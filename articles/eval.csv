1497,"“THE DISTINCTIVE function of the banker ‘begins as soon as he uses the money of others’; as long as he uses his own money he is only a capitalist,” wrote Walter Bagehot in 1873, quoting Ricardo. This distinction may seem outdated. Institutional investors (hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, private equity) all use other people’s money. Yet Ricardo’s point matters.
Modern institutions are the interface between individuals and their capital. Gains (or losses) are returned to individuals. By investing in this way, people typically deploy their own money, with the fund acting as a mere tool. Banks also use deposits, the money of others, to extend loans. But customers expect to get their deposits back in full: they do not expect to bear the bank’s loan losses in bad years, nor to reap greater rewards in good ones. It is the banks that take both losses and gains.

This process may make banks unstable, but it also gives them a big advantage in financial services, since deposit-taking and lending are complementary. Banks have as a result become providers of any and all financial services that a client needs, from a credit card to a mortgage to investment advice.Yet all these are now under threat. The clout of non-bank financial firms is growing, making the balance-sheets that banks use to support lending less valuable. And tech giants are using the competitive power of their platforms to muscle into banks’ main business. It is as if the entire industry were in a pincer grip that might one day kill it.
Consider such tech apps as Grab in Singapore or Gojek in Indonesia, which both started as ride-hailing services, or Mercado Pago, the financial arm of MercadoLibre, Latin America’s largest e-commerce site. Their model of financial services starts by being a dominant provider of a service that customers use daily. The most advanced examples are AliPay and WeChat Pay in China. Ant Group, the financial offspring of Alibaba, was born out of the fact that shoppers flocking to Alibaba lacked a safe payment method. Alipay was initially just an escrow account to transfer money to sellers after buyers had received their goods, but it was soon launched as an app for mobile use. In 2011 it introduced QR codes for payments, which are trivially easy to generate. Now a shop owner need only display the code to accept money.
This means of payment proliferated, supercharging Alipay’s growth. It has more than 1bn active users and handled $16trn in payments in 2019, nearly 25 times more than PayPal, the biggest online-payment platform outside China. A competitor arrived in 2013 with Tencent, which added a payment function to WeChat, China’s main messaging app. Together the two process some 90% of mobile transactions in China.

The first blow to banks is that both companies earn as little as 0.1% of each transaction, less than banks do from debit cards. Interchange fees around the world have tumbled because of such firms. “It was very lucrative for fintechs to come in and compete these fees away,” says Aakash Rawat of the bank UBS. “In Indonesia they have fallen from 200 basis points to just 70.” But the bigger threat is that payment platforms may become a gateway allowing tech platforms to attract more users. Using data that payment transactions provide, Ant, Grab and Tencent can determine a borrower’s creditworthiness. Ant began consumer lending only in 2014. By 2020 it had already grown to account for about a tenth of the consumer-finance market in China, though regulators are now reining it in.
Banks have traditional ways to assess borrowers’ creditworthiness, such as credit history or current wealth. Often they secure loans against collateral, like homes or cars, minimising the need to monitor an individual borrower. Bob Hope, a comedian, quipped that “a bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it.”
Yet as Agustín Carstens, boss of the Bank for International Settlements, a club of central bankers, said in March, “Data can substitute for collateral.” The information that payment platforms have on users is so plentiful and, until recent crackdowns, the restrictions so lax in China, that Markus Brunnermeier, of Princeton University, talks of “an inverse of the information asymmetry”, in which lenders know more about whether borrowers will repay than borrowers themselves. Big tech and fintech firms have lent $450 per head in China, around 2% of total credit, in five years.
As banks found decades ago, there are synergies between loans and other financial products, like asset management and insurance. Ant muscled into asset management in 2013 with the launch of Yu’e Bao, where shoppers with cash in Alipay earn a small return by parking it in a money-market fund. In 2019 Yu’e Bao briefly became the world’s biggest money-market fund by size, before the central bank put pressure on Ant to shrink it.Ant supplemented this with other investment options and also expanded into life, car and health insurance in partnership with other firms.
Tech firms are using their platforms to reverse-engineer banking.This has even caught on in America, where credit-card sweeteners keep users hooked and payments tech has lagged. Enthusiasm for payment platforms has accelerated during the covid-19 pandemic, which forced shoppers online. PayPal has almost doubled in market value over the past year to more than $310bn, making it the world’s most valuable payment platform.
Stripe, a business-payment provider, is now valued at $95bn, making it the largest private tech company in America.Stripe’s success as a business platform suggests it is not just retail banking that might be under threat, but corporate banking as well. The firm won favour with tiny businesses by making it easier to embed payments in their websites. It has expanded into payroll and cash-management services.
Knowledge can be power
Such platforms cannot do everything a bank does, because they do not have a balance-sheet to sustain lending. A bank’s advantage lies in having deposits to exploit, even if they do not know whom they should lend them to. Tech firms’ advantage is that they know whom to lend to, even if they do not have the funds. So some platforms have decided they would like a balance-sheet. Grab, which is about to go public at a valuation of some $40bn, has acquired a banking licence. If many others took this path banks might remain at the heart of the financial system, though the biggest could be Ant, Grab or Mercado Pago, not HSBC, DBS or Santander Brasil.
But most tech firms have opted against banking licences. They are instead skimming the cream off the top. “Core banking”, the heavily regulated, capital-intensive activity of banks, makes around $3trn in revenue worldwide, and generates a 5-6% return on equity (ROE). Payments and product distribution, the business of the tech firms, yields $2.5trn in sales but with a ROE of 20%.
Ant initially made loans and packaged them as securities sold to other financial institutions. But Jack Ma, its founder, fell foul of the government and regulators. So they demanded that originators of securities hold capital against them, trimming Ant’s margins. The firm’s next approach was to act as a conduit, connecting borrowers with banks, which made the loans. But regulators worried that Ant had too little skin in the game, so demanded it hold more capital. Ant must now rethink its business model.

Banks are not the only institutions that may bid for loans or securities that tech platforms want to flog. The balance of power has shifted towards non-banks. According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a group of regulators, the capitalists are often bigger players. In 2007 global assets of non-bank financial firms stood at $100trn, equivalent to 172% of gross world output and 46% of total assets. In 2019 these assets, at $200trn, constituted 228% of gross world output and half of the total. “The banking system is smaller, as a share of finance, than it was before,” notes Jamie Dimon, boss of JPMorgan Chase.
Banks still dominate the holding of credit and lending assets. Just shy of 40% of all credit assets, including securities and loans, are held by non-banks, though their share is growing fast. It rose by nearly 9% in 2019, whereas banks’ credit assets grew by just 4.6%. Yet banks remain the largest source of specific loans, holding 83% of global lending assets at the end of 2019.
The switch is most obvious in America, which has a history of capital-market growth as far back as the 1940s, when the pots of money raised by mutual-fund managers swelled. The 1980s brought a rush of debt issuance, especially of junk bonds, by companies. And there was a boom in household debt via securitisation, the bundling of loans into bonds that can be bought and sold. Yet nervousness about securitisation after the financial crash means that now, in America, just 20% of financial assets are on banks’ balance-sheets.
Other countries are following America, not least because regulators want banks to reduce their holdings of risky assets. In the euro area, the share of financial assets held by banks fell from around 60% of the total in 2007 to below 40% in 2019. Much of the world still has a long way to go. “In emerging markets, it is a different story. They are very bank-dependent with very limited capital markets. Some of their capital markets are still in their infancy,” says Carmen Reinhart, chief economist at the World Bank.
The rise of tech firms and capital markets is mostly good news. Access to banks can be costly. Some 7m households in America are unbanked, relying on cheque-cashing firms, pawn shops and payday lenders. Credit and debit cards levy fees of 1-4% on merchants, which are remitted to the rich via air miles and credit-card points. This means that the average cash-using household in effect pays $149 over a year to card users, and each card-using household receives $1,133 from cash users, partly in the form of rewards, said a paper in 2010 by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
New payment systems are also easier to use. UPI in India, which links mobile-phone numbers to biometric data and bank accounts, has helped provide cheaper access to financial services for millions of people. Between 2014 and 2018, 315m previously unbanked Indians have opened accounts, depositing more than 800bn rupees ($12bn), and received 237m debit cards.
Most non-banks do not undertake the maturity and liquidity transformation that makes banks vulnerable to runs. According to the FSB, 29% of the $200trn in assets held by non-bank financial institutions take risks typical of banks, though the share is growing. Most assets are held in investment funds that promise more liquidity. They try to match maturities: a pension fund paying retirement income in 30 years is happy to lock its money up in a private-equity fund for a decade or more.
The triumph of these competitors brings clear benefits, but also some risks. There are economies of scale for both banks and tech firms. Big banks spread the fixed costs of branches and marketing over many customers. Payment platforms spread costs over many users. The value proposition for a customer to join a bank scales with size. A bank can offer cheaper products because it has lots of customers. Yet the value proposition for a payment platform grows exponentially with the network, as each new user makes the system more valuable.
Regulators often complain about concentration in the American banking system, but there are four large banks and thousands of smaller ones. Payment platforms’ comparative advantage makes these businesses more likely to reach a winner-take-all end state (rather like Facebook).
Tech monopolies
Today’s debate over technological monopolists focuses on interoperability, particularly of user data. If online behaviour were able to uncover helpful information about whether a customer qualifies for a loan, it would be more useful if it could be accessed by all potential financial providers. The idea of sharing data in this way, called “open banking”, has already been embraced by regulators in Europe. Another concern could be that platforms might exploit their market dominance to create silos that made it easy to do things within a platform, but well-nigh impossible to use stored money elsewhere.
Regulators in China have turned sharply against its fintech giants. Ant’s troubles began last November when they kiboshed its initial public offering. The firm and its peers are now being forced to retract some credit products, to obtain new business licences and to raise more capital—in short to look and act more like a traditional bank. In Europe regulators are similarly nervous. “The authorities are facing the prospect that an increasing amount of data will be collected through payments for other use,” says Jean-Pierre Landau, a former deputy governor of the Banque de France. “Then it becomes impossible to think of the organisation of payments separately from data priorities, which in Europe are focused on protecting the privacy of individuals.”
The risks from the rise of capital markets are different. It may be that bank balance-sheets will fund a smaller share of lending in future, but as banks are the only institutions that can take deposits their role would not disappear. Yet the arrival of a wider range of participants makes life harder for regulators. In 2007-09 the Federal Reserve intervened in capital markets, but went to much greater lengths to prop up commercial and investment banks. In March 2020, banks went unscathed when capital markets seized up. Rather than acting as lender-of-last-resort only to banks, the Fed became market-maker of last resort, intervening directly in credit markets. The scale of this quantitative easing, to the tune of $23.5 trn, surpasses any other in the Fed’s history. Such efforts to stabilise financial markets make it harder for the Fed to avoid picking winners and influencing credit. As the world changes, regulators’ toolkit will have to adapt.■",2
1498,"A T 4PM EVERY Sunday in Barra de Pojuca, a poor town in Bahia, the streets suddenly empty. You may think people are taking a siesta, until you spot the crowded churches. “For every sister in church there’s a brother in the bar,” jokes Cremilda, a member of the Assemblies of God, as she climbs to the cinderblock chapel. But in the 20 years since she helped build the church, more men are choosing Bibles over beers.
In 1970 only 5% of Brazilians were evangelical. Now a third are. The movement owes its growth to rapid urbanisation. Pastors arrived with little more than a Bible and preached in words people understood. Pentecostalism offered lively worship and solutions to earthly problems like poverty, alcohol abuse or domestic violence. A study of Brazilian men in 2014 found that Protestant faith was linked to a rise in earnings, especially among less educated black men. “Becoming evangelical isn’t only a bet on the supernatural, but a choice” for a better life, writes Juliano Spyer, an anthropologist, in a new book.

The largest subset of evangelicals are poor black women, a group Mr Bolsonaro has derided. Yet two-thirds of evangelicals voted for him, many on advice from their pastors. Evangelical churches once shied away from politics. Their representatives at Brazil’s constitutional convention in 1988 urged Catholics to keep the state secular. But they realised politics could promote goals such as opposing gay rights and abortion, or remaining tax-exempt. Politics also became a way to deal with religious competition, says Amy Erica Smith, a political scientist at Iowa State University. The evangelical lobby in Congress includes 195 of 513 federal deputies.
Among Brazil’s 40-odd denominations, the most partisan is the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God ( UCKG), which has 2m members and 8,000 churches. It was founded in 1977 by Edir Macedo, an ex-lottery official who owns a TV network. He once backed the PT but in 2018 declared for Mr Bolsonaro (who is Catholic but was rebaptised in the Jordan river by a Pentecostal pastor). Members were bombarded with anti- PT propaganda. Some wavered, says Jacqueline Teixeira, an anthropologist at the University of São Paulo. But after Mr Haddad called Mr Macedo a “fundamentalist charlatan”, they felt that if they did not vote for Mr Bolsonaro, “they’d be denying their religious identity,” she says.
Evangelical support for Mr Bolsonaro reflects dissatisfaction with the PT’s progressive policies and its role in Lava Jato. “When the church enters politics, it brings morals,” says Antônio Falcão, a Baptist former city councillor from Barra de Pojuca. Mr Bolsonaro has not legalised state religious education or outlawed gay marriage, but he has increased punishment for people convicted of domestic violence and slashed public funding for Brazilian cinema, calling it “pornographic”.
In April his nominee to the supreme court decreed that churches could open on Easter Sunday, despite covid-19. Some 500 people crowded into a UCKG temple in Porto Velho. The pastor chided the congregation for skipping services. “You have faith in doctors, you have faith in vaccines but you don’t have faith in God?” he cried. Church workers promptly appeared with velvet bags; the UCKG instructs its members to donate 10% of their income to the church. “All that matters is that you are good with God,” said the pastor.
Only 35% of evangelicals disapprove of Mr Bolsonaro, against 44% of all Brazilians. Still, some may break with him in 2022. Marina Silva, an evangelical former senator, says that politicians should be judged for their credentials, not their creed. Assemblies of God is less hierarchical than the UCKG. It has megachurches with bolsonarista pastors but most of its 12m members belong to hole-in-the-wall congregations like Cremilda’s. Pastor Josemar says he is sick of “representatives who don’t represent us”.
In 2018 evangelicals were “like chicken with our heads cut off”, one of Cremilda’s friends comments. Now she thinks that the president is “not a man of God”. But Cremilda is undecided. She is waiting to see whether other candidates share her Christian values. “Bolsonaro has lost his way,” she says, but she believes in the power of redemption.

1499,"HIS SWIMMING-POOL-turned-prison was known as La Piscine. There, Hissène Habré’s torturers would bind victims’ feet and hands and force them to swallow large volumes of water. Then they would hoist them up and drop them, sending water shooting out of their mouths and noses. They had other methods, too, such as stuffing the exhaust pipe of a running vehicle into a prisoner’s mouth. Across the road from La Piscine were offices used by the American government, which backed Mr Habré’s brutal regime.
The despot who ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990 died on August 24th after contracting covid-19. He was 79, and serving a life sentence in Senegal for crimes against humanity.

The son of a shepherd, Mr Habré showed early promise. He won a scholarship to study in France, where he earned a university degree. But on returning to Chad he joined a rebel group. In 1974 he and his men took three Europeans hostage, then killed a French officer sent to negotiate their release. Later that decade, under a power-sharing deal, he was given the posts of prime minister and vice-president. When the deal broke down, Mr Habré fled to Sudan. Several hundred skeletons were found near the house he left behind in Chad.
He made a comeback in 1982, seizing power with the support of America, which saw him as a bulwark against communism and, in particular, Libya. America helped train Mr Habré’s secret police and sent him copious arms. President Ronald Reagan even invited him to the White House (pictured). France also helped out, sending troops. Meanwhile, Chadian soldiers massacred civilians. In all Mr Habré is thought to have ordered the killing of some 40,000 people.
Rebels led by Idriss Déby overthrew Mr Habré in 1990. For years the exiled leader lived a quiet, luxurious life in a coastal suburb of Dakar, the capital of Senegal. His victims, though, were rounding up evidence. “From the depths of that madness, I swore to fight for justice if I ever got out alive,” said Souleymane Guengueng, a former detainee.
Finally, in 2015, Mr Habré was called before a special court in Senegal where 90 witnesses testified against him. Ten months later the judge found him guilty of crimes such as summary execution, torture and rape. A soft ululation from the widows of victims rang out in the courtroom, then cheering and weeping. It was a rare instance of a court in one country successfully prosecuting the former leader of another for crimes against humanity.
America and France backed the Senegalese court, but in Chad their strategy did not change. Both threw their support behind Déby, who ruled with an iron fist for 30 years. After he was killed by rebels earlier this year, France endorsed his son, Mahamat, who took over in a coup. Stability was the priority, even if it left Chad in the same sorry state.",2
1500,"Washington (CNN)When it came to light in January 2017, just days before Donald Trump took office, the so-called Steele dossier landed like a bombshell and sent shockwaves around the world with its salacious allegations about Trump and his supposed ties to Russia.The central allegations, that Trump conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election and that Russia had compromising information on him, were given a veneer of credibility because they originated from a retired British spy, Christopher Steele, who had a solid reputation.But five years later, the credibility of the dossier has significantly diminished.A series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of its central allegations and exposed the unreliability of Steele's sources. They also raise serious questions about the political underpinnings of some key explosive claims about Trump by shedding new light on the involvement of some well-connected Democrats in the dossier, and separate efforts to prod the FBI to investigate ties between Trump's campaign and Russia.These revelations have triggered a reckoning around the Steele dossier, particularly in the wake of two recent indictments secured by John Durham, the special counsel appointed during the Trump administration to investigate the FBI's Russia probe. Durham alleges that Steele's primary source, a US-based foreign policy analyst, repeatedly lied to the FBI about where he got his information.To be clear, multiple US government inquiries uncovered dozens of contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russians, which have since been acknowledged. The candidate himself and his closest advisers even welcomed the Kremlin's interference in the election. Still, none of it added up to the collusion suggested in Steele's memos.Legitimate questions are now being raised about the dossier -- how it was used by Democrats as a political weapon against Trump, how it was handled by the FBI and US intelligence agencies, and how it was portrayed in the mainstream media.Democrats' hidden hand revealed  Trump swiftly rejected Steele's claims and said a ""group of opponents ... put that crap together."" Nearly five years later, it's clearer than ever that he wasn't too far off about the origins of the dossier.Two special counsel investigations, multiple congressional inquiries, civil lawsuits in the US and the United Kingdom, and an internal Justice Department review have now fully unspooled the behind-the-scenes role that some Democrats played in this saga. They paid for the research, funneled information to Steele's sources, and then urged the FBI to investigate Trump's connections to Russia.Mother Jones first revealed the existence of the dossier a few days before the 2016 election, and said the memos were part of an ""opposition research project"" underwritten by Democrats. Nearly a year passed before the full truth came out about the financing: The money flowed from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign to law firm Perkins Coie, to the research company Fusion GPS, and then ultimately to Steele, who got $168,000.(Anti-Trump Republicans initially funded Fusion GPS' research during the 2016 GOP primaries, but the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee picked up the tab before Steele got involved.)But Democratic involvement in Steele's work was much deeper than previously known. Court filings from the Durham inquiry recently revealed that some information in the dossier originated from Charles Dolan, 71, a public relations executive with expertise in Russian affairs who had a decades-long political relationship with the Clinton family. He has not been accused of any crimes.Federal prosecutors said Dolan was in regular contact in 2016 with Steele's primary source Igor Danchenko, 49, a Russian citizen and foreign policy analyst who lives in Virginia. Danchenko was indicted on November 4 for allegedly lying to the FBI about his dealings with Dolan and a fellow Soviet-born expat that he claimed was one of his sources.Danchenko pleaded not guilty last week. In a statement to CNN, his defense attorney Mark Schamel said Durham is pushing a ""false narrative designed to humiliate and slander a renowned expert in business intelligence for political gain."" Schamel also accused Durham of including legally unnecessary information in the 39-page indictment to smear Danchenko.""For the past five years, those with an agenda have sought to expose Mr. Danchenko's identity and tarnish his reputation while undermining U.S. National Security,"" Schamel said. ""...This latest injustice will not stand. We will expose how Mr. Danchenko has been unfairly maligned by these false allegations.""The indictment indirectly connected Dolan to the infamous claim that Russia possessed a compromising tape of Trump with prostitutes in Moscow, which became known as the ""pee tape."" (Trump and Russia both denied the allegations.) According to the Danchenko indictment, in June 2016, Dolan toured the Ritz-Carlton suite where the alleged liaison occurred, and discussed Trump's 2013 visit with hotel staff, but wasn't told about any sexual escapades. It's still unclear where those salacious details that ended up in the dossier came from.Dolan was also indirectly linked in the indictment to still-unverified claims about Russian officials who were allegedly part of the election meddling. The indictment also suggested that Steele's memos exaggerated what Dolan had passed along to Danchenko.The indictment also says the dossier contained a relatively mundane item about Trump campaign infighting that Dolan later told the FBI he actually gleaned from news articles. Prosecutors say Dolan even lied to Danchenko about where he got the gossip, by attributing it to a ""GOP friend"" who was ""a close associate of Trump.""An attorney representing Dolan, Ralph Martin, declined to comment for this story because his client ""is a witness in an ongoing case.""Durham explicitly stated in the Danchenko indictment that the Clinton campaign didn't direct, and wasn't aware of, Dolan's activities regarding the dossier. Clinton has said she only learned about the dossier when it was posted online, two months after the 2016 election. Senior Clinton campaign aides also said they found out about Steele's work from press reports.Clinton's allies prod the FBI  The Danchenko indictment raises new concerns about the circular nature of portions of Steele's work, and how it fit into a larger effort by Democrats to dirty up Trump. Clinton's campaign funded the project, and we now know that much of the material in Steele's memos ended up being mere political gossip. Steele then sent his explosive but unverified findings to the FBI and State Department.While Steele was passing his tips onto the FBI in fall 2016, a Clinton campaign lawyer separately met with a senior FBI official and gave him information about strange cyberactivity between servers at the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia.The lawyer, Michael Sussmann, has since been charged with lying to the FBI during that meeting, for allegedly saying he wasn't providing the dirt on behalf of any client, even though he ultimately billed that time to the Clinton campaign, and also billed them for other work he did on the server issue. Durham says Sussmann repeated this lie during a meeting with CIA officials in February 2017, where he told them about the server theory. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.The indictment says Sussman peddled the same material to a Slate reporter, who published a story right before the election. The story said reputable computer scientists uncovered unusual activity between servers belonging to the Trump Organization and the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, suggesting a secret backchannel.The Trump Organization and Alfa Bank both denied there was a backchannel. The FBI investigated the underlying data and ruled out any improper cyber links by February 2017.But after the Slate article came out, Clinton's campaign went on a PR blitz, tying Trump to Russia. Clinton had already slammed Trump for months, for embracing Russia's interference in the election, which included releasing hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee.Sussmann was a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie, which indirectly hired Steele. Both men separately went to the FBI in 2016 with dirt about Trump, though there's no indication Sussmann knew about the dossier. (A 2019 Justice Department watchdog report pointed out that the FBI routinely accepts information from biased or dubious sources, and then investigators try to independently vet the material.)After he was charged, Sussmann resigned from Perkins Coie. He declined to comment for this story.Rumors, hearsay and fabrications   When the dossier burst into public view, much of the conversation revolved around Steele's résumé: He worked undercover in Moscow, ran the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters, and maintained a network of sources in the country. This lent credibility to his findings, even though nobody, including CNN, was able to confirm the explosive allegations of collusion or the salacious ""pee tape"" claims.In January 2017, CNN broke the story that senior US intelligence officials had briefed Trump and then-President Barack Obama about the dossier. CNN never published the dossier itself, but hours later, BuzzFeed posted the full 35 pages of Steele's memos online for all to see. CNN said the author was ""a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.""That was true. The FBI formalized Steele's role as a confidential informant in 2013. He aided the FBI's groundbreaking corruption case against dozens of FIFA soccer officials in 2015, and he also provided the FBI with reliable information about Russian oligarchs.But the once well-connected British spy had been out of the intelligence services for a while.For starters, we now know that Steele's primary source, Danchenko, wasn't some deep-cover Kremlin insider. He was a DC-based think tank analyst with a Rolodex of Russians.The FBI tracked down Danchenko and interviewed him a few times in 2017 while they scrambled to verify the dossier. Danchenko said the information he gave to Steele was mostly ""hearsay,"" ""just talk,"" ""word of mouth,"" and came from ""conversations he had with friends over beers."" Danchenko also said Steele puffed up the memos and leaned too hard into the raw information he received, according to a bombshell 2019 report from Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz about the Russia probe.Some of Steele's sourcing disintegrates  The Danchenko indictment alleges that he lied to the FBI, and possibly Steele too, about another detail that became central to the dossier: where he heard there was a ""well-developed conspiracy of cooperation"" between Trump and the Kremlin.In interviews with the FBI, Danchenko attributed the information to Sergei Millian, a Belarusian-American businessman who did some real estate work with the Trump Organization. The indictment also says Danchenko sourced the ""pee tape"" story, in part, to Millian. But Millian wasn't the source, Durham says, contradicting press reports from 2017. (Some outlets recently corrected or clarified those reports.)Millian has since said he was ""framed"" by Danchenko and has publicly denied that they ever spoke, though there is no indication in the indictment that Millian ever denied it to the FBI or under oath.""This fraud destroyed my health, life, businesses and turned my American dream into (a) nightmare,"" Millian told CNN in a statement, declining further comment.A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released last year said Millian's behavior during the 2016 election ""resembles activities by a Russian intelligence officer or cooptee."" He has vehemently denied working for the Russian government.Another Russian who Danchenko told the FBI was one of his sources said in a sworn affidavit in a civil case that she wasn't the source for at least one claim that was attributed to her. The woman, publicist Olga Galkina, said she believes Danchenko told the FBI she was his source ""to create more authoritativeness for his work,"" according to court filings.The indictment against Danchenko quotes emails where Galkina told Dolan she is a ""big Hillary fan,"" and hoped to land a job at the State Department after Clinton became president.Taken together, these revelations about Dolan, Millian and Galkina raise grave questions about where Danchenko got his information, or if he perhaps made some of it up.Attorneys for Danchenko didn't respond to CNN's request for an interview.The Durham investigation is ongoing. He continues to use a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, signaling that he might be interested in bringing charges against additional defendants.'Underpinned by poor judgment'   It took five years of criminal investigations, civil cases and congressional reports to pull back the curtain on the flimsiness of the dossier. The big picture really came into focus in 2019 with the release of a Justice Department watchdog report.That report described for the first time Danchenko's many walk-backs in his FBI interviews. It also said FBI agents gave Steele mixed reviews, with some seeing him as a ""person of integrity,"" while others said he had a ""lack of self-awareness"" and was ""underpinned by poor judgment,"" even if he was acting in good faith.The report also said the CIA viewed Steele's material as an ""Internet rumor.""Last year's bipartisan Senate report said ""the tradecraft reflected in the dossier is generally poor relative to (US intelligence community) standards."" The blockbuster 966-page report also raised concerns that some of the material Steele put in his memos was Russian disinformation.These revelations undermined Steele's credibility -- and led to renewed scrutiny and right-wing criticism of how many news outlets, including CNN, covered the dossier story.Efforts to corroborate fall flat   Everyone but Steele talked about his work for nearly five years, but he finally broke his silence in an ABC News interview last month, shortly before Danchenko was arrested. (Steele and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence, declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview.)Steele defended his work and said he was right about three big takeaways from his memos: Russian spy agencies interfered in the 2016 election; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the operation; and the goal was to help Trump and hurt Clinton.He pointed to the US intelligence community's landmark 2017 report that said Russia meddled in the election at Putin's orders to help Trump. US intelligence agencies had examined the dossier but didn't rely on his findings for their report.But Steele's findings on Russian election-meddling, which were ahead of the curve at the time, now seem more like prescient geopolitical observations rather than insider information. Plus, his final and most consequential takeaway -- that Trump's campaign worked hand-in-hand with the Kremlin -- was essentially debunked by special counsel Robert Mueller's sweeping investigation.CNN reported in February 2017 that US investigators had corroborated some of the communications detailed in the dossier, citing multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials.The CNN report said US investigators were able to confirm the time, place and people involved in some of the conversations between foreign nationals mentioned by Steele. The story said CNN couldn't confirm if those conversations were about Trump, and the sources told CNN that the corroborated information had nothing to do with the salacious claims in the dossier.The sources also told CNN that the corroboration gave investigators ""greater confidence"" in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier, which the FBI was still actively investigating at the time.Two years later, the Justice Department watchdog said only limited information was corroborated from the dossier relating to ""time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available.""Horowitz's watchdog report, released in December 2019, also said much of the material in the dossier about Trump and his campaign ""could not be corroborated"" and that ""certain allegations were inaccurate or inconsistent"" with subsequent FBI findings.But Horowitz said the FBI determined that Steele's big-picture conclusions about Russian meddling were ""consistent with known efforts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections.""What's right? What's wrong?   Looking at the big picture, Steele was right that Russia used ""trusted agents of influence"" to target Trump's inner circle. And he was correct to suspect there were secret contacts between Trump aides and Russian officials, even though Trump denied any Russian ties. But Steele was wrong about so many of the key details.Despite a worldwide hunt for the Trump ""kompromat,"" no tapes ever emerged, and the Danchenko indictment puts the source of that underlying claim into doubt.There is no proof of something in the dossier that would've been a smoking gun for collusion -- that Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen went to Prague in 2016 to coordinate with Russian officials about their anti-Clinton hacking efforts. The watchdog report said the FBI concluded that these claims ""were not true."" Even after Cohen turned on Trump and started helping Mueller, and implicated his former boss in an illegal campaign finance scheme, Cohen always denied the Prague allegations.The dossier said Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and foreign policy adviser Carter Page led the collusion efforts. But this was never verified by any government investigations. Mueller found that both men had extensive contacts with Russian agents, but he couldn't verify that Page met with the specific Kremlin officials as alleged in the dossier.The Mueller report said there wasn't evidence of a criminal conspiracy to collude.Five years on, Steele continues to defend his work. He told ABC News that ""the evidence suggests"" there was collusion, that he believes Cohen traveled to Prague after all, and that the compromising tape of Trump with Russian prostitutes ""probably"" exists.""I stand by the work we did, the sources that we had, and the professionalism which we applied to it,"" Steele said in the interview with ABC News.Origins of the Russia probe  Democratic officials, the media and Internet conspiracy theorists initially hyped Steele's work. But as his credibility waned, Trump started exaggerating Steele's influence, and pushed the lie that the dossier triggered ""the entire Russia probe.""In truth, the dossier played a remarkably limited role in the Russia investigation.Four US government reports concluded that the probe began in July 2016, two months before the FBI team handling the inquiry even learned about the dossier.(After a lengthy review, Horowitz said there was a legal basis to open the Russia probe, and that the process was free of political bias. However, Durham publicly rebuked Horowitz and said he disagreed with some of Horowitz's conclusions, leading to criticism that his own work is politically motivated.)Mueller's team interviewed Steele, but largely ignored the dossier as they found dozens of links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller's report didn't say all that much about the dossier, and he didn't attribute any findings to Steele.And there's no indication that the dossier influenced Mueller's successful criminal prosecutions against six Trump campaign associates: Manafort, Cohen, Roger Stone, Rick Gates, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos.But the dossier did play a major role in the investigation into Page, the lower-level Trump foreign policy adviser, and helped the FBI secure a warrant to wiretap him after he left the campaign in September 2016.Tainted FBI wiretaps  The fallout from the dossier was largely contained to the Page surveillance. But when internal investigators looked under the hood, they found catastrophic issues.Before the dossier, investigators already considered applying for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to wiretap Page's communications, but they weren't sure if they could establish probable cause. The dossier's explosive claims about Page's alleged meetings during his recent trip to Moscow ""pushed it over"" the line, a lawyer involved in the case told the Justice Department watchdog.The FBI included snippets of Steele's reporting in the FISA application, along with other information, like details of Page's previous interactions with Russian spies, and the fact that he suggested to an FBI informant that he had an ""open checkbook"" from the Kremlin. The secretive FISA court approved the warrant in October 2016, as well as three subsequent renewal requests, meaning Page was wiretapped for about one year.In April 2017, CNN was first to report that the FBI included some material from the dossier in the FISA applications. The article said prosecutors would only have done this ""after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation,"" according to officials familiar with the process.It's now clear that this level of verification never materialized. The watchdog report said Steele's claims about Page ""remained uncorroborated"" when the wiretaps ended in 2017.Page was never charged with any crimes, and Mueller said his investigation ""did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government"" to meddle in the election, which was a far cry from the FBI's initial assertions in FISA applications that Page ""is an agent of a foreign power"" who was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian Government.""The inspector general examined the FBI's handling of the FISA applications and found that there were widespread mistakes, omissions and errors that deeply undermined the integrity of the process. In response, the Justice Department declared that the final two FISA warrants against Page were legally invalid.But even Durham, who has been accused of cherry-picking an unfair narrative to undermine the Russia probe, hasn't said in his recent indictments, spanning 66 pages, that the FBI or Mueller ever relied on Steele for anything beyond the Page surveillance.Partial vindication for Trump    Critics of the Russia probe -- conservative pundits, Republican lawmakers and Trump himself -- took a victory lap after the inspector general blasted the Page FISA applications.That's because the inspector general's report confirmed what many of them had argued all along, including in a highly disputed memo from GOP Rep. Devin Nunes: That there were systemic problems with the FBI surveillance of someone tied to the Trump, and the Steele dossier was improperly used to influence part of the Russia probe.But the report refuted the more outlandish conspiracy theories that Trump, Nunes and other Republicans pushed about the Russia probe. The report said the FISA process, while flawed, wasn't intentionally abused and wasn't politically biased. And the report debunked Trump's lie that the FBI planted spies in his campaign.The latest Durham indictments also injected new life into Russia probe skeptics.After wall-to-wall coverage of the Steele dossier, public opinion was quickly locked in on the question of collusion. Many Democrats clung to hope that the dossier was true. Most Republicans denounced it as a deep state hoax. Post-Mueller polling found that about half of Americans believed Trump was guilty of collusion.Mueller and a bipartisan Senate inquiry concluded that Trump's team welcomed Russian help, and tried to coordinate on a few fronts, but it didn't come to fruition.But so much suspicion was fueled by Trump's massive cover-up about Russia.Trump and his team systematically lied about almost every aspect of the Russia probe. (At the start, they falsely denied any contacts with Russians.) After so many of their denials were disproved, they repeatedly shifted their story. Trump repeatedly undermined and obstructed Mueller's investigation.All the while, Trump heaped praise on Putin. He infamously took Putin's side at the 2018 Helsinki summit by agreeing with Putin's lie that Russia didn't try to help Trump win in 2016, leading many to wonder if Trump was compromised after all.",0
1501,"“I HOPE YOU never have to see it like this again,” says Markus Quint, communications chief for Frankfurt’s Messe (exhibition centre), as he surveys 440,000 square metres of empty halls from a 22nd-floor terrace. When the pandemic struck last spring the Messe, which had welcomed nearly 2.5m visitors in 2019, had to shut for all business bar the digital sort. Worldwide revenues (the Messe has 29 subsidiaries) plunged from €736m ($870m) to €257m. Most of the 1,000-odd Frankfurt staff went on Kurzarbeitergeld, Germany’s much-imitated furlough scheme.
As Germans prepare to go to the polls on September 26th, recovery is glinting. Mr Quint says he could have “cried with joy” in July when the Messe reopened for its first physical exhibition, a trade fair for bike-part manufacturers. Bigger shows are in the works, including a return of the famous Frankfurt Book Fair next month.

Yet the threat from covid-19 has not evaporated. In the Messe’s case, border restrictions and quarantine rules make it near-impossible for what was once a large contingent of Asian and American visitors to attend the shows. Other businesses fear the return of some contact restrictions amid a fourth wave of infections and Germany’s worryingly low vaccination rate.
Hiccups in supply chains present a more serious drag on Germany’s recovery, says Clemens Fuest of the Ifo Institute in Munich. The global semiconductor shortage is crippling Germany’s mighty carmakers. Fully 70% of all German manufacturers say they are running low on everything from aluminium to paper. Highly globalised Germany—its total trade was equivalent to 88% of GDP in 2019—is particularly exposed. Having previously forecast that the economy would reach its pre-crisis level at the end of 2021, Ifo has grown more pessimistic.

No wonder German firms are watching the election campaign with keen interest—and in some cases grave concern. Jürgen Vormann, CEO of Infraserv Höchst, a chemicals-service provider based in Frankfurt, says he fears that the next government will be zealous about climate change and so wrap business in red tape. Germany’s electricity prices, Europe’s highest, are a huge burden on industry. Some of Germany’s influential family businesses fear tax raids. “You need not be a pessimist to anticipate that we’re going in the wrong direction,” says Mr Vormann.
In consensus-oriented Germany, none of the likely coalition configurations will bring economic rupture. But differences between the party platforms will make for tricky post-election negotiations, especially as polls suggest that only ideologically muddled three-way coalitions will be viable. The pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the conservative Christian Democratic bloc (CDU/CSU), for example, vow not to increase the tax burden, whereas the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens want a wealth tax and higher income taxes on the rich. All parties agree on the need to speed up climate protection, but differ strongly on the balance between market mechanisms and regulation.

This problem will interact with a more familiar one: the parties’ sums do not add up. The German Economic Institute (IW) reckons that by 2025 growing demands on the state-pension system, extra defence spending and a few other fresh expenses could reach a cumulative €263bn. But of the main parties, only the Greens have made pledges that they say will be revenue-neutral. The FDP’s tax cuts could add €75bn, roughly 2% of GDP, to the deficit. No party’s manifesto will survive coalition talks. But Germany’s constitutional brake on public debt, which took effect in 2016, limits annual deficits to 0.35% of GDP. All main parties bar the Greens say they wish to abide by it, yet growth alone will not generate enough cash to do so.
Parties always make dodgy claims on taxation and spending, says Thomas Obst of the IW. He is more alarmed by their failure to confront Germany’s demographic challenges. As the baby-boomers retire en masse throughout the 2020s, subsidies to the pension system, which already gobbles up 30% of the federal budget, will rocket in the absence of reform. At a televised debate on September 12th only Armin Laschet, the CDU/CSU candidate, acknowledged the urgency of the problem. Olaf Scholz, the SPD frontrunner, brushed it aside, placing his faith in expanding the labour force.
Another test will be to meet the investment demands presented by Germany’s climate targets, including extending power grids and insulating buildings. The private sector can take up much of the slack; revamping Germany’s planning rules and municipal working practices will help. But some estimates put the demand on the federal budget at close to €50bn a year.
If that also seems incompatible with the constraints of the debt brake, there may be room for a political fix. True, the tweak to the brake sought by the Greens is a non-starter, as it needs a two-thirds majority in each of the two parliamentary chambers. And months before the European Commission is due to begin a review of the EU’s fiscal rules, the CDU/CSU fears that assenting to German profligacy now could encourager les autres (see Charlemagne).
But most parties would probably stomach what Mr Obst calls the “second-best solution” of establishing off-budget investment funds that could circumvent the debt brake. And there are signs of a subtle shift. Some CDU/CSU figures have upset colleagues by questioning the rigidity of the debt brake in an era of cheap money and pressing investment needs. And while the FDP remains committed to it, Christian Lindner, the party’s leader, has lately emphasised that he is not ideologically wedded to a balanced budget—a move interpreted as an overture to the SPD, currently leading the polls, and the Greens. The trio could assemble a left-leaning “traffic-light” coalition—the most plausible outcome if current polling is borne out on election day.
That illustrates a broader shift in Germany’s economic debate. “Everyone knows that we have to transform Germany…and for digitalisation and decarbonisation, it’s all about investment,” says Otto Fricke, an FDP budget expert. The divisions between parties on budgetary planning, monetary policy and European spending seem less rigid than in the past. The public debate is more tolerant of what used to be outlandish views. As ever, the theatrics of the campaign before the election will not preclude the compromises that will, eventually, be made after it. ■

1502,"“HOW DOES a nation survive being swallowed by the sea?” So went the tagline for “Anote’s Ark”, a documentary film following Anote Tong, then president of Kiribati, as he toured the world warning that his islands were drowning. In 2014, he bought 20 square kilometres of land in Fiji, for Kiribati’s 120,000-odd people to move to as a “last resort”.
“Anote’s Ark” came out in 2018, two years after Mr Tong retired. The government that succeeded his was unimpressed. “It’s a drama, like a Star Wars film,” says Teburoro Tito, Kiribati’s ambassador to the UN. “The story is very convincing, but I must say, it’s not true.” The land in Fiji is being turned into a commercial farm.

Mr Tito has a point. In research published in 2010, Paul Kench, now at the Simon Fraser University in Canada, measured the size of 27 atolls over a period of decades and found that while 14% had shrunk and a couple had disappeared, 43% stayed the same size and another 43% became bigger. Many of the ring-shaped coral reefs have been able to adapt to sea-level rise, changing shape as sediment is eroded and pushed around. Tuvalu’s land surface, for instance, increased by 3% between 1971 and 2014 despite a rise in the local sea level of 4mm a year, twice the global average for that period. Mr Kench describes Mr Tong’s tale of sinking islands as “largely an emotional narrative”.
Such narratives have their uses. Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, low-lying archipelagoes deep in the South Pacific (see map), are among the first countries to face the full onslaught of climate change. Stories like Mr Tong’s help capture international attention and much-needed funding—seven of the world’s 15 most aid-dependent countries are islands in the Pacific. But there are other, more immediate effects of climate change that threaten the lives and livelihoods of the citizens of these countries. They are less arresting, harder to explain and, as in the changing shape and size of islands, sometimes counterintuitive. But the upshot is the same: the countries may soon become uninhabitable.

Start with the phenomenon of shape-shifting islands. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a consensus-building body on climate science, warns that the natural adaptation of coastal ecosystems may be only temporary: faster rates of sea-level rise, stronger waves and a growing human population may reduce their capacity to adapt.
That is one risk. Another, more urgent one stems from even small rises in the sea level. These can cause exceptionally high tides to briefly but entirely inundate the narrow strips of low-lying land that comprise most atolls. Such “king tides”, as they are known, are becoming more frequent. The saltwater can kill crops such as banana and papaya and seeps into groundwater, making it unfit to drink. Desalination plants are pricey and, like all machines, can fail. “The islands are not drowning,” says Michael Walsh, a former economic adviser to Kiribati. “But, humans and plants alike, they may well die of thirst.”
Changing weather patterns are another factor that could make low-lying islands uninhabitable long before most of them disappear. Last year, Cyclone Harold damaged 21,000 houses in Vanuatu. Cyclone Pam in 2015 was one of the strongest ever to hit the South Pacific. Cyclones and tsunamis in the region are predicted to become ever more intense.
Many islanders have picked up and moved. Some 30,000 Marshallese, or more than a third of the country’s people, have migrated to America, many in the past two decades. Yet few cite climate change as the reason for their move. The Marshall Islands Climate and Migration Project, a research outfit, notes that the main reasons given are “education, health care, work, and family connections”.
Already poor and dependant on aid, Pacific island countries have been particularly hard hit by covid-19. Travel restrictions have decimated the tourism industry and curbed seasonal migration to Australia and New Zealand.
Pacific leaders have ideas to revive their economies. Tuvalu makes lots of money from licensing its .tv internet domain (along with Vanuatu, it also sells passports to rich people). It now wants to set up an internet banking system and offer more services online. There are also ways to keep islands habitable: Kiribati plans to dredge its lagoons and use the sand to raise the surrounding islands higher above the sea. Tuvalu has embarked on a land-reclamation project. But the spectre of climate change makes it harder to drum up investment for such schemes. “I am trying to change the minds of the many people who say, ‘We cannot invest in your country, you’re finished’,” says Kiribati’s Mr Tito.
The depressing long-term solution, as in Mr Tong’s last resort, may be to move. The Marshall Islands hopes to renegotiate its post-colonial “Compact of Free Association” with America, which expires in 2023, to ensure a permanent right of residence in the United States for all Marshallese. Tuvalu has no such option. Maina Talia, a climate activist, thinks that the government should take Fiji up on its offer of a home where Tuvaluans could practise the same culture rather than “be dumped somewhere in Sydney’‘.
Earlier this year, the government of Tuvalu, which until recently insisted that there would be no Plan B, established a new UN initiative. Its aim is to work with “like-minded countries” to figure out how and where such countries could be relocated, how they could continue to function ex-situ, and whether they could still lay claim to vast exclusive economic zones if their land disappeared under water.
Relocating a country would raise other big questions, too, for both the international system and the way in which people think about statehood. “How to prepare to move a nation in dignity, that has never been done before,” says Kamal Amakrane, a migration expert whose ideas helped spark the UN initiative. He is confident that countries would be able to retain all the elements of statehood, but says that the world needs to start planning now. “This is happening,” Mr Amakrane warns. “We have 10-15 years to prepare for it.” ■

1503,"EACH YEAR the United Nations puts out a carefully crafted state-of-the-world assessment from a humanitarian perspective. It considers how much help is needed to stave off disaster in the most vulnerable countries. According to its latest “Global Humanitarian Overview”, released on December 1st, the state of the world is stark.
A year ago the UN projected that 168m people would need assistance in 2020. For 2021 the number is 40% higher: a record 235m. That is almost as many people as there are in Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most-populous country. The UN says it will need $35bn to support the neediest 160m of these—about four in five of them in Africa and the Middle East—across 56 countries. Extreme poverty has risen for the first time in 22 years. Women and young people are the hardest-hit.

The main cause of the increase is covid-19—not the health effects of the virus itself but its toll on economies, with recession, food-price rises and a decline in remittances from abroad adding to the millions of people who are so poor they will not survive without help. The UN fears a near doubling of the number of people at risk of starvation. “Famine is back,” says Mark Lowcock, the UN’s humanitarian chief. Famines had seemed largely a thing of the past: the only significant one this century was in 2011-12 in Somalia, where about a quarter of  a million people died. Now Yemen, north-east Nigeria, Burkina Faso, South Sudan and half a dozen other countries are vulnerable. “If we get through 2021 without major famines, that will actually be quite a result,” believes Mr Lowcock.
The pandemic is also having a knock-on effect on health beyond the virus’s immediate toll. In vulnerable places it is causing a contraction in life-saving services such as immunisation, malaria prevention and neonatal care. The result, predicts Mr Lowcock, will be a reduction in life-expectancy—not as visible or concentrated as famine, but another unhappy reversal after decades of progress.
Vaccines offer hope in the fight against covid-19, yet rich countries are bound to roll them out fastest, paying too little heed to the amounts and most appropriate types available for the poorest places. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines need to be stored at very low temperatures. “Frankly, we don’t think anywhere where we work is going to be able to very quickly put in place cold-chain requirements,” says Mr Lowcock. He also cautions against a rush to channel efforts into covid at the expense of routine immunisation (against measles, say) with a higher life-saving impact in many poor and crisis-hit places.
The pandemic may be the biggest reason for the rise in humanitarian stress, but two longer-term factors are also pushing it up. One is global warming. Many of the countries most at risk from the effects of climate change already have big humanitarian problems (with extra risks in the coming months from the La Niña weather system). The other is conflict, which is spreading trouble in a growing number of places, including Western Sahara and the Sahel, Ethiopia and northern Mozambique as well as Nagorno-Karabakh. Syria, which looms large in the UN’s humanitarian efforts, has seen no peace: the UN expects an extra 1.9m people will need humanitarian assistance there. Overall, the number of people displaced within countries because of conflict and violence has reached a new high of 51m, and over the past decade the number of refugees crossing borders has doubled to 20m.
Will a cash-strapped world be willing to provide anything like the $35bn the UN says it needs for the coming year? The amount of humanitarian aid co-ordinated through the UN (about 70% of the global total) has been rising. The bad news is that the needs have been rising faster, so the funding gap has been growing, to $22bn (see chart).

America’s spending has been robust, and Germany’s has been increasing. But the Gulf countries have grown less generous, and last week Britain announced that it was slashing £4bn ($5.3bn) of its foreign aid, suspending its commitment to devote 0.7% of GDP to international development (it will now drop to 0.5%, though humanitarian spending within the total may be protected as far as possible). “A small budgetary saving for the UK will have large impacts for the world’s most vulnerable people,” laments Mr Lowcock, himself a former head of Britain’s Department for International Development.
If, as seems likely, the UN ends up far short of its $35bn target, it will have to channel the money it has towards alleviating the worst of the distress. The focus on emergency relief leaves little room for more lasting support. The result is more places on the verge of famine for longer: that is, a rising humanitarian caseload.
A few bits of brightness can be discerned. First, experiments in “anticipatory action”, where the UN acts early when key indicators suggest releasing funds can help prevent a deeper disaster, have shown encouraging results. This approach has been tried this year to pre-empt the impact of floods in Bangladesh and hunger in Somalia. Anticipatory action against cholera might be tried next. Donors seem keen to see more such interventions.
Second, adjustment to the pandemic has speeded up change in the humanitarian sphere, just as it has in other industries. Cash is being deployed more effectively. So is technology: artificial intelligence is being used to map outbreaks of disease, and drones deployed to deliver medical supplies and testing samples. Even the UN’s bureaucracy is pushing less paper, and its staff are travelling less manically. More important, the value of building up local organisations in the field has become even clearer, with the prospect of improved capacity to deliver relief in future. Local capacity-building was recognised as vital at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in 2016, but the pandemic  has given this a renewed sense of urgency, according to Dr Esperanza Martinez, head of health at the International Committee of the Red Cross: “Covid-19 is an accelerator,” she says, for example causing the ICRC to bring forward the building of surgical capacity from 2023 to 2021 in a project spanning Nigeria, South Sudan and the DRC.
Third, the incoming Biden administration could make a difference. It is likely to give greater weight to places President Donald Trump called “shithole countries”. One of Jake Sullivan’s first tweets after he was named as Mr Biden’s choice for national security adviser was about Ethiopia. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the nominee for UN ambassador, served as the top official for Africa under the Obama administration. Mr Biden plans to put America back into the Paris agreement and has signalled the priority he attaches to tackling climate change by naming John Kerry, a former secretary of state, as his climate envoy. 
But all these changes will take time to show results. In the meantime, 235m people are at risk in 2021. The bright spots are mere glimmers in the gloom.",2
1504,"El Salvador’s roll-out of  bitcoin as legal tender got off to a shaky start. The Central American country is the first in the world to adopt the cryptocurrency as an official means of exchange; it now uses bitcoin alongside the American dollar. Systems were overwhelmed as people downloaded the government-backed Chivo, or “cool”, e-wallet, after the government offered $30-worth of free bitcoin as an incentive. The roll-out added to already volatile trading in bitcoin; at one point the price plunged so fast it was described as a “flash crash”.
The SEC plays catch-up

Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, revealed that America’s Securities and Exchange Commission is threatening to sue it, if it brings a product to market that allows users to lend their cryptoassets and earn interest on the loan. The company suggested that this may be because the SEC classifies the product as a security (therefore falling outside existing lending regulations), but it had not been given an official explanation.
SoftBank’s stock surged after it announced a complex deal that gives it a 4.5% stake in Deutsche Telekom in return for a chunk of its shares in T-Mobile US, in which Deutsche Telekom is already the largest investor. The German telecoms company will then sell off T-Mobile Netherlands for $6.1bn and buy more shares in the American wireless business. SoftBank benefits through a strategic arrangement that gives it access to Deutsche Telekom’s European customer base.
Both Didi Global and Beijing’s city government denied media reports that the city government is considering taking the ride-hailing company under state control and arranging this by directing state firms to invest in it. Didi is one of the targets of China’s crackdown on influential tech companies. In July it was ordered to pull its app from app stores after it completed a successful IPO in New York.
Trading in bonds issued on Chinese stock exchanges by Evergrande was suspended for a second time, after the property developer, one of China’s largest, warned that it was at risk of a default. The highly indebted company’s woes have sent shock waves through China’s property industry.

The takeover battle for Morrisons, Britain’s fourth-largest supermarket chain, looks set to be decided by an auction next month. The company is being pursued by two American private-equity groups, neither of which has declared its offer as final, sparking the auction process.
EasyJet, a low-cost airline based in Britain, said it had rejected a takeover approach.

Politicians would be accountable to residents, diversity would rule and prosperity would be shared. Telosa’s detractors call it the world’s first woke city.",2
1505,"OF THE ESTIMATED 55m people living with dementia around the world, only one-quarter have been formally diagnosed with the condition. There are many reasons for this. Two are enduring: many patients and clinicians alike wrongly believe that dementia is an inevitable part of the ageing-human condition and, being incurable, is hardly worth diagnosing; and some people experiencing cognitive impairment fear hearing what sounds like a sentence of brain-death, and so do not seek help.
Some of the reasons for non-diagnosis, however, may be about to change. During the covid-19 pandemic many people have delayed consulting their doctors about non-urgent conditions, and as lockdowns ease, they may begin to ask for professional guidance (moreover, evidence suggests that covid itself heightens the risk of dementia). In addition, diagnostic techniques, hitherto unreliable, time-consuming and costly, are becoming available, and for some forms of dementia hopes are emerging of more effective treatments.

Dementia is normally diagnosed by testing cognitive functions such as memory. If mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often a precursor to dementia, is detected, a patient may then be referred for tests to identify which of the dozens of causes of dementia are to blame. By far the most common is Alzheimer’s disease, accounting for 60-80% of cases.
Fear of the needle
Identifying Alzheimer’s normally requires a brain scan, and perhaps a lumbar puncture (the insertion of a needle into the lower spine), to extract cerebrospinal fluid, so as to measure its levels of two proteins that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, known as beta-amyloid and tau. Some patients are reluctant to undergo the intrusive procedure. The scans are usually by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), to look at the size of the brain, along with a positron-emission tomography (PET) scan to measure the build-up of beta-amyloid. PET and MRI scanners are expensive pieces of kit, running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For most people in the world, they are unobtainable.
That explains the excitement at the development of simple blood tests to distinguish Alzheimer’s from other neurodegenerative conditions. One, announced last year and likely to be validated for routine use within 12 months, according to Serge Gauthier, professor of neurology and neurosurgery at McGill University in Montreal, measures a form of tau called p-tau217. It has been found to predict Alzheimer’s with 96% accuracy.
It is already possible using mass spectrometry, which detects how atoms and molecules are deflected by magnetic fields, to measure the level of beta-amyloid in the blood. But it is not certain how this relates to levels in the brain. The accuracy of the procedure rises to 94% if two other risk factors are considered: age and the presence of a form of the APOE gene, known as APOE4, which heightens the risk of developing Alzheimer’s (and also appears to increase vulnerability to heart disease and covid). This can also be detected by a blood test, so Dr Gauthier envisages symptomatic patients giving blood samples for simultaneous tests for both tau and APOE4.
Other approaches aim to detect asymptomatic people years or even decades before they begin to show obvious symptoms. George Stothart at the University of Bath in Britain leads a team that has developed very quick passive tests that hold great promise for detecting cognitive impairment early. These tests use electroencephalographic caps which are worn on the head to compare brainwave responses to a series of images. The caps are relatively cheap and the test can be conducted using a tablet computer.
Taking the exam
Meanwhile, machine-learning and AI are enabling big improvements in cognitive testing, which, like other sorts of pencil-and-paper exams, has been prone to cultural and educational bias, and to a “learning bias” (lessened accuracy as practice improves the participants’ results). Cognetivity Neurosciences, for example, a firm launched by two academics at the University of Cambridge, produces an “integrated cognitive assessment” that has already been deployed by some regions of Britain’s National Health Service. It has also been approved by America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by regulators in the European Union.
The Cognetivity test relies on a series of flashing images, among which some animals have been embedded for the person being tested to identify—rather like the CAPTCHA tests used by some websites to weed out robots trying to log on, only these are conducted at rapid speeds. So rapid, indeed, that the tests cannot be conducted remotely, but are done on tablets in memory clinics or at doctors’ surgeries. Already, however, a variety of do-it-yourself cognitive tests of various standards are available online, and some of these could become important diagnostic tools.
Even before the explosion in the use of AI, scientists could detect evidence of dementia from how people use words. A study in 2011, for example, found clear retrospective evidence in the writings in her 40s and 50s of Iris Murdoch, a novelist, of the Alzheimer’s she was to die with in 1999, aged 79. The research arm of IBM, a computing giant, has used data from the Framingham heart study, which has tracked three generations of people in a town in Massachusetts since 1948 to improve knowledge of cardiovascular health. Ajay Royyuru, who heads IBM’s health-care and life-sciences research, says that studying the use of language by participants in the study suggests that changes over time can be used to predict which of them will acquire dementia, seven and a half years before they are diagnosed even with MCI.
Such data—and the massive amounts people compile every day on their smartphones, using various services such as messaging or navigation—could help enable much earlier detection of dementia. This might be possible with apps, although the ethics of any non-consensual diagnosis and the willingness of people to use such services are another matter. One way or another, though, Paola Barbarino, chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International, an advocacy group, expects a “tsunami” of demand for treatment.
For health-care systems around the world all this may pose more problems than it solves. The main one is the lack of proven treatments. In June the FDA approved Aduhelm, the first drug to treat Alzheimer’s. A monoclonal antibody shown to reduce accumulations of beta-amyloid, it has so far been little used, because it is expensive and insurers are reluctant to approve reimbursement when there are doubts as to whether it actually slows cognitive degeneration. But it is the first in a queue of drugs, for which Alzheimer’s specialists hold out great hopes.
The second difficulty is in assessing when MCI requires medical intervention. As Dr Gauthier points out, some mental decline is indeed part of ageing. People find ways of coping. Telling the difference is hard to do through blood tests or the use of AI. It still requires time and human intervention. This is part of the third and biggest difficulty: that, as the world ages, the number of people with dementia is going to rise rapidly, to more than 80m by 2030 and more than 140m by 2050. Even today health services are buckling. Who knows how they will cope in the decades ahead. ■

IN THE SIMULTANEOUSLY global, parochial and precise view of the scientists of the Global Carbon Project (GCP), it was April 7th which marked peak lockdown. The parts of the world where there was some sort of confinement order in place on that day would normally have accounted for 89% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions, the highest such percentage of the whole pandemic: the day before, less of America was locked down; the day after, more of China had gone back to work. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted on that peak day was, the GCP calculates, 17% lower than 2019’s daily average.
That is a huge difference: more than 11m tonnes of carbon dioxide. It is also a small one. For years, environmentalists have been calling on people to change their lifestyles in order to protect the planet. In the face of covid-19, governments have made some of their strictures official policy. The world now knows what can be achieved by closing a vast number of shops, as well as offices and factories, and stopping a great many people from travelling: a reduction in emissions which, though striking, is not enough to fundamentally change things, gained at an enormous price in terms of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

The measures governments have taken against covid-19 are entirely unsuited to a campaign against climate change that has to last for decades, rather than days. But the financial muscle brought to bear and the willingness to use the full force of the state is nevertheless suggestive. Climate-minded academics, public intellectuals and think-tankers have worked themselves into a lather over the benefits which action on such a scale could provide if effects on climate were actually part of the remit.
As Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental think-tank, points out, government decisions guide about 70% of the world’s spending on energy. “In a very short period of time,” he says, “governments will make enormously consequential decisions.” Total stimulus spending will be in the trillions. If a decent fraction of that is earmarked for climate action, it could be world changing.
This idea is not new. Similar pleas were heard—from some of the same people—a decade ago, when policymakers were trying to get the world out of the slump brought on by the financial crisis of 2007-09. Roughly an eighth of the stimulus money disbursed by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)—some $90bn—went into clean-energy loans and investments.
This greenery is remembered in political circles mainly because the first loan issued under the scheme—for a meaty $535m—went to Solyndra, a company devoted to cylindrical solar cells which went bust soon afterwards. The overwhelming majority of its loans, though, were repaid. One of them helped to finance Tesla’s first car factory.
Defenders of those clean-energy investments argue that they drew in $150bn of private and non-federal investment in clean energy—2009 and 2012 proved to be bumper years in America’s wind-energy sector—and paved the way for great progress over the subsequent decade. They did not, though, have any prompt appreciable effect on the global emissions trajectory. That was dominated by China’s post-crisis stimulus, which relied on ramping up coal-fired power stations. If American emissions did not rise as fast as they might have, it had more to do with cheap natural gas from the fracking boom providing a profitable alternative to coal-fired electricity than to any effects of ARRA.
Whatever ARRA’s role in the matter, though, renewables did start to have an appreciable effect in later years. They helped global emissions plateau in 2014-16, and again in 2018-19, even as the economy expanded. Renewables are now often cheaper than fossil fuels in large parts of the world. This is one of the reasons why today’s calls for a green stimulus are not carbon copies of those made ten years ago. They have less stress on renewable-energy R and fewer calls for demonstration projects. There is more emphasis on deploying technologies for types of decarbonisation not easily achieved with electricity, and on energy-storage systems and greatly improved electric grids that will open the way to much needed further expansion of renewables.
In America, the precise details of what is on the stimulus menu seem immaterial; President Donald Trump’s administration is much more interested in helping coal and oil companies than it is the renewable sector. That said, a block of Republican senators from states with significant clean-energy industries—including wind farms of the sort that blossomed after the financial crisis—has convinced the Treasury to consider extending tax-incentive schemes for renewable developments which have been stalled by the response to the epidemic.
The fact that renewables now have lobbying power is one demonstration that things are different this time. Another is that politics have changed, too. The Paris agreement of 2015 required its signatories to develop plans for emissions reduction, and to stand ready to increase their ambition at another big UN summit, co-hosted by Britain and Italy, which was originally planned for this year but has now been deferred to 2021. Polling suggests that citizens would be happy to see them take that commitment seriously. In April Ipsos MORI asked people from 14 countries whether they thought climate change was as serious a threat as covid-19. The greatest assent was in China, where 87% agreed that it was; but even in America, where the assent was lowest, 59% agreed. Nearly two-thirds of respondents, including 57% of Americans, went on to say that it was important that government actions aimed at economic recovery prioritise action on climate change.
Gizza job
Green boosters have always been keen to claim that strong climate policies have the added advantage of producing copious jobs; the Obama administration credited clean-energy investments under ARRA with supporting 900,000 job-years of employment. In recent years of low unemployment such claims have come to seem somewhat beside the point. With joblessness now having bounced back above Great Depression levels in many places, green jobs have again become a selling point.
Some see mass unemployment not just as a symptom to assuage, but as a unique opportunity to get things done which, if everyone had a job, would be much harder. Such ideas fit with the growing need for large-scale infrastructure that gets the most out of private investments. With renewable energy growing fast, getting it to the places where it can do the most to edge out fossil fuels—for example, the batteries of electric vehicles—is an obvious next step. The British government is one of those considering rolling out a huge network of car-charging facilities.
Many economists might prefer to see governments simply provide incentives for endeavours they think worthwhile, leaving industry to meet those goals with whatever number of workers seems most efficient, rather than how many the government wants off the dole. This is particularly true given that much covid-related unemployment has fallen on the service sector; the jobs that need doing and the people who need jobs might be a poor fit.
Against that needs to be considered the problem of the “90% economy”. Some service-sector jobs will come back quite slowly, if at all. If governments incentivise, say, home insulation and offer training and certification, all sorts of local companies might provide the actual service, and they would be quite labour intensive.
In Pakistan the unemployed are being released from lockdown to work on a tree-planting programme that predates the crisis. The climate impact may not be that high; but refugees from service sectors around the world might rather enjoy similar opportunities, at least for a while. And they would not need all that much training. As Cameron Hepburn of the University of Oxford points out, you can go from pulling pints to planting pines pretty quickly. ■",2
1507,"TOURISTS IN CRES, a pretty town on the rock-strewn Croatian island of the same name, have no idea what they are looking at. In the distance is a wall of steel, painted white and blue. Many locals hate it. They think this relic of their ship-repairing past is a piece of junk that spoils the view and should be scrapped. But wait! Is it not the last maritime object afloat from the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Navy, which vanished with its empire in 1918? Preserve it, say some historians. Sink it, say less romantic islanders.
Built in 1913, the floating dry dock repaired submarines in the first world war. After 1918 Italy’s navy used it, since a chunk of territory along the north-east strip of the Adriatic had become Italian. After the second world war, when Cres became part of Yugoslavia, the dock repaired naval vessels until it was sold as a commercial asset in 1984. In 1991 the island became part of independent Croatia. Its dry dock closed down last year.

Bojana Vuksanovic, a local architect, thinks it an extraordinary piece of maritime history. In a nearby palace she has an exhibition, showing how it could become a museum and performance space. Fancy new marinas, she says, are wiping out local history. But many locals say Cres has more pressing needs than restoring the dock. “I’m a fisherman,” says a shipyard worker. “We should tow it out to sea and sink it—to attract the fish.”
Elsewhere in Croatia royalty bows before the more recent communist past. The Galeb, a ship on which Yugoslavia’s Marshal Tito cruised the world, is being restored to its former glory. But the Habsburgs’ yacht, which took Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne, on his last naval voyage en route to his assassination in Sarajevo in 1914, lay forlorn near Split. Officials in left-leaning Rijeka, the Galeb’s home port, secured €5m ($5.8m) of EU funds topped up with Croatian money to preserve the boat. No such luck for Franz Ferdinand’s vessel. It has sunk.",2
1508,"Rodents may be asymptomatic carries of SARS-like viruses, a study has warned — meaning the the 'next COVID-19' may well come from rats.
Researchers from Princeton University performed a genomic analysis of various mammal species, looking specifically at the receptors that SARS viruses bind to.
They found evidence that some rodent species in the past were repeatedly exposed to SARS-like coronaviruses, leading them to likely evolve a certain level of resistance.
SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 infection — is 'zoonotic', meaning that it jumped from a non-human animal into humans.
And previous research has shown that Chinese horseshoe bats can play host to numerous SARS-like without themselves showing extreme symptoms.
Identifying animals that may have similar protections against such infections — and could thus serve as viral reservoirs — is vital for preventing future pandemics.
The study was conducted by molecular biologist Sean King and computer scientist Mona Singh of New Jersey's Princeton University. 
'Our study suggests that ancestral rodents may have had repeated infections with SARS-like coronaviruses,' the duo wrote in their paper.
This, they added, likely have allowed them to acquire 'some form of tolerance or resistance to SARS-like coronaviruses as a result of these infections.
'This raises the tantalizing possibility that some modern rodent species may be asymptomatic carriers of SARS-like coronaviruses — including those that may not have been discovered yet.' 
In their investigation, Dr King and Professor Singh studied the so-called ACE2 receptors that SARS viruses use to gain entry into mammalian cells — characterising the evolution of the receptors across different mammal species.
The team found that primates and other mammals not already known to be SARS hosts tended to have little evidence of past adaptation in the ACE2 receptors, which is what today leaves us vulnerable to symptomatic cases of the disease.
Among rodents, however, the duo's genomic analysis exposed a pattern of rapid evolution in the ACE2 binding interface — evidence by a greater diversity in the amino acid sequences that code for the receptor.
This suggests that some rodent species were likely exposed to SARS-like coronaviruses repeatedly over the course their evolution and, as a consequence, that they may have acquired a form of tolerance to these types of infections. 

'Continuing to explore adaptations in coronavirus animal hosts will be important […] for understanding which animals have possibly adapted tolerance mechanisms through ancient exposures and may be carriers of SARS-like viruses,' the duo began.
Such studies, they continued, will also aid us in 'finding those that are vulnerable symptomatic hosts, as humans have unfortunately proven to be.'
The full findings of the study were published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.  
Zoonotic diseases are able to pass from one species to another.
The infecting agent - called a pathogen - in these diseases is able to cross the species border and still survive. 
They range in potency, and are often less dangerous in one species than they are in another. 
In order to be successful they rely on long and direct contact with different animals.  
Common examples are the strains of influenza that have adapted to survive in humans from various different host animals. 
H5N1, H7N9 and H5N6 are all strains of avian influenza which originated in birds and infected humans.
These cases are rare but outbreaks do occur when a person has prolonged, direct exposure with infected animals. 
The flu strain is also incapable of passing from human to human once a person is infected.  
A 2009 outbreak of swine flu - H1N1 - was considered a pandemic and governments spent millions developing 'tamiflu' to stop the spread of the disease. 
Influenza is zoonotic because, as a virus, it can rapidly evolve and change its shape and structure.  
There are examples of other zoonotic diseases, such as chlamydia. 
Chlamydia is a bacteria that has many different strains in the general family. 
This has been known to happen with some specific strains, Chlamydia abortus for example.
This specific bacteria can cause abortion in small ruminants, and if transmitted to a human can result in abortions, premature births and life-threatening illnesses in pregnant women.",-2
1509,"Newly released bodycam footage shows the moment a 17-year-old girl warned police of the abuse her parents were inflicting upon her and her 12 siblings living in squalor, in the first time she had ever spoken to a person outside her family.
Jordan Turpin, now 21,  escaped her home and called the cops on her abusive parents on January 14, 2018. Bodycam footage from that night in Perris, California, shows a terrified girl struggling to speak but determined to rescue her siblings. 
Then 17, Jordan managed to escape her home out a window with a cell phone, which contained evidence of the abuse, walking down the middle of the street not knowing where she lived and shaking as she struggled to dial 911.   
'My whole body was shaking, I couldn't really dial,' Jordan, choking back tears as she described the moment she finally escaped the House of Horrors and made the 911 call, said during a 20/20 special set to air Friday.
Their parents, David and Louise Turpin, pled guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison in 2019. 
Scroll down for video 
The 911 dispatcher had stayed on the phone with the frightened girl until an officer arrived. Jordan is seen noticeably frantic, taking a moment to calm herself as she begins speaking with the officer. 
'Okay. I just ran away from home. And I live in a family of 15. My two little sisters right now are chained up,' she say as her voice shakes sounding much younger than 17. 
When the officer asks where the siblings are chained up she replies: 'On the bed now mother didn’t chain them up just to be mean. Okay. They’re chained up because they stole mother’s food.'
She strains to maintain her calm as she speaks to a person outside her home for the first time in her life. 'But…I’m sorry if I talk too much. Okay. I’ve never talked to anybody out there so I don’t- I’ve never been alone with a person so this is very hard for me to talk,' she tells the officer.
Questioning the frazzled teen who struggles to speak clearly, the officer asks if she's on any medication. 
'Medication? What's medication?' she asks back. The officer tries to help Jordan understand asking if she takes pills. 
'Oh. I don’t think I’ve ever tooken a pill before. Right, I haven’t,' she confirms in her broken vocabulary. 
She's then seen putting on a baseball cap, which ABC's Diane Sawyer explained in her interview was a reminder of one of her sisters. After nervously fixing the cap on her head, she dives back into the reason for her call. 
'Our parents are abusing. They abuse us. But the reason I called and the reason I managed to get out here this is one of the most scariest things I’ve ever done. I’m terrified. But I called because my two little sisters they’re chained up right now.' 
The officer asks if Jordan has any photos of the girls chained up and she excitedly confirms she took photos after one of her sisters told her to. 
'I don’t have proof of everything but I have proof that my sisters are chained up.'
Not knowing the word 'bruise' she tells the officer: 'See? Those are the places that make in on them. And see how dirty she is? We’re so filthy. We don’t take baths.'
The officer asks one more time: 'Your parents chained them up?'
'Yes, because they stole food. But they stole it because they were hungry,' Jordan confirms.  
Audio from the bodycam recorded the deputy asking Jordan: 'What are your parents going to do when they find out you left?'
'They are going to want to literally kill me,' she answers. 
Jordan's call to police lasted for 20 minutes because the girl struggled to work out her address because she had not been outside alone before.
'I had to make sure that if I left we wouldn't go back and we would get the help we needed,' she told Sawyer. 
Explaining her decision to finally escape, Jordan told Sawyer: 'I think it was us coming close to death so many times.'




'It was literally a now or never. If something happened to me, at least I died trying.'
'The only word I know to call it is 'hell,""' Jordan's sister Jennifer, 33, added in the trailer for the 20/20 special, set to air Friday.
'My parents took my whole life from me, but now I am taking my life back,' she said.
Jennifer doesn't doesn't want her siblings to be remembered as victims, but instead as fighters.
'I want the Turpin name [to be] ""Wow, they're strong. They're not broken. They've got this,'"" she said.
Jordan, describing life post-rescue, said: 'It's so free. Like wow, this is life.'
Jordan said she and her siblings came 'close to death so many times.'
'Mother, she choked me and I literally thought I was going to die,' she shared.
In her harrowing 911 call, Jordan sounded clear but agitated as she walked away from the home she was confined to most of the time and revealed everything to the dispatcher. 
'Um hello? I just ran away from home because I live in a family of 15. OK? Can you hear me? And we have abusing parents. Did you hear that?' Jordan Turpin tells a dispatcher.
When the dispatcher asked how her parents abused her and her siblings, she replied: 'OK, They hit us. They like to throw us across the room. They pull out hair. They yank out our hair. I have two ... My two little sisters right now are chained up.' 
Bodycam footage later shows officers enter the house, confront the parents and discover the children, at least two of whom were shackled to their beds. 
'Sarge, we've got another room in the front right here with two kiddos in the bed,' an officer says in the video.   
The siblings, ranging in age from 2 to 29 years old, were freed from the home in January 2018 after being regularly beaten, starved and strangled by their parents. 
The house was covered in filth and the stench of human waste was said to be overwhelming. Jennifer confirmed that the kids would often be chained up for months.
The parents' abuse and neglect was so 'severe, pervasive, [and] prolonged' that it stunted their children's growth, led to muscle wasting and left two of their daughters unable to bear children. 
Since the 13 Turpin children were rescued from their parents horror house in January 2018, they have been actively working to take back their lives. 
'They're all happy,' Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People in April 2020. 'They are moving on with their lives.'
His interview revealed the siblings still live in Southern California and remain close to each other, regularly getting together.  
'They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they'll meet somewhere kind of discreet,' he shared.
Beecham shared that the six youngest children had been adopted and, since they had experienced fewer years of abuse due to their ages, were able to quickly adjust to their new lives.
One of the older siblings has earned a college degree.  
Others are in school, living on their own and working jobs.
'Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,' Beecham explained. 
A few of the siblings, at the time of the interview, were still living in group homes as they received therapy and counseling.
Two of the Turpin sisters spoke out to Diane Sawyer, in an interview airing on November 19, revealing that they were moving forward with their lives. 
'My parents took my whole life from me, but now I am taking my life back,' one sister told Sawyer. 
The other described her new life as being 'free.'



Following David and Louise's arrests in January 2018, horrific details began to emerge of the extent of torture, abuse and neglect that the children.
Deputies testified that the children said they were only allowed to shower once a year.
They were mainly kept in their rooms except for meals, which had been reduced from three to one per day, a combination of lunch and dinner. 
For years, the siblings' diet consisted of nothing but two slices of bread with peanut butter or bologna. The couple were also accused of taunting their children with pies and other food that they were forbidden to eat.  
The Turpin parents chowed down on fast food in front of them, chaining the children to filthy beds if they tried to steal food. 
'They still can't look at peanut butter or bologna,' Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham told People magazine last year.
'I made the mistake of mentioning peanut butter during one of our meet-and-greets, and one of the girls almost threw up. And when they're at the grocery store, they can't look at peanut butter. They can't even go down the aisle where there's peanut butter.'
The Turpin offspring weren't allowed to play like normal children and were deprived of things other kids had, including toys and games. 



Sawyer also spoke with Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin, who was involved with the case. He says it is one he will never forget.
'It stopped me dead in my tracks,' he said. 'There are cases that stick with you, that haunt you.' 
David and Louise pleaded guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse in 2019 and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
They are both eligible for parole in 22 years.
The 13 siblings remained out of the public eye as their parents' case unfolded in court and they learned to adapt to normal life outside the confines of the house of horrors. 
Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People magazine that all of the siblings 'are happy.'
'They are moving on with their lives,' he added.
At that time, one sibling had graduated college, while several others had jobs or were going to school. 
'Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,' he shared. 
He also noted that the siblings see each other regularly.  
'They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they'll meet somewhere kind of discreet,' he said. 
Several of the siblings have changed their names to rid themselves of the stigma of being a victim in the high-profile case. 
'It would be difficult for them to carry that name, that label of being a victim, forever,' Beecham said. 
But Jennifer told Sawyer she wants to change what people think when they hear the Turpin name. 'I want the Turpin name, like wow, they're strong, they're not broken, they've got this,' she explained.

1510,"Oct 21 (Reuters) - When Sebastian Kanovich co-founded Latin American digital payments startup dLocal in Montevideo in 2016, he struggled to get global retailers to take him seriously.
""It took us a lot of No's before getting the first Yes,"" he told Reuters. ""We were not only from Latin America, but from Uruguay, not known for technology.""
Five years on, it's a different story.
dLocal (DLO.O) listed on the Nasdaq exchange in New York in June and is now worth $16 billion, thanks to partnerships with the likes of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Uber (UBER.N) in 30 countries, and other Latino tech firms are riding the wave.
In the first nine months of 2021, Latino startups from Brazil's online lender Nubank to Colombian delivery firm Rappi raised $14.8 billion in new money, a jump of 174% since last year, data provided to Reuters by CBInsights showed.
The Latino boom has caught the eye of some of the biggest names in private equity and venture capital such as SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. Now Wall Street's banks are looking to tap into the gold rush by taking more Latino ""unicorns"" public in the United States.
At least 10 Latin American tech startups including Brazil's apartment rental service QuintoAndar as well as Mexico's used-car dealer Kavak and fintechs Clip and Creditas are preparing initial public offerings (IPOs) for next year, six people with knowledge of the deals told Reuters.
All the sources requested anonymity as the discussions about the planned listings are confidential.
Kavak, QuintoAndar and Clip declined to comment. Creditas said it could not share any information about an IPO at this time.
Nubank, which counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) as an investor, is aiming for a valuation above $55 billion in a U.S. IPO next year to become the region's most valuable financial institution, Reuters reported in August.
GLOBAL ASPIRATIONS
The rise of Latin American unicorns - private firms worth at least $1 billion - is being driven by a once-in-a-generation internet boom that has accelerated under pandemic lockdowns as more shoppers move online, bankers and deals lawyers say.
""Companies in the region have matured in the last five years and now we think there will likely be between two and three IPOs by Latam tech companies per quarter by next year,"" said Rodrigo Maldonado, executive director at Morgan Stanley in Brazil, referring to U.S. listings.
While Latin America still lags Asia, Europe and the United States in terms of volumes of tech startups, the widespread and increasing use of smartphones, wireless networks and payments cards has created a ready demand for new digital services.
Smartphone-savvy consumers in the region have become increasingly comfortable with digital wallets and even starting to make virtual doctor appointments with smartphone apps.
That's why venture capitalists are still minting tech unicorns in Latin America, and some more established startups are pushing ahead with U.S. listing plans despite the recent market sell-off that hit technology stocks.
""If you look at the pipeline from Latam now, it is pretty amazing what could come from the region - not only from Brazil, but also from countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Peru,"" said Alex Ibrahim, head of International Capital Markets at the New York Stock Exchange.
""And a number of those high-growth startups from those countries are betting on big global markets like the United States,"" he said.
Many stock markets in Latin America are dominated by more traditional companies such as banks and commodities players, which is pushing startups to look north for listings. Tech firms account for less than 10% of Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index, for example, whereas they make up nearly a third of the S&P 500.
Gone are the days, though, when Latino startups were seen as a cheaper entry point for investors than U.S. ones. Most financing is now at valuations on a par with Silicon Valley rivals, investment bankers and venture capitalists told Reuters.
""I see multiples for startups in Brazil and Mexico as very similar to those elsewhere, (especially) if the company has global growth aspirations,"" said Martin Escobari, co-president at U.S. growth investor General Atlantic, which has a dozen Latin American startups in its portfolio.
There are still challenges for tech companies to overcome in the region, including a paucity of engineering talent.
General Atlantic estimates Latin America's universities train 40,000 software developers a year, far below the 100,000 it estimates the fast-growing tech sector needs annually.
Other factors such political and economic instability are also making investors more cautious when looking for businesses they believe will be resilient.
The region has a history of going from boom to bust too, such as in 2014-15 when a number of large investors pulled back following an economic downturn that doomed the prospects of several fledgling tech ventures.
But deep-pocketed investors, such as SoftBank and Sequoia, are betting this time is different, and are poised to rake in big returns from some early bets. Eye-popping gains are, in turn, inspiring a new generation of tech founders and investors.
""Tech companies first emerged in the region roughly 20 years ago, but only now all the building blocks are in place: infrastructure, entrepreneurs, venture capital investors and capital markets,"" said General Atlantic's Escobari.
FINTECH FAVORED
Startups focused on financial technology, or fintech, are mopping up much of the funding with a 40% share of the overall pot in 2020, according to LAVCA, the association for private equity in Latin America.
Many of them sell financial services to the ""unbanked"", or those unable to access traditional banking, and Brazil's Nubank, C6Bank, which is backed by JPMorgan (JPM.N), and SoftBank's Creditas have benefited most from the investor interest.
With fintech in vogue, non-financial startups such as Kavak and QuintoAndar have started offering financial services to consumers including car loans and insurance.
Sequoia has only made a half dozen Latin American investments - including Nubank and Rappi - but Sonya Huang, a partner at the venture capital firm, said it planned to back one or two companies a year, in sectors such as finance, e-commerce, health and education.
""The region is very different from the U.S. or Europe, but there are some big theses which have proved right globally - like digital or mobile-first banking - and they can be applied in the region,"" Huang told Reuters.
Japan's SoftBank renewed its bets on Latin America with a $3 billion fund last month, less than three years after launching its first regional fund. Since 2019, it has invested in roughly 50 Latino startups, said Alex Szapiro, SoftBank's head of Brazil and operating partner.
""Now, capital is basically a commodity for the region.""

1511,"IN THE STAID world of Chinese banking, it is rare for executives to voice public criticism. So Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, made headlines in 2008 when he bemoaned how hard it was for small businesses to get loans: “If the banks don’t change, we’ll change the banks.” He has not repeated his warning since then. He has not needed to.
Through Ant Group, which began life as a payments service on Alibaba, Mr Ma’s impact on the Chinese financial system has been profound. Ant has helped establish China as the world leader in digital transactions, given entrepreneurs and consumers far greater access to loans, and changed the way that people manage their money. It is now a giant in its own right. Over the past year it counted more than 1bn active users. Last year it handled 110trn yuan ($16trn) in payments, nearly 25 times more than PayPal, the biggest online payments platform outside China (see chart 1).

An initial public offering (IPO) in the coming weeks will bear testimony to Ant’s growth. It is expected to raise more than $30bn, eclipsing Saudi Aramco’s debut last year as the biggest IPO—a symbol of the world’s transition from a century in which oil was the most valuable resource to an era that prizes data. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 40, in line with big global payments companies, Ant could fetch a market capitalisation in excess of $300bn, more than any bank in the world.

A four-legged insect
More important than its size is what Ant represents. It matters globally in a way that no other Chinese financial institution does. China’s banks are huge but inefficient, burdened by state ownership. By contrast foreign financiers look at Ant with curiosity, envy and anxiety. Some hawks in the White House reportedly want to rein in the company or hobble its IPO. Ant is the most integrated fintech platform in the world: think of it as a combination of Apple Pay for offline pay, PayPal for online pay, Venmo for transfers, Mastercard for credit cards, JPMorgan Chase for consumer financing and iShares for investing, with an insurance brokerage thrown in for good measure, all in one mobile app.
Given the abundance of consumer data in China and the relatively lax safeguards around its use, Ant has more to work with than fintech peers elsewhere. More than 3,000 variables have gone into its credit-risk models, and its automated systems decide whether to grant loans within three minutes—a claim that may seem far-fetched but for Alibaba’s proven ability to handle 544,000 orders per second. Ant is, in short, the world’s purest example of the tremendous potential of digital finance. But as it advances further, it may also be an early warning of its limitations.
Start with a deceptively simple question: what is Ant? In its decade as an independent company it has changed names three times—from Alibaba E-Commerce to Ant Small and Micro Financial Services to Ant Group. The company once called itself a fintech leader. Then Mr Ma inverted the term to techfin, in order better to capture its priorities. Such are its efforts to distinguish itself from a purely financial firm that it has asked some brokerages to assign tech analysts to cover it. (Of course, it does not hurt that the valuations for tech stocks are much plumper than for bank stocks.)
Yet there is no doubt that Ant, at its heart, is about finance. The clearest way of understanding its business model is to look at the four sections into which it divides its revenues. The first is payments—how it started and still the foundation of the company. Ant began in 2004 as a solution to a problem. Shoppers and merchants were flocking to Alibaba but lacked a trusted payment option. Alipay was created as an escrow account, transferring money to sellers after buyers had received their products. With the launch of a mobile Alipay app, it moved into the offline world, super-charging its growth in 2011 with the introduction of QR codes for payments. A shop owner needed to show only a QR code print-out to accept money, a big advance for a country previously reliant on cash.
For China as a whole, digital transactions reached 201trn yuan in 2019, up from less than 1trn in 2010. Alipay’s market share has been whittled down by Tencent, which added a payments function to WeChat, China’s dominant messaging app. Both companies earn as little as 0.1% per transaction, less than banks do from debit-card swipes. Given the sheer volume, this still adds up to a lot. Ant generated nearly 52bn yuan of revenues from its payments business last year. But growth is slowing, dropping from 55% of Ant’s revenue in 2017 to 36% in the first half of this year. Instead, the crucial point is that payments are a gateway: how Ant attracts users, understands them and ultimately monitors them.
The biggest beneficiary of all this data is Ant’s lending arm, the second part of the company (which Ant, never one to shy away from jargon, calls CreditTech). Ant began consumer lending as recently as 2014, with the launch of Huabei, a revolving unsecured credit line for purchases—basically a virtual credit card. Alipay users can tap into Huabei to defer payments by a month or to break them into instalments. Credit cards had never taken off in China, so Huabei was lapped up. That led to Jiebei, an Alipay feature which allows users to borrow larger sums. Ant also offers loans, with a focus on very small businesses. Annualised interest rates hover between 7% and 14%, lower than the alternatives from small-loan companies.
Like many Ant clients, Zhu Yifan, owner of Rabbits Go Home, a convenience store in Dongyang, an eastern city, started small. Four years ago she and her husband wanted to open their store. With no property as collateral, they could not get a bank loan. Instead, they pulled together money from friends and relatives, and, on a whim, borrowed 10,000 yuan from Ant, the most they could obtain then. By repaying that initial loan and getting customers to use Alipay—giving Ant a look at her cash flow—Ms Zhu’s credit score improved. Now, she has a 100,000 yuan credit line from Ant, which lets her stock up before busy holidays.
In barely half a decade Ant has reached 1.7trn yuan in outstanding consumer loans, or roughly a 15% share of China’s consumer-lending market. Its loans to small businesses total about 400bn yuan, about 5% of the micro-enterprise loan market. From a financial perspective, Ant’s biggest innovation is the way that it funds the credit. Initially, it made the loans and then packaged them as securities, sold to other financial institutions. But regulators feared parallels with the securitisation boom that preceded the financial crisis of 2007-09. They required that the originators of securities hold capital much like any bank—a rule that cut into Ant’s margins.

So Ant devised a new approach. It now identifies and assesses borrowers, but passes them on to banks which extend the loans. Ant collects a “technology service fee”. For borrowers it is seamless. With a few taps on their smartphones, their credit requests are approved or rejected. Ant ends up with a cash-rich, asset-light lending model. Fully 98% of the loans are held as assets by other firms. Credit has become Ant’s biggest single business segment, accounting for 39% of its revenues in the first half of this year (see chart 2).
The strength of Ant’s platform is what enables its third and fourth business segments: asset management and insurance (InvestmentTech and InsureTech, to use Ant’s nomenclature). Ant got started on asset management in 2013 with the launch of Yu’ebao, or “leftover treasure”. The idea was that merchants or shoppers with cash in Alipay could get a small return by parking it in a money-market fund. That attracted people interested in Yu’ebao purely for storing cash, since its yields (now roughly 1.7%) were higher than those available on current accounts at banks. By 2017 Yu’ebao had given rise to the world’s biggest money-market fund by size.
Ant broadened its offerings to become one of China’s most powerful distribution channels for investments. Today 170 companies sell more than 6,000 products such as stock and bond funds on Ant. Altogether these firms have roughly 4.1trn yuan in assets under management enabled by the app. As with its lending business, Ant screens prospective clients and directs them to products. It then collects a service fee. “Our growth on Ant has been faster than on any other digital platform,” says Li Li, deputy CEO of Invesco Great Wall Fund Management. Her group’s two money-market funds soared from 665m yuan in assets under management in early 2018, when it started selling them on Ant, to 114bn yuan in June.
Ant’s push into insurance happened more recently. For a decade it offered shipping insurance for purchases on Alibaba, letting dissatisfied customers return goods for no charge. But it is only in the past two years that it has applied its asset-management template to insurance. In partnership with big insurance firms, it has unveiled life, car and medical insurance—again collecting fees as a distribution platform. Asset management and insurance now make up nearly a quarter of revenues.
All the ants are marching
Simply looking at the numbers, Ant can appear unstoppable. It has chalked up dizzying growth rates in every market that it has targeted. It benefits from the network effects so familiar in the tech world: the more people use it, the stronger its attraction for yet more borrowers, lenders and investors. It is a virtuous cycle, especially for Ant’s shareholders. Nevertheless, there exist three kinds of risks that could slow it down: regulatory, competitive and those that are intrinsic to its own model.
The regulatory landscape in China is treacherous. Officials endlessly tweak rules for banks and investors, patching up holes as they emerge in the fast-growing but debt-laden economy. Many have long assumed that the government will give Ant, a private-sector firm, only so much leeway in the state-controlled system.
Indeed, regulators have already put numerous hurdles in Ant’s path. Its first attempt at launching a virtual credit card was blocked. The securitisation crackdown upended its lending model. A government plan to standardise QR codes could weaken it in payments, potentially reducing Ant’s market dominance. Another new rule, taking effect in November, will force Ant to hold more capital.
But if all these hurdles were meant to stop Ant, they have not succeeded. So there exists an alternative explanation. Regulators, wary of the pitfalls in financial innovation, continue to erect guardrails around Ant. In general, though, they like it. Not only has it steered credit towards small consumers and businesses, it has also given the government more information about money flows. Duncan Clark, author of a biography of Jack Ma, notes that regulators have long struggled to monitor all corners of China, referencing the old saying that the mountains are high and the emperor far away. “Ant has basically let Beijing tunnel through the mountains and fly drones over their summits,” he says.
Another threat to Ant is its competitors. Until 2013 mobile pay was, more or less, Ant’s exclusive domain. But Tencent has used its ubiquitous WeChat app to muscle in, taking nearly a 40% market share. Other firms also have financial ambitions. Meituan, an app known for food delivery, now also offers credit. The financial arm of JD.com, an e-commerce firm, and Lufax, an online wealth-management platform, are on track for IPOs this year.
So far these competitors have a much smaller financial footprint than Ant’s. Partly this is because they do not have the same breadth. Shawn Yang of Blue Lotus, a boutique Chinese investment bank, says that Tencent, for instance, has high-frequency but low-value consumption data, less rich than the trove that Ant has thanks to Alibaba, which accounts for more than half of Chinese online retail sales.
But it is also a matter of business culture. The most controversial episode in Ant’s history came in 2011 when Mr Ma spun it out from Alibaba, without notifying SoftBank and Yahoo, which together held about 70% of Alibaba’s shares back then. Mr Ma explained that Chinese regulations forbade foreigners from owning domestic payments firms, though there may have been work-arounds. Some suspected that he wanted to bring in powerful investors closer to home. Ant’s earliest rounds of fundraising as an independent firm did indeed attract major state-owned enterprises. A stake was also sold to a private equity firm managed by the grandson of Jiang Zemin, China’s paramount leader during Alibaba’s early years.
Yet in retrospect the spin-off has a clear strategic rationale. As a standalone company Ant has had the motivation to explore distant corners of the banking system and act aggressively. An executive with another e-commerce company says that its financial unit worries about making mistakes that might taint the group’s core retail business. Ant, by contrast, has diversified, with less than 10% of its revenues now from Alibaba. For China’s other e-commerce dynamos, its success offers a template. They may be several years behind but the fintech race is far from over.
The final danger for Ant has the most global resonance: the nature of its model. Unsecured lending to small borrowers is risky, whichever way it is done. Indeed the coronavirus pandemic has offered a sharp test for Ant. Delinquent loans (more than 30 days past due) issued via its app nearly doubled from 1.5% of its outstanding total in 2019 to 2.9% in July. Yet that is better than most other banks in China. Is that because of Ant’s prowess? Some critics say that it reflects its market power. Given the centrality of Alipay and Alibaba to their operations, few dare to default on Ant loans, worried that a downgraded credit rating may damage other parts of their business.
Still, many bankers are persuaded that Ant truly does have an advantage in its analytics. “They don’t need quarterly statements. They see your daily flow of funds. They know who your customer is. They know who your customer’s customer is,” says one. Based on the address for e-commerce deliveries, Ant has more up-to-date information about where someone lives and works than a bank. Based on what that person buys, Ant can work out their income bracket and their habits, preferences and way of life.
But according to Hui Chen, a finance professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has worked on research projects with Ant, individual and systemic risks are different. The machine learning that underpins Ant’s algorithms observes individual behaviour again and again, and is then able to detect patterns and anomalies. But if risks do not appear in the historical data—say, a big economic shock—the same machine learning may stumble.

There are also some limitations hard-wired into Ant’s strategy. By design, it aims for high-volume, small-scale borrowers and investors. “Their analytical advantage is most significant with this mass market, where traditional banking models are most inaccessible,” says Mr Chen. Most corporate lending—about 60% of all credit in China—will remain off limits. Ant also has an awkward relationship with banks. It relies on them to fund the loans on its platform, but as it grows it may become a competitor in their eyes. For now that is not much of a concern, given that it focuses on borrowers ignored by banks. But it means that Ant must befriend the very institutions that it once set out to disrupt.
Doubts exist about its investment and insurance platforms, too. Ant has excelled in selling money-market funds to a plethora of retail investors. Moving up the value chain could be harder. “They are great at selling penny products. But that’s not where you make the money in insurance,” says Sam Radwan of Enhance, a consultancy. To close a deal on a valuable, complex policy like a variable annuity, brokers typically speak with consumers several times. “No ordinary customer is going to trust an online broker for something that complicated,” says Mr Radwan.
Doing the jitterbug
Ant’s global ambitions are also running into problems beyond its control. It has stakes in around ten different fintech companies in Asia, such as Paytm in India. Boosters once imagined a world connected by Ant, its credit-to-investment architecture straddling borders. The first blow to that vision came in 2018 when America blocked Ant’s acquisition of MoneyGram, a money-transfer firm, which would have established Ant as a force in global remittances. Security concerns over Ant have increased as China’s foreign policy has become more aggressive. Little wonder that Ant plans to devote just a tenth of its IPO proceeds to cross-border expansion.
Despite all these limitations, one lesson from Ant’s decade in existence is that future possibilities remain vast. Ms Li of Invesco gushes about her fund-management firm’s mini-site within the Alipay app, one of the tens of thousands of separate sections that constitute the Ant ecosystem. In September Invesco hosted a live-stream on the mini-site to discuss its market outlook. More than 700,000 tuned in—just one example of how Ant has become the main doorway into the financial system for tens of millions of people. And for all those who have walked through it, many more have not. Ant will soon know where they live, how much they earn and what they want. It is coming for them. ■",2
1512,"WHEN THE Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, they were international pariahs. Their hospitality to global jihadists, oppression of women, medieval brutality and cultural vandalism alienated most of the world. Only three governments recognised their self-proclaimed Emirate—those of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—and those were quick to turn against them after the September 11th attacks orchestrated by al-Qaeda from Afghanistan.
Twenty years on, the Taliban seem intent on ensuring that their second regime will be on a sounder diplomatic footing. Having largely avoided bloodshed in their takeover of Kabul, they are presenting themselves as a moderate, stabilising force. Unlikely allies in this effort are some supporters of a rival militant group, Islamic State, who have decried the Taliban as an “apostate militia” and even, absurdly, an American agent. The West will take some convincing of the Taliban’s apostasy, but their humiliation of America has predisposed some big countries in their favour, including China, Iran and Russia. Even these countries, however, are extremely wary of the Taliban. The victors in Kabul are a long way from achieving widespread international acceptance.

As Western governments scrambled to extricate their citizens and some local staff from the country, China and Russia have kept their embassies in Kabul open, under Taliban protection, and indicated they are ready to deal with the new regime. On August 17th the Russian ambassador, Dmitry Zhirnov, was the first foreign official to sit down with Taliban leaders in Kabul. Russia has its own memories of humiliation and failure in Afghanistan. And the chaotic scenes of the past few days at least have the merit, viewed from Moscow, of making the Soviet Union’s withdrawal from the country in 1989 look less calamitous by comparison. The Afghan government it left behind survived for three years, rather than collapsing instantly. Its fall (leading to a period of turmoil and, ultimately, to the Taliban’s taking power) was precipitated by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the withdrawal of its financial support. The Russian government has long had contacts with the Taliban, despite listing them as a terrorist group, and prepared for their possible triumph. In July Russia played host in Moscow to a Taliban delegation.
In what seems in retrospect to have been part of a concerted diplomatic push ahead of taking power, that same month a Taliban delegation, led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the group’s de facto leader, was also in Beijing, where it was accorded a well-publicised meeting with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. The official Chinese press has relished America’s embarrassment, celebrating what one commentator called the end of the “second period of US strategic profligacy” (the first having ended, in this view, with the withdrawal from Saigon in 1975).
Iran, too, has enjoyed the Great Satan’s discomfiture, and this week has maintained a diplomatic presence both in Kabul and in Herat, close to its border. Its long-standing hostility to the Taliban has moderated in recent years, with its leaders holding meetings with them. This week Iran’s new president, Ebrahim Raisi, celebrated America’s withdrawal and “military defeat” as “an opportunity to restore life, security and lasting peace to the country”.
It is not just America’s foes and rivals that have kept their doors open to the Taliban. Indeed, one has long invited them in, to make themselves at home. Pakistan has for decades balanced its close ties with America with clandestine support for the Taliban. Osama bin Laden went into hiding in Pakistan after he was forced to flee Taliban protection. And the group’s leading council is still known as the “Quetta shura”, after the city in the Pakistani province of Balochistan where it was based. This reflects an obsession held by Pakistan’s army and security services with the necessity of a friendly Afghanistan to provide “strategic depth” should relations with India deteriorate disastrously. The prime minister, Imran Khan, did not hide his glee at events in Afghanistan, congratulating its people on having “broken the shackles of slavery”.
Less effusively, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, has said he “views positively” the messages the Taliban have been sending, and that Turkey is in dialogue with all sides. Even India, which has opposed the Taliban as strongly as Pakistan has backed them, is reported to have opened discreet talks with the group.
All of this suggests that it will be hard for America and its allies to prevent the Taliban from achieving diplomatic recognition. In a conversation with President Joe Biden on August 17th, Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, agreed to convene next week a virtual summit of the G7 group of rich countries (which Britain currently chairs) to discuss how to approach the new order. He has argued against “anybody bilaterally recognising the Taliban”. That, however, may be hard to stop.
But America and its allies still have ways to exert influence. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Biden administration, besides stopping shipments of cash that it had been sending to the ousted government, is also blocking the Taliban’s access to Afghan government accounts managed by the Federal Reserve and other banks, and is trying  to prevent them gaining access to foreign-exchange reserves held at the International Monetary Fund. 

Moreover, the Taliban insist they will soon announce what they call an “inclusive Islamic” government. On August 17th a spokesman said “hectic” talks were under way in Doha, Qatar, not just with Afghan parties, but with America’s special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad. If the Taliban keep that promise, and the government they unveil includes a variety of allegiances and ethnicities, it will make it hard to withhold recognition (especially in the unlikely event it includes women). It is not as if the West has an alternative government to back in exile, or a resistance force to turn to, like the Northern Alliance America mobilised against the Taliban in 2001.
But even if the new government does indeed look less forbidding than the group of Taliban fighters who took over the presidential palace in Kabul on August 15th, it will take a long time for them to convince other countries that they really have changed. And among the most sceptical will be those cheering their victory the loudest. China will worry about their links with disgruntled Uyghurs in its western region of Xinjiang. Russia, too, is concerned about Islamist unrest. Iran, run by Shia Muslims who scorn the Taliban’s Sunni fanaticism, fears a renewed influx of refugees and cheap heroin. Pakistan knows it has paid a very high price for its sponsorship of the Taliban in Islamist terrorism on its own soil by Afghan-linked groups.
The question haunting Afghanistan also troubles the outside world: how much have 20 years out of power changed the Taliban? They have shown they have learned some diplomatic and political finesse, and to tailor their message to the audience; and that they would prefer recognition to renewed isolation. But a change of style cannot disguise an unchanged ideology; nor a ruthless commitment to enforcing it.",2
1513,"EGYPTIANS SOMETIMES call their country umm ad-dunya, the “mother of the world”. Egypt has never lacked a distinct identity: the sons of the Nile are heirs to one of the world’s oldest civilisations. Theirs is the most populous Arab state, a bridge between the heartlands to the east and the Maghreb to the west.
It was only natural that Egypt would be central to the post-war Arab order. Gamal Abdel Nasser, its second post-revolutionary president, was the charismatic voice of Arab nationalism. The Muslim Brotherhood was born in Egypt, the Arab League based there and the fight against Israel led from there. It began to end there, when Nasser’s successor, Anwar Sadat, signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, a betrayal that played a part in his murder. But that decision, along with his efforts at economic liberalisation and pivot towards America, signalled an ideological shift away from the statist policies and Soviet leanings of the Nasser years.

Egypt ceded its central position during Hosni Mubarak’s dictatorship. He ruled for 30 years yet aspired to little beyond self-preservation. If he accomplished anything it was to unmake his predecessors’ order. The army state became a police state: though a former officer, Mr Mubarak relied on civilian agencies to secure his rule. The socialism of Nasser and the economic opening under Sadat gave way to unchecked crony capitalism. Corruption and an effort to create an inherited presidency led to his downfall.
Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi invites comparisons to his charismatic predecessor, another military man who led a coup and smashed the Brotherhood. But unlike Nasser, he is no ideologue. He has core beliefs—an abiding faith in the army and a mistrust of civilians. Yet he shows no interest in regional leadership. Instead he has a narrow sense of Egypt’s interests and his own priorities.
With 102m people Egypt can seem ungovernable. It has one of the fastest-growing populations in the world: the number of Egyptians has doubled since 1987, and despite efforts to lower the fertility rate (now 3.3 children per woman, down from over 5 in the 1980s) the UN expects the population to reach 160m by 2050. These people will be crammed into a country that, though quite large, is mostly uninhabitable. Some 95% of Egyptians live on 5% of its land. Efforts to build new cities in the desert have mostly failed.

The government trumpets strong GDP growth of 5.3% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2019. Even last year, when covid-19 ravaged the world, Egypt’s economy grew by 3.6%. Yet those rosy figures do not tell the full story. A burgeoning oil and gas sector contributes almost 24% of Egypt’s GDP, says Tarek al-Molla, the petroleum minister. This is good for the treasury, but does little to provide jobs for the unemployed who number 10% of the population and 26% of young people. The purchasing managers’ index, a measure of private-sector activity, has spent most of the past five years contracting. As many as 30% of Egyptians fell below the official poverty line of 857 pounds ($55) a month at the end of 2020.
Military in the market
Even more problematic is the army’s stranglehold on the economy. It is difficult to put a dollar figure on its empire, since its accounts are not subject to scrutiny. But to take one example, it has cornered the cement industry, flooding the market with so much extra supply that private producers have gone out of business. It operates the country’s biggest fertiliser plant and the region’s largest fish farm, both projects that Mr Sisi personally inaugurated.
He cuts the image of a man on the move, a leader scrambling to develop his country. One of his advisers suggests, rather patronisingly, that Egyptians since the time of the pharaohs have admired leaders who build big things. The biggest among those is the new capital rising in the deserts east of Cairo.
Egyptians often call Cairo Masr, the Arabic name for Egypt itself: country and capital are inseparable. One in four live in greater Cairo, an agglomeration that stretches more than 40km (25 miles) from its historic centre. A city that once felt timeless is changing at a dizzying pace. The emptying of Tahrir Square is but one example. On the drive from the airport one passes through Heliopolis, an affluent area that was one of the few leafy redoubts amid the concrete. No longer: workers have denuded more than 400,000 square metres of green space to make room for new roads.
Approaching the Nile on the 6th of October flyover, a notoriously congested road, a visitor sees a huge construction site. The so-called “Maspero triangle”, a wedge of land behind the foreign ministry, is being razed, its poor inhabitants dispersed to slums on the outskirts of Cairo to make room for a fancy mixed-use development in a sort of caricature of gentrification. Some of this frenzied building is helpful. New roads have eased the capital’s hellish traffic, even if Google maps cannot keep up. Yet some Egyptians see an ulterior motive: the urban landscape of Cairo is being reshaped to meet authoritarian goals. Shaded boulevards make a nice gathering spot for protesters, as do pedestrian-friendly squares. Most striking, of course, is the new capital, an effort to separate the government from its people.
Like many post-war Arab republics, Egypt’s military regimes enforce domestic security by throwing in more people. The state-security agency is thought to have had more than 100,000 employees, three times the size of America’s FBI, with a network of informants numbering millions. If you lived in Cairo during the Mubarak years, it was a safe bet that your doorman was on their payroll. Even with such a wide net, the regime could not be in all places at all times. The Sisi government is building a more modern autocracy. A law in 2018 required ride-sharing apps to share data with the government. A year later the government signed a contract with Honeywell of America to install 6,000 cameras across the new capital, linked to a “command centre” run by the army.
Egyptian officials express admiration for China’s ability to deliver growth and development while keeping the party in power. Mr Sisi has launched a programme called Itnayn Kifaya (Two is Enough), an echo of China’s recently abandoned policy. The picture is of a government aspiring to be like China’s, with a flurry of state-directed development and a tight hold on its population.
In his first years as president Mr Sisi seemed more interested in Africa, neglected under Mr Mubarak, than in the Arab world. Aides spoke of the economic opportunity south of the Sahara; in the Middle East they saw only headaches, most of which Egypt had no need for. Lately, though, Mr Sisi has become a fixture in Arab diplomacy. Saad Hariri, the ex-prime minister nominated as prime minister-designate in Lebanon last October, was a surprisingly frequent visitor to Cairo this year. Lebanon has been a regional battleground for decades: Syria, Iran, Israel and the Gulf states all vie for influence. Not Egypt, though, which largely sat out the Saudi-Iranian proxy struggle and has few interests in the Levant.
Egypt brokered the ceasefire that ended a brief war between Israel and Hamas in May. It has played a big part in the civil war in neighbouring Libya. In July Mr Sisi’s spy chiefs even held talks in Cairo with their Iranian counterparts, an unusual step for a country that has historically steered clear of Arab-Iranian disputes.
But Mr Sisi’s wider role is largely meant to safeguard a narrow set of Egyptian priorities. His interests in Libya and Gaza are obvious: they border Egypt and have long been a source of insecurity. Elsewhere he has an eye on the Gulf states. Egypt wants their support in its dispute with Ethiopia, which last year began to fill a massive new dam on the Nile. Seen from Cairo, this is a serious threat: a water-poor country with a fast-growing population cannot tolerate any reduction in its water supply. Acting as an interlocutor with Lebanon and Iran may give Mr Sisi some credit with the Gulf states that he can spend on more pressing issues.
Mr Sisi has been happy to break with his closest partners in the region. He largely refused to send troops to the Saudi-led war in Yemen in 2015—an understandable decision for a country that has already fought one ruinous war there, but a disappointment to the Gulf states that spent billions backing him after the coup. He also diverged early from the Arab consensus on Syria, allowing Mr Assad to reopen his embassy in Cairo in 2013 and later backing the Russian intervention that saved the embattled Syrian dictator.
Nasser was a gifted orator whose speeches still make the rounds on social media. He is remembered for strident remarks about colonialism and Israel; in one famous speech, he berates the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood for seeking to impose headscarves on Egyptian women. Today’s president browbeats his subjects to exercise more and work harder. Yet it is hard to imagine Egyptians a generation hence feeling nostalgic for Mr Sisi’s monotonous lectures. In a way, though, this makes him a fitting avatar for modern-day Arabism: a leader who aspires not to reshape the region, but merely to hold his own country together.■

1514,"NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Indian retailers demanded a government probe of the company after a Reuters investigation showed the e-commerce giant had copied products and rigged search results in India.
The Reuters report, reviewing thousands of internal Amazon documents, found that the U.S. company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in India, one of the company’s largest growth markets.
Wednesday's report showed that, at least in India, manipulating search results to favour Amazon’s products, as well as copying other sellers’ goods, were part of a formal strategy at Amazon – and that at least two senior executives had reviewed it.
The Reuters investigation drew bipartisan criticism of Amazon from U.S. lawmakers.
Linking to the story on Twitter and Facebook, Warren, a long-time critic of Amazon, said ""these documents show what we feared about Amazon’s monopoly power — that the company is willing and able to rig its platform to benefit its bottom line while stiffing small businesses and entrepreneurs.""
""This is one of the many reasons we need to break it up,"" she said.
Warren, a prominent Democrat, advocated the breakup of Amazon and other tech giants in 2019 when she was running for president. Since then, as a senator from Massachusetts, she has continued to apply pressure on companies like Amazon.
Ken Buck, a Republican on the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee, also shared the story on social media, saying, ""These documents prove Amazon engages in anticompetitive practices such as rigging search results and self-preferencing their own products over competitors.""
""More concerning, it contradicts what Jeff Bezos told Congress,"" the Colorado lawmaker said. ""Amazon and Bezos must be held accountable.""
Asked for comment on the reactions, Amazon issued a statement similar to one it provided for the Reuters investigation.
""These allegations are incorrect and unsubstantiated,"" it said. ""We display search results based on relevance to the customers, irrespective of whether such products are private brands offered by sellers or not.""
Amazon said it ""strictly prohibits the use or sharing of non-public, seller-specific data with sellers, including with sellers of private brands,"" and investigates reports of its employees acting contrary to that policy.
The company did not comment on the criticisms by U.S. lawmakers or Indian retailers.
INDIA RETAILERS, START-UPS CONCERNED
In sworn testimony before the subcommittee last year, Amazon founder Bezos said the company prohibits its employees from using data on individual sellers to help its private-label business. In 2019 another Amazon executive testified that the company does not use such data to create its own private-label products or alter its search results to favour them.
The Amazon documents reviewed by Reuters showed how the company's private-brands team in India secretly exploited internal data from its India unit to copy products sold by other companies, then offered them on its platform.
The company promoted sales of its private brands like AmazonBasics by rigging search results on its platform in India so that its products would appear, as one 2016 strategy report put it, “in the first 2 or three … search results.”
A group representing millions of India's brick-and-mortar retailers said on Thursday the country's government must launch an investigation into Amazon.
""Amazon is causing a great disadvantage to the small manufacturers. They are eating the cake that is not meant for them,"" Praveen Khandelwal of the Confederation of All India Traders told Reuters. The group says it represents 80 million retail stores in the country.
Indian retailers say foreign e-commerce businesses like Amazon and Walmart Inc's (WMT.N) Flipkart indulge in unfair business practices that hurt smaller firms, allegations the companies deny.
The Alliance of Digital India Foundation, a nonprofit representing some of India’s biggest startups, said the practices detailed in the Reuters report were ""highly deplorable"", calling into question ""the credibility of Amazon as a good faith operator in the Indian startup ecosystem"".
In a blog post, the group urged the Indian government to take action against “Amazon’s predatory playbook of copying, rigging and killing Indian brands”.
A top official in the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, urged consumers to shun the company on Thursday.
""I call upon people of this country to #boycottAmazon,” Ashwani Mahajan, co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, said on Twitter.",3
1515,"AGREE OR DISAGREE: “Homosexuals should be given corporal punishment.” That is one of the many odd questions posed in a civil-service exam taken by the 1,300 employees of Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in April. The formerly independent anti-graft agency is to be folded into the civil service, thus requiring its staff to pass an entrance test. Yet the exam was not the standard one taken by all hopefuls. Instead, it was written specially for the KPK, with input from the armed forces and intelligence and counter-terrorism agencies. It included questions about workers’ sex lives and their views on various minorities. Seventy-five employees failed, among them some of the commission’s best investigators. Two-thirds were sacked.
Indonesia is awash with corruption. Last year, it scored 37 out of 100 on a corruption index produced by Transparency International, a global watchdog, lower even than Brazil (38) or India (40). The KPK was set up in 2003 to tackle the scourge. Its investigations of company bosses, bureaucrats, politicians and senior police officers have resulted in the convictions of over 900 people, a clutch of cabinet ministers among them.

It was, perhaps, too effective. Since 2009, police have investigated and arrested top KPK officials, and lawmakers have repeatedly tried to curb its powers. In 2019 Parliament passed a law that stripped the commission of its independence and appointed a police general, himself dogged by allegations of corruption, to head the agency. The taming of the KPK will be complete next month, the deadline for integrating it into the civil service.
That President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, put his signature on the bill fatally weakening the KPK surprised many Indonesians. When he was first elected in 2014, he was hailed as a reformer who would protect civil liberties and promote better governance. Yet he has empowered a cabal of politicians, party bosses, bureaucrats and tycoons who have conspired to erode the democracy’s checks and balances. A year after he took office, Indonesia slipped from “free” to “partly free”, on a ranking compiled by Freedom House, a think-tank. By the start of his second term, in 2019, “Indonesia’s democracy had sunk to its lowest point since the end of the New Order,” the name of the authoritarian regime which made way for democracy in 1998, write Thomas Power and Eve Warburton, editors of “Democracy in Indonesia: From Stagnation to Regression”.
The president’s assaults on democracy are manifold. Under Jokowi, the state has stepped up efforts to suppress views it dislikes. In 2017 the government gave itself the power to disband civil-society organisations on national-security grounds. It deals harshly with protesters. Ordinary citizens who criticise the government online are threatened with criminal charges or imprisoned. The information ministry regularly blocks websites it finds objectionable, among them gay-dating services.
Jokowi has also eroded checks on executive privilege. He has appointed toadies to run the police, armed forces and the attorney-general’s office. He has tried to do away with political opposition by manipulating the boards of two rival parties to ensure loyalist factions are in control and by coercing opposition politicians, via threats of prosecution, into supporting his re-election. His enormous coalition encompasses three-quarters of parliamentarians.
At the same time, Jokowi has surrounded himself with generals and relies ever more on the armed forces to help execute domestic policy, such as in increasing rice production. He is fond of centralising authority, reclaiming some powers that were devolved to regional governments after the fall of Suharto, the strongman who ruled Indonesia for three decades until 1998.
On occasion the president does remind voters of the candidate they elected. He visits far-flung regions, home to most ethnic minorities, more often than his predecessors. In 2015 he ordered the closure of a corrupt subsidiary of the state petroleum company. Earlier this year he asked for a review of a draconian internet law.
Such moves keep the Jokowi hype-machine running. Yet they do nothing to deal with the rot deep within the state. The era of reform after Suharto retained many of the old authoritarian’s functionaries. That ensured stability at a delicate moment, but it meant that many officials steering the fledgling democracy were themselves not democrats. “Authoritarianism in Indonesia never truly went away,” notes Ben Bland, Jokowi’s biographer. Neither did corruption. Bureaucrats and politicians continue to treat the state as their own personal piggy bank. Oligarchs nurtured during the New Order clawed back their influence. Today they are the defining force in Indonesian politics, argues Vedi Hadiz of the University of Melbourne.
This was the system that Jokowi’s supporters thought he would dismantle. But the president has proved to be a pragmatist rather than an idealist, riding roughshod over democratic institutions and principles in order to secure the political support necessary to execute his economic agenda. “If you are swimming with the sharks and dancing with the wolves, you have to make friends with some of them,” says Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, a former minister. Enfeebling the KPK is one way to do that.
On the face of it, that would seem at odds with what Indonesians want. Some 82% of those surveyed in 2019 believed that democracy was the best system of government, while only 3% thought that authoritarianism was acceptable “under certain circumstances”. Participation in elections is high. Yet if one asks the average Indonesian why she likes democracy, she will not praise it as a vessel for liberal values, but as a system for delivering prosperity. Jokowi will take comfort in that.■",2
1516,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)Journalist Roger Parloff, who wrote the first major cover story on Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes and later issued a retraction, was called to testify in her criminal trial Thursday.The government has alleged Holmes used the media, and Parloff's Fortune Magazine story titled ""This CEO is Out for Blood"" in particular, to perpetuate a scheme to defraud investors.Parloff's testimony comes as the government has said it is close to resting its case against Holmes. She faces a dozen counts of federal fraud and conspiracy charges, and up to 20 years in prison over allegations that she knowingly misled doctors, patients and investors in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty.Parloff is set to return to the stand Friday for continued cross-examination. Thus far the defense has focused on Parloff's note taking and reporting process.Holmes was for a time upheld in the media as a rare female founder who'd raised significant sums of capital and driven her startup to an eye-popping $9 billion valuation. Parloff's story was the first of many laudatory cover stories of Holmes and has been shown repeatedly in the San Jose courtroom. Through Parloff's testimony, the government pieced together various layers of the alleged fraud that it has spent more than 10 weeks establishing before jurors through witness testimonies. Parloff testified he has interview notes, as well as 10 hours of audio recordings from interviews associated with his 2014 Fortune story, clips of which have been played for the jury. The recordings contrast how Holmes represented the company's capabilities with what jurors have heard from other witness testimonies. In one recording, Holmes explains that the company can do tests for 1,000 ""CPT"" or medical codes, despite its website stating 200 tests. Jurors have previously heard Theranos could only perform around a dozen tests using its proprietary technology, one of the numerous points prosecutor John Bostic sought to highlight through questioning Parloff about what Holmes told him in his interviews.Parloff said Holmes did not tell him about Theranos' reliance on third-party devices. When Parloff asked Holmes about use of venous draws instead of its finger stick method, Holmes is heard ticking off a list of reasons why it may conduct such a sample, but does not disclose, as Bostic elicited, it is because of the limitations of Theranos' devices.Parloff testified that Holmes told him that its tech had been used in Afghanistan, but that ""she did not want me to publish that."" While Parloff interviewed James Mattis, the former US Secretary of Defense and onetime Theranos board member, he testified Holmes told him the retired four-star general couldn't discuss deployment and not to ask him about it.During his reporting, Holmes sent Parloff the reports, affixed with Pfizer and Schering-Plough logos, purporting to validate its blood tests, which jurors have learned were not legitimate. Parloff testified that after the article's publication, Holmes ""praised it effusively,"" and said he believed she linked to it on Theranos' website. The article, which contained false and misleading statements, circulated to stakeholders and how it played a role in validating the company to outsiders.""This morning I had one of the most interesting meetings I can recall with the women [sic] profiled in the attached Fortune magazine article,"" read one email shown to jurors from the CEO of RDV Corp, the family office of the billionaire family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The email was sent to members of the DeVos family before they invested $100 million into Theranos.Investor Chris Lucas, whose firm Black Diamond Ventures invested more than $7 million across two funding rounds in 2006 and 2013, testified earlier this month that the piece made him ""proud of the situation. Proud that we are involved. Proud of Elizabeth."" ""Great article, great pictures, the whole thing,"" testified Lucas.In a column more than a year later titled ""How Theranos Misled Me,"" Parloff acknowledged that the article ""helped raise to prominence"" Holmes. (There is now an author's note at the top of his original article that links to the column and reads, ""On December 17, 2015, I published a protracted correction to this article here."")""As much as I'd like to say that Holmes lied to me, I don't think she did. I do believe I was misled — intentionally — but I was also culpable, in that I failed to probe certain exasperatingly opaque answers that I repeatedly received,"" wrote Parloff, who was formerly an attorney.The government said in a court filing that it will not seek to admit the follow-up column but ""reserves the right to introduce that article for a non-hearsay purpose should the defense open the door by questioning Parloff about statements he made in that article.""For weeks, attorneys have been wrangling over what Parloff can testify to, and what information he can be compelled to provide. While Parloff has turned over audio recordings and notes from his interviews with Holmes and former Theranos COO Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani as part of a grand jury subpoena order, he successfully fought a trial subpoena order by Holmes' defense team for notes and recordings from interviews he conducted with others for his story. (Balwani faces the same charges as Holmes; his criminal trial is slated to begin next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.)Holmes' attorneys argued those notes may serve to refute the claims that Holmes misled Parloff, and through him, investors. Judge Nathanael Cousins, who presided in a hearing on the matter, called the quest for Parloff's additional notes ""a fishing expedition as to whether there might be material out there that could be helpful to the defense.""Parloff's remorse over the story has been well-documented. ""Roger was first [to the story] and felt a tremendous amount of guilt,"" said Alex Gibney in 2019. Gibney is the prolific documentary filmmaker whose HBO film, ""The Inventor,"" chronicled the rise and fall of Theranos. Gibney, who has said his work started with interviewing journalists who felt duped, has called Parloff the ""beating heart"" of his film. (CNN and HBO share a parent company.)In addition to Parloff's article, a 2013 piece by a Wall Street Journal opinion writer, who has since passed away, has been frequently brought up in the courtroom. The government has alleged that, prior to its publication, Holmes approved the piece, which offered a glowing look at Holmes and Theranos, but also contained misleading claims about the company's capabilities at the time. The article corresponded with a broader unveiling of the startup after years of operating in stealth and was leveraged by Holmes as validation of the company.In a statement to CNN Business in September, Journal spokesperson Steve Severinghaus said, ""editors make publishing decisions based on their independent judgment.""The statement continued, ""Our writer asked Elizabeth Holmes to confirm complicated facts on a technical subject, not to approve publication. Our writer visited Theranos, spoke with numerous sources in and outside the company about its technology, and had his blood tested on a Theranos machine that appeared to offer credible results. If that was all a deception, then the responsibility lies with Ms. Holmes and Theranos.""",0
1517,"Disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her fraud trial on Friday after the judge denied her attorneys' request to toss all charges after the prosecution rested its case following 11 weeks of testimony by 29 witnesses.
Holmes, 37, addressed the allegation that she intentionally defrauded patients and investors by claiming the company's blood test technology could conduct a full range of tests when she supposedly knew it was inaccurate.
Holmes denied the allegation saying: 'We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all of the technologies in the laboratory.
'The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples….By 2009-2010 we had a breakthrough.' 
When asked about her public announcements about the number of tests Theranos could run and whether she was limiting her commentary to specific types of tests, she replied: 'No.' 
Before she took the stand, defense attorney Amy Mason Saharia motioned that all charges against Holmes be dismissed, alleging the case presented to the California jury 'is insufficient on every element on every count'.
U.S. District Judge Edward Davila said he would delay final judgment on the motion, the Marin Independent Journal reported. He did, however, dismiss one of the fraud counts against Holmes because of an error the prosecution made in its indictment.  
Holmes is accused of making false claims about Theranos, including that its technology could run a range of diagnostic tests more quickly and accurately than conventional laboratory testing with a drop of blood from a finger prick.During her testimony Friday, Holmes argued she believed in Theranos' technology.
Holmes told the jury about early efforts to raise capital, testifying that she had met with Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas, who ultimately invested in the company and became the chairman of its board.
'I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long term,' she said. 'He had a lot of questions.
Lucas 'began a very comprehensive diligence process,' including asking for Theranos' financial information, Holmes added.
Holmes also provided insight into her own background and the company's founding.
She described having been absorbed in lab research when she decided to leave Stanford University to start Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19, noting that her early team was focused on building components of the technology in question.
'We were prototyping,' she shared. 'I had the opportunity to hire some of the people I was working for and with at Stanford.' 
She also detailed how she financed the company when it was only a start-up.
'I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money they saved for me to go to college,' Holmes said. 'Then I went to go borrow money.'
She went on to raise more than $940million from private investors and eventually reached a valuation for Theranos of $9billion. 
Its fortunes waned after a series of articles published by the Wall Street Journal suggested the company's devices were flawed and inaccurate. 
Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy.
Over the course of her 11-week trial, jurors heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses for the prosecution, including patients and former Theranos investors whom prosecutors say Holmes deceived.  
The defense attempted to strike several of these testimonies, including one from a patient over the fact that her doctor didn't take the stand to explain her blood test results. 
After the prosecution rested its case, Holmes' attorneys immediately motioned to object to numerous parts of the government's case.
The defense pushed to exclude portions of a 'highly critical' report about the Theranos lab from the nation's lab regular, the Wall Street Journal reported.  
Her lawyers also requested to strike testimony from a patient who claimed her Theranos test results erroneously indicated she had HIV, alleging the patient was not qualified to interpret her blood test results.
The motion came after the prosecution challenged the relevance of presenting the jury with a list of Theranos patents - some of which list Holmes as an inventor.
'They're pieces of paper. They're not proof that the technology worked,' Assistant US Attorney Robert Leach said.  
Defense lawyer Katherine Trefz argued the patents would demonstrate Holmes' state of mind during the time of the alleged crimes and offer her understanding of the effectiveness of Theranos technology.  
'What's the state of mind? That she's smart?' Judge Edward Davila responded, noting that he wasn't blocking entering the patents altogether, but restricting some from later years. 
The defense also asked the court to strike all testimonies and exhibits from patients, doctors and customers.  
Holmes' attorneys also began presenting their case Friday by calling paralegal Trent Middleton to the stand to offer summaries of Theranos documents.
Middleton claimed he sorted through 'easily thousands of pages' of documents in an effort to present the jury with simple summaries and statistics of company data.
He reported that had 149 US patients issued to since 2007. He also showed a chart with customer receipts from 2011 to 2014 totaling $217.8million.
The defense is expected to reference Middleton's data with future witnesses.  
They have said they also plan to call Fabrizio Bonanni, who joined Theranos as a director in 2016. Bonanni will testify about the company's technology, they said in court. 
Defense attorney Lance Wade told jurors during opening arguments in September that Holmes was a hardworking young entrepreneur who had underestimated the obstacles Theranos faced before it failed.  ",-2
1518,"NEXT MONTH Amazon will turn 9,500 days old. But for Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder and chief executive, it is always “Day 1”. Amazon, he has insisted since its founding in 1994, must forever behave like a feisty startup: innovate aggressively and expand relentlessly.
Adherence to this rule has made Amazon as convenient to consumers as it is feared by businesses which stand in its way. Today roughly $11,000-worth of goods change hands on Amazon’s e-commerce platform every second. The company delivered 3.5bn packages last year, one for every two human beings on Earth. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing division, enables more than 100m people to make Zoom calls during the day and a similar number to watch Netflix at night. In all, Amazon generated $280bn in revenues last year.

This year Amazon has become not just convenient, but essential. The smiling brown package left at the threshold as the neon-vested delivery worker backs swiftly away has become the hallmark of the locked-down pandemic. Shopless and officeless life would be unimaginable without deliveries and cloud-based work—and insufferable without distractions like video-streaming. Investors see this as an acceleration of a long-term trend towards life online from which the world will not turn back. “The explosive demand created by covid-19 catapults Amazon straight into 2025,” says Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, a venture-capital firm.

Amazon’s market capitalisation doubled to $734bn between 2016 and 2018. Since then it has close to doubled again. Its shares trade at 118 times earnings, compared with 25-35 times for Apple and Microsoft, the other members of the trillion-dollar-company club. Up and down Wall Street, brokers tell clients to hold Amazon shares if they have them, or buy them if they don’t.
But Amazon is not without problems. Rivals have emerged in both e-commerce and the cloud. Questions are being raised about its treatment of workers and independent merchants on its platform. Politicians in many capitals would like to see it broken up. So would some investors, on the basis that they would see higher returns that way. “Day 2”, which Mr Bezos characterises as “Stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline”, has not yet dawned. But it is well past noon on Day 1.
Prime position
No firm bestrides the physical and digital worlds in the way Amazon does. In the physical world, it has a logistics system second to none. The 150m customers who subscribe to its Prime service get all their purchases delivered promptly—as well as perks like free streaming of videos and films—for a flat fee, with same-day delivery in some places. The convenience leads them to shop more. The logistics system is also used to fulfil orders for other companies. In 2018 “third-party” sales accounted for 58% of sales through the platform.
The scale of its retail operation gives Amazon an unparalleled collection of data on the desires and decision-making of hundreds of millions of shoppers—the sort of data that advertisers love. Amazon’s advertising revenues are now $11bn; its 7% share of the global online-ad market is larger than any save Google’s (38%) and Facebook’s (22%).
In the digital world Amazon dominates the cloud-computing business. In 2003 two engineers suggested that Amazon’s in-house IT infrastructure could be provided as a service to other companies, as space on its website and use of its logistics system were. That intrigued Andy Jassy, Mr Bezos’s technical adviser at the time. Today Mr Jassy is AWS’s chief executive. The division has established the company’s credentials as a developer of serious technology on a very large scale, rather than just a user of it. It also provides lots of cash. Last year AWS contributed $35bn to Amazon’s sales—and a fat $9.2bn in operating profits.

The AWS piggy bank has supported both expansion in retail—in 2017 Amazon paid $14bn for Whole Foods, an upscale supermarket chain—and new projects which the company’s engineers cook up at a prodigious rate. One of the whizziest is Project Kuiper, a satellite-broadband venture; another is Haven Healthcare, a not-for-profit aimed at reducing health-care costs, created with JPMorgan Chase, a bank, and Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate.
Amazon is still growing briskly, especially so for a set of multi-billion-dollar businesses. But growth is no longer accelerating in a day-one-ish way. Start with retail. Between 2016 and 2019 growth in global sales of goods, Amazon’s own and third parties’, on its websites slowed from an annual rate of 27% to 18%, calculates Sanford C. Bernstein, a broker. The effects of covid-19 might drive it back up to 23% for 2020 as a whole, but the long-term trend is not expected to change.
And the coronaviral sales boost has come at a cost. The company is hiring 175,000 new workers in America to cope with surging demand; it has invested heavily in covid-proofing its operations; and it has sacrificed earnings by prioritising the delivery of essential items, which tend to have lower margins, while barring many lucrative non-essentials from warehouses and removing ads for them to tamp down demand. Even as sales rose by 26% between January and March, profits fell by 29% compared with the previous year.
With its range narrowed and shipping slowed, Amazon could not keep up with soaring online demand (see chart 2). In America and elsewhere shoppers turned to rivals, often on a “click and collect” basis. According to data from Rakuten Intelligence, an independent subsidiary of a Japanese e-commerce firm, Amazon’s share of online spending in America was 34% in mid-April, down from 42% before covid-19. For years Amazon has led the way as an e-commerce pioneer, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein; now every big retailer will turn to the web as never before. Long-established retailers like Target and Walmart are already making hay.

Big resurgent rivals are not Amazon’s only competition. Shopify, a Canadian firm, offers retailers a way to sell online—and obsesses over the experience it provides to the companies which use it just as much as Amazon obsesses over its customers. It has gone from nowhere a few years ago to 5.9% of America’s online-retail market, second only to Amazon. It is now to become the back-end for Facebook Shops, the social networking giant’s new e-commerce venture. Taking a lead from Alibaba, China’s dominant online retailer, Facebook hopes to provide a setting where people will browse and socialise in a way that no one does on Amazon.
Amazon can no longer count on Prime to fuel prodigious growth at home; most American households that can afford the $120 fee are already members. Future retail growth will therefore depend on markets elsewhere. These currently account for 29% of the company’s total non-AWS revenues. In western Europe, Amazon is entrenched and has been doing well. But an ageing, economically sluggish continent is not exactly a long-term growth and profits motor. Many of the region’s consumers tend to browse online then buy offline. Meanwhile, things in emerging markets are not going to plan.
A year ago, after 15 years of trying, Amazon gave up on China. In 2012 it had managed to win an e-commerce market share of 7% there, but Alibaba and the other local success story, JD.com, squeezed it out, poaching customers with screaming deals and promotions. Had Amazon fought harder it might still have lost; it is possible, even likely, that the Communist Party would not long have tolerated a big American retail presence. But it does bear some blame: it failed to recruit talented locals, and made too many decisions in Seattle.
Failing to deliver
Elsewhere in the emerging world Amazon is still burning billions with no returns in sight. Its $6.5bn investment in India looks troubled. The nationalist government of Narendra Modi is making life hard for foreign firms—and easier for its local champion, Reliance Jio (in which Facebook is investing $5.7bn). In Latin America Amazon’s 3% share of online retail is barely one-fifth that of MercadoLibre, an Argentine firm better at dealing with bad roads, banditry and other local pitfalls. Because profits from western Europe are not enough to offset losses in the developing world, Amazon’s international division has been losing money for years.
Investors have mostly shrugged off Amazon’s global retail slowdown. The reason is simple—AWS. Its operating income usually adds up to well over half of Amazon’s total—in the most recent quarter it accounted for 77%. Bernstein estimates that Amazon’s retail business had an operating margin of -1% in 2019, and AWS 26%. But the cloud is getting crowded. Alibaba, Google and Microsoft have expanded their cloud offerings (though Alibaba Cloud still earns almost all its revenue in China). Globally, AWS’s share of cloud-computing declined from 53.7% to 47.8% between 2016 and 2018, according to Gartner, a research firm, while Microsoft’s nearly doubled to 15.5%. Revenue growth at AWS has slowed sharply, from 49% in the second quarter of 2018, year on year, to 33% in the first quarter of 2020 (see chart 3).

The AWS cloud is considered superior to the others in terms of reliability and speed. Azure experiences more service outages, for example. AWS also allows its customers to do more sophisticated things. But the rivals are good enough for most purposes, and improving. Large firms may prefer to deal with Microsoft because they have been dealing with it as a software provider for decades. George Gilbert of TechAlpha Partners, a consultancy, says that whereas AWS offers a wide range of platform services that suit the most technology-centric customers, Microsoft concentrates on integrating its servicesin order to make them accessible to mainstream customers.
AWS has the resources to defend its market-leading position. But in the cloud wars any handicap could cost it dearly. Its parent may be becoming one such drag. For years being part of Amazon was a huge advantage for AWS, says Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs, a bank. It needed cash from the rest of the group, as well as technology and data. But Mr Bezos’s habit of moving into new industries means that there are now ever more rivals leery of giving their data to it. Potential customers worry that buying services from AWS is tantamount to paying a land-grabber to invade your ranch. Walmart has told its tech suppliers to steer clear of AWS. Boards of firms in industries which Amazon may eye next have directed their IT departments “to avoid the use of AWS where possible”, according to Gartner.
This has fuelled talk that AWS might be better off pursuing its future as a separate company. In addition to putting a healthy distance between itself and the Amazon expansion machine, AWS would no longer need to cross-subsidise the firm’s less lucrative ventures. The transparency that would be offered into the financials of each business by a break-up would allow fund managers a better insight into how the new firms fulfil their investing criteria. In financial markets, a separation has been expected for the past year or so, according to the head of global internet banking at a leading financial institution.
Mr Jassy says that AWS was always designed to be separable from the rest of Amazon. If things get to the point where being inside Amazon is more disadvantage than advantage, says Mr Terry, AWS could go its own way.
Not that AWS gets nothing from being part of Amazon, however. Some data-driven technologies work better at scale. Data from Alexa, the virtual assistant Amazon makes available through its Echo smart speakers, helps feed Amazon’s voice-recognition algorithms, which can then be sold as a service to AWS customers, as well as back to shoppers. More shoppers and more data mean better algorithms, and so on. Yet such benefits could easily be set aside if AWS’s position inside Amazon continues to give powerful rivals such as Microsoft and Google a winning sales pitch.
Letting go of AWS would mark by far the most dramatic reorganisation in Amazon’s unremittingly accretive history. Analysts reckon the unit accounts for a third or more of Amazon’s value. A plausible valuation of $500bn would see it start out as one of America’s ten most valuable firms. And despite slowing growth it is still expanding twice as fast as the retail bit. If it grew at 20-30% a year for a decade—which is more slowly than in the past—while maintaining its margins, it could turn into the world’s biggest profit-generator.
The great migration
There is no historical precedent for a half-a-trillion-dollar firm growing that fast for that long. But the notion is not entirely outlandish. Less than 10% of the estimated $4trn in annual global IT spending has so far migrated to the cloud. Mr Jassy is not alone in arguing that “the overwhelming majority” of computing is going to end up there one day. A company focused entirely on making that happen could become vast.
How would Amazon fare without AWS? In some ways, the change might be salutary: some close to Amazon feel that it has grown too big. Elements of unproductive bureaucracy and politicking are creeping in, they report. A lot of high-level Amazon meetings these days are about lobbying for promotion rather than innovation or operational excellence, says a former executive. A slimmed-down and refocused company might be on a better footing.
It would, though, also be one with much less cash to back its further growth. As well as helping pay for the purchase of Whole Foods, AWS money has paid for international expansion and heavy investment in “last-mile” delivery, among other things. If the e-commerce rump were to inherit a hefty chunk of the company’s $59bn cash pile it might be able to keep spending—but not for long, at its recent rates. An Amazon without AWS “might not be one I would want to own”, says a representative of a big institutional shareholder in Amazon.

Mr Bezos’s views on a break-up are unknown (he declined to be interviewed for this article). He may believe that AWS and the rest of the group are symbiotic and would both suffer if separated. Even if he does not, though, it is a fair bet that he would be reluctant to let go of a cash-cow that enables Amazon to pursue new ventures. In time, the ad business might grow to fill that role. Last year it boasted an operating margin of 49%, and it is standing up to the current collapse of the advertising market better than its larger online rivals. But it is still small compared with AWS.
Whatever Mr Bezos’s views are, though, they will not be the final word that once they would have been. For a few years Seattle tech insiders have reckoned that Mr Bezos has been preparing to give up the top job to become executive chairman. He has already shed some of the management burden. In 2016, when Mr Jassy became chief executive of AWS, he named Jeff Wilke as “chief executive worldwide consumer”.
Though the pandemic has now brought Mr Bezos back into day-to-day involvement in the e-commerce operation, in recent years he has mostly confined himself to new projects such as Amazon Go, a till-less supermarket, and, earlier, Alexa. He has also been devoting a fifth of his working week to Blue Origin, his private rocket company, which is currently working on satellite launchers to compete with those of SpaceX and a Moon lander for NASA.
There is also the matter of his private life. In January last year Mr Bezos tweeted a bombshell: he and his wife, MacKenzie, were getting divorced. Days later the National Enquirer published details of an extramarital affair. The news shook the tight group of executives who run the company alongside him. Amazon’s meritocratic culture depends on “truth-seeking”, says a former senior executive. But it only works “if people at the top behave accordingly”, he adds. “Jeff’s episode put a dent in the company’s values.” Investors, for their part, fretted that Mr Bezos’s eventful personal life had become a distraction.
If Amazon fissions, Mr Jassy and Mr Wilke will be the obvious candidates to run the two firms—if, that is, one or other of them does not leave before then (they are both high on every recruiter’s wish list). Mr Bezos might stay on to oversee both companies as executive chairman. Amazon’s board will want to hang on to his magic touch for as long as possible, says a headhunter who knows the firm well.
But over time his influence may dwindle. He remains the company’s biggest shareholder—and thus the richest man in the world. His divorce settlement cut his economic stake from 16% to 12% (though he kept the voting rights of the portion he gave up). Still, every year he sells a slug of stock to fund Blue Origin, so in some years’ time he may come to own less than a tenth of his creation. Excluding the big three passive fund managers, the four largest institutional investors in Amazon already control 10% of the stock. And unlike many technology firms, Amazon has no dual-class shares that would let Mr Bezos control the board regardless of the size of his stake.
There might be other attractions to new leadership. While on Wall Street and in Seattle investors and insiders talk of one way of splitting up the company, in Washington, DC, they talk of another. A growing chorus of politicians, accompanied by an ensemble of antitrust experts, accuse Amazon of abusing the market power its size and reach provide.
Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator and scourge of big tech, has proposed sundering Amazon’s private-label business—which produces goods for sale on the site—from that of third-party sellers on its platform. The company would also have to sell Whole Foods and Zappos, an e-commerce rival it bought over a decade ago. Two Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, also speak of breaking up big tech, for different reasons. Donald Trump reserves especial spite for Mr Bezos on the basis that he owns the Washington Post, a newspaper critical of the president.
Soul-searching in Seattle
Anti-Amazon feeling grew stronger in April, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon employees used data on third-party sellers to pinch ideas for the private-label business. Amazon has launched an internal inquiry into the incident, which violated the company’s own guidelines. But lawmakers who had been investigating Amazon, Alphabet (Google’s parent), Facebook and Apple for antitrust violations, still threatened to subpoena Mr Bezos if he did not voluntarily appear at an upcoming hearing. (In June Amazon signalled it was ready to send Mr Bezos.) The European Commission is reportedly preparing to file formal antitrust charges against Amazon over its treatment of third-party sellers in the coming weeks.
In America Amazon’s market share is nearly two-fifths in e-commerce, but only 6% in all of retail. The firm’s low prices and high-quality service certainly do consumers no harm. But even Amazon insiders say accusations of stealing small firms’ ideas are becoming harder to brush off.
So are criticisms with respect to Amazon’s treatment of its workers, a large proportion of whom are African-American or Hispanic. During the pandemic a number of warehouse employees have been publicising safety shortcomings to activists and the media. According to a tally by an Amazon worker, there have been 1,079 coronavirus cases among American warehouse workers. Amazon has said that the firm’s rates of infection and quarantine are never higher than those of the communities in which its facilities are located, and sometimes lower. In May a group of 13 state attorneys-general asked Amazon to hand over data on covid-related infections and deaths at its warehouses.
In May a furore erupted after Amazon fired two tech employees who worked on user-experience design, after they organised a live-stream for warehouse workers to explain their pandemic safety fears. Democratic senators have demanded more information from Amazon on the dismissals. So have a handful of shareholders.
The incident prompted the resignation of Tim Bray, a respected senior vice-president at AWS (and co-inventor of XML, an internet data-description language). The sackings, and those of other activists at the firm, Mr Bray wrote, were evidence of a “vein of toxicity” running through Amazon’s culture. A leading engineer inside Amazon’s Grand Challenge team, a secretive skunk-works unit working on ambitious projects, says morale is rock-bottom. He plans to leave.
The risk of Amazon’s labour practices inviting more regulatory scrutiny—and, possibly worse, alienating brainboxes—is not lost on investors. The firm needs to be “very, very careful”, says the institutional shareholder’s representative. Amazon raised workers’ wages by $2 an hour from mid-March until June 1st and allowed warehouse employees worried about infection to go on unpaid leave without the risk of being sacked. It made 150 changes to the way its warehouses function to ensure social distancing and more cleaning.
Still, says the shareholder rep, rather than leading by example on labour Amazon “seems to be playing catch-up”. Mr Bezos, who has added $54bn to his net worth thanks to his company’s buoyant share price while low-paid warehouse workers toil through the pandemic, “needs to lean over backwards to make sure workers are properly treated”, cautions a leading Silicon Valley venture capitalist.
The antitrust cudgel may in fact be an attempt to force Amazon to spruce up its labour track record. How far regulators are willing to go will depend on the public mood. Americans’ reliance on the company and the goodwill it has generated with consumers may help it, says an antitrust expert close to Congress. An AWS spin-off, if it occurred, might obviate the need for drastic antitrust action.
Mr Bezos has managed to keep Amazon from ageing beyond Day 1 for longer than most companies can dream of. But not even the best magician can stop the passage of time. One day, Day 2 will come. ■",2
1519,"THE CALL from China came in the early morning. Desmond Shum, a former tycoon now living in the West, heard the voice of his ex-wife, Duan Weihong, for the first time in four years. Ms Duan vanished in Beijing in September 2017, shortly after Communist Party anti-corruption investigators came for a patron of hers, a young member of the Politburo once seen as a successor to the supreme leader, President Xi Jinping.
The call from Ms Duan, who also used the English name Whitney, was followed quickly by a second. Both contained a warning. She urged her ex-husband to halt the publication, on September 7th, of a book he has written about their joint career as entrepreneurs in the 1990s and 2000s. That was a gilded age of breakneck growth and influence-peddling that, Mr Shum alleges, vastly enriched both the couple and their business partners, including family members of senior leaders within the Communist Party. “No good comes to those who oppose the state,” Ms Duan told her ex-husband, saying that she was on a provisional form of release but faced renewed detention at any time. She begged him to consider the welfare of their 12-year-old son, who lives with Mr Shum.

He published anyway. “I don’t know whether I was talking to her, or to her handlers,” Mr Shum says in a telephone interview. “She told me herself that she has had no contact with the outside world for the past four years.” Weighing this attempt at intimidation, he is unsure whether the party knew what was in his book, or simply feared “who I am and what I know”.
The machine was right to be worried. Large scandals of the recent past are revisited in “Red Roulette: An Insider’s Story of Wealth, Power, Corruption and Vengeance in Today’s China”, including allegations that the family of Wen Jiabao, then the prime minister, amassed vast fortunes by facilitating business deals and taking stakes in state-owned firms on strikingly generous terms. Some of those deals were brokered by Mr Shum and his ex-wife, though he denies law-breaking. Small, grubby details of elite life in the book are just as revealing, for they challenge one of the party’s main claims to legitimacy, namely that its monopoly on power helps to explain China’s modern-day rise.
In the party’s telling, its autocracy is a merit-based system run by technocrats who are free to take the long view and act for the common good, rather than worrying about the next election. Mr Shum describes the reality. To build a new airport cargo terminal, he spent three years collecting 150 official seals from sundry agencies and ministries, many of them locked in paralysing competition with one another. That quest involved, at various points, arranging heart-bypass surgery for a local official who collapsed during a junket to Las Vegas and California, and building airport-customs officers a new complex, complete with tennis courts and a 200-seat theatre.
Mr Shum names the hotel in Beijing where, on any given night, three or four government ministers were hosted by entrepreneurs eager to buy their favour, in a labyrinth of private dining rooms designed to keep different groups from spotting each other. His book turns a jaundiced, insider’s eye on claims that, in the absence of a free press, independent judiciary and other checks and balances, officials are held to account by internal targets. Explaining the purging of a big airports boss, Mr Shum concedes that the official’s gambling habit made him vulnerable, but insists that his cardinal error was to exceed revenue targets by such a margin that rival bureaucrats craved his job.
In some aspects, Mr Shum’s book supports Mr Xi’s diagnosis of China’s ills. It describes sleaze that largely predates Mr Xi’s elevation as party chief in 2012. Since then, the Xi era has witnessed an anti-corruption drive that has seen more than 1.5m officials punished. Mr Xi himself grumbles about foot-dragging officials who put parochial interests first.
Still, leaders have grounds to dislike the book. It argues that Mr Xi’s anti-corruption drive is as much a campaign to consolidate power as a sincere attempt to reform a rotten system. The campaign has spared some notoriously corrupt princelings, the children or grandchildren of high officials. A self-made man, Mr Shum calls red aristocrats a “separate species”, reared in high-walled compounds, sent to special schools and fattened on food supplies reserved for senior leaders.
They even enjoy special forms of corruption, he notes. Rather than hustle to build real businesses, he describes princelings seeking lucrative monopoly contracts from the state. Most damningly, he charges that the well-born are shielded during anti-corruption probes, in part because they know to obey what he calls the party’s Mafia-like code of silence. He asserts that Li Peiying, the airports boss, was executed after talking too much about high-level corruption, while in the same year a party elder’s son was only jailed for taking larger bribes. “Red aristocrats got a prison sentence; commoners got a bullet in the head,” he writes.
Now you’ve crossed the line
With that charge, the book challenges a second form of legitimacy that is dear to Mr Xi, himself the son of a high-ranking official. Mr Xi asks the masses to have faith in the party, not just because China is more prosperous, but because it carries “red genes” inherited from revolutionary pioneers and martyrs, and has always put the people first. In a speech on July 1st Mr Xi declared: “The party has no special interests of its own—it has never represented any individual interest group, power group, or privileged stratum.”
“Red Roulette” undercuts that claim. It describes red aristocrats demanding 30% stakes in business deals merely for being seen to be supportive. It details an elite China built on secrets and fear, in which family ties are one of the only reliable bonds of trust. Mr Xi would have people believe that corruption is an external infection. Insiders know that it is in the party’s blood. ■",2
1520,"NOBODY LIKES a call from the taxman. Donald Rumsfeld, who as America’s defence secretary oversaw a budget bigger than the economy of a typical country, nonetheless finds the rules so confusing that he writes to the Internal Revenue Service each year complaining that he has “no idea” whether he has filed his taxes correctly. So it is hardly surprising that, when the phone rings and an official-sounding voice says you have underpaid your taxes and will be connected to an adviser to pay the balance, ordinary folk tremble.
It is, however, invariably a scam. Few tax authorities call individuals about their taxes. If you are lucky, they will send you a letter a year later, to the wrong address. They will certainly not menace you, as bogus calls often do, with the threat of arrest if you do not stump up the cash right now.

Such scams have become vastly more common. Phone calls from tricksters claiming to be taxmen almost doubled in number last year, according to UK Finance, a trade association of banks. Other countries show increases at least as dramatic.
Even as rates of most crimes remain low in rich countries, the spectacular growth of cyber-crime—crime committed mostly or entirely by digital means—stands out. According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, the best indicator of long-term trends in Britain, in 2019 there were 3.8m incidents of fraud, mostly online, representing a third of all crimes committed. That figure has increased every year since 2017 when the government started collecting data. Around 7% of all adults were victims. Three-quarters lost money, and 15% lost more than £1,000 ($1,390). In America the number of reported cases of internet fraud increased by 69% last year. Reported losses there (excluding bank or credit-card fraud) reached $4.2bn, three times higher than in 2017.
Other kinds of internet-enabled crime are growing too. Computer-enabled spam phone calls and text messages, typically trying to defraud people, extract billions of dollars a year. Illegal gambling websites, many of which steal from their customers, have multiplied. And new technology makes many old-fashioned crimes easier to perpetrate. Drug-dealers use Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, to take payments and move money around. They rely on specialised criminal encrypted-communications software to organise their affairs. “There is no serious organised crime that does not have a digital component,” says Nigel Leary of Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA).
Most significant over the past year is the growth in “ransomware”—hacking attacks where victims’ files are locked up until money is paid. Such attacks were once crude. Ransomware arrived in spam emails and targeted ordinary people’s computers. The sums demanded were often small, to encourage people to pay up.
These days hackers focus on large organisations and demand big ransoms (see chart). Malicious software is injected into specific computer systems. It steals data before locking them. A ransom is then demanded to unlock the files or, increasingly, to prevent them from being leaked (backups of important data are common now). It is almost always in Bitcoin. Chainalysis, a cyber-security firm, says the amount paid in Bitcoin ransoms increased by 311% last year compared with 2019, to around $350m. Victims are usually businesses but more and more include governments and their departments, including the police. On April 27th Washington DC’s coppers revealed that they had been hit by hackers, who say they will expose police informants to gangs if the authorities do not pay up.

Ransomware is “the single biggest threat” in the organised-crime world, says Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Sussex who advises Europol, the EU’s police agency. On April 29th Alejandro Mayorkas, America’s secretary of homeland security, described it as “a threat to national security”. The damage is enormous. Maersk, a global shipping company, wrote down $300m in losses related to a ransomware attack in 2017. Travelex, a British currency trader, collapsed last year, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. An attack that took its systems down at the end of 2019 was partly to blame. Despite coughing up 285 Bitcoin—then worth around $2.3m—the firm lost about £25m that quarter. It attributed most of that to the attack.
Ransoms can be eye-watering: an attack in March on the Broward County school system, which includes Fort Lauderdale in Florida, came with a demand for $40m in Bitcoin. In messages leaked by the hackers, one of the district’s negotiators was incredulous: “You cannot possibly think we have anything close to this.”
Most government bodies do not. But the consequences of not paying can be just as costly. In Baltimore County, in Maryland, schools had to stop online teaching last year for several days after their systems were locked by a ransomware attack. In 2019 an attack on the neighbouring City of Baltimore cost its taxpayers $18m. During the pandemic, hospitals have been hit, too. France reported 27 attacks on hospitals last year, as part of a 255% increase in ransomware attacks generally. Medical treatments have been delayed in Germany and America because of attacks.
Bitcoin buccaneers
The criminals who do it are a mixed bunch. Many seem to be based in Russia, other parts of eastern Europe, or China. In Russia and Belarus, cyber-criminals thrive because the state tolerates them, as long as they scam only foreigners. Some reportedly have links to the security services.
But cyber-criminals do not seem to operate in tightly organised crime groups, like drug cartels or mafias. Their strength comes from their decentralisation. Individual elements of each crime are provided as a service to organisers. One lot may write and sell the software. Others may get it into targets’ computers. Others may collect and launder the ransom. And a few kingpins may finance the entire operation. And yet they may never know each other’s names or locations.
Crimes such as bank robbery used to be artisanal, says the NCA’s Mr Leary. Big jobs like the Brink’s-Mat robbery of 1983, when gold, diamonds and cash worth £26m (£100m in today’s money) were stolen from a warehouse at Heathrow airport in London, required a large specialist staff who all knew and trusted one another. These days large-scale crime is being industrialised by technology. “The barriers to entry are really very low,” says Mr Leary.
That is largely because an entire internet infrastructure has developed to facilitate attacks. Cryptocurrency is key. Ransomware criminals like to use Bitcoin, says Kemba Walden, a lawyer with Microsoft’s digital-crimes unit because it is very liquid and relatively anonymous. The end recipient is anonymous unless his real-world identity can be connected to his virtual address. Criminals can trade Bitcoin between themselves. Cashing out their earnings into real money is risky; in most rich countries Bitcoin exchanges apply strict “know your customer” requirements. But it is not impossible. Some exchanges in less-regulated countries apply looser criteria. And coins can be “tumbled”—swapped between cryptocurrencies by money-launderers—to conceal their origins, and then sold on well-regulated exchanges. In Russia and China “it’s just incredibly difficult” to trace stolen money, says Ms Walden.
Other technological innovations are vital, too. SIMboxes, which allow people to “spoof” (conceal the origin of) phone calls, are sold for legitimate purposes, to marketing firms, for example. But they also allow criminals to spam people or communicate without revealing their location. TOR, softwarewhich anonymises internet connections by bouncing data around the world, lets the “dark web” thrive, hosting the forums on which criminals anonymously trade their wares. “Bulletproof hosting”—server farms with a high level of security and privacy—operate like virtual safe houses, where compromising data can be moved off at a moment’s notice, invariably before the police are able to get to it.

What is the future of such crime? As ransomware has grown, so has the industry promising to protect firms from it. The crime is “becoming more high-profile”, says Michael Levi of Cardiff University, because of attacks such as the one on Maersk. Organisations are trying to buttress their defences. But many do not want to report hacking attempts or fraud. Data breaches are not only damaging in themselves; they are embarrassing, too. Individuals rarely think to report cyber-crimes to the police. The costs may be borne indirectly. Banks and insurers will often compensate people for losses. Security is improving but the crimes are increasingly profitable.
The police fret that more traditional criminals are moving into cyber-crime, and vice versa. “Now the dark web is used for the commodity trade [fencing of stolen goods], the drugs trade and firearms,” says Mr Leary. In raids in Belgium in March police seized 28 tonnes of cocaine, as well as cash, guns, police uniforms and a torture chamber in a shipping container. The criminals had reportedly been using Sky ECC, an encrypted phone network sold by a Canadian firm. The phones were seemingly designed to hide criminal activity, with end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages and no GPS data. Subscriptions were paid in Bitcoin. That gave them a great deal of anonymity—at least until European police forces managed to inject their own malware into the phones to spy on them.
Governments are starting to take cyber-crime more seriously. America’s Justice Department has appointed a team to tackle ransomware. The “five eyes” allies—America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand—are sharing intelligence on it. But there is a long way to go. In Britain only one in 200 police officers focuses on fraud, despite its outsized footprint, according to figures revealed through the Freedom of Information Act by the Times newspaper.
And the opportunities are growing. In the past six months the value of the world’s Bitcoin has soared to over $1trn. That surge of liquidity makes it even easier to hide crime. And as Mr Woodward puts it: “Why would you walk into a bank with a sawn-off shotgun to steal £30,000 when, if you’ve got some money to invest, you can go on the dark web and start a ransomware campaign and make millions?” ■

1522,"Western Europe is no longer the continent's capital for excess deaths, official data shows with Eastern European countries now taking up that mantle.
While countries like the UK, Spain, Italy and Belgium bore the brunt of fatalities early in the pandemic, the crisis has slowly shifted East, to nations like Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.
A major analysis by the Office for National Statistics looked at excess deaths — the number of fatalities from all causes above the five-year average — on the continent from the start of Covid to mid-2021.
It found that nearly every corner of Europe has suffered well above average excess deaths at some point, either due to coronavirus itself or the knock-on effects of lockdowns.  
There are a few exceptions, namely the Scandinavian nations which have kept case rates and excess deaths low, excluding anti-lockdown Sweden. 
In the UK, 120,000 more people have died than usual so far during the pandemic with a significant spike in non-Covid deaths in people's homes. It has been referred to by experts as a 'silent crisis'. 
The ONS' interactive map shows trends in excess deaths have followed the trajectory of Covid waves. Western countries were hit hardest early in the pandemic because of their close proximity to Italy, the continent's original epicentre. Most of these were Covid, even if a lack of testing in the early days did not pick up on all of them.
But there has been a shift in the first half of 2021 after wealthy EU members stocked up on vaccine supplies and squashed Covid death rates.
It is no coincidence that Eastern European nations — where uptake of the jabs remain low — made up seven of the 10 countries with the highest excess death rates by June this year. 
By the week ending June 18, Poland had the highest rates of excess deaths with 23 per cent more than the five-year average, followed by Bulgaria (21 per cent) and the Czech Republic (20 per cent).
Rounding out the worst five are Slovakia (17 per cent) and Romania (14 per cent), followed by Slovenia and Hungary (both 10 per cent). 
By contrast, the highest in Western Europe was England (7 per cent), Spain (6.5 per cent), Scotland (5 per cent), and Wales (4 per cent). The UK's rate as a whole was 6.7 per cent above average in June.
By the middle of summer 2021, eight countries in Europe had below average excess mortality — Denmark, Cyprus, Finland, Iceland, Malta, Norway, Luxembourg, and Sweden. Norway had the lowest at minus 12 per cent. 
Eastern European countries lag behind many in the West when it comes to vaccinations, which is contributing to Covid deaths and therefore excess mortality.
Just 25 per cent of Bulgarians have been fully vaccinated against Covid, figures show, compared to around 65 per cent in the UK, France and Germany. 
Romania is doing slightly better with just over 35 per cent of the population jabbed, while Slovakia has jabbed more than 40 per cent.  Uptake is above 50 per cent in Poland and the Czech Republic.
The ONS found that, in the UK, some local authorities had up to triple the number of deaths from all causes compared to average on some weeks. 
Enfield and Tower Hamlets, both boroughs in London, suffered 226 per cent and 214 per cent more deaths than usual in weeks in January, at the peak of the second Covid wave. 
Meanwhile, the ONS found that almost all countries had higher excess mortality in 2020 than in 2021, except for Portugal, Estonia and Hungary.
This is because less people are dying from Covid on the continent now that there are high levels of immunity thanks to vaccines and natural protection from previous waves.  
However, in recent weeks there has been a fresh wave of Covid infections on the continent that has sent nations back into draconian restrictions and could see excess deaths start to rise again. 
Italy is considering a lockdown of the unvaccinated, it emerged yesterday, which would make it the second country to impose the controversial intervention after Austria. 
And Germany's incoming government has said that it wants unvaccinated people to be barred from going to work and travelling on public transport amid what Angela Merkel calls 'dramatic' infection levels. The Netherlands has also introduced a 7pm curfew for pubs and restaurants amid rising cases there.
Starting tomorrow in Ireland, all hospitality businesses including nightclubs and pubs will be forced to close at midnight, the use of Covid passports will be expanded, and people will be advised to work from home where possible.
The British Government has repeatedly rejected pleas to implement its Plan B, which would see similar measures to what are being levied on Ireland. But Boris Johnson has admitted a full-blown lockdown could still be on the cards if cases spike.
The UK is in a slightly different position from many of its European neighbours in that it was the first country on the continent to come out of lockdown and drop all restrictions over summer. The move is believed to have frontloaded cases in the autumn, which scientists believe should avert a major peak in winter.   
More than 60,000 extra deaths have occurred in private homes since the start of the Covid pandemic, official data shows as experts call for an investigation into the trend.
An Office of National Statistics (ONS) report published last week found that there have been 252,486 deaths in private homes between January 2020 and June 2021.
The number of deaths at home in the England and Wales has steadily risen since 2005, with thousands more people choosing to die in the comfort of their home rather than a hospital bed. But the proportion leapt nearly 30 per cent in 2020 compared to the year before, as Britons were told to 'stay home, protect the NHS, save lives' when Covid struck. 
The ONS data shows there were about 41,000 more at-home deaths from all reasons in 2020 compared to 2019, with the number of people dying at home peaking in May. 
However, figures for 2021, which go up to June, show there were nearly 25,000 more deaths at home than the five-year-average for this period, casting doubt over lockdown being the sole reason for the rise.
While Britain was still in its third lockdown at the start of 2021, the Government toned down its 'stay home' messaging and the NHS was told to continue treating non-Covid patients. 
There has been serious debate over the merit of the lockdowns and if they did more harm than good for the nation's health with it leading to people avoiding seeking medical help out of fear of the virus and disrupted tests and scans for illnesses such as cancer. 
Experts have called for further and more detailed research to determine if people are choosing to die at home, or if they being left to suffer by a system unable to to provide them quality care of their final days. 
The biggest at-home killer was heart disease, killing more than 25,000 people in 2020 alone. Covid has only played a comparatively minor role in deaths at home, killing around 3,000.",-2
1523,"ON THE KAMPALA skyline workers can watch their savings climb into the air. Pension Towers, an office complex financed by the state-run provident fund, will be one of Uganda’s tallest buildings. Work began in 2008 and has been marred by fatal accidents, corruption allegations and budget overruns. The skyscraper illustrates the growing size of African pension pots—and the challenge of investing that money usefully.
This is a strange problem to have. The African Development Bank reckons that the continent needs $130bn-170bn of infrastructure spending a year to bring roads, water, power and internet to its people. Businesses are crying out for capital. What little they get often comes from foreigners, who are quick to pack their bags when things get tough. There is no such risk with local pension funds, which collectively manage around $350bn of assets in sub-Saharan Africa, according to RisCura, an investment firm. And yet many local funds say they struggle to find places to invest.

Pension funds have grown impressively in recent decades, for diverse reasons. In South Africa the government pumped cash into the civil service pension scheme to allay members’ worries about losing benefits at the end of apartheid. Its successor, the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF), is the largest in Africa, with assets of about $110bn. In Nigeria a mandatory pension system was introduced in 2004, and funds’ combined assets have grown nine-fold over the past 15 years, to $31bn.
Pension schemes typically cover only the small fraction of Africans who have formal jobs. But they can still be big fish in small ponds. In Namibia, for example, the value of retirement fund assets is larger than the country’s annual GDP.

What to do with all that money? Consider the choices laid out by Richard Byarugaba, the managing director of Uganda’s National Social Security Fund. It already owns a third of the shares traded freely on the local stock exchange, where only 16 companies are listed. An alternative is property, like the ill-fated Pension Towers, but building things is much more complicated than just “pumping concrete in”, he notes. So 78% of the fund’s investment is in bonds and the like, mostly government debt (see chart). In Africa, unlike in rich regions, that yields high returns.
This reliance on government securities is typical of fund managers almost everywhere except South Africa, which has uniquely deep capital markets. The Public Investment Corporation, which manages the assets of the GEPF, puts 41% of its investment into listed equities, as well as 7% into an unlisted portfolio that has drawn scrutiny for alleged improprieties. Pension pots in Botswana and Namibia also invest an unusual amount in equities, often abroad. The Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund could buy up the entire national debt and still have money to spare. Moemedi Malindah, its chief executive, says it would like to invest more locally, but options are limited: it had so much trouble finding private-equity managers that it had to run a programme to create them.
Talk of diversifying into alternative assets runs ahead of reality. In Nigeria, for example, pension funds put just 0.5% of their assets into infrastructure. That is partly because fund managers find it hard to assess the prospects of greenfield projects with unproven cash flows, says Wale Okunrinboye of Sigma Pensions, one of the largest funds in the country. It is a similar story when fund managers look at private equity. “Some of them want to dip their toes in the water but they’re just scared,” says Abi Mustapha-Maduakor, the chief executive of the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, an industry body.
There are efforts to change that. In Kenya more than 20 pension funds have formed a consortium to invest in infrastructure, pooling their capacity to spot duds. Governments and foreign donors are thinking of ways to take on some of the risk by issuing guarantees.
The long-term investment horizons of pension funds dovetail with the need for “patient capital” to build a continent. Yet the first job of a pension-fund manager is to protect the savings of future pensioners. The kind of public-private partnerships they might invest in have had mixed outcomes in Africa. Until there is a track record of success, most will continue simply to lend to governments and let the politicians build the roads instead. ■

1526,"A federal judge has blamed the former president for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot, saying that Donald Trump 'created the conditions' for the unrest with his 'lies.'
Judge Amit Mehta, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, indirectly invoked the president's name Friday when sentencing John Lolos to 14 days in jail for his role in the deadly demonstration.
'The fact remains that he and others were called to Washington, DC, by an elected official, prompted to walk to the Capitol by an elected official,' Mehta said.
'People like Mr. Lolos were told lies, were told falsehoods, were told the election was stolen when it was not,' Mehta added, calling Lolos a 'pawn,' according to CNN.  
Mehta appears to be the first judge to hold Trump responsible in a Capitol riot case. 
Judge Mehta, 50, was born in India and attended Georgetown University and the University of Virginia Law School. He was appointed by former President Barack Obama in July 2014 and confirmed by the US Senate via voice vote in December. 
'Once you hear people who should know better tell you that an election was stolen and they say it loudly enough, frequently enough, it's not surprising that people will believe it,' the judge said, according to Politico.
Nearly 700 people have been charged in the riot, Insider reports, and 40 have been sentenced. 
Lolos was sentenced to 14 days in jail and was ordered to pay $500 in restitution.
Prosecutors say that Lolo was seen in a video leaving the Capitol doorway waving a red 'Trump 2020 Keep America Great' flag hooked together with the United States flag, yelling, 'We did it, yeah!' after an unknown individual yelled, 'We stopped the vote!'
He was arrested after a DC airport officer saw a video of Lolos at the riot on his Instagram feed and noticed him at the airport wearing the same shirt.
At the time, Lolos was waiting for another flight out of DC because he was kicked off the first one after 'continuously yelling ""Trump 2020!""' while the plane was on the tarmac, according to Lolo's charging document.
On Wednesday, a judge sentenced Jacob Chansley, also known as the 'QAnon Shaman,' to nearly three-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the riot, with credit for the 10 months he's already served.
'I admit to the world, I was wrong. I have no excuses. My behavior was indefensible,' he said.
Chansley insisted that he is not a violent man, a domestic terrorist or a 'white supremacist.'
As part of an impassioned 30-minute speech to the court, Chansley quoted Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Jesus, and the prison break film The Shawshank Redemption.
January 6 rioters were hoping to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results in favor of President Joe Biden after President Trump repeatedly said the election had been stolen from him, a claim he continues to make today.
Earlier that day, Trump had given a speech in which he told his supporters, 'If you don’t fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'
The riot resulted in the deaths of five people, including Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer trying to stop a crowd from breaking into the building. 
'Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos who were told those lies took it to heart. And they are the ones paying the consequences,' Judge Mehta said. 
'Those who created the conditions that lead to Mr. Lolos' conduct have in no meaningful measure been held accountable.'
He told Lolos: 'You were a pawn. You were a pawn in the game played by people who know better.'
Various reports of Friday's hearing describe Lolos as 'rambling' or going into an 'extended rant.'
As his defense attorney tried to stop him from talking, he continued to cite debunked election fraud claims, claimed the evidence against him was tainted, and encouraged people listening in on the hearing to look up a video of him online, according to CNN. 
'I may have failed to explain why incarceration is necessary here, but I think Mr. Lolos just summed it up,' prosecutors said.",-2
1527,"IT IS NOT exactly the Cuban missile crisis. In early June, a pair of warships rounded the Cape of Good Hope and became the first Iranian naval vessels ever to enter the Atlantic without port stops. The IRINS Makran, inching along at the speed one would expect of a former oil tanker, is thought to be carrying fast attack craft—small, agile missile-toting warships—bound for Venezuela. The United States has warned that any arms delivery would be a “provocative act and a threat to our partners in this hemisphere”, meriting “appropriate measures”.
Iran and Venezuela are united in hostility to the United States, which has imposed tough sanctions on the former for its nuclear programme and on the latter for its repression at home. Last year Iran sent equipment and experts to help Venezuela revive its ailing oil refineries, plus fuel and food to stock an Iranian supermarket, in return for Venezuelan gold.

Since the expiration of a UN arms embargo in October, Iran has also been free to sell weapons to anyone it fancies. Venezuela is a happy customer. In December the head of the US Southern Command pointed to “growing Iranian influence” and claimed that Iran had sent its Quds Force, an elite expeditionary unit, to support the regime of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator. American officials told Politico, a website, that the deal for weapons was signed last year. Fast attack boats would be a welcome addition to the Bolivarian Navy, which has not covered itself in glory. Last year it lost a patrol boat after ramming a cruise liner in the Caribbean.
The United States has few good options for halting the Makran and its accompanying frigate. In October Donald Trump’s administration threatened simply to “eliminate” any long-range missiles sent to Venezuela by Iran (there was no sign that Iran intended to send any). Joe Biden’s administration has stopped short of such threats. A year ago, the American State Department threatened sanctions against Greek-owned tankers to foil a delivery of Iranian fuel to Venezuela. But warships have “practically absolute sovereign immunity”, says Cornell Overfield of CNA, a think-tank, meaning that the United States cannot lawfully seize or attack them. That principle, in force from around 1812, was reaffirmed when international courts blocked America’s attempt to impound an Argentine warship at a port in Ghana in 2012.
In the middle of a heated presidential campaign, Iran is currently negotiating America’s return to the multinational nuclear deal abandoned by Mr Trump. It is therefore eager to project defiance. But Mr Maduro may have less stomach for confrontation. Eager to ease pressure on his regime, he recently let the UN’s World Food Programme resume operations in Venezuela and freed six former employees of an American oil company. There is still time for a change of heart. Some Venezuelans speculate that Iran’s shipment is timed to arrive by June 24th, the 200th anniversary of a famous battle against Spain, traditionally the national day of the armed forces.■",2
1528,"The multimillionaire founder of a software company that employs Princess Beatrice stepped down last night after a female member of staff accused him of attacking her in harrowing testimony to the US Congress. 
Beatrice is now facing calls to follow David Cameron - who has quit as an adviser to the firm - and resign from her role as vice president of strategy and partnerships after the allegations emerged.
Prince Andrew’s eldest daughter, 33, is vice president of strategy and partnerships at Afiniti, where boss Zia Chisti, 50, has been accused of pressuring a female employee into sex, and allegedly beating her during a sexual encounter.
Former employee Tatiana Spottiswoode, 28, has claimed that Mr Chishti effectively groomed her when she was 21 and then pressured her into sex and assaulted her, leaving her with cuts and bruises and symptoms of concussion.
She gave evidence about the alleged attack to the US Congress and submitted photographs of her injuries.
In a statement last night an Afiniti spokesman said: ‘The Board of Directors of Afiniti, Ltd. (“Afiniti”) announces that Mr. Zia Chishti has stepped down from his role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Director of Afiniti, effective immediately. The Board will make additional organizational announcements in the coming days.’
Earlier an Afiniti spokesman said Mr Chishti ‘strongly disputes all accusations against him’.
David Cameron announced he would leave his role with the firm immediately after learning of the accusations against Mr Chishti, despite the entrepreneur’s denial of the allegations.
Mr Cameron joined the company’s advisory board in 2019, two years after the alleged assault against Miss Spottiswoode and his spokesman said he had ‘absolutely no knowledge’ of the allegations until her evidence to the US Congress committee on Tuesday.
Several major businesses have also said they will review their involvement with the firm.
Afiniti, which provides artificial intelligence technology for call centres, was founded by multimillionaire entrepreneur Mr Chishti in 2005 and has its headquarters in Bermuda, a tax haven.
Ms Spottiswoode said she met Mr Chishti - who was listed among the top 50 bachelors in America by People Magazine in 2001 - when she was 12 or 13, and met him again when she was a student at Columbia Law School.
She told the committee: 'When I was in my senior year of college, in December 2014, Chishti, who was 43 at the time, invited me on a ski trip. I was 21. 
'I initially declined, but he insisted he wanted me to meet his nephew, who also studied philosophy. So I agreed. I later learned that the nephew, who never showed up, didn't exist.'
'The trip was designed to groom me. Chishti told me he had feelings and showed me an extravagant lifestyle.'
Ms Spottiswoode said she rejected him, but eventually dated him about five times over ten weeks before eventually breaking off the relationship.
She continued: 'Months later, Chishti encouraged me to join his company. He presented a rosy picture of a great career opportunity. I believed him. Chishti told me he did not expect a sexual relationship.'
When Ms Spottiswoode joined his company in 2016, she said she signed a contract that included an arbitration agreement with a 'strong confidentiality clause'.
She went on to describe a toxic work environment, saying he 'ocellated between pressurising me for sex and punishing me'.
'During a work meeting in Dubai, he put his hands under my pants and grabbed my but in front of co-workers,' she said.
Ms Spottiswoode went on to describe another work trip to Brazil.
'I avoided him as much as I could, but was under increasing pressure from him. I began to worry that, in addition to wanting sex, Chishti wanted to hurt me and punish me for rejecting him,' she said.
'I felt completely trapped and hopeless. I was 23 and very far from home.
'I didn't want to lose my job, I didn't want him to get any angrier, I did not feel that anyone would protect me and I was too tired to argue with him anymore. I went to his room where he beat me while having sex with me.
'I told him he was hurting me, he said, ''Good''. He told me he should've had sex with me when we first met, when I was 13-years-old.
'I hid in my hotel room until my flight the next day. My body was covered with scratches, cuts, and contusions.
'I had bruises around my neck that looked like I had been strangled, a large bump on my head, and a black eye. A nurse at the hospital said I had the symptoms of a concussion.' 
Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, the founder of the Centre for Women’s Justice, had said Mr Chishti should ‘consider his position’ and that executives such as Princess Beatrice should do the same.
Former England rugby star Will Greenwood, Prince Harry’s friend Thomas Inskip and Winston Churchill’s great-grandson Archie Soames are also employed by the company and board members include former Spanish prime minister José María Aznar and Australian banker Rob Rankin.
Princess Beatrice splits her time between Britain and the US in her role for the firm, and has represented the company at major events such as the annual meeting of world leaders in Davos.
She is currently on maternity leave but has previously described the business as being ‘on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence’ and praised it for ‘working to build a little bit more of a community’ in the technology industry.
Her father Prince Andrew is currently facing a civil lawsuit over separate sexual abuse allegations in the US, related to his friendship to shamed financier Jeffrey Epstein. He denies any wrongdoing.",-2
1529,"A Russian model who put two million Swarovski diamonds onto her £270,000 Lamborghini Aventado has been left with a new car bill - after it was wrecked in a crash.
Daria Radionova, 26, had the black supercar customised with the crystals to show off her bling lifestyle to her 626,000 Instagram followers.
The motor - which has a top speed of 217mph - even has a personalised numberplate DAR 11A so people know who it belongs to.
But the unusual vehicle is now off the road after being involved in a crash in Kensington, west London yesterday. 
A picture emerged showing the rear of the car completely smashed up after another vehicle seemingly smashed into the back of it.
Ms Radionova posted about the mishap this lunchtime but it is not known who was in the car at the time.
She offered a cash reward to anyone with information about a blue Vauxhall car. 
Last night, a friend of Ms Radionova posted a video of the pair driving through Oxford Street in a car, though it remains unclear who was driving and what car they were travelling in.  
It will come as a devastating blow to her as it is one of her most prized possessions.
She regularly shows it off on her social media platforms to her fans.
Only a week ago she put up two pictures of it at a garage in Knightsbridge being filled up with petrol.
Then on Monday she Instragramed another of her in a baseball cap getting out of the driver's seat.
The location appeared to be a similar road to where the crash happened.
Ms Radionova was first known to have been the owner of the car back in 2019.
Stunned pedestrians in London spied it as it was showcased at rally in Kensington.
Work to add on the crystals took over 700 hours, because it has to be done painstakingly by hand.
She had been delighted with the end result, telling her followers 'I have no words to describe how shiny it is -  it was a complete shutdown.""
Ms Radionova is a serial car customiser and has done the same to one of her vehicles before.
In 2020 she drove her £150,000 Lamborghini Huracan covered in a million crystals down Oxford Street. 
Six years earlier she sold her Mercedes CLS 350, which was also covered in crystals, on eBay.
The bespoke work is carried out by Swarovski artist Vinceri, who has also worked with TV personality Maya Jama.
They teamed up to do some flash drinks tumblers with the former Radio 1 DJ.  ",-2
1530,"Australia's vaccine rollout has eclipsed the US and Britain and reached a rare global milestone - but it still has a long way from being the world's most vaccinated nation.
Nearly 82 per cent of Australians aged 12 and over are fully vaccinated, just ahead of Britain (80 per cent) and well in front of the US (69 per cent). 
Looking at the proportion of the total population vaccinated, Australia cracked the 70 per cent mark which only 25 of 195 nations have reached, putting it well ahead of Britain (67.5 per cent) and US (57.67 per cent).
But if there was a league table of the most vaccinated nations, it would be a modest 25th. Britain would rank 30th and the US well down such a list at 64th.
Singapore has (92 per cent) has the highest proportion of vaccinated residents, ahead of United Arab Emirates (88.4 per cent).
Portugal (87.8 per cent), Malta (83.5 per cent) and Chile (82 per cent) round out the top five.
Far fewer Covid-19 cases were recorded in Australia than Britain or the US due to border closures, but experts are in no doubt the fast, though delayed, vaccine rollout prevented the Delta outbreak causing far more deaths and serious illness.
Australian National University professor Peter Collignon said high vaccination rates alone don't guarantee a country freedom from a Covid catastrophe.
Another factor includes how much Covid is circulating in the community when a vaccine rollout begins.
1- Singapore 92% of people are fully vaccinated 
2- United Arab Emirates 88.4%
3- Portugal 87.8% 
4- Malta 83.5%
5- Chile 82%
6- Iceland 81.5%
7- Spain 80.2%
8- South Korea 78.6%
9- Seychelles 78.2%
10- Cambodia 78% 
11- Cuba 78% 
12-  Bermuda 76.3%
13- Denmark 76.2%
14- Japan 76% 
15- Malaysia 76%
16- Uruguay 75.7%

The more virus circulating, the bigger the job to reverse new Covid infections - and the more hospitalisation and pressure on the healthcare system.
That is how Australia appears to have escaped outbreaks anywhere near nations like the US, which has recorded a chilling 762,000 deaths, or the UK, where 143,000 people have died.
Australia closed the borders back in March 2020, making it much simpler to identify the source of Covid that did come in and buying time without thousands of cases.
'It's a mix of Covid circulation and vaccination, but generally where you have a higher vaccination rate, you have a lower per capita death rate,' Professor Collignon said.
Australia's impressive 12+ vaccination rate - 17.8 million of 21.9 million eligible people - was driven by the state with the highest vaccine take-up, NSW.
In NSW, a remarkable 90 per cent of over-12s are vaccinated.
Experts said Australia surpassed Britain and the US because the public responded to the call to vaccinate when the Delta variant hit.
If Australians had concerns about taking the vaccines, they seemed to decide it was for the best - despite reluctance and fears over AstraZeneca.
'Australians have a history of being fairly pro-vaccination,' Professor Collignon said.
Deakin University chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett said Australia's only real problem was the queue was too long.
'We never really had much vaccine hesitancy, there was some, but we had a look at what was happening overseas and we could see the serious side effects were very very rare,' she said. 
'When you contrast Australia with the complexities of the US, where there is so much talk about individual rights taking precedence. Here there seems to be enough of an understanding of individual and community protections being balanced.'
Australia's vaccination rollout began in February 2021, two months after Britain and the US, and took months longer to ramp up due to scarce supply.
Because of low case numbers and an accompanying sense of complacency, the number of Covid-19 vaccinations administered Down Under was sluggish for months.
The drip-feed of vaccine supplies meant it took until Sydney's Delta outbreak rapidly increased new infections in July for a sense of real urgency in both vaccine supplies and vaccination messaging.
Professor Bennett said experts overseas where asking 'what is Australia doing?' in mid 2021, especially with the wide focus on 'strange' Covid zero policies.
'When NSW went into lockdown we had to vaccinate our way out of it. That was the big shift,' she said.
From there, Australia's rollout was among the fastest in the world, which health officials said contributed to Covid-19 not becoming the catastrophe it was in countries such as India and the US.
In the US, high rates of Covid in the community and vaccine hesitancy meant new infections remain stubbornly high - especially in areas of low vaccination.
Hospitalisations and deaths in parts of the US with strong vaccine resistance have not improved much in the past year, Professor Bennett said.
While Australia is confidently reopening, the virus is causing huge political waves in the US. 
In many states, attempts to enforce restrictions placed on individuals to try to slow virus spread are wildly unpopular with tens of millions of residents.  
As a result, the the US Covid-19 vaccination program has slowed and attempts to introduce Covid restrictions ended the careers of hundreds of senior health officials.
Waning vaccination effectiveness, or a shortage of boosters, is not believed to be a leading factor in US deaths remaining high.
That is because low vaccination rates and resistance to the kind of health orders Australians grudgingly accepted before jab rates improved - such as lockdowns and mask mandates - meant the spread was never fully controlled.
A new definition of being 'fully vaccinated' could be around the corner for Australia and all nations fighting Covid-19.
It would shift from meaning you've had two shots to having your booster up to date.
'We may well move to a new definition of ""fully vaccinated"" that means you were vaccinated no more than seven months ago,' Professor Emma McBryde, an epidemiologist at James Cook University said.
That looks set to a global change too.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged said the definition of fully vaccinated would have to be adjusted to account for third Covid-19 shot, although he did not give a timeframe for the move. 
Whether that means six monthly boosters or a once-off third jab is yet to be decided, Professor Collignon said.
'We don't know the answer to that question yet.'
That is likely to be decided once immunity and hospitalisation rates have been analysed from the third shots starting to be administered worldwide.
'We should know in about a year,'  Professor Collignon said.
'That’s when we’ll know you're know whether a third shot will give you enough immunity for another five to 10 years, or whether you'd need one every six months.' 
For now, health advice is the protection against serious illness of vaccines wanes after seven months.
That means after that time people are advised to have a third vaccination to remain fully protected against Covid-19. 
'Third shots have a marginal gain in terms of protecting people, nowhere near as much as from first and second shot, both as an individual and as a society,' Professor Collignon said.
'Stopping Covid is about the first and second shot - it’s the unvaccinated that the real problem.'
Professor Bennett added: 'They (the US) just never got the numbers down like we did.'
Cases remain high in the UK, but its hospitalisations and deaths are about a quarter of their peak last winter.
Like the US, Britain had a huge spread of the virus before its vaccine rollout commenced. The UK also quickly hit lockdown fatigue.
'Australia took more precautions and we quickly had higher vaccination rates and those two things together worked put us in a better position,' Professor Bennett said.
Professor McBryde agreed: 'Overall, Australians have been incredibly compliant with all public health expectations.
'We are generally good at vaccination, for example childhood immunisations rates over 90 per cent. 
'We have some hefty incentives - carrot and stick - in place. We have great logistics with GPs already delivering millions of vaccines per year and additional funding of state run clinics.' 
Professor Bennett said the unsung heroes of Australia's vaccine rollout were community leaders in Sydney and Melbourne hotspots where the virus spread quickest, and where vaccine take-up was slowest initially.
Those included north Melbourne suburbs like Hume, Whittlesea, and Craigieburn and southwest Sydney suburbs like Blacktown, Bankstown, and Fairfield.
'Absolutely they were the heroes,' she said.
'Many of those suburbs had vaccination rates increasing at nine and 10 per cent a week, which is extraordinary.
'They lifted vaccination rates from 50 per cent to 90 per cent in a matter of weeks, it was incredible and it shows the strength of their leadership.' 
Professor Bennett said mandatory vaccination programs for workers in healthcare settings, and to stop community spread, also played a significant role. 
But even before the rollout, the scale of Australia's Covid problems did not compare to Britain and especially the US.
Even at the height of Australia's Delta outbreak, daily case numbers and death rates never approached what those nations faced.
In the US, more than 762,000 people have died, while in the UK the death toll is over 143,000. The total number of deaths in Australia through the whole pandemic period is just 1,907. 
On January 11, the US peaked with more than 252,000 cases a day, while Britain's peak of 59,000 cases came two days earlier.
The US is still seeing over 80,000 new infection a day and in the UK the number is over 35,000. 
Australia's peak came on October 13, when just 2,306 cases were recorded. The vaccination rollout was progressing rapidly before Australia reached 2,000 cases.
As the pandemic went on, experts said the correlation between vaccination rates, and hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 has become clearer.
This was especially clear when deaths and serious illness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people were compared. 
Being fully vaccinated reduces by more than 90 per cent the risk of having a severe Covid-19 infection, falling to 60 to 70 per cent even six months after vaccination.
Although vaccination rates in Britain and especially the US are lower than hoped, experts crunched the numbers to calculate how many lives were saved by vaccination.
In the In the US, it is believed vaccination saved at least 140,000 lives and more than 100,000 in the UK.
While there has been news coverage of waning vaccine effectiveness after six months in some countries, the first two shots could remain effective enough to last Australia through summer due to the delayed rollout.
'If case numbers stay low and even drop it could be that the very low risks of transmission mean the booster program isn't such a priority and it's actually smarter to save it for Autumn,' Professor Bennett said.
'Everybody is still watching to see what happens around the world with boosters in places like Singapore.'",-2
1531,"SOME CHEERED it as a necessary intervention into a broken political system. Others called it a “coup”, the possible end of Tunisian democracy. No one is playing down the significance of President Kais Saied’s decision to enact Article 80 of the constitution, under which he suspended parliament for 30 days and dismissed the prime minister, Hichem Mechichi.
The president’s decision, delivered late on July 25th in his customarily awkward style, came after a day of widespread protests. Tens of thousands of Tunisians, defying a covid-19 lockdown, called for the downfall of the government. Some attacked the offices of Ennahda, the biggest party in parliament. After Mr Saied’s announcement many of the protesters again took to the streets—to celebrate (pictured).

Tunisia is the one true democracy to emerge from the Arab spring protests of 2010-11 that toppled dictators in a handful of countries. But it has struggled in the decade since. Ten governments in ten years have failed to stem corruption or revitalise the economy, which shrunk by 8.6% last year. Covid-19 has added to the strain. The government declared victory over the virus a year ago. Now Tunisia is suffering a new spike in cases. The health service has collapsed. Oxygen supplies are at a premium. About 200 people (out of a population of 12m) are dying each day from the disease (see chart).

Earlier this month the government opened dozens of centres offering covid-19 vaccines. Large crowds showed up expecting to be jabbed, only to find chaos, confusion and rumours of vaccine shortages. The dismissal of the health minister did little to appease an angry public—nor did the prime minister’s claim of ignorance over the operation. In a harbinger of things to come, Mr Saied stepped in, asking the army to assume management of the country’s pandemic response.

The president’s power grab was condemned by the largest parties in parliament. But Mr Saied seems unswayed. He has since fired the defence minister and acting justice minister, while lengthening an existing curfew and banning public gatherings of more than three people. The police raided the office of Al Jazeera, a media outlet seen as sympathetic to Ennahda.
Mr Saied was elected two years ago as a protest against the political class. A former constitutional-law professor with no previous political experience, he won with 73% of the vote, drawing support from young Tunisians and others who viewed him as incorruptible. The same election produced a fractious parliament, with no party or coalition claiming a majority. Mr Saied has thus attempted to play a larger role in domestic policy, previously the preserve of the prime minister and government. Since January the president has refused to swear in 11 new ministers.
It is no secret that Mr Saied, who helped to write Tunisia’s constitution (but later criticised it), wants to upend the political system. He would like the president to have more power and to do away with political parties and some elections. Instead, he suggests that Tunisians should elect local delegates, based on their merit, not their ideology. These delegates would appoint regional representatives, who would then appoint members of a national assembly. According to the constitution, two-thirds of parliament would need to approve any revision of the charter.
What Mr Saied has planned for the near term is unclear. He has claimed the power to extend the 30-day suspension of parliament “until the situation settles down”. For now he says he will assume executive authority with the help of a new prime minister, whom he will appoint. Mr Mechichi released a statement saying he would not be a ""disruptive element"" and would hand over power to whomever Mr Saied selected.
Ennahda, a party with roots in the Muslim Brotherhood (a regional Islamist movement) which now styles itself “Muslim democratic”, has also tried to calm things down. It has been a political force ever since the revolution, and many Tunisians blame it for the country’s woes. But its leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, who is also speaker of parliament, helped get Tunisia through its last big political crisis, in 2013-14, by joining a national dialogue. His party has suggested holding another one and withdrew calls for protest.
America and European democracies have expressed concern over Mr Saied’s move. But Tunisians say they have not done enough to support their country over the past decade. The president faces an immediate challenge in managing Tunisia’s relationship with the IMF. The government had been negotiating a much-needed loan from the fund, which may now think twice about making any commitment.
Tunisia is also caught up in a regional rivalry that pits countries such as Turkey and Qatar, which supported the Arab spring and the Islamist groups that benefited, against those such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which opposed the uprisings. Saudi and Emirati commentators were quick to hail Mr Saied’s actions as a blow to political Islam.
In meetings with civil-society groups Mr Saied has promised to protect Tunisian democracy. Yet he seems likely to try to reshape it in a way that gives him more power. Tunisia will not emerge from the crisis looking like Saudi Arabia. But it will probably be a little less democratic. ■",2
1532,"THE STREETS of Dessie, in Ethiopia’s Amhara region, are loud and bustling. So are its restaurants and bars. But as Ethiopia’s civil war edges closer, the mood is darkening. In the past week military-training camps have sprung up. Outside a hospital a tent has been erected; wounded soldiers lie on stretchers. Through mountain fog come the screams of ambulance sirens. Such is the tension gripping the place that when your correspondent visited, he was arrested almost immediately and held for several hours.
The jitters are because rebels from Tigray are advancing fast and meeting weak resistance. As The Economist went to press, the fighting was drawing near to Weldiya, a strategically important town about 80km north of Dessie. To the west they have penetrated to within perhaps 80km of Gondar, Ethiopia’s historic capital (see map).

A few weeks ago, when the insurgents captured most of the Tigray region, including Mekelle, the capital, there may have been a chance for a negotiated end to Ethiopia’s civil war and accompanying humanitarian crisis. Instead, the war may be entering its most dangerous phase yet.

On June 28th Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, announced a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew his troops from Tigray. Yet instead of using the opportunity to open talks with the rebels led by the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the region’s ruling party, Abiy tightened a blockade. Ignoring calls to join the ceasefire the TPLF has sent its forces well beyond Tigray’s borders. As well as into Amhara, they have marched east into the Afar region in what seems like a bid to control the road and rail link to Djibouti, through which about 95% of landlocked Ethiopia’s trade flows. The TPLF may even be mulling a march on Addis Ababa, the federal capital, to remove Abiy by force.
Abiy has responded with a call for total war, invoking the battle of Adwa, when Ethiopians from all corners defeated Italian invaders in 1896. The president of Amhara has ordered all armed residents to mobilise in a “campaign for survival”, while the president of Afar has called on his people to protect their land “whether by guns, sticks or stones”. Other regions have also sent in paramilitary forces.
The tactics on both sides are risky. The government’s mobilisation of ethnic militias is a recipe for bloodletting: most of their members are poorly trained and have been whipped up by allegations of Tigrayan atrocities. “Everyone is ready with anything they have, from machetes to Kalashnikovs,” says Teqil Nigusse, a merchant in Weldiya. In Addis Ababa and elsewhere, ordinary Tigrayans are being treated as fifth-columnists. Hundreds have been arrested and scores of Tigrayan-owned businesses, including hotels and bars, have been closed, in some cases simply for playing Tigrayan music.
For now, though, the Tigrayan forces have the upper hand. As the Ethiopian army has retreated, they have captured its heavy artillery. And they have turned their once-disorganised ranks into an effective fighting force, motivated by the murders and rapes committed by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. The insurgents’ counterparts in Amhara, by contrast, lack training and have been hastily assembled. The Tigrayans “have the military advantage now”, frets a young policeman in Dessie.
Even so, the Tigrayans’ gamble is also risky. Rather than focus on reclaiming disputed territory occupied by Amhara forces in the west, they are attacking on many fronts—and risk overstretching themselves. Tigrayans make up only about 7% of Ethiopia’s population. Amharas alone outnumber them four to one.
Securing the road to Djibouti, moreover, is no easy feat. The scorching deserts of Afar are harsh terrain and, beyond their own borders, Tigrayan forces cannot rely on widespread local support. The fighting in Afar has already forced tens of thousands of civilians from their homes. The resistance may be stiffening. Federal troops backed by Afar paramilitary forces seem to have halted the Tigrayan advance in the east. “Invading Afar was a historic mistake,” argues Dawud Mohammed Ali, a local academic.
The second risk is political. When the TPLF arrived in Addis Ababa in 1991 as a band of guerrillas who had toppled Ethiopia’s then military dictatorship, it could count on support from many of Ethiopia’s more than 80 ethnic groups. But after almost three decades in charge of the government in Addis Ababa, it has few friends left. Many would regard any move towards the capital as a brazen attempt to put itself back on the throne.
Despite the dangers, neither side in the war appears especially interested in talks to end it. The TPLF, believing it can smell victory, wants a transitional government to replace Abiy. The prime minister, for his part, insists that the TPLF must be defeated entirely. Many Ethiopians agree with him. Yet much blood has been spilled trying to do this, even as the government’s prospects have inexorably worsened. ■",2
1533,"“IT IS TERRIFYING, all the arguments and measures to persuade the unvaccinated to get the jab are simply ignored,” said Manfred Güllner, head of Forsa, a German pollster. The cause of his consternation? In a recent Forsa survey, 65% of the 3,048 unvaccinated Germans polled said they would “definitely” not get a covid-19 jab in the next two months. A further 23% were inclined not to.
Germany, Austria and Switzerland have the highest shares of unvaccinated people in western Europe, bar tiny Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Most of their hold-outs vote for populist, far-right parties. In Germany, for example, around 50% of those polled by Forsa voted for the AfD, a far-right party particularly popular in the east; 15% cast their vote either for Die Basis, the political arm of the Querdenker, the movement opposing all measures to contain the covid-19 pandemic (the picture shows a Querdenker rally). Saxony, the eastern state where the AfD is strongest, has Germany’s lowest vaccination rate, just 57.5%, and its highest infection rate.

Because more than two-thirds of the population are fully vaccinated, the latest wave is far less deadly than it might have been. Deaths are rising far more slowly than infections. Yet intensive-care wards are again close to capacity in particular in Austria and Germany (see chart). At the same time the political gulf between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated is widening. New measures in Austria and Germany to halt the spread of infection are aimed at cajoling the unvaccinated into getting jabbed without inflicting another winter of lockdowns on the vaccinated majority. 

“A federation of imbeciles has ensured that Germany is being hit extremely hard by the fourth wave—much worse than many other European countries,” says Der Spiegel, a weekly, in its current edition. On November 11th Germany reported 50,196 new cases, the second-highest number in the world after America. On November 15th the number of new cases per 100,000 people in the previous seven days hit 303, the highest rate yet recorded. In Saxony it is 754 and in some eastern and southern districts it exceeds 1,000. The government is reportedly preparing to bring in the army to assist stretched health-care services.
The city of Berlin on November 15th banned the unvaccinated from restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres, concert halls and other entertainment sites, in an expansion of the capital’s “2G” (geimpft or genesen—vaccinated or recovered) rule. In some places even the vaccinated or immune must be tested before entry. Outdoor events with more than 2,000 people are also off-limits for the unjabbed.
As caseloads have risen, it has not helped that Germany has been virtually leaderless since elections at the end of September. Angela Merkel, the departing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, her likely successor, and all 16 state premiers will at last meet on November 18th to discuss new measures to contain the pandemic. Most expect something like the imposition of Berlin’s 2G rule to the entire country, but no new lockdown. Germany’s “state of epidemic emergency”, which permits the government to impose a national lockdown or close schools, expires on November 25th—and the likely incoming government coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats under Mr Scholz does not want to renew it. (Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats are campaigning for renewal.)
In neighbouring Austria the situation is even grimmer. The seven-day infection rate is more than 800 per 100,000 people, and hospitals are cancelling non-emergency surgery. Though the government intended to wait until 600 beds in intensive-care wards were occupied by covid-19 patients, it has acted before reaching that alarming milestone. From November 15th it has imposed a ten-day lockdown on unvaccinated people aged 12 or over. Those who cannot prove that they are either fully vaccinated or immune through recovery from a past infection may leave their home only for essential reasons, such as going to work or to buy groceries—or to get a jab. People breaking the rules face fines starting at about €500 ($572); businesses will have to pay €3,000. Groups conspiring to evade regulations could be clobbered for €30,000.
“We must raise the vaccination rate. It is shamefully low,” said Alexander Schallenberg, the chancellor, on November 14th. Roughly 65% of Austria’s population are fully vaccinated. The right-wing Freedom Party, which gets around a fifth of votes at national elections, is the mouthpiece of anti-vaxxers. Herbert Kickl, the party’s boss, rails against Austria’s “covid-apartheid”. He is calling for a demonstration in Vienna against the new measures on November 20th and is threatening to sue the government at the Constitutional Court.
Across the border in Switzerland citizens will vote in a referendum on November 28th on codifying the federal government’s emergency pandemic powers. Opponents are especially vocal in German-speaking cantons; Freiheitstrychler, who describe themselves as the original Swiss, are particularly prominent. (Freiheit means “freedom”; they carry trycheln, the giant cowbells that are a folkloric Swiss symbol.)
The referendum particularly concerns the Swiss covid certificate, which has been compulsory since September 13th for admission to restaurants, gyms, cinemas, and big cultural and sports events. The populist Swiss People’s Party (SVP), the country’s strongest, is campaigning against the emergency powers. According to a recent poll 51% of its supporters are unvaccinated.
The Swiss government (a seven-strong council on which the SVP occupies two seats) last week launched an unprecedented vaccination drive with mobile inoculation centres, a vaccination “village” at the main railway station in Zurich and in-person or telephone counselling. Only 65% of the population are fully vaccinated. The government is unlikely to win the Trychler over. But it hopes to persuade some reluctant Swiss that getting jabbed is a price worth paying to visit their local restaurant for rösti.

1534,"“WE ARE A community company committed to maximum global impact. Our mission is to elevate the world’s consciousness.” The opening lines of WeWork’s prospectus for its planned initial public offering in 2019 seem to confirm the worst about mission statements. People sit in a room earnestly discussing the differences between their purpose, their vision and their mission. There are whiteboards and bottles of kombucha. Nonsense ensues.
But even guff has meaning. For investors in young companies in particular, the mission statement sends useful signals. It articulates what a firm does and gives clues to where its priorities lie. Such information matters all the more when founders exercise outsized voting power. The WeWork prospectus helped elevate the consciousness of investors that the property company had lost its marbles. WeWork ended up scrapping both its listing and its boss.

To see why mission statements deserve more than an eye-roll, look first at entities that lack them. Of the 58 prospectuses filed with America’s Securities and Exchange Commission in the first two weeks of this month, more than a third were for special purpose acquisition companies. SPACs are a type of shell company whose goal is to raise money for an unspecified future deal. They are purposelessness incarnate.
“We have not identified any potential business combination target, and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target,” runs a typical SPAC filing blurb. Investors have been warned: their money could end up pretty much anywhere.
Mission statements contain multitudes in comparison. They can tell you which stakeholders matter most to a firm. A tiny handful of the non-SPACs to have filed this month say their objective is shareholder returns (call it a Milton statement). Most couch their goals in terms of meeting customer needs.
Lulu’s Fashion Lounge says that its vision is to be the most beloved women’s brand for affordable luxury fashion. AirSculpt Technologies, a “body-contouring” firm, aims to produce the best results for its patients. This may be the age of purpose, but giving people what they want, whether they are looking for clothes or a “Brazilian butt-lift procedure”, is mission enough for many entrepreneurs.
The mission statement can also tell investors something about how technologically sophisticated a company is. Among this month’s filers there is a marked lack of flannel from GlobalFoundries, a big semiconductor firm. But for simpler products and services, it is not enough to describe what an enterprise does. “We aim to help the customers in our communities live a good life by inspiring moments that create lasting memories,” burbles Solo Brands, whose biggest seller is a stainless-steel fire pit.
Similarly, you may have been under the impression that Krispy Kreme, which returned to public markets earlier in the summer, sells doughnuts. Wrong. “As an affordable indulgence enjoyed across cultures, races, and income levels, we believe that Krispy Kreme has the potential to deliver joyful experiences across the world.” That’s not icing on your face, it’s euphoria.
A mission statement also illuminates crispness of thinking. Of the firms to have filed this month, NerdWallet, a firm that provides reviews and comparisons of financial products, deserves most plaudits. “Our mission is to provide clarity for all of life’s financial decisions,” runs the prospectus. That is ambitious without being absurd, informative without being constraining.
Others are woollier. The prospectus for Rivian, an electric-vehicle manufacturer, says that it wants “to keep the world adventurous forever”. Prospective investors are told that “the part of us that seeks to explore the world is also the secret to making sure it remains a world worth exploring.” Yet the company’s near-term revenues depend on a big order from Amazon for its electric delivery van. The part of us that plans never to leave the house again may be the secret to Rivian thriving.
As for WeWork, it is back and chastened. Its public debut, via a merger with a SPAC called BowX, was due on October 21st. In a proxy statement issued by BowX in September, WeWork says it was founded in 2010 with a vision “to create environments where people and companies come together and do their best work”. No mission creep this time.

1535,"A bird flu outbreak has been confirmed in Dorset today with officials culling 39 domestic ducks after a case of the 'highly pathogenic' H5N1 strain was found.
The strain of avian influenza was detected at a premises in Southbourne, Bournemouth.
To contain its spread, Government and local health officials are doing door-to-door testing in the area to check for any further cases. 
They have also constructed a 3km temporary exclusion zone to prevent animal movements.
Elsa Hatton, of Southbourne, said a case of the avian influenza H5N1 strain had been found in her flock of 39 domestic ducks. 
The domestic ducks were kept to sell eggs to the local community and have since been culled. 
Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus. 

Bird flu is unique in that it can be transmitted directly from birds to humans. 
There are 15 different strains of the virus. It is the H5N1 strain which is infecting humans and causing high death rates. 
Humans can catch bird flu directly through close contact with live infected birds and those who work with infected chickens are most at risk. 


'We sold eggs to local people for five years in Christchurch and have made many new connections and forged some wonderful friendships through selling eggs here in Southbourne for five years,' she told Dorset Live.
'We are truly heartbroken as ducks are such happy characters and were very much a part of our family.
'We’ll get some more ducks in due course, probably in the Spring.'
Mrs Hatton has shared a tribute to the ducks along with a photo before they were culled. 
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirmed the case in birds at the premises and the area is currently undergoing testing.
Other birds that pose a direct risk will be culled.
A BCP Council spokesperson said: 'Trading Standards Officers from BCP Council are working alongside officers from the Government’s Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) with measures to prevent the spread of the disease. 
'These measures include a cull of the birds who pose a direct risk, as well as further investigation over the weekend into premises in the area who are breeding or keeping birds.
'Please be advised that a 3km Temporary Control Zone has been constructed around an area centred on Castlemain Avenue at this time with regard to animal movements. 
'APHA and BCP Council officers will be knocking on doors in the zone from tomorrow to check for potential further cases. Please note that these officers will be carrying ID.'
Peter Haikin, Regulatory Services Manager, said: 'Avian Influenza predominantly affects only birds and is not considered to be an illness which poses a risk to the general public.' 
All bird keepers in Great Britain are now required by law to undergo certain biosecurity procedures following an outbreak of Avian Flu being declared to help prevent further spread.
Bird flu cases have also been reported in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Essex, Lancashire, North Yorkshire and Derbyshire. 
Last week, people in Lancashire were warned not to pick up any sick or dying birds after an outbreak of bird flu was confirmed at a poultry farm.
A temporary control zone was declared around the affected site in Salwick, near Preston.
Elsewhere, a protection zone was also set up in North Yorkshire after birds there were identified to have the H5N1 virus, the BBC reported.
Defra confirmed the strain of bird flu was found at a property near Leeming Bar, Hambleton, and that testing was underway. 
Earlier this month, a bird flu prevention zone was declared across the country after a number of cases of the virus were detected in captive and wild birds in England, Wales and Scotland.
Farms and bird keepers were ordered to toughen their biosecurity measures after the avian influenza was spotted in poultry at multiple sites across the UK.
The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) will see keepers with more than 500 birds have to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites.",-2
1536,"A  HORMONE CALLED relaxin helps loosen up pregnant women’s hips. Without it, the pain of delivery would be unbearable. Its job done, however, relaxin lingers in female bodies for up to a year, when softer ligaments make new mothers more prone to injury, as Jessica Ennis-Hill, an Olympic champion heptathlete, discovered in training after giving birth in 2014. Five years later Dame Jessica started Jennis, a fitness app to help other women perform safe post-natal workouts. It now lets users optimise workouts for the different phases of their menstrual cycles, and has just concluded a successful funding round.
Dame Jessica’s startup is part of a wave of “femtech” firms coming up with ways for women to overcome health problems specific to their sex. The market could more than double from $22.5bn last year to more than $65bn by 2027, reckons Global Market Insights, a research firm. Having ignored it for years—in 2020 femtech received only 3% of all health-tech funding, and a modest $14bn has been invested in it globally to date—venture capitalists are at last waking up to the opportunity. So far this year they have invested nearly $1.2bn in the industry, nearly half as much again as the annual record in 2019 (see chart 1).

Last year Bayer, a big German drugmaker, paid $425m to buy KaNDy, a British developer of a non-hormonal treatment for menopause symptoms, and Bill Gates, Microsoft’s billionaire co-founder, backed BIOMILQ, a startup that has produced cell-cultured human breast milk and aims to bring both parents closer to their newborns. In August Maven Clinic, an American startup which began as a femtech but has expanded to other areas of health, raised $110m and achieved “unicorn” status, with a valuation of more than $1bn. In September Elvie, another British firm, raised $97m from venture-capital firms.

Unlike heath tech aimed at men, which often focuses on erectile dysfunction, a condition that afflicts perhaps one in ten potential users, femtech offers products like period trackers, which could be of value to virtually all of the world’s 4bn women at some point in their lives. Moreover, women are 75% likelier than men to adopt digital tools for health care. That makes for a huge potential market.
A big reason femtech has been slow to grow has to do with the underlying medical science. For conditions that affect all humans, men are more commonly studied, largely owing to misplaced worries that women’s hormonal fluctuations can confound results (male mice are favoured for the same reason). In the few more inclusive studies, results are seldom disaggregated by sex, obscuring how diseases—and the drugs used to treat them—affect women differently. “We have been operating as if women are just smaller versions of men,” observes Alisa Vitti, a hormone expert whose work on the 29-day “infradian” body clock, which affects everything from metabolism to sensitivity to pain and is a uniquely female phenomenon, underpins many period trackers.

As a result, plenty of woman-specific health issues have, despite their ubiquity, been routinely neglected. Femtechs help fill this research gap. Noting that eight in ten women suffer from premenstrual pain but no treatments have been specifically designed to allay it, founders of Daye, a British startup, designed a tampon laced with cannabidiol, after observing that the vaginal canal has more cannabinoid receptors than any other part of the female body.
Hertility Health, also of Britain, offers non-invasive tests which can help diagnose nine common gynaecological conditions. Elvie’s silent wearable breast pump is a best-seller in America and Britain; its app-controlled pelvic-floor trainer reduces the chances of the typical intervention, whereby surgeons insert “a fishing net and lift up your pelvic organs because they are falling out of your vagina”, says Tania Boler, the firm’s founder.
Labour pains
That is welcome progress. But too many femtechs face an uphill struggle. Helen O’Neill, who runs Hertility Health, calls the $5.7m funding round her firm closed in June a “soul-destroying” process. “It was predominantly grey-haired men saying they are not sure there is a market for this,” she says. Never mind that all women with a reproductive system require gynaecological help at some point. ■",2
1537,"MORE THAN a day after it was meant to finish, COP26 finally came to an end, with 197 parties agreeing to the newly-dubbed “Glasgow Climate Pact”. There were several notable achievements. Countries committed themselves to further accelerating their decarbonisation plans and, specifically, to strengthening their emissions-reduction targets for 2030 by next year, rather than in 2025 as per the five-year schedule set out under the Paris agreement. Developed countries were “urged” to double funding for adaptation in developing countries by 2025. Rules to create a framework for a global carbon market were approved, settling a problem that had plagued negotiators since 2015. The need to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions by a whopping 45% by 2030 was formally recognised. Not the stuff of triumph; but not a trainwreck, either.
The closing moments, though, were hardly jubilant. Speaking from the floor of the final plenary India demanded that a particularly contentious clause be changed. Instead of a commitment toward “accelerating efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels”, the country’s lead negotiator requested a call to escalate “efforts to phase down unabated coal power, and phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies”.

This explicit acknowledgement of coal and fossil fuels as the main drivers of climate change had been celebrated as a major breakthrough. The European Union, Switzerland and many developing nations—which had previously strongly objected to the wording being watered down once through the qualifiers “unabated” and “inefficient”—expressed outrage. But they ultimately decided that they could not let it derail the agreement. Alok Sharma, the COP26 president, succumbed briefly to tears before gavelling the amended package through. “To all delegates, I apologise for the way in which this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry,” he said. His voice broke as he concluded “But I think that, as you have noted, it is also vital we protect this package.”

The feeling of compromises accepted in order to preserve some progress permeated the final hours of the summit. Many countries were vocal about the gravity of the concessions they were making in pursuit of consensus. Almost every developing country expressed deep disappointment that no concrete agreement had been reached on compensation to vulnerable countries for the damage they are already experiencing due to climate change. (They also noted that the compromise the text settled on—with a promise of further “dialogue” on the subject of such “loss and damage”—would only be acceptable if the dialogue happened quickly.) Despite not being mentioned much in the final hours, the failure of developed countries to provide developing ones with the long-promised $100bn a year by 2020 was keenly felt and became a sticking point in negotiations. (The final decision asks for this to be delivered as soon as possible and to increase the amount they give from 2025 onwards.)
In his final statement António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, noted that the decision flowed from “the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today”. Difficulty in assessing the fruits of the last fortnight in Glasgow reflect, in large part, the difficulty of harnessing a process as sclerotic as international diplomacy to a problem as urgent as climate change. The gap between the action taken and the action needed to put the world on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement—to keep temperature rise below 2°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, and preferably to 1.5°C—remains all but impossibly imposing. COP26 succeeded in moving into that uncharted territory, but there is still far more work to be done.

1538,"Rejection can often be a step on the road to success.
Indeed, Fred Astaire was famously dismissed at a screen test with the words: ‘Can’t act; slightly bald; can dance a little.’
Well it turns out Ed Sheeran – now a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter with a £220million fortune – suffered the same humiliation at the age of 16…thanks to Dame Arlene Phillips.
The then schoolboy Edward took part in a televised audition to appear in ITV musical drama series Britannia High in 2007, where he performed Justin Timberlake’s Like I Love You.
However, his wooden dancing failed to impress the former Strictly judge who declared he was ‘not even an option’ to progress.
In a resurfaced clip of the failed audition, Sheeran can be seen dressed in a dark green jumper and jeans.
He stunned judges with his vocal ability and managed to get through to the second round.
But he struggled with the dancing element and Dame Arlene remarked: ‘Ed hasn’t got a clue what he’s doing, but he is trying.’
The teen Sheeran – who made it through just one round of the show – defended himself claiming: ‘I’m just trying to really get it in my head. I think I messed up as I got kicked in the face by accident.’
He was ultimately rejected for the show which aired for just one series.
Reflecting on the disastrous audition, Sheeran, now 30, told The Jonathan Ross Show: ‘This was a TV show I did for ITV when I was 16 and it was a show where you had to be a triple threat.
'You had to be able to act, dance and sing – two of which I couldn’t do. There is a girl who was at my high school and she was an incredible dancer.
'She taught me this dance which looked amazing when she did it…so I just copied what she did.
‘I walked out of the audition like “I think that went really well” and then I saw Arlene Phillips go “not a chance”.’
Sheeran – who has since sold more than 150million records worldwide – recently secured his fifth number one album with =.
Last week he made a cameo appearance in the film Red Notice which became the most watched movie ever in its opening weekend on Netflix.
And earlier this week he announced a collaboration with Pokemon Go – a mobile phone game which had more than one billion downloads by early 2019.",-2
1539,"Seven migrants have been killed and eight others injured after the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in lost control and crashed near a motorway toll station in northern Greece, authorities said.
Police said the vehicle carrying 15 people had been travelling on a motorway from the area of Greece's north-eastern border with Turkey towards the north's main city of Thessaloniki when it crashed just after midnight.
The vehicle had been travelling at high speed and the driver lost control as he tried to exit the motorway, hitting a toll booth and crashing into a nearby storage container, police said.
The injured were four men from Pakistan, one from Afghanistan and two from Nepal, as well as the 35-year-old Moldovan driver, who police suspect was acting as a smuggler.
They have been transported to hospitals in the north-eastern Greek towns of Xanthi and Komotini.
The seven people killed in the crash included one woman.
Their nationalities were not immediately known, authorities said.
Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
The most frequently used routes for clandestine entries into Greece are the short but dangerous sea crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands, or crossing the heavily guarded land border between Greece and Turkey.",-2
1540,"THE FIRST sign was gunfire on the streets of Conakry, Guinea’s capital, on the morning of September 5th. Soon after, unauthenticated videos spread on social media showing President Alpha Condé, looking stunned and dishevelled, surrounded by masked soldiers. “Have we touched a single hair on your head?” demands one soldier of the 83-year-old. Before the day was out, soldiers draped in Guinean flags appeared on television. “The personalisation of political life is over. We will no longer entrust politics to one man, we will entrust it to the people,” said Lieutenant Colonel Mamady Doumbouya (pictured, waving), the head of Guinea’s special forces and leader of the coup, as he declared the constitution and government dissolved. “Look at the state of our roads, of our hospitals,” he said. “It’s time for us to wake up.”
Mr Condé’s overthrow marks a sorry finale to a presidency that once promised much but has long disappointed. It is a dangerous moment for this suffering country of 13m people. The coup is also the latest lurch in an accelerating decline of democracy across much of Africa. The trend has raised fears of a return to the bad old days of plentiful putsches, especially in the west of the continent.

When Mr Condé, a veteran opposition leader, took office in 2010, he became Guinea’s first democratically elected president. He declared he would try to be “Guinea’s Mandela”. Yet his commitment to democracy proved fickle. In March last year, after two terms in office, he pushed through a new constitution that permitted him to run for another two six-year terms. Angry Guineans took to the streets but were clobbered by security forces, who killed dozens of them. After an election in October 2020, the electoral commission declared Mr Condé victorious.
This was angrily disputed by his main rival, Cellou Dalein Diallo, and questioned by outsiders. Mr Condé responded by sending in the troops to surround Mr Diallo’s house for days and by locking up hundreds of opposition members and activists. Once again the security forces put down protests, killing dozens.
Many Guineans have celebrated the coup in the streets. Mr Condé’s authoritarian ways were not the only thing that had been frustrating them. The country boasts the world’s largest reserves of bauxite, used to make aluminium, and for the past five years economic growth has topped 5% a year. Yet more than 70% of the population eke out a living on less than the equivalent of $3.20 a day.

Guineans tell pollsters that corruption has been getting worse. In recent weeks the government has also raised taxes. The price of fuel has jumped by 20%. For those celebrating, even change through the barrel of a gun represents hope. “We cannot help but feel relieved,” Mr Diallo tells The Economist. The coup leaders have freed about 80 political prisoners and promise a government of “national unity” and an “inclusive and peaceful transition”.
Yet things could easily get worse. Mr Diallo, whose opposition alliance released a statement in support of the junta, admits he has received no specific assurances as to when elections will happen or whether civilians will be included in the transitional government. Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya, who served in the French Foreign Legion, has already installed army officers as heads of every region in the country.

Soldiers making vague promises of democracy to fob off regional and Western powers, while doing nothing to bring it about, sounds horribly familiar. In next-door Mali, soldiers have recently staged two coups. In Chad, they staged one in April. The meek international reaction to those putsches may have emboldened Guinea’s special forces. As soldiers were taking over in Guinea, a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the 15-country regional bloc, was in Mali trying to persuade the junta there to keep its promise to hold elections in February. Yet preparations for those polls are badly off track. The delegation said it was “concerned”—but merely asked everyone to “work together” to prepare. Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya, who is thought to know Mali’s coup leader personally, may take note.
Democratic institutions are hard to build but easy to undermine—and across much of the region they are being dismantled. The dismal trend began before this year’s slew of coups. Mr Condé’s constitutional mangling met little international or regional resistance. Neighbours kept quieter still when President Alassane Ouattara repeated the trick in the Ivory Coast. In Chad, in the name of regional security, France and America have long turned a blind eye to rigged elections and violence against the opposition. In Benin few noticed when President Patrice Talon blocked, exiled and arrested members of the opposition. If a country’s leaders do not care enough about democratic institutions to play by the rules—and if outsiders ignore the steady undermining of institutions—it is hardly surprising that men with guns have no qualms about smashing those institutions altogether.
For the moment, ECOWAS has suspended Guinea from the bloc and threatened sanctions, but it may struggle to respond effectively. Unlike Mali and many of its neighbours, which share a currency, Guinea has its own money. After Mali’s coup, the bloc got the regional central bank to shut down all operations in that country, though in due course it relented. That will not be possible in Guinea. Shutting land borders, another common way to apply pressure, will not rattle Guinea, a coastal country. Western governments have condemned the coup and called for Mr Condé's release. But their leverage is limited.
Russia was conspicuous in providing Guinea with its first covid-19 vaccines this year. China is influential, too; more than half of its imported bauxite comes from Guinea (see Finance section). Both have condemned the coup but are unlikely to do much more, especially as Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya was quick to emphasise that mining can continue as normal.
Guinea’s recent history is not reassuring. The leader of a coup in 2008 broke his promise not to stand in the subsequent elections. When tens of thousands gathered in a stadium in Conakry to protest, soldiers opened fire, killing at least 150. They raped dozens of women in the stadium, too. Today things are different, insists Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya: “We no longer need to rape Guinea. We just need to make love to her.” ■",2
1541,"GLASGOW, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine, Fiji, Colombia, Kenya and Mali will be the first countries to participate in an investment program announced on Thursday that will help developing countries transform their power grids to carry growing levels of renewable energy.
The Climate Investment Funds (CIF), created by the world's biggest economies in 2008 to help developing countries accelerate their shift to a low-carbon economy, said its new initiative would help those countries bridge a huge gap in investments needed to integrate renewable energy sources.
Experts estimate that global infrastructure investments will have to ramp up to $820 billion annually by 2030 to facilitate the decarbonization of power systems and help refit or replace existing infrastructure so it can integrate alternative energy.
""Power systems in many, many developing countries are not equipped today to take on that much renewable energy capacity,"" CIF chief Mafalda Duarte told Reuters at the COP26 climatesummit.
""Our grids won't be ready for a clean energy future unless we can unlock significantly more investment in fit-for-purpose energy systems,"" Duarte added.
Duarte said investors viewed this issue as a major barrier to investments in renewables. ""If you can't integrate them into the power systems, there's no point in generating all that power,"" she said.
Duarte said Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia and Turkey were priority countries for subsequent phases of the Renewable Energy Integration (REI) program.
The REI program will work through multilateral development banks to offer participating countries a toolbox of financial instruments and technical assistance.
Plans for REI were endorsed earlier this year by the Group of Seven advanced economies, and are supported by financial pledges from the Netherlands, Britain and Switzerland.
The new program will support grid flexibility measures on both the supply and demand sides by scaling up renewable-energy enabling technologies and enhancing the readiness of energy infrastructure for renewables.
It will also support innovative business models and improve power system and market design.",3
1542,"EVEN BY THE standards of the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, Britain has quite a nest-egg. In 2020 the organisation’s pensions report valued the country’s pot at $3.6trn, second only to America out of the 37 members. A sizeable chunk of that is set aside for workers who will not retire for decades, and who hope it will have grown by the time they do. So how should it be invested in the meantime?
In recent years, regulation has focused on keeping down costs. In 2016, wary of fund managers eating up workers’ retirement savings with outsized charges, the government introduced a cap. Workplace pensions were restricted to investing in funds with annual fees of 0.75% or less.

That seems set to change. Spying a chance to redirect pension assets towards the government’s “levelling up” ambitions, in August the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer wrote to pension trustees to encourage them to start an “investment big bang”. By investing in unlisted British assets like green infrastructure and early-stage, innovative firms, trustees could ensure their savers were “benefiting from the fruits of UK ingenuity and enterprise”, securing better returns and backing British success stories at the same time.
In practice, this would mean pension schemes investing less in listed equities and bonds, and more in venture capital and infrastructure funds. The snag is the fee cap. Such funds tend to charge more than 0.75% per year, plus a share of the profits once returns beat a “hurdle” rate. And so Treasury officials are reportedly looking at ways to loosen the cap.
There is certainly room for more investment. A report by the government-funded British Business Bank (BBB) found that less than a fifth of British venture-capital funding between 2010 and 2019 came from pension funds. That compares with over 70% in America. Much of the funding gap was plugged by agencies like the European Investment Fund and the BBB.
Meanwhile, workers saving for retirement are missing out on an asset class that yields higher returns. The British Private Equity  Venture Capital Association, an industry body, reckons that funds managed by its members returned an average of 14% a year over the decade to 2019. That compares with an average of 8% a year by the FTSE All-Share index of British listed equities. Yet two-thirds of defined-contribution schemes, the most common type of workplace pension, do not invest in such assets at all.
That said, raising the fee cap is unlikely to trigger a rush of pension-fund investment, cautions Raj Mody of PwC, a consultancy. The workers most likely to benefit from high-risk, high-growth investments like venture capital are those furthest from retirement. Such savers also tend to have the smallest pots. And simply raising the cap will not solve the problem of unlisted funds’ performance fees, which can be volatile and depend on returns. “It is an enabling step, not a solution,” says Mr Mody.
Part of the reason American pension schemes can invest in venture capital at scale is their sheer size: the largest five funds have combined assets of $1.8trn. That gives them leverage to negotiate fees, and makes it economical to hire specialist teams. The closest thing Britain has to this scale is the £276bn ($382bn) of pension assets in its Local Government Pension Scheme—which is split into 90 separate funds. A big bang might require more concentration of the Treasury’s firepower. ■",2
1543,"A DECADE AGO Bowling Park Primary was one of England’s least successful schools. Its neighbourhood in south Bradford is one of England’s poorest. A fifth of pupils are Roma, who tend to do worse at school than any other group. But a turnaround that began in 2008 dragged test scores up to the national average. The progress pupils make from seven to 11 is greater than almost anywhere else.
Covid-19 has hit hard, says Matthew Langley, the head teacher. Large families and small homes helped the virus spread. Some pupils spent a quarter of the past academic year isolating, on top of two months of remote learning early in the pandemic, when all classrooms in England were shut. “It’s like we’ve hit a brick wall,” says Mr Langley, “and now we have to reverse.”

As children return to school after the summer break, the effects of the past two years of closures are worrying head teachers—and the government. A recent study suggests that in March primary-school pupils were about two months behind expected attainment in reading, and more than three months behind in maths. It also offered some grounds for optimism: during the relatively uninterrupted period last autumn pupils started to make up some of their earlier losses. But the averages disguise wide variations. Pretty much every school, says Sammy Wright, a member of a government advisory panel on social mobility, will have 5-10% of children who have been “devastated” by the disruption.
Missing out on sport, school trips and other character-building activities has hit disadvantaged pupils’ confidence, says Mr Langley. And the pandemic has amplified the sorts of everyday difficulties that distract them from their studies. Across the country, the number poor enough to qualify for free lunches rose by 20.6% in the year to January. Even during normal times disadvantaged children lose more time than others to common problems such as toothache, says Mark Mon-Williams of the Bradford Institute for Health Research. These will have been worsened as services were cut or suspended during lockdowns.
The government has promised schools extra funding equal to about £310 ($427) per pupil. That is only a little more than a single month’s spending in 2020 on a scheme that subsidised people to eat out in restaurants. In June Sir Kevan Collins, a former teacher and council boss hired to advise the government on its catch-up strategy, resigned when he heard that only a tenth of the £15bn in extra funding he had asked for would be made available.
Sir Kevan had wanted to increase school spending by about 10% over the next three years, with more than half to be used to add half an hour to the standard school day. The idea was to make time for confidence-building activities, such as sport, music and drama, which risk being squeezed out as schools scramble to catch up on the basics. The extra time would have been mandatory, since voluntary activities are most likely to be skipped by those who need them most. In July the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said that more money might be announced later this year. But the Treasury, faced with a post-pandemic black hole in the budget, is reportedly less keen.
One reason is that many education researchers are dubious that longer school days do much to improve results—in normal times, at least. They tend to recommend using existing time better, not least because that is cheaper. Many teachers and school leaders, meanwhile, fear that a heavier workload might not be fully reflected in extra pay. They argue instead for schemes aimed at pupils with the biggest learning deficits, along with freedom for each school to craft its own plans. In the Netherlands, where catch-up money is a more munificent £2,500 per pupil, the government has given guidance regarding what to spend it on, but not set firm rules.
In Bradford Mr Langley worries that much talk of catch-up has focused on “short-term solutions” aimed at propping up test scores. Covid-19 has disrupted schooling for much longer than people expected; its after-effects will linger, too. He has no doubt that Bowling Park will outgrow the damage done by the pandemic. “But it won’t be in two or three years.” ■",2
1544,"WHEN INTERNATIONAL news organisations revealed that at least ten governments had used Pegasus, a powerful software tool created by Israel’s NSO Group, to hack into the smartphones of thousands of people around the world, including politicians, human-rights activists and journalists, the Israeli government shrugged. A humdrum official statement insisted that all Israeli cyber-exports were regulated by the government in “adherence to international arrangements”. Export licences were granted “exclusively to governmental entities, for lawful use, and only for the purpose of preventing and investigating crime and counter-terrorism”.
Israeli defence exporters privately expressed ridicule. “Arms companies can’t keep track of every rifle and bullet they sell to legitimate customers,” said one. “Why should we have higher expectations when it comes to software?...Israeli spying is a sexy subject and these reports are the price for doing business.”

In any case, the Pegasus customer list correlates neatly with many of the governments courted by Israel’s former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who lost his job in June. These include like-minded populists such as the rulers of Brazil, Hungary and India, along with Sunni Arab regimes with whom Israel recently established diplomatic relations: Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, a fellow enemy of Iran, is listed, too. “Deals on cyber-surveillance are the kind of sweetener you can throw into a diplomatic package with a foreign leader,” says a former NSO consultant.
Israel’s new government, too, has close ties to the cyber-industry. The prime minister, Naftali Bennett, made a fortune as a founder of an online-banking security company and is a cyber-defence aficionado. His interior minister and right-hand woman, Ayeled Shaked, is a former tech executive with friends at NSO; she supported awarding the firm government contracts. The new defence minister, Benny Gantz, chaired a company that specialised in data-mining for policing and counter-terror purposes. The head of that (now defunct) company, Ram Ben Barak, a former Mossad bigwig, currently chairs the foreign-affairs and defence committee, which monitors cyber-exports. A hearing on the NSO affair is scheduled, but only in a secretive subcommittee behind closed doors.
Israel’s Defence Export Control Law of 2007 requires companies to undergo a rigorous licensing process. It was passed after America, Israel’s chief patron, complained about Israel selling arms to China. But defence officials and human-rights campaigners admit that once a licence has been obtained, the Israeli government prefers not to know how the tools are used.
Some firms have set up in-house ethics committees, fearing that otherwise they might become tainted, making it harder to do business in the West. “The more progressive-minded workforce coming to the fore in America’s tech giants could treat Israel as a pariah, object to having research centres in Israel and collaborating with Israeli companies,” says a veteran dealmaker. Stung by the Pegasus revelations, investors in Novalpina Capital, a private-equity firm that owns NSO, are thinking of liquidating the fund. But Israel’s rulers, old and new, have fewer qualms. ■
Correction (August 6th 2021): This article originally stated that none of Israel’s ministers publicly commented on the reports about NSO Group. In fact, the diaspora affairs minister did comment, saying firms such as NSO Group are causing direct harm to Israel’s diplomatic interests. Sorry.",2
1545,"“I WANT TO talk about happy things, man!” protested President Joe Biden in early July, when reporters asked him about the imminent withdrawal of the last American forces from Afghanistan, expected some time in the next few weeks. No wonder he wants to change the subject: America has been fighting in Afghanistan for 20 years. It has spent more than $2trn on the war. It has lost thousands of its own troops and seen the death of tens of thousands of Afghans—soldiers and civilians alike. Now America is calling an end to the whole sorry adventure, with almost nothing to show for it.
True, al-Qaeda, which sparked the war by planning the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan, is no longer much of a force in the country, although it has not been eliminated entirely. But that is about as far as it goes. Other anti-American terror groups, including a branch of Islamic State, continue to operate in Afghanistan. The zealots of the Taliban, who harboured Osama bin Laden and were overthrown by American-backed forces after 9/11, have made a horrifying comeback. They are in complete control of about half the country and threaten to conquer the rest. The democratic, pro-Western government fostered by so much American blood and money is corrupt, widely reviled and in steady retreat.

In theory, the Taliban and the American-backed government are negotiating a peace accord, whereby the insurgents lay down their arms and participate instead in a redesigned political system. In the best-case scenario, strong American support for the government, both financial and military (in the form of continuing air strikes on the Taliban), coupled with immense pressure on the insurgents’ friends, such as Pakistan, might succeed in producing some form of power-sharing agreement. But even if that were to happen—and the chances are low—it would be a depressing spectacle. The Taliban would insist on moving backwards in the direction of the brutal theocracy they imposed during their previous stint in power, when they confined women to their homes, stopped girls from going to school and meted out harsh punishments for sins such as wearing the wrong clothes or listening to the wrong music.
More likely than any deal, however, is that the Taliban try to use their victories on the battlefield to topple the government by force. They have already overrun much of the countryside, with government units mostly restricted to cities and towns. Demoralised government troops are abandoning their posts. This week over 1,000 of them fled from the north-eastern province of Badakhshan to neighbouring Tajikistan. The Taliban have not yet managed to capture and hold any cities, and may lack the manpower to do so in lots of places at once. They may prefer to throttle the government slowly rather than attack it head on. But the momentum is clearly on their side.

At the very least, the civil war is likely to intensify, as the Taliban press their advantage and the government fights for its life. Other countries—China, India, Iran, Russia and Pakistan—will seek to fill the vacuum left by America. Some will funnel money and weapons to friendly warlords. The result will be yet more bloodshed and destruction, in a country that has suffered constant warfare for more than 40 years. Those who worry about possible reprisals against the locals who worked as translators for the Americans are missing the big picture: America is abandoning an entire country of almost 40m people to a grisly fate.
It did not have to be this way. For the past six years fewer than 10,000 American troops, plus a similar number from other NATO countries, have propped up the Afghan army enough to maintain the status quo. American casualties had dropped to almost nothing. The war, which used to rile voters, had become a political irrelevance in America. Since becoming president, Mr Biden has focused, rightly, on the threats posed by China and Russia. But the American deployment in Afghanistan had grown so small that it did not really interfere with that. The new American administration views the long stalemate as proof that there is no point remaining in Afghanistan. But for the Afghans whom it protected from the Taliban, the stalemate was precious.
There will be a long debate about how much the withdrawal saps America’s credibility and prestige. For all its wealth and military might, America failed not only to create a strong, self-sufficient Afghan state, but also to defeat a determined insurgency. What is more, America is no longer prepared to put its weight behind its supposed ally, the Afghan government, to the surprise and dismay of many Afghan officials. Hostile regimes in places like China and Russia will have taken note—as will America’s friends.
That does not make Afghanistan a second Vietnam. For one thing, the Afghan war was never really the Pentagon’s or the nation’s focus. American troops were on the ground far longer in Afghanistan than they were in Vietnam, but far fewer of them died. Other events, from the war in Iraq to the global financial crisis, always seemed more important than what was happening in Kandahar. And American politicians and pundits have agonised over whether to stay or go for so long that, now the withdrawal has finally arrived, it has lost its power to shock. To the extent that outsiders see it as a sign of American weakness, that weakness has been evident for a long time.
Unhappy things
Shocking or not, though, the withdrawal is nonetheless a calamity for the people of Afghanistan. In 2001 many hoped that America might end their 20-year-old civil war and free them from a stifling, doctrinaire theocracy. For a time, it looked as though that might happen. But today the lives of ordinary Afghans are more insecure than ever: civilian casualties were almost 30% higher last year than in 2001, when the American deployment began, according to estimates from the UN and academics. The economy is no bigger than it was a decade ago. And the mullahs are not only at the gates of Kabul; their assassins are inside, targeting Shias, secularists, women with important jobs—anyone who offends their blinkered worldview. America was never going to solve all Afghanistan’s problems, but to leave the country back at square one is a sobering failure. ■

1546,"LIU ZHONGTIAN has been called Asia’s “aluminium king”. His firm, Zhongwang Group, is one of the world’s largest makers of aluminium products. At one point he was the richest man in China’s north-eastern rust belt, where the company is based. In America, Mr Liu has a different reputation. Firms controlled by the 57-year-old were convicted in late August of orchestrating one of the most brazen tariff-avoidance schemes in history. Now his empire appears to be coming undone, not at the hands of American prosecutors but owing to domestic economic woes.
Zhongwang’s long, hollow metal rods are a key component in everything from cars to homes and bridges. They have undergirded China’s building and manufacturing boom. Literally at times: Zhongwang grabbed big contracts with the construction groups behind the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010. An initial public offering in Hong Kong in 2009 made Mr Liu one of China’s richest industrialists.

Mr Liu’s fortunes turned in 2019. He was indicted by America’s Department of Justice (DoJ) for running a scheme whereby shell companies shipped in products subject to import duties disguised as crudely welded aluminium pallets. Prosecutors say that Mr Liu arranged for these pallets, 2.2m of which his firm had stockpiled in its American warehouses, to be turned into other things at melting facilities in America. The conviction in August found American firms he controls guilty of trying to evade $1.8bn in tariffs. The sentence, expected in December, may allow the DoJ to go after Zhongwang’s American assets. Days after the ruling Zhongwang froze the trading of its shares in Hong Kong, ostensibly pending the delayed release of results for the first half of 2021.
All debilitating, to be sure. But probably not fatal. The firm remains the world’s second-biggest aluminium-extruder with a vast home market. Disclosure delays are common in Hong Kong and may be unrelated to the DoJ case. And China’s government, itself in a tussle with America over trade and geopolitics, might even help shield Zhongwang from the DoJ’s lawmen.
Then, on October 15th, the firm divulged that two important subsidiaries in China were facing severe difficulties “due to major losses”. Analysts reckon that without a bailout Mr Liu’s group could collapse. The company has offered little explanation. But like many Chinese firms it has been paralysed by power cuts, which could cause the country’s industry to run at 5-10% below its usual capacity until the end of the year. In order to prevent blackouts, local governments are permitting some energy-intensive manufacturers to operate only ten days a month, says Johnson Wan of Jefferies, an investment bank.
Aluminium extrusion requires lots of energy, so power cuts and surging electricity costs have hit Zhongwang hard. Having sold its smelter business in 2020 the firm faces rocketing prices for aluminium, as other smelters raise prices to help offset their own rising bills amid shortages of the metal. As Zhongwang’s home province of Liaoning braces for a bitter-cold winter, manufacturers are in for more disruptions as coal is burned to heat homes rather than produce industrial electricity. For Mr Liu, escaping the clutches of American law must feel like cold comfort. ■

1547,"Prince Andrew was pictured riding in Windsor today with just a week to go before the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell on charges of grooming underage girls for now-deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. 
The Duke of York, 61, was joined by a female groom for the early morning ride ahead of a weekend of festivities which will see The Firm descend on Windsor.
 The Queen is said to be determined to attend the joint christenings of her great-grandchildren in Windsor, with other senior members of the royal family including Prince William, Kate Middleton and Prince Charles also likely to be in attendance.
Her Majesty, 95, was forced to cancel her Remembrance Sunday appearance last week following a back sprain and later warned that 'none of us can slow the passage of time' via a speech delivered by the Earl of Wessex after the monarch failed to address the Church of England's national assembly for the first time in her 69-year reign. 
But she has told courtiers she is set on bring present this weekend as her granddaughters  Princess Eugenie, 31,  and Zara Tindall, 40,  christen their first-born sons at the All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park, according to the Sun.
It is believed The Queen will make an '11th-hour decision' and is taking advice from her personal doctor, with a source saying she is 'keen to be there' as she 'knows how important it is' for her children and great-grandchildren.
It's an unusual move for the two royal cousins to have a joint christening, with the royal commentator Penny Junor saying it would be a 'fantastic message to the world that she is not ready to leave us yet.'
'She's very spiritual, a christening is a very important occasion for the head of the Church of England and being there will be of great importance to her,' she added to the Sun.
Many members of the Firm were spotted out today - Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall attended at day at races at Ascot's November weekend while Princess Anne was pictured the Rugby Union autumn International watching Scotland v Japan. 
Princess Eugenie welcomed her son - August Brooksbank - who is 13th in line to the throne, with husband Jack Brooksbank on 9th February at London's Portland Hospital.  
She had planned to christen him in July at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.
However, celebrations were apparently scrapped after a fellow attendee is said to have either tested positive for corornavirus or been pinged by the NHS Covid-19 app minutes before meaning the gathering had to be cancelled. 
Little August - the grandson of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson - will be christened alongside his second cousin, Lucas Tindall - the son of Zara and Mie Tindall and grandson of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips.
Princess Anne's daughter and the former England rugby star welcomed their third child - and first son - in March.
The royal babies will be christened in Holy Water Prince Charles picked up on his recent trip to Jordan.
The Prince of Wales was pictured picking up 'five or six dozen bottles' of Holy water taken from the River Jordan back to the UK for royal baptisms - which could include that of Lilibet, the grand-daughter he has never met.
The water will eventually wend its way back to the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace, where Prince Louis was christened. It will also be used for non-royal worshippers at the chapel. 
 Other children set to be christened are Princess Beatrice's new daughter, Sienna Elizabeth. 
It's believed the ceremony will be led by chaplain to Great Windsor Park Canon Martin Poll. 
The church forms part of the Royal Lodge at  Windsor Great House where Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson live and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie grew up.
Andrew's appearance comes amid reports  the Queen’s second son plans to use his military career as a way to return to public life.
 Next year is the 40th anniversary of the conflict in the South Atlantic, which claimed 255 British military lives, and the Duke of York will attend commemorative events in the summer.
‘The Duke is determined to take part in the Falklands commemorations,’ a source told Daily Mail's Richard Eden. ‘The Falklands was a key moment in his life and he wants to honour his fallen comrades. He hopes this could help pave the way for a return to public life.’
Andrew’s withdrew from royal duties two years ago  after the overwhelmingly negative reaction to his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis about his ill-advised friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke on three occasions when she was 17.
However, earlier this month, a U.S. judge set a date in January for Andrew’s bid to have his accuser’s allegations thrown out.
 He has repeatedly and vehemently denied the claims.

1. Savannah Phillips
Ten-year-old Savannah Phillips, who was born in 2010, is the Queen and Philip's eldest great-grandchild.
She is the daughter of the Princess Royal's son, Peter Phillips, and his ex-wife Autumn.
The couple announced they were divorcing in 2020, but share custody and co-parent their children.
At Eugenie's wedding in 2018, bridesmaid Savannah had pageboy Prince George trying to stifle laughter when she entertained him by pretending to play the trumpet in St George's Chapel.
She was also once seen pushing George - her second cousin - down a grassy bank at a polo match, and also putting her hand over his mouth as the National anthem was played while they were on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour.
2. Isla Phillips
Savannah's younger sister, Isla, has just turned nine and was born in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year of 2012.
Her middle name is Elizabeth in honour of the monarch. The Phillips sisters are not entitled to a royal title.
They are usually kept out of the limelight - but sometimes join other members of the family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for major events.
They are mostly spotted enjoying themselves as they play together at horse trials.
3. Prince George
Future king George, born in 2013, is the oldest of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children.
The seven-year-old has spent much of lockdown at William and Kate's countryside home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk.
The prince is known to be a fan of helicopters, and all things police-related.
Football-mad George is also a passionate Aston Villa fan, just like his father.
George is seen as shyer than his younger sister, Princess Charlotte, occasionally appearing a little reluctant in front of the cameras.
Third-in-line George and his siblings call the Queen ""Gan Gan"".
4. Mia Tindall
Mia is the eldest child of former England rugby star Mike Tindall and Olympic medal-winning horsewoman Zara, daughter of the Princess Royal.
The fun-loving youngster, who was born in 2014, has a reputation for being mischievous.
She is often spotted running around with her father and cousins, Isla and Savannah Phillips, at horse eventing competitions.
During a portrait shoot for the Queen's 90th birthday, Mia, then two, had the privilege of holding her great-grandmother's classic black handbag.
Like Savannah and Isla, she is not an HRH, nor does she have a title.
5. Princess Charlotte
The Cambridges' five-year-old middle child, Charlotte, is known for her confident, feisty character.
The princess, who was born in 2015, likes spicy food and is nicknamed ""Lottie"".
She shares a love of horses with the Queen, and bears a resemblance to her great-grandmother when she was a child.
At the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding in 2018, the playful fourth in line to the throne stuck out her tongue as she arrived by car.
She repeated the gesture while watching a presentation ceremony at the King's Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in 2019.
At the christening of younger brother Prince Louis, she was heard telling off photographers and declaring they were not allowed inside.
6. Prince Louis
William and Kate's youngest child was born in 2018. The toddler proudly joined his siblings, George and Charlotte, when they clapped for carers during lockdown.
In pictures released for his second birthday, he was shown with a paint-covered face and hands as he made a rainbow print for his window.
Louis, who has inherited the Middleton eyes, has been compared to his maternal grandfather, Michael Middleton.
7. Lena Tindall
The Tindalls welcomed a second daughter, Lena, in 2018, after suffering two miscarriages. 
The Queen and Philip's other three great-grandchildren were not in the photograph taken by Kate, having not yet been born in 2018.
8. Archie Mountbatten-Windsor
Archie, who was born in 2019, lives thousands of miles away in California after his parents, Harry and Meghan, stepped down as senior royals last year and moved to the US.
He appears to have inherited his father's red hair, seen when he was pictured in a stylised image on the family's Christmas card.
In the Oprah interview which rocked the monarchy, Meghan accused a member of the royal family - neither the Queen nor Philip - of raising concerns before Archie was born about how dark his skin tone might be.
The duchess also said Archie was not made a prince because of his race - although he is not actually entitled to be one or to have an HRH style yet because of rules set down by King George V more than 100 years ago.
9. August Brooksbank
August Philip Hawke Brooksbank - born to the Duke of York's daughter Princess Eugenie and tequila brand ambassador Jack Brooksbank - arrived on February 9 this year.
Eugenie described their hearts as being 'full of love for this little human'.
His middle name was in honour of the duke.
10. Lucas Tindall
Zara delivered an 8lb 4oz son Lucas on March 21 - with the baby arriving on the bathroom floor in a surprise home birth.
Buckingham Palace said the Queen and the duke were 'delighted' at the news of their 10th great-grandchild.
Lucas has the middle name Philip in honour of both the duke and Mike Tindall's father.
11.  Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's second child is eighth in line to the throne despite being born a US citizen after the couple moved to LA to quit royal life.
Lilibet, who was born in June weighing 8oz and is a sibling for Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, two, has entered the line of royal succession behind her older brother and is set to nudge senior family members further from the throne.
12. Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi 
Princess Beatrice, 33, the oldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, gave birth to a baby girl weighing 6lbs 2oz at 11.42pm on Saturday 18 September at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, in London. 
Her husband Edo Mapelli Mozzi has announced their baby daughter is called Sienna Elizabeth, in a touching tribute to the Queen. 
Although her mother is a princess, Sienna, who is the Queen's 12th great-grandchild, will not have a royal title. Only grandchildren of the monarch through the male line are automatically entitled to the styling of HRH. This means she will be plain Miss Mapelli Mozzi. The Queen could bestow a title on her great-grandchild if desired, but it is unlikely to be asked for.

1548,"ON MOST WEEKENDS this August convoys of thousands of horn-tooting cars and motorcycles have descended on Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, and on provincial cities. These “car mob” rallies defy a ban on gatherings instituted by the country’s army-led government. The ban is supposedly aimed at controlling the pandemic. But the political dimension is unmistakable.
Among other things, the car-borne protesters want the resignation of the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general who led a coup that overturned a civilian government in 2014. Last year Mr Prayuth contemptuously dismissed student demonstrators making the same demand. More boldly, the students took aim at the wealth and powers of the monarchy. The government seems to have expected that the use of draconian laws to arrest the student leaders would end the protests. Instead the anti-government movement has mutated, infecting new groups of Thais. The rallies in Bangkok include Range Rovers and other luxury cars owned by members of the monied elites who typically back the establishment that Mr Prayuth represents.

The underlying complaint is the government’s poor handling of the pandemic. Thais proud of their country’s relative prosperity have been shocked by pictures of people dying in the streets. One reason for this is that an obscure drug firm which got a government mandate to manufacture 200m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine has failed to meet its targets. But it is taboo for Thais to criticise that mistake, since the company belongs to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Chinese-made vaccines, meanwhile, inspire little trust. As a consequence, just 8% of Thais are fully vaccinated—far short of the 70% that is the target for the end of the year. Last year Thailand did well in holding the virus at bay. Now the Delta variant is ripping through society, with 20,000 infections a day and deaths rising. For the less well-off, especially the young, economic prospects are dimming. Yet even the well-connected are not guaranteed a hospital bed or a vaccine. That helps explain why some of members of the elite are turning on Mr Prayuth.
The prime minister’s authoritarian response to dissent has had perverse consequences. The dozens of protest leaders who were arrested under sedition and lèse-majesté laws had overwhelmingly advocated non-violence. Their absence has emboldened more confrontational demonstrators. In recent weeks Bangkok’s streets have filled with tear gas and rubber bullets as riot police face off against protesters throwing eggs, tomatoes and, on occasion, rocks. Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Kyoto University argues that Mr Prayuth’s refusal to communicate with the younger generation makes things more dangerous.
Meanwhile, in early August Thailand’s usually docile courts issued a temporary injunction against Mr Prayuth’s media gag-order. That had barred anyone from reporting news that might “frighten” people, “cause a misunderstanding” or affect “state security, order or good morality”. The government backed down and withdrew the order.
Mr Prayuth’s enemies scent blood. Even on the pro-government side some want a new prime minister; they might claim that Mr Prayuth’s media gag breached the constitution. Among the opposition, leaders from an older generation of politicians (the so-called “red shirts” who backed Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister whom the army deposed in 2006) are making common cause with younger protesters. Mr Thaksin himself is attempting to connect with them from exile via weekly sessions on Clubhouse, a social-media app.
But the country has moved on since Mr Thaksin’s day. Many young Thais see the king as a fatuous martinet and are much readier than Mr Thaksin to take aim at his powers. The intrigues of the older generation are over, says Frank Netiwit, a leader of the student protests. Politics, Mr Netiwit argues, is opening “a new battlefield”.
For all that, it is one in which the king holds the key ground. Little suggests he has lost faith in his prime minister. The king may not be around to face down the protesters himself—he is preparing to return to his preferred residence in Bavaria—but he is assumed to have authorised Mr Prayuth to act as harshly as needed to crush the movement. The establishment may win the battle for control of the streets. Yet in the longer war, it has already lost the battle for the younger generation’s minds.

1549,"LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The standard setter for global trade finance flows has proposed a new set of rules to define sustainability in the trade finance arena, worth some $5 trillion a year, an executive told Reuters.
While governments and business sectors move quickly to set guidelines for some types of sustainable finance, there are no standards for trade finance. Those rules would apply to a third of global trade.
Agreeing on a common rulebook could help direct more trade flows toward efforts that reduce climate-warming emissions and that also meet the United Nations' development goals, said Andrew Wilson, policy director at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
While others have begun to set definitions for parts of the sustainable finance industry, such as green bonds, ""none of those frameworks can be easily or reliably applied to the financing of trade,"" Wilson said on the sidelines of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.
A framework for trade finance is considered more complicated as more parties are involved and entire supply chains need to be monitored, he said.
Banks and companies are assessing the sustainability of their trade deals in different ways that can be hard to reconcile.
On Wednesday, the ICC released a position paper that it expects to be formalised as guidelines in 2022. The paper was produced with the Boston Consulting Group based on input from more than 200 companies and banks including HSBC (HSBA.L), Santander (SAN.MC) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE).
More input would be sought, including with civil society and governments, before the framework is finalised to ensure support and consistency between the banks in how they classify transactions.
If the framework is considered workable, the ICC would look to develop sectoral standards for specific types of transactions, Wilson said.
While the ICC rules are not compulsory, the group is a recognised standard-setter, Wilson said, noting that its decisions are often referred to in court decisions.
He said he expected the framework to be under consultation until the second quarter of 2022, when a more detailed framework would be delivered. Final rules would then come in the third quarter.",3
1550,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",3
1551,"IN A SPEECH by video-link, Xi Jinping, China’s president, told the UN on September 21st that his country would stop supporting new coal-power projects overseas. Since 2013, 95% of the funding for coal-fired power plants that came from outside the countries where the plants are located has come from China, Japan and South Korea. In April South Korea vowed to end state-backed financing of coal plants abroad; in June Japan pledged to do the same. Climate campaigners are celebrating China’s decision to follow suit.
By some estimates, 70% of all coal plants being built today rely to some degree on China’s cash. Cutting off this source will hobble the building and operation of such projects in poor countries, where demand for power is often difficult to meet without foreign help. But by mentioning only overseas coal, Mr Xi glossed over China’s own dependence on the stuff. Last year, the country’s power plants produced over half the world’s coal-generated electricity. It continued adding new coal-fired power capacity at a pace of roughly a new coal plant a week. China is already moving away from funding coal plants abroad anyway, mostly because of the falling price of renewable energy.

However, the gesture is at least a sign that China does not want to be seen as a spoiler of global climate-change efforts. John Kerry, President Joe Biden’s climate envoy, had been urging China to make a pledge of this kind. But China had warned that climate-change co-operation with America could be jeopardised by tension in the two countries’ relationship. Now tongues are wagging about whether China might have more good news to announce at COP26, the UN climate summit that is due to be held in Glasgow in November. (Mr Xi is unlikely to attend in person—since the pandemic began, he has shunned travel abroad.)

The speculation mainly surrounds China’s plans for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases. The most tantalising possibility is that the country will move forward the date by which it aims for its carbon emissions to reach a peak: currently 2030. (A year ago, Mr Xi also said China would strive for “carbon neutrality”—a balance between carbon emissions and carbon reduction—by 2060). Given that China is the world’s largest emitter, an earlier peak could make a big difference to the world’s climate prospects, especially if it is followed by a marked decline.

Many analysts argue that China could, with effort, achieve an emissions peak in 2025. But Li Shuo, an analyst for Greenpeace, an environmental NGO, says China is unlikely to make a formal commitment to this effect. It would require shutting down many coal plants and overhauling the current five-year economic plan, which took effect this year.
A G20 summit in July gave a flavour of things to come. Italy presided over the event and was keen to extract a commitment to phase out coal power. China, among others, was reluctant. It also resisted a push for faster decarbonisation to prevent more than 1.5°C of global warming above preindustrial temperatures (the Paris agreement on climate change, reached in 2015, calls for the stabilisation of temperatures somewhere between 1.5°C and “well below” 2°C). But with thermometers showing roughly 1.1-1.2°C of warming already, it would take a Herculean effort to achieve that goal. China knows much of the task would fall on its shoulders.■

1552,"LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates will require all gold refineries to undergo annual audits to ensure their suppliers are responsible, it told Reuters, in an effort to combat illicit trading.
Industry figures said this should raise standards in the UAE, one of the world's biggest bullion trade hubs, but may also shift flows of gold linked to crime or human rights abuses to other countries, for example in Africa, where the number of gold refineries is growing rapidly.
A Reuters investigation in 2019 found that UAE took in gold worth billions of dollars smuggled from Africa, some of it mined in grim and polluting conditions and countries in conflict.
Organisations including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental anti-money laundering monitor, are pressing the country to tighten rules and enforcement. UAE has said doing so is a national priority.
UAE's Economy Ministry told Reuters a UAE Good Delivery Standard would require refiners to properly scrutinize suppliers and prove to outside auditors they have done so.
""All gold refiners will be required to adhere to the responsible sourcing obligations,"" it said. ""The UAE Good Delivery Standard will also require annual compliance audits.""
The ministry said its goal was to bring the whole industry in line with responsible sourcing standards. It declined to comment further before an announcement at a precious metals industry conference in Dubai later this month.
CORE TO ECONOMY
Millions of people work in small scale gold mines that can be brutal on workers and leak toxic chemicals. The metal is often used to finance crime, conflict and terrorism.
The FATF last month placed Turkey on its ""grey list"" -- potentially eroding foreign investment -- due in part to ""serious issues of supervision"" in its gold trade.
Last year, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which runs the biggest responsible sourcing accreditation scheme for refineries, said it could stop refiners it certifies from taking gold from countries with inadequate controls.
UAE said it had taken numerous measures to combat illicit trading, including requirements for firms to register with anti-money laundering authorities and declare large cash transactions.
""The gold and precious metals industry is core to our economy,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi, who chairs a committee overseeing the gold trade, said in a statement to Reuters.
The good delivery standard ""will further strengthen the UAE's AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism) framework, which is a critical national priority and a central focus of the UAE leadership,"" Al Zeyoudi said.
SQUEEZING A BALLOON
UAE said its standard was an extension of the Dubai Good Delivery Standard, a voluntary accreditation scheme run by the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a UAE free trade zone.
DMCC accredits two of UAE's more than 10 refiners, requiring responsible sourcing policies and audits. Most UAE gold refiners and dealers lack accreditation or outside scrutiny of how and where they get their gold.
""This is the most significant thing the UAE government have done (to stop unethical trade),"" said Tyler Gillard, who advises governments and companies on responsible sourcing at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
But illicit trading will not disappear, he said. ""It's like squeezing a balloon ... there's still enough gaps and opportunities in other countries for gold to enter the market.""
Most countries do not require sourcing audits. Dozens of refineries are operating or under construction in sub-Saharan Africa, and India, a big importer of gold from small-scale mines, has many refiners not subject to scrutiny.",3
1553,"LEUVEN IS PERHAPS best known to the general public as the birth place of Stella Artois. Among chipmakers the Belgian city’s biggest claim to fame sits in a squat building not far from the Leuven Institute for Beer Research. Metal banding lends its facade the glittering look of a silicon wafer etched with microcircuitry. Inside, its lower floors hum with the noise of $3bn-worth of some of the most complex equipment humanity has ever devised. The offices above house hundreds of the planet’s keenest semiconductor engineers dreaming up the future of chipmaking.
The building (pictured) is the headquarters of the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre. IMEC, as it is better known, does not design chips (like America’s Intel), manufacture them (like TSMC of Taiwan) or make any of the complicated gear in its basement (like ASML, a Dutch firm). Instead, it creates knowledge used by everyone in the $550bn chip business. Given chips’ centrality to the modern economy—highlighted by the havoc wrought by current shortages—and increasingly to modern geopolitics, too, that makes it one of the most essential industrial research-and-development (R) centres on the planet. Luc Van den hove, IMEC’s boss, calls it the “Switzerland of semiconductors”.

IMEC was founded in 1984 by a group of electronics engineers from the Catholic University of Leuven who wanted to focus on microprocessor research. In the early days it was bankrolled by the local Flemish government. Today IMEC maintains its neutrality thanks to a financial model in which no single firm or state controls a big share of its budget. The largest chunk comes from the Belgian government, which chips in some 16%. The top corporate contributors provide no more than 4% each. Keeping revenue sources diverse (partners span the length and breadth of the chip industry) and finite (its standard research contracts last three to five years) gives IMEC the incentive to focus on ideas that help advance chipmaking as a whole rather than any firm in particular.
A case in point is the development of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). EUV is a delicate process involving high-powered lasers, molten tin and ultra-smooth mirrors. The bus-sized machines that generate EUV are today all made by ASML and used by TSMC and Samsung, a South Korean chipmaker. It took 20 years of R to turn the idea into manufacturing reality. IMEC acted as a conduit in that process. That is because EUV must work seamlessly with kit made by other firms. Advanced toolmakers want a way to circulate their intellectual property (IP) without the large companies gaining sway over it. The large companies, meanwhile, do not want to place all their bets on any one experimental idea that is expensive (as chipmaking processes are) and could become obsolete.
IMEC’s neutrality allows both sides to get around this problem. It collects all the necessary gear in one place, allowing producers to develop their technology in tandem with others. And everyone gets rights to the IP the institute generates. Mr Van den hove says that progress in the chip industry has been driven by the free exchange of knowledge, with IMEC acting as a “funnel” for ideas from all over the world.
This model has lured ever more contributors. Today “several hundred” are active at IMEC at any one time, the institute says. They range from startups to the stars of the chipmaking firmament, from ASML to TSMC. Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s newish boss, is effusive in his praise for the outfit. Even as their number has grown, individual partners have also become more generous, in part to keep pace with the rising price of all the chipmaking equipment that IMEC must procure (even if it gets a lot of it from collaborators at reduced rates). As a result, IMEC’s revenues, which come from the research contracts and from prototyping and design services, doubled between 2010 and 2020, to €678m ($773m). Its annual takings are already on the order of those of giant charities such as the Ford Foundation or the American Cancer Society, and growing roughly in line with the booming chip business (see chart).

The deepening rift between America, home to some of the industry’s biggest firms, and China, which imported $378bn-worth of chips last year, threatens IMEC’s spirit of global comity. China’s chip industry is increasingly shielded by an overbearing Communist Party striving for self-sufficiency, and ever more ostracised by outsiders as a result of American and European export controls. All this limits the extent to which IMEC can work with Chinese semiconductor companies.
It is a matter of public record that IMEC has worked with Chinese firms in the past, including Huawei, a telecoms-gear giant with a chip division that has been hobbled by American sanctions, and SMIC, China’s biggest chipmaker. Chinese make up 3.5% of people working at IMEC, the fifth-largest group and ahead of Americans at 1.5%. IMEC has a unit in Shanghai. Still, no Chinese tools are visible in its basement. IMEC would not comment on individual partnerships but says it has “a few engagements with Chinese companies, however not on the most sensitive technologies, and always fully compliant with current European and US export regulations and directives”. Mr Van den hove adds that IMEC has no “major partnerships” with up-and-coming Chinese toolmakers.
Less chipmaking know-how flowing to China and less streaming out of it means that Chinese engineers’ ideas can no longer be integrated with the global technology base of which IMEC is the custodian. There is little that IMEC can do about the growing distance between the Western and Chinese techno-spheres. So it is focusing instead on what it does best: pushing the cutting-edge of chip manufacturing.

1554,"England's Covid cases dipped 10 per cent last week, according to official figures that come amid mounting fears the outbreak is heading in the wrong direction again.
The Office for National Statistics' weekly surveillance report, based on random swab tests of thousands of Britons, estimated 824,900 people were infected on any day in the week ending November 13, the equivalent to one in 65 people. This was down slightly from 925,400 previously.
But in a warning sign that the downturn in infections has stalled, No10's top scientific advisers today claimed the R rate remained level between 0.8 and 1.0 last week. 
And a slew of reports yesterday suggested infections are trending upwards among children after they returned to the classroom from half-term. Official Government statistics, which offer the most up-to-date picture, showed the same.  
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He urged people to get their booster vaccines and warned of Europe's spiralling crisis, which saw Austria become the first country to impose another lockdown. 
Despite the growing concerns over the continent's outbreak, top experts are confident Britain won't be forced into cancelling Christmas again. One scientist behind a surveillance study showing cases were ticking upwards said he remained 'optimistic' that festivities could go ahead without any restrictions.
The ONS surveillance report relies on random swabbing of more than 100,000 Britons every week to estimate the prevalence of the virus across the country.
It is seen as the gold-standard method of tracking the country's outbreak by ministers because it is not affected by asymptomatic carriers.
Figures suggest Wales had the highest infection rate in the UK last week, with one in 55 people likely infected with the virus. It was followed by England and Northern Ireland, at one in 65, and Scotland, at one in 95.
Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 63.9 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus, one of the lowest uptakes of the jabs in western Europe. 
When cases were broken down by age groups, figures showed only 11 to 16-year-olds saw a drop in cases last week. Infections flatlined in all other groups.
Meanwhile, No10's top scientists estimated the R rate was still between 0.8 and 1.0, the same as the previous week.
But they said in London and the South East it could now be above the cut-off point and be as high as 1.1, which would mean an outbreak is growing. 
The R rate is a lagging indicator measuring how many infected people are passing the virus on. It reflects the situation on the ground up to three weeks ago, simply because of how it is calculated.
An R below one suggests that for every ten people who catch the virus, they are passing it on to fewer than ten others.
Two separate surveillance reports yesterday suggested Covid cases are now rising in younger age groups, too.
King's College London scientists, who track symptoms instead of tests, also estimated infections dipped 10 per cent overall last week, but they said cases appeared to be trending upwards among under-18s. 
There was still a drop in cases for over-75s, while they flatlined in all other age groups.
And the UK Health Security Agency weekly surveillance report, which is based on Government testing rates, estimated cases rose sharply in over-18s last week. 
It said cases also rose slightly among under-70s, but dipped in older age groups.
Britain's daily Covid cases also appear to be trending upwards, with rises in younger age groups and 50 to 65-year-olds appearing to drive the increase.
Professor Tim Spector, the eminent scientist who leads the King's College study, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' Christmas will be business as usual this year. 
He said: 'In terms of what it means for Christmas, I’m cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. It’s becoming clear that children and the school holidays play a key role in the waves of infection. 
'I think it’s safe to say that we can expect to see another rise in the new year after the holidays.'
But he still called on all Britons to get fully vaccinated against the virus, as well as ensuring they have their booster doses. And he urged everyone to start using face masks in crowded spaces such as public transport.
This was a softening in his tone from last month when he joined a chorus of experts calling on ministers to switch to Plan B — bringing back hated face masks, social distancing and work from home guidance. 
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He told a Downing Street press conference: 'Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to — non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions — get the boosters.' 
Austria is the first Western nation to mandate vaccines, but it far from the first.
A handful of tinpot dictatorships, smaller nations, and at least one large democracy has already issued vaccine mandates. They are:
Indonesia: President Joko Widodo made jabs mandatory in February this year, with anyone who refuses facing a £250 fine - roughly two months' salary - and being disqualified from receiving state benefits
Tajikistan: From July this year, all adults over the age of 18 were required to get vaccinated by order of the country's Covid task-force. It did not specify a penalty for those who refuse
Turkmenistan: Though dictator Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has refused to acknowledge having a single case in the country, he never-the-less made vaccination mandatory for all over-18s starting in July. Punishments for refusal were not specified 
Micronesia: A small South Pacific island nation, it mandated in July that its adult population had to be inoculated against Covid
New Caledonia: A French dependency also located in the South Pacific, it ordered its entire adult population to get vaccinated starting in September 
It comes after Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 66 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus. This is just below the 67 per cent average for the EU, and the UK where 68 per cent are double-jabbed. 
It is not the first country to make vaccines compulsory. Indonesia required all adults to get jabbed back in February, followed by dictatorships Turkmenistan and Tajikistan in July. Dozens of other countries, including many western nations, require specific groups — such as healthcare workers — to be fully inoculated. 
Speaking today, Schallenberg said: 'For a long time there was consensus in this country that we do not want vaccinations to be compulsory.
'For a long time, maybe too long, it was assumed that it would be possible to achieve a high vaccination rate even without an obligation. Now we have to face reality.
'Whipped up by radical anti-vaxxers, by fake news, too many among us didn't get vaccinated. The results are overcrowded intensive care units and enormous suffering,' he added, accusing the un-jabbed of launching an 'attack on the health system.' 
Ireland, which imposed a night-time curfew on hospitality businesses this week, has today placed its hospitals on a 'war footing' with routine operations cancelled to make room for Covid patients amid a warning from the country's top doctor that intensive care medics face 'unthinkable' choices over who to give care to.
And Germany's incoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz said almost 30 million vaccines need to be administered before the end of the year to ward off the worst effects of the winter wave, which would require the country to more-than double the number of shots it currently gives each day.
He spoke a day after Germany put forward new rules that would restrict the movements of unvaccinated people in states where hospital admissions are high. 
The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states.
It comes as the NHS app is being updated to show proof of booster jabs in a move which could save Christmas travel plans for the elderly and vulnerable.
It will appear on the travel section of the Covid pass, allowing Britons to visit parts of Europe which now require evidence of a third dose.
While the new feature will initially be limited to travel, it could also make it easier for the UK Government to make the third jab compulsory in domestic circumstances. 
Boris Johnson warned on Monday that the concept of full vaccination would need to be adjusted – with a third jab becoming part of it.
Almost 14million Britons have had the booster but the goal is to administer 40million to people over the age of 40. Younger adults may also be offered the jabs in the near future.
A small but growing number of countries, including Switzerland, Croatia and Israel, are now requesting proof of boosters for arrivals vaccinated many months ago.
France has indicated that proof of a third jab will be required for over-65s to access most venues from December 15.
Austria had required proof of a booster but announced today it is going into a full nationwide lockdown from Monday. The move, which comes just days after the Government imposed a lockdown only for the unvaccinated, makes Austria the first Western European to retreat back into a draconian shutdown since the summer.
A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs.",-2
1555,"FROM THE collapsing of city walls during medieval sieges, to the laying of giant mines filled with explosives under enemy trenches during the first world war, to the supply networks of the Ho Chi Minh trail during the war in Vietnam, to the Tora Bora cave complex, used first by the Mujahideen to oppose the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and then by the Taliban to oppose the American invasion, tunnel-digging in times of conflict has a long history. These days, secret tunnels are used to move weapons and people between Gaza and Egypt, and by Kurdish militia operating on the frontier between Syria and Turkey. But the same principle applies. What happens underground is hard for the enemy to observe. Digging for victory is therefore often a good idea.
That, though, may be about to change. Real-time Subsurface Event Assessment and Detection (RESEAD), a project being undertaken at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, uses novel sensors to make accurate maps of what is happening underground. This will, no doubt, have many civilian applications. But Sandia is principally a weapons lab, and it is military matters that are uppermost in the mind of the project’s leader, Chet Weiss.

RESEAD grew out of work that was looking at ways of monitoring earth tremors by means of sensor networks. The researchers involved found that the analytical techniques they had developed to handle data so collected were fast enough to process those data more or less in real time. This would mean they could detect movement underground in a way that would be militarily useful.
The versions of these networked sensors used in RESEAD are embedded in the collars connecting sections of borehole casings, and communicate with the surface via wires. This makes them easy to deploy and use. The sensors themselves are a mixture of accelerometers, which pick up vibrations, current detectors, which measure the electrical-resistance of rocks and soil, and subsurface radar.
RESEAD’s real secret, though, is in the way it handles the incoming data. First, these are pre-crunched by powerful hardware built into the sensors themselves. This step, a form of parallel processing, greatly reduces the time required by the central receiving computer to finish the job. Second, the mathematical technique employed, a species of finite-element analysis, divides the volume represented by the incoming data not merely into blocks, as is normal in this approach, but into blocks the faces and edges of which can have different properties. This means a block can straddle, say, the interface between a metal pipe and the rock surrounding it. That considerably reduces the number of blocks needed, and further simplifies the calculation.
To test their system Dr Weiss’s team decided to look at an oilfield. Most oilfields have only one or two wells per square kilometre, which is hardly challenging. The team, however, chose in Bakersfield, California, which has a dense network of oil-related infrastructure. The square kilometre they picked contains more than a hundred wells, many underground storage tanks and tens of kilometres of steel pipeline. RESEAD made short work of this challenge. It produced an accurate map of the area in just ten minutes.
Exactly how RESEAD sensors would be put in place in a zone of active conflict remains to be seen. But the system could certainly be useful for other sorts of security. In particular, America has a problem with tunnels under its border with Mexico being used to smuggle drugs and migrants into the country. RESEAD would be able to detect existing tunnels and nip new ones in the bud. ■

1556,"Washington (CNN)When it came to light in January 2017, just days before Donald Trump took office, the so-called Steele dossier landed like a bombshell and sent shockwaves around the world with its salacious allegations about Trump and his supposed ties to Russia.The central allegations, that Trump conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election and that Russia had compromising information on him, were given a veneer of credibility because they originated from a retired British spy, Christopher Steele, who had a solid reputation.But five years later, the credibility of the dossier has significantly diminished.A series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of its central allegations and exposed the unreliability of Steele's sources. They also raise serious questions about the political underpinnings of some key explosive claims about Trump by shedding new light on the involvement of some well-connected Democrats in the dossier, and separate efforts to prod the FBI to investigate ties between Trump's campaign and Russia.These revelations have triggered a reckoning around the Steele dossier, particularly in the wake of two recent indictments secured by John Durham, the special counsel appointed during the Trump administration to investigate the FBI's Russia probe. Durham alleges that Steele's primary source, a US-based foreign policy analyst, repeatedly lied to the FBI about where he got his information.To be clear, multiple US government inquiries uncovered dozens of contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russians, which have since been acknowledged. The candidate himself and his closest advisers even welcomed the Kremlin's interference in the election. Still, none of it added up to the collusion suggested in Steele's memos.Legitimate questions are now being raised about the dossier -- how it was used by Democrats as a political weapon against Trump, how it was handled by the FBI and US intelligence agencies, and how it was portrayed in the mainstream media.Democrats' hidden hand revealed  Trump swiftly rejected Steele's claims and said a ""group of opponents ... put that crap together."" Nearly five years later, it's clearer than ever that he wasn't too far off about the origins of the dossier.Two special counsel investigations, multiple congressional inquiries, civil lawsuits in the US and the United Kingdom, and an internal Justice Department review have now fully unspooled the behind-the-scenes role that some Democrats played in this saga. They paid for the research, funneled information to Steele's sources, and then urged the FBI to investigate Trump's connections to Russia.Mother Jones first revealed the existence of the dossier a few days before the 2016 election, and said the memos were part of an ""opposition research project"" underwritten by Democrats. Nearly a year passed before the full truth came out about the financing: The money flowed from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign to law firm Perkins Coie, to the research company Fusion GPS, and then ultimately to Steele, who got $168,000.(Anti-Trump Republicans initially funded Fusion GPS' research during the 2016 GOP primaries, but the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee picked up the tab before Steele got involved.)But Democratic involvement in Steele's work was much deeper than previously known. Court filings from the Durham inquiry recently revealed that some information in the dossier originated from Charles Dolan, 71, a public relations executive with expertise in Russian affairs who had a decades-long political relationship with the Clinton family. He has not been accused of any crimes.Federal prosecutors said Dolan was in regular contact in 2016 with Steele's primary source Igor Danchenko, 49, a Russian citizen and foreign policy analyst who lives in Virginia. Danchenko was indicted on November 4 for allegedly lying to the FBI about his dealings with Dolan and a fellow Soviet-born expat that he claimed was one of his sources.Danchenko pleaded not guilty last week. In a statement to CNN, his defense attorney Mark Schamel said Durham is pushing a ""false narrative designed to humiliate and slander a renowned expert in business intelligence for political gain."" Schamel also accused Durham of including legally unnecessary information in the 39-page indictment to smear Danchenko.""For the past five years, those with an agenda have sought to expose Mr. Danchenko's identity and tarnish his reputation while undermining U.S. National Security,"" Schamel said. ""...This latest injustice will not stand. We will expose how Mr. Danchenko has been unfairly maligned by these false allegations.""The indictment indirectly connected Dolan to the infamous claim that Russia possessed a compromising tape of Trump with prostitutes in Moscow, which became known as the ""pee tape."" (Trump and Russia both denied the allegations.) According to the Danchenko indictment, in June 2016, Dolan toured the Ritz-Carlton suite where the alleged liaison occurred, and discussed Trump's 2013 visit with hotel staff, but wasn't told about any sexual escapades. It's still unclear where those salacious details that ended up in the dossier came from.Dolan was also indirectly linked in the indictment to still-unverified claims about Russian officials who were allegedly part of the election meddling. The indictment also suggested that Steele's memos exaggerated what Dolan had passed along to Danchenko.The indictment also says the dossier contained a relatively mundane item about Trump campaign infighting that Dolan later told the FBI he actually gleaned from news articles. Prosecutors say Dolan even lied to Danchenko about where he got the gossip, by attributing it to a ""GOP friend"" who was ""a close associate of Trump.""An attorney representing Dolan, Ralph Martin, declined to comment for this story because his client ""is a witness in an ongoing case.""Durham explicitly stated in the Danchenko indictment that the Clinton campaign didn't direct, and wasn't aware of, Dolan's activities regarding the dossier. Clinton has said she only learned about the dossier when it was posted online, two months after the 2016 election. Senior Clinton campaign aides also said they found out about Steele's work from press reports.Clinton's allies prod the FBI  The Danchenko indictment raises new concerns about the circular nature of portions of Steele's work, and how it fit into a larger effort by Democrats to dirty up Trump. Clinton's campaign funded the project, and we now know that much of the material in Steele's memos ended up being mere political gossip. Steele then sent his explosive but unverified findings to the FBI and State Department.While Steele was passing his tips onto the FBI in fall 2016, a Clinton campaign lawyer separately met with a senior FBI official and gave him information about strange cyberactivity between servers at the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia.The lawyer, Michael Sussmann, has since been charged with lying to the FBI during that meeting, for allegedly saying he wasn't providing the dirt on behalf of any client, even though he ultimately billed that time to the Clinton campaign, and also billed them for other work he did on the server issue. Durham says Sussmann repeated this lie during a meeting with CIA officials in February 2017, where he told them about the server theory. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.The indictment says Sussman peddled the same material to a Slate reporter, who published a story right before the election. The story said reputable computer scientists uncovered unusual activity between servers belonging to the Trump Organization and the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, suggesting a secret backchannel.The Trump Organization and Alfa Bank both denied there was a backchannel. The FBI investigated the underlying data and ruled out any improper cyber links by February 2017.But after the Slate article came out, Clinton's campaign went on a PR blitz, tying Trump to Russia. Clinton had already slammed Trump for months, for embracing Russia's interference in the election, which included releasing hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee.Sussmann was a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie, which indirectly hired Steele. Both men separately went to the FBI in 2016 with dirt about Trump, though there's no indication Sussmann knew about the dossier. (A 2019 Justice Department watchdog report pointed out that the FBI routinely accepts information from biased or dubious sources, and then investigators try to independently vet the material.)After he was charged, Sussmann resigned from Perkins Coie. He declined to comment for this story.Rumors, hearsay and fabrications   When the dossier burst into public view, much of the conversation revolved around Steele's résumé: He worked undercover in Moscow, ran the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters, and maintained a network of sources in the country. This lent credibility to his findings, even though nobody, including CNN, was able to confirm the explosive allegations of collusion or the salacious ""pee tape"" claims.In January 2017, CNN broke the story that senior US intelligence officials had briefed Trump and then-President Barack Obama about the dossier. CNN never published the dossier itself, but hours later, BuzzFeed posted the full 35 pages of Steele's memos online for all to see. CNN said the author was ""a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.""That was true. The FBI formalized Steele's role as a confidential informant in 2013. He aided the FBI's groundbreaking corruption case against dozens of FIFA soccer officials in 2015, and he also provided the FBI with reliable information about Russian oligarchs.But the once well-connected British spy had been out of the intelligence services for a while.For starters, we now know that Steele's primary source, Danchenko, wasn't some deep-cover Kremlin insider. He was a DC-based think tank analyst with a Rolodex of Russians.The FBI tracked down Danchenko and interviewed him a few times in 2017 while they scrambled to verify the dossier. Danchenko said the information he gave to Steele was mostly ""hearsay,"" ""just talk,"" ""word of mouth,"" and came from ""conversations he had with friends over beers."" Danchenko also said Steele puffed up the memos and leaned too hard into the raw information he received, according to a bombshell 2019 report from Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz about the Russia probe.Some of Steele's sourcing disintegrates  The Danchenko indictment alleges that he lied to the FBI, and possibly Steele too, about another detail that became central to the dossier: where he heard there was a ""well-developed conspiracy of cooperation"" between Trump and the Kremlin.In interviews with the FBI, Danchenko attributed the information to Sergei Millian, a Belarusian-American businessman who did some real estate work with the Trump Organization. The indictment also says Danchenko sourced the ""pee tape"" story, in part, to Millian. But Millian wasn't the source, Durham says, contradicting press reports from 2017. (Some outlets recently corrected or clarified those reports.)Millian has since said he was ""framed"" by Danchenko and has publicly denied that they ever spoke, though there is no indication in the indictment that Millian ever denied it to the FBI or under oath.""This fraud destroyed my health, life, businesses and turned my American dream into (a) nightmare,"" Millian told CNN in a statement, declining further comment.A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released last year said Millian's behavior during the 2016 election ""resembles activities by a Russian intelligence officer or cooptee."" He has vehemently denied working for the Russian government.Another Russian who Danchenko told the FBI was one of his sources said in a sworn affidavit in a civil case that she wasn't the source for at least one claim that was attributed to her. The woman, publicist Olga Galkina, said she believes Danchenko told the FBI she was his source ""to create more authoritativeness for his work,"" according to court filings.The indictment against Danchenko quotes emails where Galkina told Dolan she is a ""big Hillary fan,"" and hoped to land a job at the State Department after Clinton became president.Taken together, these revelations about Dolan, Millian and Galkina raise grave questions about where Danchenko got his information, or if he perhaps made some of it up.Attorneys for Danchenko didn't respond to CNN's request for an interview.The Durham investigation is ongoing. He continues to use a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, signaling that he might be interested in bringing charges against additional defendants.'Underpinned by poor judgment'   It took five years of criminal investigations, civil cases and congressional reports to pull back the curtain on the flimsiness of the dossier. The big picture really came into focus in 2019 with the release of a Justice Department watchdog report.That report described for the first time Danchenko's many walk-backs in his FBI interviews. It also said FBI agents gave Steele mixed reviews, with some seeing him as a ""person of integrity,"" while others said he had a ""lack of self-awareness"" and was ""underpinned by poor judgment,"" even if he was acting in good faith.The report also said the CIA viewed Steele's material as an ""Internet rumor.""Last year's bipartisan Senate report said ""the tradecraft reflected in the dossier is generally poor relative to (US intelligence community) standards."" The blockbuster 966-page report also raised concerns that some of the material Steele put in his memos was Russian disinformation.These revelations undermined Steele's credibility -- and led to renewed scrutiny and right-wing criticism of how many news outlets, including CNN, covered the dossier story.Efforts to corroborate fall flat   Everyone but Steele talked about his work for nearly five years, but he finally broke his silence in an ABC News interview last month, shortly before Danchenko was arrested. (Steele and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence, declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview.)Steele defended his work and said he was right about three big takeaways from his memos: Russian spy agencies interfered in the 2016 election; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the operation; and the goal was to help Trump and hurt Clinton.He pointed to the US intelligence community's landmark 2017 report that said Russia meddled in the election at Putin's orders to help Trump. US intelligence agencies had examined the dossier but didn't rely on his findings for their report.But Steele's findings on Russian election-meddling, which were ahead of the curve at the time, now seem more like prescient geopolitical observations rather than insider information. Plus, his final and most consequential takeaway -- that Trump's campaign worked hand-in-hand with the Kremlin -- was essentially debunked by special counsel Robert Mueller's sweeping investigation.CNN reported in February 2017 that US investigators had corroborated some of the communications detailed in the dossier, citing multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials.The CNN report said US investigators were able to confirm the time, place and people involved in some of the conversations between foreign nationals mentioned by Steele. The story said CNN couldn't confirm if those conversations were about Trump, and the sources told CNN that the corroborated information had nothing to do with the salacious claims in the dossier.The sources also told CNN that the corroboration gave investigators ""greater confidence"" in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier, which the FBI was still actively investigating at the time.Two years later, the Justice Department watchdog said only limited information was corroborated from the dossier relating to ""time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available.""Horowitz's watchdog report, released in December 2019, also said much of the material in the dossier about Trump and his campaign ""could not be corroborated"" and that ""certain allegations were inaccurate or inconsistent"" with subsequent FBI findings.But Horowitz said the FBI determined that Steele's big-picture conclusions about Russian meddling were ""consistent with known efforts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections.""What's right? What's wrong?   Looking at the big picture, Steele was right that Russia used ""trusted agents of influence"" to target Trump's inner circle. And he was correct to suspect there were secret contacts between Trump aides and Russian officials, even though Trump denied any Russian ties. But Steele was wrong about so many of the key details.Despite a worldwide hunt for the Trump ""kompromat,"" no tapes ever emerged, and the Danchenko indictment puts the source of that underlying claim into doubt.There is no proof of something in the dossier that would've been a smoking gun for collusion -- that Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen went to Prague in 2016 to coordinate with Russian officials about their anti-Clinton hacking efforts. The watchdog report said the FBI concluded that these claims ""were not true."" Even after Cohen turned on Trump and started helping Mueller, and implicated his former boss in an illegal campaign finance scheme, Cohen always denied the Prague allegations.The dossier said Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and foreign policy adviser Carter Page led the collusion efforts. But this was never verified by any government investigations. Mueller found that both men had extensive contacts with Russian agents, but he couldn't verify that Page met with the specific Kremlin officials as alleged in the dossier.The Mueller report said there wasn't evidence of a criminal conspiracy to collude.Five years on, Steele continues to defend his work. He told ABC News that ""the evidence suggests"" there was collusion, that he believes Cohen traveled to Prague after all, and that the compromising tape of Trump with Russian prostitutes ""probably"" exists.""I stand by the work we did, the sources that we had, and the professionalism which we applied to it,"" Steele said in the interview with ABC News.Origins of the Russia probe  Democratic officials, the media and Internet conspiracy theorists initially hyped Steele's work. But as his credibility waned, Trump started exaggerating Steele's influence, and pushed the lie that the dossier triggered ""the entire Russia probe.""In truth, the dossier played a remarkably limited role in the Russia investigation.Four US government reports concluded that the probe began in July 2016, two months before the FBI team handling the inquiry even learned about the dossier.(After a lengthy review, Horowitz said there was a legal basis to open the Russia probe, and that the process was free of political bias. However, Durham publicly rebuked Horowitz and said he disagreed with some of Horowitz's conclusions, leading to criticism that his own work is politically motivated.)Mueller's team interviewed Steele, but largely ignored the dossier as they found dozens of links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller's report didn't say all that much about the dossier, and he didn't attribute any findings to Steele.And there's no indication that the dossier influenced Mueller's successful criminal prosecutions against six Trump campaign associates: Manafort, Cohen, Roger Stone, Rick Gates, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos.But the dossier did play a major role in the investigation into Page, the lower-level Trump foreign policy adviser, and helped the FBI secure a warrant to wiretap him after he left the campaign in September 2016.Tainted FBI wiretaps  The fallout from the dossier was largely contained to the Page surveillance. But when internal investigators looked under the hood, they found catastrophic issues.Before the dossier, investigators already considered applying for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to wiretap Page's communications, but they weren't sure if they could establish probable cause. The dossier's explosive claims about Page's alleged meetings during his recent trip to Moscow ""pushed it over"" the line, a lawyer involved in the case told the Justice Department watchdog.The FBI included snippets of Steele's reporting in the FISA application, along with other information, like details of Page's previous interactions with Russian spies, and the fact that he suggested to an FBI informant that he had an ""open checkbook"" from the Kremlin. The secretive FISA court approved the warrant in October 2016, as well as three subsequent renewal requests, meaning Page was wiretapped for about one year.In April 2017, CNN was first to report that the FBI included some material from the dossier in the FISA applications. The article said prosecutors would only have done this ""after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation,"" according to officials familiar with the process.It's now clear that this level of verification never materialized. The watchdog report said Steele's claims about Page ""remained uncorroborated"" when the wiretaps ended in 2017.Page was never charged with any crimes, and Mueller said his investigation ""did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government"" to meddle in the election, which was a far cry from the FBI's initial assertions in FISA applications that Page ""is an agent of a foreign power"" who was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian Government.""The inspector general examined the FBI's handling of the FISA applications and found that there were widespread mistakes, omissions and errors that deeply undermined the integrity of the process. In response, the Justice Department declared that the final two FISA warrants against Page were legally invalid.But even Durham, who has been accused of cherry-picking an unfair narrative to undermine the Russia probe, hasn't said in his recent indictments, spanning 66 pages, that the FBI or Mueller ever relied on Steele for anything beyond the Page surveillance.Partial vindication for Trump    Critics of the Russia probe -- conservative pundits, Republican lawmakers and Trump himself -- took a victory lap after the inspector general blasted the Page FISA applications.That's because the inspector general's report confirmed what many of them had argued all along, including in a highly disputed memo from GOP Rep. Devin Nunes: That there were systemic problems with the FBI surveillance of someone tied to the Trump, and the Steele dossier was improperly used to influence part of the Russia probe.But the report refuted the more outlandish conspiracy theories that Trump, Nunes and other Republicans pushed about the Russia probe. The report said the FISA process, while flawed, wasn't intentionally abused and wasn't politically biased. And the report debunked Trump's lie that the FBI planted spies in his campaign.The latest Durham indictments also injected new life into Russia probe skeptics.After wall-to-wall coverage of the Steele dossier, public opinion was quickly locked in on the question of collusion. Many Democrats clung to hope that the dossier was true. Most Republicans denounced it as a deep state hoax. Post-Mueller polling found that about half of Americans believed Trump was guilty of collusion.Mueller and a bipartisan Senate inquiry concluded that Trump's team welcomed Russian help, and tried to coordinate on a few fronts, but it didn't come to fruition.But so much suspicion was fueled by Trump's massive cover-up about Russia.Trump and his team systematically lied about almost every aspect of the Russia probe. (At the start, they falsely denied any contacts with Russians.) After so many of their denials were disproved, they repeatedly shifted their story. Trump repeatedly undermined and obstructed Mueller's investigation.All the while, Trump heaped praise on Putin. He infamously took Putin's side at the 2018 Helsinki summit by agreeing with Putin's lie that Russia didn't try to help Trump win in 2016, leading many to wonder if Trump was compromised after all.",0
1557,"The United Kingdom on Saturday recorded 40,941 daily COVID-19 cases, a decrease of seven percent on last week's cases, government data showed.
The figures also showed 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test - versus 157 seven days earlier - bringing the country's total deaths to 143,866.
Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 168,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. 
Release of the figures came after a SAGE adviser moved to reassure Britons the UK will not see a spike in Covid-19 cases like Austria and Germany.
But Professor John Edmunds said that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'.
'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmunds told Sky.
He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on.
'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane.
'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.'
Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmunds told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step.
'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' 
This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections.
Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.
But Mr Edmunds said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position'. 
The British Government has repeatedly rejected pleas to implement its Plan B, which would see similar measures to what are being levied on Ireland. But Boris Johnson has admitted a full-blown lockdown could still be on the cards if cases spike.
This comes amid a fresh wave of Covid infections on the continent that has sent nations back into draconian restrictions and could see excess deaths start to rise again.
Italy is considering a lockdown of the unvaccinated, it emerged yesterday, which would make it the latest country to impose the controversial intervention after Austria announced lockdown would return on Monday.
And Germany's incoming government has said that it wants unvaccinated people to be barred from going to work and travelling on public transport amid what Angela Merkel calls 'dramatic' infection levels. The Netherlands has also introduced a 7pm curfew for pubs and restaurants amid rising cases there.
Both Austria and the Czech Republic have announced the return of lockdowns from Monday, with Germany poised to follow suit after health officials warned they cannot rule out a full shutdown.
Meanwhile, Slovakia intends to bring in harsher restrictions if its current lockdown of unvaccinated people does not curb the rise in cases.
The reintroduction of restrictions across Europe have sparked a fierce backlash and fevered protests broke out in cities including Rotterdam overnight, where riot police fired warning shots - injuring protestors marching against the Covid measures.
Today, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Vienna with the far-right opposition Freedom Party among those who have called for the protest and vowed to combat the new restrictions.
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy.  ",-2
1558,"IN THE MID-1990s outlines of bulbous heads, spray-painted with a single swipe, began to appear on Beijing’s walls. Next to them was written “AK-47”. This tag, as graffitied signatures are known, belonged to Zhang Dali, an art student who had spent time in Italy and discovered graffiti culture there. On his return to China, swathes of its cities were being razed to make way for development. Workers were daubing the character chai, meaning “demolish”, on buildings due to be torn down. Mr Zhang took his cans to the same walls in protest at this often brutal upheaval.
Mr Zhang is widely regarded as China’s first modern graffiti artist. More recent ones are influenced by skateboarding culture or rap music. The art form is still in its infancy in China—it is far less commonly seen than in the West. But Liu Yuansheng, co-author of “Beijing Graffiti”, published in 2020, reckons the number of practitioners in the capital has at times swelled to 200.

Cities are riddled with CCTV cameras and teeming with law-enforcement officers. But it is not the threat of punishment that deters people from becoming graffiti artists. Doodlers rarely face more than a fine of 500 yuan ($80) and a day in police custody. Those caught tagging often get away with a promise to paint over their work. Sometimes the public defends such art. Residents in the central city of Wuhan called on officers to remove advertisements that had been pasted over a work by Rui Huang, a local artist. They felt that the ads had defaced his graffiti.
It may simply be that few people even consider spraying walls without permission. There is no tradition of guerrilla art used by criminal gangs to mark their territory or by protesters to attack the government. Mr Zhang’s poke at developers was a rare kind of dissent. The ruins gave him cover—officials turned a blind eye, knowing his works would soon be bulldozed.
China does have a history of using walls to express dissent in written form, however. A famous example occurred during the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79 when people flocked to the brick wall of a bus station in Beijing to put up “big-character posters” demanding greater political freedom. A constitutional right to put up such posters was scrapped in 1980. These days mural self-expression rarely goes beyond unauthorised “throwies”, or two-tone tags in bubble-like writing, which can be seen on walls in Beijing.
Local governments sometimes even sponsor street art, regarding it as a sign of modernisation. In the run-up to the Olympic games that were held in Beijing in 2008, officials in the capital encouraged artists to paint a 300-metre-long “graffiti wall”. Designs were vetted first. A street in the south-western city of Chongqing is home to one of the world’s largest graffiti projects (pictured). It was created, with official approval, by 800 painters. This year Wuhan paid local crews to draw graffiti on a tram and several public buses.
There are others, however, who barely qualify as artists who scribble on walls. A Chinese citizen in Sydney, who goes by the name Lil Quacky, collects graffiti in an Instagram account called “chinesegraffitihub” (the app is blocked in China). Quacky began the project last year after noticing that someone had rewritten a roadside slogan in China that had urged people to carry away their rubbish. It had been changed to “Carry away your love.” Most graffiti submitted to Quacky consists of untidy spray-painted sentences. “Are they enough to shock passers-by, to make them think, to make them stay for a while?” are Quacky’s criteria for posting them online. Hundreds of examples have passed the test. ■",2
1559,"THERE ARE things that democratic governments are not supposed to do. They are not supposed to change the rules of the game at the last minute because they are going to lose. They are not supposed to make it easier to take money for favours. They are not supposed to force MPs to do things that make them hang their heads in shame. Yet on November 3rd Boris Johnson’s government did all this and more. The father of the House, Peter Bottomley, declared that he could not in conscience vote with his party. Younger Tory MPs with careers still to make looked embarrassed.
On October 26th Parliament’s standards committee issued a damning report on Owen Paterson, a veteran MP and leading Brexiteer. He was guilty of “an egregious case of paid advocacy” and had “brought the House into disrepute”, it said. He should be suspended for 30 days, long enough to trigger a recall if enough voters demanded it. Mr Paterson had lobbied ministers and officials on behalf of two companies, Randox, a clinical-diagnostics firm, and Lynn’s Country Foods, a meat processor and distributor. They paid him more than £100,000 ($137,000) a year between them for consulting work.

The report brought a furious rebuttal from Mr Paterson and a fusillade of complaints from his friends in Parliament and the media. They accused the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, of bias against Tories, particularly Brexiteers, of having used the two-year-long inquiry to torment Mr Paterson (his wife, Rose, took her own life during it) and, in the Daily Telegraph, of wearing a nose-stud and refusing to condemn the IRA.
If the Tories disagreed with the verdict, they could have voted to reject the report or reduce Mr Paterson’s suspension. Instead Dame Andrea Leadsom, a former leader of the Commons, tabled an amendment to create a new committee to fix “potential defects” in the disciplinary system. The government then used its might to rescue Mr Paterson by imposing a three-line whip on its MPs to vote for the amendment.
His allies had little to say about the evidence against him, probably because it was overwhelming. He had lobbied ministers and officials not once but repeatedly, using contacts acquired when he was secretary of state for Northern Ireland and then the environment. He used his parliamentary office for business meetings, and parliament-headed notepaper for lobbying. He claimed in his defence that he raised issues of food safety with the Food Standards Agency. But after that he made further attempts to contact officials and to promote “Randox’s superior technology”. The committee concluded that “no previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of confusion between the private and public interest”.
Instead, Mr Paterson’s supporters criticised the process. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the house, argued that it had denied him the right of appeal as required by “natural justice”, a phrase he and other Tories used with the reverence of Thomist scholars. In fact, the system offers several chances for reconsideration—the standards committee can reject the commissioner’s report and even if it does not, the House of Commons has final say. The committee read all the evidence Mr Paterson presented, and no court is obliged to listen to any and all supporters a defendant nominates.
Whatever the current system’s failings, the government’s plan was worse. The new committee was to dispense with the independent commissioner and consist entirely of MPs, with a built-in Tory majority. It made a nonsense of Mr Rees-Mogg’s talk of an appeals process: what sort of appeal court is controlled by the governing political party? Other parties said that their MPs would refuse to sit on it.
As if to acknowledge these shortcomings, on November 4th the government appeared to back down. It would, Mr Rees-Mogg said, bring about reform on a “cross-party” basis and break the link between Mr Paterson’s case and future cases. Mr Paterson himself resigned as an MP, though he continued to insist he was innocent of wrongdoing.
Today’s system is itself the product of the cash-for-questions imbroglio in 1994 and the parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009. Yet the government is now dismantling it to wish away another money-related scandal. Almost a quarter of the 59 backbenchers who signed Dame Andrea’s amendment had previously been found in breach of parliamentary standards. David Cameron, the prime minister from 2010 to 2016, was recently hauled over the coals for lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital, a financial company that later failed. Yet the government has now protected yet another Tory MP who used his office to lobby.
The Paterson affair looks likely to further undermine public trust in politicians in general and Tories in particular. How will rich rewards for lobbying go down with the Conservative Party’s new working-class voters in northern constituencies? That MPs voted for the amendment by just 250 to 232, despite a government majority of 80 and a three-line whip, suggests many Tory MPs are uneasy. Mr Rees-Mogg closed his speech by saying that “sometimes to do the right thing, one has to accept a degree of opprobrium”. The government has just earned a great deal of opprobrium by doing the wrong thing. ■
Editor’s note (November 4th 2021): This story has been updated since its initial publication",2
1560,"ON OCTOBER 19th, USA Today, an American newspaper, reported that surgeons in New York had successfully transplanted a pig kidney into a human subject. The organ was successfully attached for three days in an experimental procedure on a brain-dead patient. It was the culmination of years of work; scientists have dreamed of xenotransplantation, in which organs from animals are put into humans, for decades. The successful transplant shows both how far science has come in this process, and how far it still has to go.
In 2014, a firm called Synthetic Genomics in La Jolla, California, began work on a unique and radical project. The idea was to make a raft of genetic changes to pigs so that their organs would be more suitable for transplantation into humans without rejection. The purpose was to address the growing shortage of organs for transplantation. Synthetic Genomics partnered with another biotech firm, United Therapeutics Corporation, based in Silver Spring, Maryland. United Therapeutics reckons that in America alone, 1m people each year have end-stage organ disease and may need a heart, kidney, or lung transplant. 
For years, attempts to take xenotransplantation forward failed, largely because of problems stemming from immune rejection of the foreign organ. But by 2014, when United Therapeutics started working with Synthetic Genomics, the growing availability of gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR seemed to bring the goal of creating a more transplantable organ within closer reach. 
Martine Rothblatt, who founded United Therapeutics, has a personal stake in the outcome: her daughter has a rare and incurable lung condition, and may at some point require a transplant. Seven years ago the firm began to engineer a variety of genes into pigs with the goal of making their organs work more harmoniously when transplanted into the human body. Pigs have been the focus of most research in xenotransplantation because, among other things, their organs are the right size. Organs taken from a cow would be too large, while those from a goat would be too small.
There were a number of problems to solve—the first being rampant inflammation inside the pig organ after removal. Another is blood clots. Then there are issues with human antibody and T-cell responses, which can cause the recipient’s body to quickly reject the organ. Humans lack an enzyme called alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase. In pigs, this enzyme places a sugar on the surfaces of their cells—something the human immune system immediately notices as foreign and rejects. 
So anyone who wanted to transplant a pig’s organ into a person had to first knock out the enzyme-making genes in pigs. This problem was solved in 2003, long prior to the advent of gene-editing. A firm called Revivicor, now a unit within United Therapeutics, created the world's first pig without those genes, now dubbed GalSafe. 
Comments by a surgeon who performed the surgery yesterday suggest that the transplant involved only taking an organ from a GalSafe pig, without further genetic modification. Many questions remain. United Therapeutics declined an interview request, and this work has not been published in a journal. But if removing the enzyme-making gene is the only genetic change made to the pig that provided the kidney, this suggests that there remains much work ahead for United Therapeutics and the future of xenotransplantable organs. 
The firm has been working on a “ten-gene pig”, which presumably refers to the number of modifications that have been made to the pig’s genome. One genetic change it has made is to add a human gene to pigs that produces a human protein called CD46, which moderates the action of the immune system. The firm is also inserting anticoagulant genes to prevent blood clots forming in the transplanted organ, and genes that will make organ rejection by T-cells less likely. The long-term goal is to make pig organs so compatible with the human body that the drug therapy required would be the same as is currently used for human-to-human organ transplants. Beyond this the firm is also working on more futuristic ideas, such as manufactured organs that would need no immunosuppressant use at all.
These endeavours are essential. Demand for organs is far outpacing supply. Although the news will bring hope to many on the waiting lists for an organ transplant, animal organs will not be used routinely for years to come.
Regulatory agencies would do well to focus on how these innovations should be governed. For instance, do pigs modified by CRISPR, either to disrupt pigs’ genes or insert human ones, fall within existing legal frameworks for genetically-modified organisms? In Europe these animals would likely qualify as GMOs. China has yet to put a regulatory regime in place. 
The conundrums do not stop there. Koko Kwisda at the Centre for Ethics and Law in the Life Sciences, Leibniz University Hannover, and colleagues, write in Nature Biotechnology this July, “Is the pig as a whole a medical device or a medicinal product? Or is the pig merely an incubator for the organ transplant?” Just as researchers start to see a path through the quagmire of xenotransplantation, regulations may yet bog them down. ■",2
1561,"SHOPPING CENTRES should be a symbol of South Africa’s progress. Their core customers, as well as their staff, are the black middle class that has grown since apartheid ended. In the past week, however, looters have destroyed malls in cities such as Pretoria, Durban and Johannesburg. Thousands of criminals have ransacked shops, departing unchallenged with their booty.
The mayhem does not end there. Arsonists have burnt lorries along the country’s major motorway, forcing its closure. Vandals have attacked infrastructure, including industrial warehouses and more than 100 telecommunications towers. The country’s largest oil refinery is shut. Rioters have blocked roads used by nurses and doctors to reach hospitals dealing with a massive third wave of covid-19. Ambulances have been attacked. Vaccination sites have shuttered. Thousands of businesses have been wrecked; many will never reopen. Food, petrol and medicines are in short supply in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and parts of Gauteng, which contains Johannesburg. At least 72 people have been killed and more than 1,234 arrested. The worst violence since the dawn of democracy in 1994 not only threatens the presidency of Cyril Ramaphosa but shows how his enemies can exploit the weakness of the post-apartheid state.

In South Africa there are plenty of sources of discontent. The official unemployment rate is the highest in the world, according to the World Bank. Gaping inequality means a minority enjoys a rich-world standard of living while most people struggle to get by. Parts of the country regularly go without power and water. The police are a blend of incompetence and cruelty. The pandemic has made life harder in every way. And when corruption is rampant, some ask, what is raiding a supermarket compared with looting a state airline or the national energy company?
But the riots are not random. They have been urged on by supporters of Jacob Zuma, the former president whose faction of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) wants to topple Mr Ramaphosa. On June 29th the Constitutional Court sentenced Mr Zuma to 15 months behind bars for refusing to appear before a judge-led inquiry into corruption during his time in office from 2009-18. Just before midnight on July 7th, as the highest court’s deadline for the police to arrest him approached, Mr Zuma was taken into custody. His allies, including family members, then spread misinformation about the basis for his arrest and encouraged unrest. His foundation called it the “righteous anger of the people...which others have characterised as violence”, in response to the “violent provocation” of his sentencing.

Some Zuma supporters may have done more than applaud the destruction. In a veiled reference to the Zulu nationalists who make up Mr Zuma’s base, Mr Ramaphosa said on July 12th that “there may have been some people who sought to agitate for violence and disorder along ethnic lines.” The next day, Ayanda Dlodlo, the State Security Minister, said the government was investigating whether former agents of the domestic spy agency and senior ANC members aligned with Mr Zuma had actively organised some of the violence. On July 14th News24, a South African outlet, reported that the government was looking into allegations that Thulani Dlomo, a Zuma-era spy boss and former ambassador, was one of the instigators.

Some 25,000 troops will soon be deployed, said the defence minister on July 14th. They are needed. In KZN, Mr Zuma’s stronghold, the violence was still unabated as The Economist went to press. Police were conspicuous by their absence at the sites of some of the worst criminality. The first state of emergency since the apartheid era is being considered, according to government ministers. Several business groups are pleading for it.
As is often the case, South Africans let down by the state are taking matters into their own hands. In parts of KZN, armed neighbourhood groups are controlling entry to and exit from their areas. The country’s many private-security firms, which between them have more than three times as many guards as there are police officers, are patrolling suburbs and defending businesses. In Johannesburg townships, such as Alexandra and Soweto, community groups are banding together to protect malls and sweep up the broken glass.
Recovery will take years. Some South African business owners, teetering after years of slow growth, will give up or go overseas. Some foreign investors will look at the chaos, see every bad stereotype about South Africa confirmed, and put their money elsewhere. Already strained public finances will be hit by the cost of rebuilding infrastructure and of payouts from a state insurer used by firms to cover against riots. Even after trashed, burned buildings have been repaired, the damage to the social fabric may prove enduring.
Mr Ramaphosa has defined his presidency as the opposite of Mr Zuma’s. In his speech on July 12th he told the country: “This is not who we are as South Africans. This is not us.” He pledged to “restore calm and order”. But if his government does not do so soon, it will cement the malign legacy of his predecessor and emphasise his own weakness. Mr Zuma may no longer be in charge. But is anyone? ■

1562,"THE LIST of 97 politicians who registered to run for president of the Philippines by the deadline of October 8th was missing one crucial candidate: the front-runner. An opinion poll conducted last month found that 20% of respondents wanted Sara Duterte, the mayor of Davao City, to replace Rodrigo Duterte, her father and the current president, when the single six-year term allowed to him by the constitution comes to an end in June. There is plenty of precedent for such a succession. Mr Duterte’s two immediate predecessors, Benigno Aquino and Gloria Arroyo, were themselves both presidential offspring.
Ms Duterte instead registered her candidacy for another term as Davao City’s mayor, insisting that was the post she wanted. Yet she has a way back into the presidential race. Senator Ronald dela Rosa, a former chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) who led Mr Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, registered his candidacy at the last minute. The rules allow him to give up his place for another person until November 15th.

Ms Duterte herself has so far sent mixed messages. She first showed interest in running for president, then reluctance. Her father, for his part, indicated first that he was against her running, then that he was for it, then that she would definitely run, and then, after she caught covid-19 on October 9th, that she definitely would not.
All that posturing—including Mr dela Rosa’s candidacy—may be false coyness, part of a rigmarole meant to disguise the Dutertes’ ambition to prolong their hold on power. The idea would be to give the appearance that Ms Duterte is running only in response to persistent public demand. Mr Duterte used similar tactics himself when he ran for president six years ago, entering the race late and replacing a placeholder on the register of candidates.
The independent Commission on Elections will probably remove most of the 97 candidates from the register on the grounds that they are simply making a nuisance of themselves. But the latest survey indicated that several could be serious challengers to Ms Duterte. Her nearest rival is Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, an ex-senator and the only son of Ferdinand Marcos, a corrupt and despotic former president. He was the choice of 15% of respondents. Another 13% said they would prefer Isko Moreno, the mayor of Manila. As a boy, Mr Moreno rummaged though rubbish for food, but grew up to be a film actor and eventually to run his home town. Senator Manny Pacquiao, a world-champion boxer, was the choice of 12%. Mr Pacquiao is backed by one of the two rival factions of the governing party, PDP-Laban. The other faction backs Mr dela Rosa.
Leni Robredo, the vice-president, who in effect is also the leader of the opposition, was the choice of less than a tenth of the respondents. Another also-ran was Senator Panfilo Lacson, another former chief of police. For a spell, Mr Lacson was a fugitive from justice, wanted on murder charges that have since been dropped. The survey was conducted before Mr dela Rosa emerged as a candidate.
Mr Duterte, for his part, says his plan after his term ends is to retire to Davao City and prepare a defence against the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is investigating whether his war on drugs amounts to a crime against humanity. If Ms Duterte were to become president, she would be in a position to perform an enormous service for her father, Mr dela Rosa and sections of the PNP by shielding them from the investigation. Among the other candidates, only Mr Marcos has declared that he would protect the drug warriors from international courts. The rest have indicated various degrees of openness to the ICC investigation. They are likely to split the pro-investigation vote. Yet Mr Marcos and Ms Duterte or Mr dela Rosa, whichever runs, may end up dividing those voters who are opposed to the investigation.
Such political currents make the outcome of the election in May uncertain. But Ms Duterte’s popularity gives her a better chance of winning than Mr dela Rosa. He, as well as Mr Duterte, would no doubt be happy if she leaves Davao City behind and follows her father’s trail to Manila.■",2

IF A VENGEFUL deity were to design a weapon to wield against the global supply chains that characterise modern business, it might well hit on a virus which hit production facilities all around the world. In the face of covid-19, though, the sinews of business have, for the most part, held up remarkably well.
Air freight has suffered, but shipping has steamed on—and its comparatively long transit times have provided a buffer to the supply shocks which followed China’s shutdown. Prologis, an American company which operates one-and-a-half Manhattans-worth of warehouse space around the world, says that 95% of its customers have remained at least partially operational. Systemic risks such as those which brought the banking industry crashing down during the financial crisis have, as yet, failed to materialise.

This is not to say that business is booming. But it is demand, not supply, that is lacking. To the extent that the sinew is not working it is for want of a task, not for want of strength.
That companies have been aflurry over their supply chains is not in doubt. From January to May supply-chain disruption was mentioned nearly 30,000 times in the earnings calls of the world’s 2,000 biggest listed firms, up from 23,000 in the same period last year. Mentions of “efficiency” declined from 8,100 to 6,700. Managers know that supply chains are good conduits of economic pain. Looking at the aftermath of the tsunami and earthquake which hit northern Japan in 2011 Vinod Singhal, Brian Jacobs and Kevin Hendricks, three management scholars, found that the share prices of suppliers to companies directly affected dropped by 4%, and those of their customers by 3%.
The sources of disruption, and thus pain, can be impressively obscure. In 2012, a month after a fire at a factory in Germany, carmakers from Düsseldorf to Detroit found themselves facing production cuts. It turned out that Evonik, the factory’s owner, was responsible for between a quarter to a half of the world’s supply of cyclododecatriene, a precursor chemical to a resin widely used in the business. Otto Kocsis, who works for Zurich, an insurance firm, has found that while the proportion of disruptions that can be attributed to “tier one” suppliers—those with which manufacturers deal directly—fell during the first half of the 2010s, the proportion which could be attributed to companies that manufacturers hardly knew they were dealing with, like Evonik, shot up.
One way to avoid such pain is to keep as diverse a supplier base as feasible—something which also helps you deal with customers quick to change their fancies. Zara, a Spanish fashion retailer, exemplifies the approach, with its different frock lines reaching the shops entirely independently. Another is to maintain spare manufacturing capacity. Though companies may pride themselves on their lean manufacturing, the world’s factories do not typically run at full tilt: across the world the proportion of their potential capacity which industrial firms actually use has been flat or falling over the past two decades.
Then there is inventory. It is widely assumed that modern supply chains relentlessly eat away at this source of resilience, but that is not entirely true. Investors can punish firms if they start piling up stock, especially if there are other signs of trouble. But they also look askance at firms that cut too close to the bone.
Hong Chen, Murray Frank and Owen Wu, another trio of business-school professors, have looked at the period between 1981 and 2000 when average inventories in America Inc declined from 96 days to 81 days. The share prices of the companies which slashed inventories by the most and of those which did not cut at all both suffered compared with those which made moderate cuts. Work by Ananth Raman and a colleague at the Harvard Business School shows that when a sharp increase in operational performance is followed by some sort of downturn, investors pay heed to the nature of the setback. If it is down to some exogenous factor, such as a flood, the firm goes unrebuked. If it is down to an internal issue, and so suggestive of excessive cost-cutting, returns on investment decline by 3.8 percentage points.

Since the financial crisis of 2007-09 companies have actually been increasing the amount of stock they have on hand. In America the ratio of inventories to sales just before the pandemic had risen to levels last seen in the early 2000s (see chart). The expansion of warehouse space that has recently been seen around the world is not just down to the rise of e-commerce—which typically requires three times as much as retailers who sell in physical locations. Some is down to firms concentrating on being near to the consumer, which increases the amount of storage a company needs. Prologis says that there has been an uptick in pricier short-term leases in warehouse space over the past few years, suggesting that companies are happy to pay a premium for flexibility.
Further evidence for buffering in the system can be seen in figures on working capital, which is calculated by subtracting what companies owe suppliers from the value of their inventories plus what they are owed by customers. Reducing working capital is the cheapest way for firms to get cash, since they need pay no interest to do so. Yet many companies are not making the most of it.
A recent survey of 15,000 large firms undertaken by PwC, a consultancy, divided them into quartiles based on their working-capital performance. If each firm in the three lower quartiles matched the performance of companies in the quartile above which were in the same line of business they would liberate $1.4trn in cash, equivalent to 55% of their cumulative capital spending. But despite this theoretically copious incentive, working-capital efficiency has not changed since 2016. Part of this is down to the increase in inventories seen in recent years, but another factor is reduced payables. Companies appear willing to spend money on their relationships with suppliers, which speaks to a sensitivity to supply-chain management.
It may also speak to the fact that many companies are already sitting on stacks of cash. Few boast sofas as plumply padded as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, which have $270bn in net cash between them, enough to finance many countries’ covid-related fiscal stimulus. But the total cash holdings of the world’s 2,000 biggest listed non-financial corporations increased from $6.6trn in 2010 to $14.2trn today.
Diversified suppliers, spare capacity, inventory and cash provide companies, especially big ones, with a certain degree of security. But whether their current “portfolios of resilience”, as Panos Kouvelis of the Boeing Centre for Supply Chain Innovation at Washington University puts it, can withstand the pandemic is another matter altogether. With respect to supply chains, the answer has so far been yes. But appetite for most non-essential goods and services among social-distancing consumers has evaporated. For some things, like air travel, ocean cruises or cinema, it may never fully recover.
How, though, could business have been better prepared? It might be possible, in principle, to self-insure against a disastrous drop in overall demand by sacrificing margins in order to build up buffers and to keep open strategic options the company will probably never willingly choose to use. But good luck convincing investors of that approach. Strategies which pay off handsomely in the event of even the worst worst case are terribly expensive.
Consider the Eurekahedge Tail Risk Hedge Fund Index, which tracks vehicles that try to make money out of “black swans”, highly improbable events that have a very large impact. If you had bet on the index on January 1st this year you would have seen a rise of 52%. But if you had bet on January 1st 2008 you would now be 25% below where you started. Insuring against lots of rare risks can never be cheap. Mr Kocsis says that insurance policies against disruptions caused by problems throughout the supply chain, including insolvencies of business partners, tend to cost 1% or more of the turnover insured annually. That is ten times what it would cost to protect the same amount of stock sitting in a warehouse from property damage.
Straighten out
Another worry is that a company which spends on resilience may end up at a disadvantage if others survive without making such provisions, for example by extracting concessions from suppliers or bail-outs from governments, says Debra Dandeneau of Baker McKenzie, a law firm. Such firms would get the benefits of insurance without having paid the premiums.
Today, having built up buffers that keep things going looks smart. But in time the attractions of cutting back will begin to assert themselves again. Yes, long supply chains bring some added risk. But as ManMohan Sodhi of the Cass Business School in London puts it, “Nothing in the operational world is risk-free.” An American company that offloads capital-intensive operations to suppliers in China is weighing the boost in value that provides against the risks—though if the Chinese supplier does a deal with one in Vietnam which then does a deal in Bangladesh, the level of risk may be hard to assess. Low inventories may expose you to disruptions in supply, but they save you from losses due to excessively rosy forecasts of demand, notes Sunil Chopra of the Kellogg School of Management in Chicago. The boss of a big European retailer doubts that his industry will return to heavy stockholding. “We value that efficiency because it keeps prices low,” he explains.
In the age of covid-19 producing closer to home is both an understandable urge and smiled on by many national governments (see article), especially for necessities like medicines or face-masks. But a company’s home country is not necessarily the least disruptive place for operations. Many factories in America are closed or running at low capacity: on May 11th Elon Musk reopened the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, in defiance of a public-health order from Alameda county. Meanwhile, Tim Cook of Apple, which continues to make most of its iPhones in China—and sell millions to Chinese consumers—recently told investors that “we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain.”
Mr Kouvelis expects companies mostly to go back to their old ways of thinking about the efficiency-resilience trade-off. Firms “manage one shock at a time”, he says. Having so far emerged from this one relatively unscathed, Mr Cook and others may well stick to Andrew Carnegie’s advice to “put all your good eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.” Until the next black swan waddles along. ■

1564,"AS BIRTHDAY PRESENTS go, a 435km railway line that is expected to open this month in Tibet will be among the most lavish. To seekers of high-altitude thrills, it is one that will be cherished. The 37bn-yuan ($5.7bn) track extends from the region’s capital Lhasa eastward to the city of Nyingchi, which is Tibetan for “Throne of the Sun”. It is the region’s first electrified railway; its trains will be Tibet’s fastest. Officials call it a gift for the Communist Party’s 100th birthday, which will be officially celebrated on July 1st.
But the new line is only part of what China calls the “project of the century”. This involves building Tibet’s second rail link with China’s interior at a total cost that state media say could be about ten times that of the Lhasa-Nyingchi stretch, with even greater engineering challenges yet to come. The section about to open was no pushover. Tunnels comprise nearly half of its length. Workers had to brave landslides, poisonous gas from broken rock, intense cold as well as an oxygen-starved atmosphere at more than 5,000 metres above sea level—roughly the altitude of Mount Everest’s base camps. When completed in 2030, the railway will connect Lhasa with Chengdu, the capital of neighbouring Sichuan province. At a maximum speed of 160kph, the journey will take just 12 hours, a third of the time now required by road.

To the party, it appears no expense is too great in its campaign to integrate the vast, isolated region more closely with the interior. The first rail link, which opened in 2006, was also an engineering feat. Long lengths of that line from Qinghai province had to be laid over permafrost, using high-tech means to prevent temperature fluctuations from damaging the track.

The most obvious impact has been on tourism. In 2005 Tibet received fewer than 2m visits by tourists. By 2018 the number had soared to 33m trips (only 0.7% of them by foreigners). The government is aiming for 61m by 2025—about 17 times the number of Tibet’s inhabitants. Some Tibetans worry their culture is being swamped. An influx of Han Chinese migrants, including shopkeepers and others cashing in on the tourism boom, may have fuelled ethnic tensions that caused an explosion of unrest in Lhasa and elsewhere across the Tibet plateau in 2008. Since then the government has clamped down even harder on dissent in the region.
Strategic thinkers in India worry, too. The new railway runs close to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Chinese officials sometimes refer to as “south Tibet” and claim as Chinese territory. China’s army swept into it during a brief but bloody border war in 1962, before pulling back again. India is annoyed enough by China’s other big infrastructure project in the area: the damming of the Yarlung Tsangpo river (as it calls the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra), which the new railway crosses 16 times. It accuses China of threatening India’s water security. There is little India can do. China is telling it “you are not in my league,” says Ashok Swain of Uppsala University. The trains will keep on running regardless of any complaints. ■",2

ON MAY 15TH the American government announced a startling escalation in its campaign against Huawei, a Chinese company which is the largest provider of telecoms equipment in the world. American politicians and officials have long expressed concerns that mobile networks which rely on Huawei could allow snooping and sabotage by China. In May 2019, citing alleged violations of sanctions against Iran—charges Huawei denies—America used powers designed to stop the transfer of military technology to bar the company from receiving American components vital to the systems it sells.
Those measures had loopholes: suppliers could keep on selling Huawei many components as long as they were made in facilities outside America. So this year America targeted the whole supply chain: as of September it will be seeking to stop companies around the world from using software or hardware that originally comes from America to manufacture components based on Huawei’s designs.

The move was a serious blow to the company. It may well have brought a sigh of relief in Britain. In January Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, had approved a substantial if clearly demarcated role for Huawei in Britain’s 5G telecoms infrastructure. Its promise of a faster, more commodious type of mobile broadband that allows completely new internet applications and might prove necessary for self-driving cars has made 5G a touchstone for seers scrying the next big thing and for politicians who pay heed to them. Infrastructure spending stamped with such a hallmark of futurity is right up Mr Johnson’s alley. If Britain’s existing procedures for overseeing Huawei’s role in telecoms infrastructure were applied, the government argued at the time, Huawei’s equipment could be used in “non core” parts of the network, and Britain could get its 5G systems up and running considerably sooner, and cheaper, than would otherwise be possible.
This decision was unpopular both with the White House and with a significant faction within Mr Johnson’s Conservative Party, with the opposition happily backing the rebels. Dismay over China’s imposition of new security laws on Hong Kong, in breach of the agreement under which the territory was handed back to it, heightened feelings further. America’s new salvo of sanctions provided a plausible reason for changing course. The inevitable dislocation to Huawei’s supply chains, the government said, would make relying on the company riskier. The new measures also meant that the vaunted system whereby British spooks vetted Huawei equipment would no longer be able to do its job: it would itself fall foul of the American sanctions.
On July 14th the government said it will ban mobile-network operators in Britain from buying Huawei equipment for their 5G networks, and told them to remove equipment already installed by 2027. Well before that—by the time of the next election, in 2024—the country would be on an “irreversible path” to expunging the Chinese firm from its networks, said Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary.
Mr Trump immediately took credit for having “convinced many countries” not to use Huawei. While some have been on board for a while—Australia banned Huawei 5G equipment in 2018—others have moved more recently. In June telecoms companies in Canada and Singapore announced plans for 5G networks built around equipment provided by Huawei’s main rivals, Ericsson, a Swedish firm, and Nokia, a Finnish one (see chart 1). In both cases Huawei had previously been a possible provider. On July 6th the head of the French cyber-security agency advised network operators which do not currently use Huawei not to plump for it in future.

Now all eyes are on Germany, which has said it will decide on the matter in the autumn. If it follows America’s urging and Britain’s example then the rest of the EU will probably go the same way, and a significant corner will have been turned. Western communications systems will be a bit less insecure. America will have used its sovereign might to humble one of China’s national champions, and China will doubtless be responding. The technophilic imperative that has made 5G a totem of the fully networked future will have had its momentum checked, at least a little, by a mixture of countries not wanting to upset America and being willing to upset a China they find increasingly disturbing.
The last domino
Perhaps most profoundly, such a change may leave behind it a world where governments are less willing to depend on companies from countries with divergent interests to supply capacities they deem strategic. “At the heart of this is a dilemma which the West has not faced before: how to cope with a technology superpower whose values are fundamentally opposed to our own,” in the words of Robert Hannigan, a former boss of GCHQ, the British signals-intelligence agency.
Germany’s decision is not a done deal. Deutsche Telekom (DT), a 32%-state-owned company, is the country’s largest mobile provider and already relies heavily on Huawei equipment. It has lobbied strongly against any action that would make it harder for it to roll out 5G. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, often eager to defend the interests of German industry, has backed the firm. Angela Merkel, the chancellor, has not wanted any trouble with China (see article).
Yet, like the British Conservatives, Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats have split on the issue. As Norbert Röttgen, a conservative member of parliament and one of the leaders of the anti-Huawei faction, has put it, “We cannot trust the Chinese state and the Chinese Communist Party with our 5G network.” The Social Democrats, who are part of the governing grand coalition, and the opposition Greens are also opposed to letting Huawei play. “If there were a vote in parliament today, Huawei would lose,” says Thorsten Benner of Global Public Policy Institute, a think-tank based in Berlin.
Mrs Merkel, who will make the final decision, has so far been circumspect. She says she does not want to exclude a company on the basis of its nationality and that any firm that complies with certain security standards should be allowed to sell its wares in Germany. In late 2019 China’s ambassador in Berlin threatened retaliation against German companies should the government exclude Huawei from its 5G plans, and insiders say it is a threat the chancellor takes seriously. Meanwhile, DT is busily creating the aura of a done deal. It intends to provide basic 5G services to 40m Germans by the end of this month using equipment from both Huawei and Ericsson, though users will see little benefit at this stage. The company has also decided to intensify its co-operation with the Chinese firm in cloud computing and other areas.
There are many reasons for Europeans to be uncomfortable siding with America. Having missed the boat on the rise of consumer tech—Europe still bemoans the lack of the home-grown Google or Amazon—European politicians fear falling further behind if they delay 5G and the various wonders it is held to enable, such as an “internet of things”. Mobile-network operators play up these fears, with an eye to either keeping their ties to Huawei or receiving some form of compensation if it were to be proscribed. By combining direct costs with estimates of lost GDP they argue that ditching Huawei will cost the continent tens of billions of euros.
Regulators and independent observers are not convinced. Mr Dowden, admittedly an interested party, put the impact of Britain’s volte-face at two or three years’ delay and £2bn or so. A study by Strand Consult, a research outfit, thinks that the cost of eschewing Huawei would be quite modest for Europe as a whole, given that its ageing 4G kit would soon have to be replaced anyway. It estimates a total of around $3.5bn, no more than $7 per mobile customer.

That said, not all European mobile-phone customers will get the same deal. The EU has failed to create a single digital market; an operator in Poland cannot sell services to a customer in Sweden in the same way New York-based Verizon sells to Californians. So where China and America have three network operators each, Europe has more than 100 (see chart 2). In some markets, such as Belgium, Germany and Poland, the local companies are highly reliant on Huawei; companies in Finland, Ireland and Spain would face much lower costs if forced to make the switch.
Shrunken titans
The multiplicity of operators is a function of EU policy. Denied a continent-wide framework that would let them compete in far-off markets, telecoms companies are also kept from consolidating at home; the EU commission likes there to be four providers in each market. The resultant competition provides a stonking deal for customers. In Europe the average revenue per mobile-phone user is less than €15 ($17) a month. The average American user pays more than twice that. Rewheel, a data company, says that the cheapest unlimited-data plan in America costs €74 a month. In Germany the figure is €40, in Britain €22.
For network operators this fierce level of competition, coupled with the high costs of comparatively small, unconsolidated markets, constitutes a serious drag. Some carriers, including DT and Vodafone, a British operator, have returns on capital lower than their costs of capital: not the kind of business model that will find willing shareholders in the long term. Emmet Kelly of Morgan Stanley, a bank, points out that the market capitalisation of Europe’s major operators has shrunk from over €1trn in June 2000 to €258bn this June—a loss of 81% in real terms. Telefónica of Spain and Orange in France, once giants, are now not much more than minnows.
Mobile-network operators have long complained to the commission that the thin margins which scare away investors leave them unable to splash out on upgrades such as 5G, and that as a result Europe will fall behind its peers. China is investing massively in 5G and America is intent on keeping up; Mr Trump has called 5G “a race America must win”. The GSMA, which represents mobile-network operators, says that by 2025 half of all mobile users in America and the richer bits of Asia (including China) will be on 5G, compared with just one-third of Europeans.
In the past, Brussels has turned a deaf ear to such griping. The EU’s download speeds have remained comparable to those in America; the price of data services has fallen even faster than usage has grown: what’s the problem? But it is possible that a ban on Huawei could catalyse the “new deal” on regulation that the operators crave. Governments which realise that their actions are delaying 5G and driving up its costs might see their way to easing merger restrictions. The spectrum needed for mobile services, which in Europe is often sold through auctions designed to maximise revenue, might be given away instead, as happens in China and Japan. The lobbyists’ list is long. The industry takes courage from last year’s appointment of Thierry Breton, who was once boss of France Télécom (now Orange), as commissioner for the internal market.
Pending such a deal things might just slow down. There is already agreement among analysts that despite the hoopla 5G networks will be rolled out more slowly than the previous 4G ones were. This year’s 5G-spectrum auctions in France, Spain and Poland have been delayed by the covid-19 pandemic, which may quietly suit some operators. The equipment needed for 5G is only going to get cheaper and more reliable, as all chip-based kit does.

To the extent that there is indeed a race, it will not necessarily be won by those who get off to the fastest start. The services on offer so far are mostly just a faster version of 4G, and sometimes in practice the speed is not all that great. The most revolutionary aspect of 5G technology—the way in which it allows the workings of a network to be reconfigured through software and thus tailored to specific needs—will need years to come into its own. Profitable business models will take time to emerge.
A continent of its own
A slower roll-out might also ease pressure on Ericsson and Nokia. The two Nordic companies will plainly benefit from countries turning away from Huawei, even if, as looks likely, they lose sales in China. They are precisely the kinds of industrial champion Europe is trying to promote these days, but there are worries about whether they can seize the moment. They now enjoy a duopoly in America (for a while there was talk of an American company taking a stake in one of them, but this idea seems to have been put aside). Some operators question whether, given those commitments, they can meet the needs of a Huawei-free full-speed-ahead Europe too. There is also the awkward fact that, supply chains for electronics being as they are, using European system integrators still means that much of the equipment comes from China.
The difficulties of having only a few suppliers will subside in time. Samsung of South Korea, a country very committed to 5G, is a growing presence. On July 15th Reliance Industries, an Indian conglomerate, announced that its Jio network, which uses a Samsung 4G network, will be building its own 5G infrastructure and selling it to others. Jio is likely to follow in the steps of some other carriers, most notably Rakuten Mobile in Japan, which are betting on networks based on advanced software, off-the-shelf hardware and open standards, thus side-stepping the need for systems integrators like Ericsson, Huawei or Nokia. Widespread implementations are still several years away, though.
Chinese reprisals against countries chucking out Huawei can be expected to come around a great deal sooner. China buys a lot from Europe, with Germany its largest trading partner in the bloc. It also invests quite heavily in the continent, having been courted by many of its leaders. Some of that may now be at risk. On the day of Britain’s U-turn the Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, tweeted that it was “disappointing and wrong”. China is painting the decision as a groundless capitulation to anti-Chinese pressure from America, and saying it calls into question the safety of Chinese investments in Britain, which are many and various.
But Europe does not see China exclusively through a commercial lens. Last year EU leaders designated it a “systemic rival”. The EU has since been working to limit Chinese state-backed groups’ operations in Europe. Its treatment of the Uighur minority, its reluctance to see word of covid-19 spread to the world and its move on Hong Kong have all raised hackles.
That does not mean Germany, or Europe as a whole, will necessarily ditch Huawei. Europe’s China links matter, and it does not like being pushed around by America. Policymakers on the continent have long fumed at the financial muscle that allows American administrations to punish European firms it sees as miscreants by squeezing the banks those firms deal with. But that does not mean it wants its internet infrastructure under the control of a third power that might, in time, aspire to use that control against it. A continental security official points out the underlying irony: “America wants to prevent China being able to do what America currently does to the rest of the world by controlling the financial system.”
The irony, though, does not invalidate the argument. Europe has sometimes acted to maintain its technological autonomy with respect to America in areas where national-security needs and civil infrastructure overlap, such as satellite launchers and navigation systems. In an interview with The Economist last November Emmanuel Macron, the French president, complained about European reliance on American tech platforms. At the same time he called development of 5G “a sovereign matter” and went on to say that “Some elements [of the 5G network] must only be European.” That did not in itself rule out any role for Huawei. But subsequent developments have pushed the continent further in that direction. American pressure may end up seeing Europe take a more assertive view of its “digital sovereignty”.■

1566," (CNN)While the US has been in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic, another public health crisis has surged past a tragic milestone. Over 100,000 people died from drug overdoses between May 2020 and April 2021, according to provisional data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday -- a 28.5% increase from the 12 months prior and a record high for the US.   Though these statistics are new, the problem is not. Overdose deaths have been trending upward for years.  A key aspect of the issue, experts say, has been the rise of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can be up to 100 times more potent than morphine, is much cheaper to produce than traditional plant-based opioids and is often mixed with street drugs without the buyer's knowledge, increasing the risk of a fatal overdose. Combine the growing popularity of fentanyl with a pandemic that has forced people into isolation, and stripped them of the in-person relationships and support systems they depend on, and it's easy to understand the spike in overdose deaths since lockdowns began.  But despite the macabre picture the trend lines paint, there is much that can be done to curb the overdose death rate, says CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who served as the health commissioner of Baltimore from 2014 to 2018 during which time the city had some of the highest opioid overdose rates in the US, and who currently serves as advisory board chair of the Behavioral Health Group, a network of outpatient opioid treatment and recovery centers in the US.  Many of the programs Wen implemented in Baltimore -- including promoting the widespread availability of naloxone, the fast-acting opioid antidote, piloting test strips that can alert users to the presence of fentanyl in street drugs and increasing treatment for opioid use disorders -- she feels have the potential to curb overdose deaths across the nation.  To address the opioid crisis we must refocus on a single mission, says Wen, and remind ourselves that when it comes to public health, we are all striving for the same outcome: saving lives.  The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: Experts have attributed the recent spike in overdose deaths to the pandemic and to the rise of fentanyl. Can you explain how those two factors impacted the overdose death rate? Wen: Prior to the pandemic, we were already having an epidemic of opioid overdoses that was driven primarily by fentanyl, which is many times stronger than heroin and is often used to cut street drugs. So, if someone is taking their usual amount of heroin, for instance, but there's something in there that's many times stronger, they are much more likely to overdose and die.  And then the pandemic happened. Public health resources were already stretched to the limits, so the people working on the opioid crisis had to shift focus to addressing the pandemic. This was necessary, but it also left a gaping hole in the social safety net. On top of that, we know that addiction is a disease of isolation, and recovery depends on relationships. Many people during the pandemic lost their health insurance and the ability to get treatment. Some may have lost other social resources like stable housing or faced food insecurity. Treating their disease of addiction may not have been top of mind. We also can't forget that addiction and mental health issues are diseases of despair, and this pandemic has worsened mental health for so many people. I think that is yet another layered component of what was already a major problem that has lost attention and lost funding and lost people working to solve it. CNN: How can overdose deaths be addressed while the pandemic is still ongoing and resources are still stretched thin? Wen: We can save lives right now through harm reduction practices. That includes getting naloxone, the opioid antidote, to as many people as possible in communities. We should also look at other classic harm reduction practices like making fentanyl test strips widely available. This does not mean condoning or encouraging drug use, but rather if people are going to be using drugs, they need to know if there's fentanyl in their supply so that they can reduce the risk of a fatal overdose. Then there are safe injection facilities, which in Portugal and the other countries have been shown to save lives. They are controversial, but if our focus is going to be on preventing deaths, then we should be looking at all strategies that are effective.  We also need to ensure that people have access to evidence-based treatment. For treating individuals with opioid use disorder, for instance, that means a combination of medications like buprenorphine or methadone, along with psychosocial support. There needs to be adequate insurance coverage for these treatments -- and while telemedicine should be enabled and allowed, we also must also recognize that many patients need brick and mortar care. Ultimately, the treatment for individuals with addiction needs to be viewed the same as treatment for people with any other medical illness.  CNN: What about longer-term solutions that can be implemented?  Wen: Strengthening our public health infrastructure is critical. Covid-19 has laid bare the many problems, including the underinvestment in and undervaluing of our public health system. We have seen what happens when resources are diverted from existing critical priorities to Covid-19. We, of course, need to focus on this because this is an existential emergency, but these other crises have not gone away. CNN: What are some of the barriers to implementing these policies and initiatives you just described? Wen: For the most part, thankfully, there has been bipartisan agreement that this is an urgent issue and needs to be a top priority. There are partisan differences around certain key elements -- criminalizing of drug use, for example. Many of us in public health would say that it is far past time for addiction to be treated as a disease, and not as a crime.  The harm reduction practices that I mentioned earlier are also not universally accepted by policymakers at this point. Most people of various political ideologies would support naloxone, because it's hard to be against the idea that if somebody's overdosing in front of you, you should save their lives. But syringe exchange programs, which are often sites where naloxone is distributed, are controversial. Many parts of the country still do not allow them for fear that they condone drug use, when what they actually do is to prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis, and provide outreach to individuals who could be susceptible to overdose.  In addition, there is a major issue around treatment. The concern here is not even so much political as in a partisan divide, but rather political as in what resources we are willing to devote to this issue. There are solutions we could tap into, but do we have the political will to devote the resources to finally solving this crisis? I understand that there are many funding priorities in front of the Biden administration and in front of Congress. The question is: where does addiction fall in their list of priorities? ​​CNN: When you were health commissioner of Baltimore, you focused heavily on implementing specific measures such as widespread access to naloxone and increased access to treatment as part of your initiative to combat the opioid crisis in the city. Do you think it's possible to implement a similar initiative on a national scale, or is this problem something that needs individualized approaches specific to each locality? Wen: There are general guiding principles that are necessary for addressing addiction in every community. And those principles include harm reduction, increasing access to treatment and strengthening public health infrastructure. Those are the three pillars that are uniform across all parts of the country. When I was the health commissioner in Baltimore, I worked closely with my colleagues in public health around the country, including Dr. Rahul Gupta, who at the time was the commissioner of health in West Virginia. He primarily oversaw a rural constituency and I oversaw an urban one, but together we wrote about how the programs that we implemented are similar. They were tailored to the specific constituencies we represented and the hospitals, nonprofits and community organizations that we worked with. And while there are different methods of reaching people in urban areas versus rural ones, the principles and the guiding values are the same. So, I think there is a way to scale up what we know works.  CNN: Do you see this as an issue that should be primarily addressed at the federal, state or local level of government? Wen: It needs to be a combination. The funding has to come from the federal government and then must be distributed to communities based on level of need. The communities then are best positioned to understand how to use that funding for specific programs or resources in their area. The federal government, though, is not going to give money and say, ""Do whatever you want with it."" There are very clear guidelines on how that money should be spent. And in this regard, the federal government has a major role to play in defining the evidence-based treatment that the funds can be used for. We don't want federal money, for instance, going toward rapid detox programs, which can be harmful and increase the rate of overdoses.  At the same time, states have to do their part. Those that have not expanded Medicaid need to. We need to have policies that treat addiction as we do all other medical illnesses.CNN: What advice would you have for people who are facing addiction and don't know how to seek help or what resources are available to them?Wen: If somebody struggling with addiction has a primary care provider that they trust and go to regularly, their doctor is the best person to seek help from because that person will know them, will understand their history, and will know what resources are available in their community. Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website has a list of providers in different parts of the country and a person's local health department may be able to refer them to treatment options depending on the part of the country they live in. In some parts of the country, hotlines exist for people to call if they are seeking help.  CNN: Are you optimistic that we will be able to turn around this trend? Wen: Public health is now right in the crosshairs of the ideological and culture wars in a way that it should not be. It's not helpful when masks and vaccinations are seen as political issues, and public health has now been largely equated with Covid-19. So, if Covid-19 is seen as a partisan issue, public health by default becomes partisan as well. Fighting drug overdose deaths is one of the issues where there is very clear bipartisan agreement that we have a problem, unlike the issue of Covid-19. Not everyone agrees that Covid is even a crisis. Addressing the opioid crisis is a way to get back to a bipartisan consensus on public health. I'm not saying that is the reason why we should be addressing the overdose crisis. We should be addressing it because it killed over a 100,000 people in America last year; we should be addressing it because it was a crisis before the pandemic and then it became largely forgotten.  But, as an added benefit, addressing the opioid crisis could get us back to the heart of the matter: how public health can unite rather than divide.",0
1567,"AT FIRST SIGHT it looks an unremarkable place. Open savannah scattered with thatched-roof homesteads. Bumpy and unpaved roads. Upturned soil that appears rocky and blackened.
But then come Sudanese soldiers. One is on a tractor. Another walks through a field, cigarette in one hand, rifle in the other. Tanks face east towards Ethiopia.

For eight months this slice of fertile farmland known as al-Fashaga has been on a war footing. Army camps have sprung up across fields of sesame and sorghum. There are thought to be tens of thousands of soldiers on the Sudanese side. Nobody knows how many have been deployed by the Ethiopians. But after months of skirmishes and some small battles, many fret that just one spark could trigger a full-blown war.
The conflict dates back to the early 20th century, when the British who then ruled in Khartoum signed border treaties with Ethiopia placing al-Fashaga inside Sudan. Ethiopia has long disputed them. But an uneasy compromise established between Sudan’s former dictator, Omar al-Bashir, and Ethiopia's late prime minister, Meles Zenawi, allowed Ethiopians to till the land, provided they recognised Sudanese ownership of the area.

That bargain ended in November when war erupted in Tigray, a northern Ethiopian region which borders al-Fashaga. Abiy Ahmed, the Ethiopian prime minister, asked the Sudanese to seal the border to stop the Tigrayans from smuggling in supplies. Sudanese troops moved in and expelled thousands of Ethiopian farmers. Ethiopian officials called it an invasion and sent in reinforcements backed by units from neighbouring Eritrea.
Some reckon that Sudanese generals, including the de facto president, are using the threat of war to strengthen their hand within Sudan’s interim power-sharing government. Also, several army officers are known to own land in al-Fashaga. But the civilians sound as incensed as the generals. “We are actually very surprised by the [Ethiopians’] rhetoric,” says Abdalla Hamdok, Sudan’s civilian prime minister. “You can’t invade your own land!”
Aggravating matters is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) being built by the Ethiopians on the Nile near the border. Abiy’s government suspects dirty tricks by downstream Egypt, which it believes wants to scupper the dam. “If you search for the cause of every problem, you find the GERD behind each of them,” said Abiy in March.
In June rebels in Tigray seized control of most of their region. Some of Abiy’s defeated troops are now being sent to reinforce those on the border with Sudan. His government has also indicated that it will blockade Tigray in order to weaken its leaders. If so, the rebels are likely to fight for access to the Sudanese border—making al-Fashaga the civil war’s next front line.",2
1568,"WHAT MATTERED was the shadow of the sun on the stone. The letters on the gravestones of the Great War should be deep enough and the angle of their engraving sharp enough, the commission on war graves decided, that someone—a mother say, or a father—walking between the rows could read the name of their son at a distance of six feet. Stonemasons struggle to achieve this: a chisel likes its own lean and to go steeper is to struggle against stone. But the commission was adamant. The letters were to be in an identical font, cut at an angle of 60 degrees and to a depth of three-sixteenths of an inch.
The precision is that of a factory: this is mourning, mass-produced. It needed to be, because when the commission was formalised in 1917,there were so many graves. On the first day of the Somme 19,240 British soldiers died; by the war’s end the total was 900,000. More wars added more bodies. Today the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), as it is now known, has 1,154,324 graves, from Arras (2,678 in just one cemetery) to Zanzibar (24) and even Timbuktu (two). It has graves in over 150 countries and every continent except Antarctica, corners of foreign fields that are legally forever England, since the CWGC has agreements giving it rights to its cemeteries “in perpetuity”.

When world leaders lay wreaths and stand for two minutes’ silence on Remembrance Sunday, therefore, they stand in places so orderly and so familiar that they feel less invented than inevitable. They were nothing of the kind. Before the first world war, Britain’s treatment of her dead was characterised by contempt. After Waterloo, Wellington’s men—“the scum of the earth” as he called them—were tipped back into the earth to rot. When tourists travelled to the scene, triumph turned to revulsion at the piles of bodies. At the start of the first world war Britain had no system for recording her dead—nor any plan to create one. General Haig called efforts to identify the dead “purely sentimental”.
Mass literacy and mass communication changed all that. News reports had started to chip away at official indifference: it was harder for generals to send brigades charging into the valley of death when war reporters sent back dispatches on the volley of cannon that met them, and the folly of the generals who sent them. It was easier to convince the British public that “dulce et decorum est pro patria mori” without letters from the front giving the details of deaths that were neither dulce nor decorous, and that ended with, in the words of Roland Leighton, “a little pile of sodden grey rags that cover half a skull” and “hideous putrescence”. (The fiancé of Vera Brittain, an early feminist who served with the Voluntary Aid Detachment, Leighton died soon after, aged 20, shot through the stomach on a moonlit night.)
But the efforts of one man were crucial. Fabian Ware, a former journalist, was too old to fight, and went to the front as commander of a Red Cross mobile ambulance unit instead. He quickly realised that there was no system for recording the slaughter. Soldiers had been trying, with pencils and wooden crosses, but official indifference defeated them. Ware set to work.
Walk through a war cemetery on Remembrance Sunday, and Ware’s legacy is around you. By May 1915 his unit had registered 4,300 graves and the commission had gained some official recognition. By 1916 he had sketched a design for the now-iconic double dog-tag: one for the body, one “for the purpose of evidence of death”. By 1917 the empire’s artists were involved. Rudyard Kipling oversaw the wording on the graves. MacDonald Gill produced the font and Edwin Lutyens the design. All should be the same shape—and they should not be crosses, for among the dead were “Jews, Mussulmens, Hindus and men of other creeds” who deserved “equality of honour”. (Religious symbols could be individually engraved afterwards).
This was death standardised and, to an extent, homogenised. In 1917 the commission ruled that graves should be in serried ranks to “carry on the military idea”, to give the impression of soldiers on parade and to ensure equality in death. Its 1,300 staff worldwide go to some lengths to keep the troops in trim. In India, in the rainy season grass is mown twice a week to maintain a military cut. Many of the graves are in Britain, as those who died of their wounds after the war still received a war burial. Walk through London’s Victorian cemeteries and you will spot them, amid the ivy and angels and decay, by the grass of a shorter cut and stones of a brighter white.
The CWGC aims for perpetuity. But time fights back. Moss grows, ivy creeps, rain erodes. The headstones were intended to be eternal: instead, Ozymandias-like, their soft Portland stone turned out to be an object lesson in obsolescence. By the second world war it was already eroding, says Caroline Walker, great-niece and biographer of MacDonald Gill. The CWGC does its best. Enzymes are now deployed to clean moss without eroding the stone further.
To the end, they remain
Stonemasons are sent to re-engrave the irrevocably damaged. Each begins by ruling lines on the grave with a metal ruler and sharp 9H pencil. It is like being back at school, says Alastair Goodall, a CWGC stonemason, when, to practise writing with ink, “you’d rule lines and repeat letters over and over again”. And so in Belgium and Britain and beyond, lines are ruled out, as by a schoolboy, and the names and ages of dead soldiers, many little older than schoolboys themselves, are chiselled deeper into stone. ■",2
1569,"A SPECIAL ECONOMY emerges around any big UN office in the developing world. Other international bodies cluster around it. Expatriates move into the safe, pleasant neighbourhood where it is located. Local suppliers vie for contracts to sell fresh produce, stationery and other staples to all these organisations. Unskilled workers get jobs as cleaners, gardeners and security guards. And small businesses, such as posh cafés and dry cleaners, thrive serving the expats and well-paid local staff.
The reason there is so much economic activity around UN hubs is simple: the UN has a lot of staff with a lot of money to spend. The UN Secretariat has a $3.2bn budget this year, with additional pots for peacekeeping and other agencies. A fair bit of that goes into salaries. So-called “professional staff”, who move around the globe, earn a base salary ranging from $46,000 a year for a fledgling policy wonk to $205,000 for an undersecretary-general (usually the head of a UN body such as the World Food Programme).

That would be more than enough to live on comfortably in any African capital. But there are additional allowances for expats with a family in tow. And jobs in cities like Nairobi and Addis Ababa come with extra pay because they count as “hardship” postings. (This is debatable. Street crime may be common in Nairobi, but the weather, bars, sports clubs and barbecued beef are extremely pleasant.)
An influx of well-paid workers provides an economic boost for any city. When the UN was established in 1945, American cities competed to host its headquarters. Since then places such as Copenhagen and Geneva have wooed UN agencies with shiny new buildings and tax incentives. Calculations from the mayor’s office in New York City, which hosts the UN’s headquarters, suggest that it adds almost $3.7bn to the city’s annual output. The UN, its agencies and affiliates are together its 22nd-biggest employer, with 10,900 staff.
The benefits of hosting the UN are much greater in places that are not already brimming with Wall Street bankers, fashion glitterati and other big spenders. Member states have chosen Nairobi, Dakar and Addis Ababa as hubs in Africa. There are only a handful of cities on the continent that are safe and well-connected enough to host legions of foreign workers and their families. But it is crucial, says Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the secretary-general, to have teams on the ground. “If you’re working on development policy, doing it from New York or doing it from Nairobi and Dakar gives you a different perspective,” he says.
The economic impact is apparent in Gigiri, a leafy corner of Nairobi where the organisation’s African headquarters are based. Street signs hint at how important the 5,000 UN staff who work there are to the local economy: United Nations Crescent leads to United Nations Avenue. The neighbourhood is filled with fancy restaurants, cafés and hotels that are unaffordable to most Kenyans. At Village Auto Bazaar, a car wash and service centre, Joshua Muhanji reckons that about 70% of his business comes from UN workers.
Yet there are costs to being a UN hub, too. New York spends about $54m on things like security for staff and public schools for their children. It forgoes almost $100m in tax thanks to exemptions for UN buildings and its diplomats. “The city makes quite an investment in hosting the UN, but it’s worth it,” says Penny Abeywardena, New York City's commissioner for international affairs.
There are other downsides in emerging markets. Cities can become dependent on UN spending. Businesses in Gigiri struggled during covid 19-lockdowns, as offices emptied out and expat staff fled. In Dakar, there are plans to relocate various UN offices from the seaside district of Les Almadies to a new city 30km outside the capital. That worries businesses in Les Almadies, from high-end coffee shops to informal car washes and the American Food Store.
A large UN presence can also distort the local job market. The organisation’s Flemming Principle dictates that the pay of local hires, who are employed on different terms and paid in the national currency, should be “among the best in the locality, without being the absolute best”. The UN conducts regular surveys on what private companies, governments and non-profit organisations pay in any given location. And it uses that information to set its alphabet-soup salary scales. In Nairobi, for example, a driver might make the equivalent of $9,000-14,000 a year, while a more skilled assistant could make $32,000-50,000. That is far less than expat staff. But in a country with an annual GDP per person of just $1,800, it is a princely sum. Joe Muturi, the head of Slum Dwellers International, a network of NGOs,puts it bluntly: “everyone wants to work for the UN.”
Martyn Davies, the managing director for emerging markets and Africa at Deloitte, a consulting firm, says that big international organisations reinforce a two-tier economy. UN employees mix in fancy bars and restaurants that most locals can’t afford, and price middle-class families out of pleasant neighbourhoods. “It’s monetary apartheid,” says Mr Davies.
That sort of inequality could spark resentment, but many locals are pragmatic. At Alkimia, a restaurant in Les Almadies serving $88 steaks and $45 seafood platters, Dimitri Vasnier, the chef, sees the irony in anti-poverty and environmental advisers arriving in four-wheel drives and leaving untouched plates piled high at buffets. But UN staff in the area are an important clientele for the restaurant. “There is so much waste,” he says. “But that is what gets the economy ticking.” ■",2
1570,"UNTIL RECENTLY Li Guangman, the retired editor of an obscure state-owned newspaper who writes leftist screeds online for a few fellow travellers, was unknown to the general public. That changed on August 29th, when the country’s biggest state and party media outlets circulated an incendiary blog post by Mr Li to their huge audiences, causing many to assume his views had official support. This prompted such a stir that a prominent state-media figure—Hu Xijin, editor of Global Times, a jingoistic party tabloid—felt compelled to post a scathing rebuttal.
The episode may have offered a rare glimpse of uncertainty in elite party circles about what exactly President Xi Jinping wants. A year before he is expected to claim a third five-year term as party secretary, Mr Xi is undertaking a populist campaign against inequality, under the slogan “common prosperity for all”. It is unclear how far he intends to take it.

Mr Li hopes very far. Writing under the title “Everyone can feel that a profound change is taking place!”, his article relished recent crackdowns on big business, celebrities and the super-rich. He suggested it was only the beginning of an anti-capitalist, anti-Western campaign that would bring the Communist Party back to its socialist roots. The country was experiencing a moment of “profound revolution”, he wrote. The “red” would soon return and China would no longer be “a paradise for capitalists to get rich overnight” nor “a paradise for effeminate men”.
But Mr Li’s views were too radical even for an establishment populist firebrand like Mr Hu. On September 2nd he wrote a blog post disputing that a “revolution” is at hand, and, in a veiled reference to the excesses of the disastrous Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, called the rhetoric inflammatory. “I am worried that such language will stir up some historical memories,” triggering “confusion and panic”, he wrote. Both posts are still accessible online.
It is highly unusual for state media to promote the rants of obscure bloggers. “He’s a nobody,” says Jude Blanchette of CSIS, a think-tank, and author of “China’s New Red Guards”, a book about neo-Maoists. And Mr Hu’s rebuke of an officially blessed essay was no less rare. What does it all mean?
One commentator with a large following among government officials argues it does not mean much. Ren Yi, whose pen name is Chairman Rabbit, says he believes the initial promotion of Mr Li’s post was “an accident”, and that no senior leaders were pushing it. “Now you are seeing officials doing a lot to calm people down,” says Mr Ren, adding that he was “disgusted” by the piece’s anti-capitalist language. On September 2nd Mr Xi gave a speech announcing a new stock exchange in Beijing to support small business. Four days later Liu He, an economic adviser to Mr Xi, said the private sector was an essential part of the economy and should be given “vigorous” support.
The targets of Mr Xi’s crackdowns might not be so easily comforted. Consider what happened in August. A party commission meditated on Mr Xi’s desire to achieve shared prosperity for all, and resolved that the rich would have to pay more. Tencent, a tech giant, promptly pledged $7.7bn to social programmes. Zheng Shuang, a famous actress, was fined $46m for tax evasion. The Supreme People’s Court declared illegal the 72-hour work week, a fixture in China’s gig economy.
Mr Xi is walking a fine line, needing to show he understands popular anger about inequality without scaring the horses in the new economy. Mr Blanchette sees the debate as a reflection of uncertainty within the establishment about the intensity of Mr Xi’s campaign.
State interventions are immensely popular with leftists like Mr Li, and he has received plenty of online support. One blogger, writing under the pen name “Little Z, a citizen observer”, concluded that Mr Li was “too radical” and Mr Hu “too conservative”. But Little Z mostly supported Mr Li. The “thunderbolt” of recent regulatory actions was an “exciting” harbinger of further coercive measures to reduce the wealth gap, he wrote. “This is only the prologue.” ■",2
1571,"SIR DAVID AMESS was the quintessential local MP. When party whips whispered that he might become a minister if he voted the right way, he laughed. When his invitation to the Leigh Duck Race, where the local scout group ceremonially released hundreds of rubber ducks, went missing, his staff turned his office upside down. His relentless campaign to have Southend-on-Sea, the town in his constituency, recognised as a city is the stuff of parliamentary legend.
It was while attending a constituency surgery, where MPs meet locals to hear their problems, that he was stabbed to death on October 15th, in an apparent Islamist terrorist attack. The murder was the latest in a grim series. Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, was killed on her way to a surgery by a far-right extremist in 2016. Stephen Timms, MP for East Ham, was stabbed at one in 2010. Nigel Jones, MP for Cheltenham, was attacked at one in 2000. His assistant, Andrew Pennington, died protecting him.
Speeches in the House of Commons attract more attention, but all MPs have a second job akin to that of a social worker: supporting asylum claims, dealing with benefit enquiries, looking into anti-social behaviour and so on. When the system works, the latter informs the former. Appalled by the death of an elderly constituent who died in a cold house, Sir David introduced legislation to tackle fuel poverty. Campaigns he ran to ban the cruel tethering of animals and to raise awareness of endometriosis also sprung from local concerns.
The constituency surgery is at the heart of this job. It is up to MPs to decide how to arrange them: some insist that people book in advance; others, like Sir David, prefer to be more relaxed, allowing anyone to drop by. Yet this sort of openness is becoming difficult to maintain. The majority of MPs report facing “aggressive or intrusive” behaviour as part of their job. After Ms Cox’s murder, parliamentarians were advised by police to screen appointments more carefully and to avoid meeting constituents on their own. Spending on security, such as CCTV and alarm buttons, has risen.
Priti Patel, the home secretary, has now asked police to review MPs’ security arrangements, to see whether more can be done to protect them. The National Police Chiefs Council will contact every MP to discuss security precautions. Many are resistant to anything that would put distance between them and their constituents. Jess Phillips, a Labour MP, said she would disregard measures that did: “You can’t put me behind a screen when I’m walking my kids to a café. I’m not the pope.”
But the direction of travel is clear. Tobias Ellwood, a Tory MP, has urged fellow parliamentarians to put face-to-face meetings on hold; Diane Abbott, a Labour one, has said she would prefer a screen. Necessary or not, it is a trend Sir David would have lamented. “We are advised to never see people alone, we must be extra careful when opening post and we must ensure our offices are properly safe and secure,” he wrote in a guide to life as a politician published last year. “In short, these increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of people openly meeting their elected politicians.” After his murder in a Methodist church, meeting his constituents and hearing their problems, that tradition is under even greater threat.",2
1572,"GLOBAL BOND markets are wakening from a long slumber. The Federal Reserve this week said it will wind down its vast bond-buying programme. At the same time, bond investors are reacting to higher inflation: across a group of 35 economies, five-year bond yields have risen by an average of 0.65 percentage points in the past three months. A shakeout is taking place not only in emerging markets but also in rich countries such as Australia and Britain. Sudden moves inevitably spark fears of market turmoil, along the lines of the “taper tantrum” in 2013. However, the bond shift taking place today is actually very different.
Before the pandemic interest rates across the world were low, reflecting dormant inflation. When the coronavirus struck almost two years ago, most central banks promised to keep their policy rates lower for longer to help the recovery. Many also agreed to buy bonds, reducing their yields.

The main reason for the sudden shift today is rising inflation. Among the 38 economies that are members of the OECD, a club of rich countries, inflation rose to an uncomfortable 4.6% year on year in September. Soaring energy and food prices are only part of the story: even if you strip those out, the figure was 3.2%, the highest in almost two decades.
For months central banks have said that high inflation is a blip caused by temporary constraints in supply. But the action in bond markets shows that investors reckon central banks are acting too slowly. Some monetary authorities have already tightened policy. Brazil announced a 1.5-percentage-point rate rise last week. Central banks in Canada and Australia have abandoned forecasts that said rates would stay low. As we write, the Bank of England is due to decide whether to raise rates. Some policymakers are standing firm: Christine Lagarde, the boss of the European Central Bank, has insisted that it is “very unlikely” to raise interest rates next year.

The spectre of central banks diverging from markets, and of consequent swings in market interest rates, will unsettle those with memories of 2013, when the Fed clumsily revealed its unexpected intention to begin scaling back its programme of bond purchases. The resulting global mini-panic dented growth and clobbered some emerging economies, particularly those with big dollar debts.
Yet this is not 2013. One difference is that the shift in bond markets is more nuanced. The increase so far in nominal five-year government-bond yields in America, for example, is less than half what it was eight years ago. Real bond yields, after accounting for expected inflation, are minus 1%, still within spitting distance of record lows. That will support easy conditions in the real economy. And even as shorter-term government-bond yields rise, there has been much less of a move in longer-term bonds.
The other difference today is the absence of financial panic. A rising cost of debt can cause defaults and capital flight. But many emerging economies have healthy foreign-exchange reserves, making them resilient. Equity markets show no sign of distress—share prices hit a record high this week. Shares in banks are up by 28% this year, because gradually rising interest rates can boost their profits. And bond markets remain open for business. In October emerging markets outside China issued near-record levels of corporate and sovereign debt.
No cause for alarm, then. Markets are betting that central banks need to bring interest-rate rises forward, not that they will lose control of inflation. Still, it is worth bearing in mind the extraordinarily difficult task that central banks face. During the unpredictable tail end of a pandemic, they must try to normalise ultra-loose monetary policy amid sky-high asset prices, heavy debt levels and above-target inflation. Taper tantrum 2.0 is not yet under way. But don’t rule out a bigger bond brawl. ■",2
1573,"ON NOVEMBER 8TH the World Food Programme (WFP), a UN agency, said that its estimate of people “teetering on the edge of famine” worldwide had risen from 42m earlier this year to 45m. Remarkably, just one country accounts for almost all those 3m additional people. Afghanistan is on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe.
Some 23m Afghans, in a country of 38m, face acute hunger. Of those, 8.7m are in a state of emergency, the second-highest category in the WFP’s hierarchy of calamity. The classification manual explains that by the time the agency declares a famine, the highest category, it will be too late to avert the worst consequences “because many will have died”.

Many are dying already. More than 3m children are malnourished. Locals report cases of entire families starving to death in their homes. Hospital wards are taking in emaciated children, including 11-year-olds who weigh just 13kg.Poor Afghans are selling their remaining possessions for food. Some are selling their daughters. The misery is as bad in the cities as it is in the countryside. As the winter sets in, the agony will only deepen.
Afghanistan’s condition was fragile even before the fall of the capital, Kabul, in August. Long periods of below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures have led to poor harvests and high prices. After decades of warfare, around 4m Afghans are refugees in their own country, with little means of support.
The Taliban takeover has made everything worse. Foreign aid, which funded three-quarters of government spending, has dried up. The country’s foreign reserves of some $9bn have been frozen. Half a million soldiers and police have lost their jobs, and civil servants have gone unpaid for months. Half the country was living on less than $1.90 a day before the Taliban came to power. By next summer, reckons the UN, all but 3% of Afghans will be in the same position.
In September the UN held a “flash appeal” seeking over $600m from donors, and received pledges of $1bn. But just a third of it has arrived. The European Union promised €1bn ($1.15bn) in October. Yet €300m of that had already been committed, and much of the remainder will go to Afghanistan’s neighbours. The WFP reckons it may need as much as $220m a month to avert a crisis over the lean winter months.
Even if the money arrives, it is at best a sticking plaster. “No humanitarian organisation can...replace the economy of a country,” says Robert Mardini of the Red Cross. The economy is atrophying. The flow of dollars into Afghanistan has been stanched, the value of the domestic currency has plummeted and the banking system has ground to a halt. The IMF reckons formal businesses will shrink by 30% in the next few months. Nonetheless, if aid were to resume and reserves were unfrozen, the pain would ease.
The trouble is that this would hand billions of dollars to the Taliban, yet to be recognised by any country as legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. The cabinet includes figures such as Sirajuddin Haqqani, whom the West considers a terrorist. America is adamant that the group must form a government that represents all Afghans and guarantee rights for women, girls and minorities.
Those are worthy aims. Yet withholding life-saving aid is reprehensible in almost any circumstances. It makes even less sense given that the Taliban show no signs of bowing to pressure. The West’s demands for basic freedoms for Afghans are entirely justified, but allowing many of the intended beneficiaries to starve to death is not a good way to fulfil them.
There is no choice but to work with the Taliban, as distasteful as that is. That need not mean becoming chummy or supportive—just realistic. The Taliban’s takeover is already terrible for Afghans. For the West to punish them further by leaving them to starve would be as cruel as anything the zealots with guns are likely to do. ■",2
1574,"AS AN ICY wind rattles the windows of his office, Sergei Shapkin dips a biscuit in honey and ponders the art of survival. He is the mayor of Pavlopil, a village in eastern Ukraine. When Vladimir Putin started grabbing Ukrainian territory in February 2014, Mr Shapkin knew his village was in danger. On one side were pro-Russian separatists, armed by the Kremlin. On the other were loyalist forces. If they fought over Pavlopil, villagers would die.
So Mr Shapkin, a cardigan-wearing former history teacher, talked to the men with guns. His village was of no strategic value, but it had shops. He suggested that the separatists enter in the morning, unarmed and on foot, to buy food and cigarettes. The Ukrainian army could do the same each afternoon. That way, they would not bump into each other and start shooting. It worked—there was no fighting in Pavlopil, and the locals stayed alive, apart from one whose tractor hit a mine.

Ceasefires have come and gone since September 2014, and sporadic shooting continues in eastern Ukraine. Just on October 12th, the day of an EU-Ukraine summit in Kyiv, monitors counted nearly 300 ceasefire violations, including 77 explosions. “Everyone has a shelter,” says Mr Shapkin. “We’re all prepared with candles, hammers and torches. And we all have bags packed in case we suddenly have to move.”
Mr Putin wrote an essay in July expanding his argument that Russia and Ukraine are a single nation. Since he has already annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula, and sponsored the takeover of a big chunk of eastern Ukraine by ethnic Russian separatists, Ukrainians take his threats seriously. In March and April he massed more than 100,000 troops on the border, before pulling them back. Now, as winter approaches, Ukrainians have another worry: that Russia will turn off the gas again.
In 2009 it shut off the flow of gas through Ukraine for two weeks. This cost Russia a fortune, since its gas needs to pass through Ukraine to reach customers in Europe. Soon, though, it may be able to pump gas to Germany via a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, that bypasses Ukraine. Once it opens—which could be soon, though it is subject to legal and diplomatic challenges—Mr Putin will be able to choke off supplies to Ukraine almost at will.
Technically Ukraine does not buy gas directly from Russia, but from downstream countries such as Hungary. In reality, it takes Russian gas in the east and substitutes its own gas, which is produced in the west of Ukraine, for transmission onwards. So if the flow through Ukraine were to stop, the east of the country would be in trouble. “We’re gas hostages,” says Vadim Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, a port city 25km south of Pavlopil.
On October 12th in Kyiv Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, assured Ukrainians that Europe would protect their energy independence. They are not reassured. President Volodymyr Zelensky seeks shelter for his country inside NATO and the EU. But this is a non-starter. NATO members do not want to extend their principle of “an attack on one is an attack on all” to a country Russia has already attacked. And the EU has enough trouble integrating corrupt ex-communist states such as Hungary without admitting a grubbier, bigger one like Ukraine.
Trust is lacking on both sides. Mr Zelensky’s first taste of geopolitics was when President Donald Trump urged him to supply dirt on Joe Biden, with a veiled threat that American support for Ukraine’s security might depend on it. President Biden has not been much better, from a Ukrainian perspective. To cement relations with Germany, in May he waived sanctions that might have blocked Nord Stream 2.

The West would like to support reform in Ukraine, but it is not easy. Corruption is rife. Oligarchs dominate the economy, control two of the bigger political parties and put other lawmakers on retainer. The IMF hesitates to throw money at a state from which billions have been stolen with apparent impunity.
The oligarchs are entrenched in public life in complex ways. Consider Mariupol, which nearly fell to pro-Kremlin forces during the war. The conscripts who were supposed to defend it were about to flee. The city was saved when the local steel baron, Rinat Akhmetov, urged his staff onto the streets and another oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky, armed a militia. Seeing that the militiamen were ready to fight, Ukrainian soldiers stayed, too. Since then, Mariupol has become a haven for fugitives from the fighting: 100,000 out of a population of 540,000. The city looks far nicer than it did in 2014. Hefty investment has improved its buses, roads, parks and rubbish collection. A new airport and university are planned.
Public opinion has shifted, too. Before the war two-thirds of people in Mariupol supported a pro-Russia political party. That share has fallen by half. Mr Putin’s aggression has alienated the people he claims to defend. So the kind of “hybrid warfare” that worked in Donbas, where Russia stirred up local ethnic Russians to demand secession, will not work in Mariupol, says Mr Boichenko. Yet Russia still has a hand on Mariupol’s throat. The amount of cargo processed in its port has fallen by half since 2012, first because of the war, then because Mr Putin made it harder for big ships to reach it from the Black Sea. Critics wonder if it is healthy for a city to depend so much on one tycoon. Mr Akhmetov is said to be Ukraine’s richest man.
Mr Zelensky, a former comedian, has vowed to cut Ukraine’s oligarchs down to size. He is expected to sign a new law soon that would allow a panel he appoints to label as “oligarchs” anyone who is very rich, finances a political party and controls media assets. This would make it harder for anyone so labelled to raise capital.
Critics note that Mr Zelensky has close ties to Mr Kolomoisky, one of the most controversial oligarchs, whose television channel hosted the show that propelled the president to stardom. They worry that the law might give Mr Zelensky too much discretion to cow his enemies and force them to sell their television channels to his friends. “It’s to make oligarchs behave, politically,” says Daria Kaleniuk of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, an NGO. “Not to stop them from being oligarchs.”
One illustration of how oligarchs weaken Ukraine is the retail market for gas. Many homes get their gas from companies controlled by Dmitry Firtash, a tycoon with Russian ties who is living in Vienna and fighting extradition to America for alleged corruption. His firms have huge unpaid debts to Naftogaz, the state wholesale supplier. This is money that could have been invested to increase domestic gas production. Meanwhile, a new Naftogaz CEO appointed by Mr Zelensky agreed to pay the state a fat dividend out of the firm’s frosty-day fund. This will help Mr Zelensky build roads, which are popular, but will leave less in the kitty for Ukraine to buy emergency supplies should Mr Putin ramp up his pipeline power politics. ■

1575,"Joe Biden is 'fit for duty,' his doctor declared Friday after the president's routine medical exam, which included a colonoscopy and 'extremely detailed neurologic exam.' 
Biden is ‘fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exceptions or accommodations,' Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the president's longtime physician, wrote in a six-page memo to press secretary Jen Psaki, which was released by the White House. 
In the first public medical report of Biden's presidency, O'Connor addressed a couple of items that had become topic of public discourse - the president's notable increase in coughing and clearing his throat and whether his stiffer gait a symptom of a neurological problem - such as a stroke. 
'There were no findings that which would be consistent with any cerebellar or other central neurological disorder,' the doctor noted, saying the 'extremely detailed neurologic exam was reassuring.'
O'Connor concluded the causes were actually fairly minor issues.  
Biden is experiencing ‘increasing frequency and severity of “throat clearing” and coughing during speaking engagements” over the last few months and it ‘warranted detailed investigation,' the doctor acknowledged. 
The cause was found to be gastroesophageal reflux, which has him ‘clear his throat more often.’ It also contributes to his ‘occasional cough and sinus congestion.’ His symptoms are exacerbated after meals, the report notes. He has no tumors in his sinuses however, and no signs of ulcer or stomach cancer. 
The president, who turns 79 on Saturday, also has an ‘ambulatory gait’ that is ‘perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago.’
That gait distrubance can 'include a variety of neurological pathologies,' Dr. O'Connor acknowledges. He cited the tests he ran to rule them out, saying he had a team of spine, foot and ankle, radiology, physical therapy and movement disorder neurological specialists to 'carefully examine and assess the president.'
The neurological exam found 'no signs of stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's or ascending lateral sclerosis,' the memo notes, but did it did find 'a mild peripheral neuropathy in both feet.'
A ‘combination of significant spinal arthritis, post-fracture “limp and compensation” and a mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of the feet are the explanation for the subtle gait changes which I was investigating,' O'Connor writes. 
The doctor noted Biden acknowledges being stiffer in the mornings but that it eases throughout the day, which is attributed to the ‘number of orthopedic and sports related injuries’ the president had over the years, including when he wore a boot on his right foot last year.
Biden would ‘likely benefit from some shoe orthotics' and is in physical therapy, the memo notes. 
President Biden's medical report reveals that he is taking five different medications to ease his allergies, reduce the risk of a stroke and to reduce levels of 'bad' cholesterol.
It also notes that he has 'no known medication allergies'
Apixaban (Eliquis) - anticoagulant medication used to treat and prevent blood clots and to prevent stroke
Rosuvastatin (Crestor) - a statin, used to lower 'bad' cholesterol and raise 'good' cholesterol
Fluticasone/azelastine (Dymista) - a nasal spray antihistamine that prevents runny nose, itching, and sneezing from allergies
Fexofenadine (Allegra) - an over-the-counter medication to tackle the symptoms of allergies
Famotidine (Pepcid) - an over-the-counter treatment for heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which also reduces the risk of stomach ulcers
Biden's colonoscopy found a 'benign-appear polyp' that was easily removed.
'Histologic evaluation is anticipated to be completed early next week,' the doctor noted. 'The president has never had colon cancer.'
O’Connor first started treating Biden in 2009 when he was vice president and he was the doctor wrote Biden's last public medical report, which was released in December 2019 during the presidential campaign. O'Connor is a retired US Army colonel who served in the 82nd Airborne Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army Special Operations Command. 
Biden is 5’11’ and 184 pounds with a BMI of 25. His blood pressure was 120/70. He ‘does not use any tobacco products, does not drink alcohol and works out five days a week.’
The six-page memo on his health concludes with: ‘This patient’s current medical considerations … include a-fib with normal ventricular response, hyperlipidemia, gastresophagel reflux, seasonal allergies, spinal arthritis and mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of both feet. For these, he takes three common prescription medications and two common over-the-counter medications.’
‘President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those of chief executive, head of state and commander in chief.’
Biden told reporters he felt 'great' after his exam conclude on Friday. The tests included him going under anesthesia for a colonoscopy and putting Vice President Kamala Harris in charge of the country.
The president disembarked from Marine One and appeared to walk slowly and stiffly across the South Lawn upon his return from spending around five hours at Walter Reed Medical Center. 
'They're going to release all the details. I feel great. Nothing's changed,' Biden said of his first physical exam as president.
'I'm looking forward to celebrating my 58th birthday,' he joked. Biden turns 79 on Saturday.   
Biden took power back at 11:35 a.m. EDT, after speaking with Harris and White House chief of staff Ron Klain. He reliquished power at 10:10 a.m. EDT, leaving Harris in charge of the country for one hour and 25 minutes. 
'.@POTUS spoke with @VP and @WHCOS at approximately 11:35am this morning. @POTUS was in good spirits and at that time resumed his duties. He will remain at Walter Reed as he completes the rest of his routine physical,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote on Twitter. 
The White House said Harris worked out of her office in the West Wing, meaning she was not in the Oval Office as she assumes presidential power. Harris takes over amid reports she is being sidelined by the administration, which the White House has vigorously denied. 
Harris, the first female and first black vice presidential, made history with her time holding presidential power. 
Psaki called it 'another chapter' in the history Harris' selection as VP has made. 'I think that will be noted for many women, young girls across the country,' she said during her daily press briefing.
President Biden headed to Walter Reed for his physical as the Democrats passed his $1.75 trillion Build Back Better spending bill and days after a poll said American voters were split on whether he is mentally fit and healthy enough to handle the presidency. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends regular screenings for colon cancer starting at age 45. A colonoscopy can last about an hour. George W. Bush was the last president to undergo a colonoscopy with anesthesia while in office. And he transferred power to then Vice President Cheney in both 2002 and 2007 when he under went the procedure. 
Biden's motorcade arrived at Walter Reed Military Center at 8:51 a.m. EDT on Friday morning, where he was to undergo his first physical as president. It comes the day before his 79th birthday. Biden, wearing a face mask, waved as he went inside.
 Psaki announced early Friday morning that Biden would be examined, adding later he 'will undergo a routine colonoscopy.'  
'As was the case when President George W. Bush had the same procedure in 2002 and 2007, and following the process set out in the Constitution, President Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia. The Vice President will work from her office in the West Wing during this time,' Psaki said.
The White House will publicly release a written summary of the Biden's physical later Friday afternoon, she noted. 
As required by section three of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Biden signed a letter to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives saying he is unable to discharge his duties while under anesthesia and designate Harris. Biden will send them another letter upon the conclusion of the procedure, noting he has resumed his duties of office.  
The White House released copies of the letters to Senator Patrick Leahy and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, where the president relinquished power and then took it back.   
Biden wrote to the leaders he was undergoing a 'routine medical procedure requiring sedation. In view of present circumstances, I have determined to transfer temporarily the power and duties of the office of President of the United States to the Vice President during the brief period of the procedure and recovery.'
He later sent a second letter resuming presidential powers.  
'In accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, I hereby transmit to you my written declaration that I am able to discharge the powers and duties of the Office of the President of the United States and that I am resuming those powers and duties,' Biden wrote.  
Walter Reed Medical Center, a military center in Bethesda, Md., is the traditional hospital of presidents for their medical needs. 
As required by section three of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Biden will sign a letter to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives saying he is unable to discharge his duties while under anesthesia and designate Harris. 
Biden will send them another letter upon the conclusion of the procedure, noting he has resumed his duties of office. 
Presidents have temporarily relinquished power but not all invoked the 25th Amendment. 
Previous transfers of power have generally been brief and happened when the president was undergoing a medical procedure.
In 2002, President George W. Bush became the first to use the amendment’s Section 3 to temporarily transfer power to Vice President Dick Cheney while Bush was anesthetized for a colonoscopy. Bush temporarily transferred power in 2007 to undergo another colonoscopy.
 The 25th Amendment was never invoked after President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Reagan did temporarily transfer power to Vice President George H. W. Bush while undergoing surgery to remove a polyp from his colon in 1985, but he said at the time he wasn’t formally invoking the 25th Amendment.
Donald Trump was treated there when he had COVID. And Trump made a mysterious visit to Walter Reed in November 2019 that was later revealed to be a colonoscopy. At the time the White House said he got a partial physical. 
But former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham indicated in her book on the administration Trump was getting a colonoscopy without anesthesia.
The reason for the secrecy, Grisham explained, was that Trump didn't want to hand over power to Vice President Mike Pence, even for a short amount of time, because it would be 'showing weakness.'
He also didn't want to be 'the butt of the joke,' she wrote, on late-night TV.   
Biden's visit to Walter Reed on Friday comes amid questions about the health of the country's oldest president and, as earlier this week, a new poll found that voters were split on whether Biden is mentally fit enough and healthy enough to handle the presidency. 
Only 40 per cent of voters surveyed in a new Politico/Morning Consult poll agreed with the statement that Biden 'is in good health,' while 50 per cent disagreed.
Biden got a tougher rating when it came to his mental health. 
Asked whether Biden is 'mentally fit', voters were close to an even split: 46 per cent says he is and 48 per cent disagree. 
And asked whether Biden is 'stable,' voters are split again with 44 per cent saying he is and 50 per cent disagreeing.
Psaki declined on Friday to addres the polls' findings.
'There are certainly quite a bit of conspiracy theory pushing out there on a range of social media platforms and even through the mouths of elected officials,' she said.
Voters' opinions on the president's health appear to be shifting with more of them concerned about his fitness. 
In October 2020, when the poll last surveyed the question, voters believed Biden was in good health by a 19-point margin compared to this recent 10 point one. Addtionally, in that October 2020 survey, voters believed Biden was mentally fit by a 21-point margin.
Biden turns 79 on Saturday and the last extensive update on his health came in December 2019 - during the presidential campaign - where his doctor described him as 'a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.'  '  
President Donald Trump, who was 70 when he was elected president, mocked Biden's stamina on the campaign trail in last year's election, dubbing him with the moniker 'Sleepy Joe.' 
Trump's first physical was released in January 2018, a year after he was sworn-in. 
An exuberant Dr. Ronny Jackson, now a Republican House member in Congress, praised Trump for having 'incredible genes,' which allowed the then 71-year-old president to consume Diet Coke, McDonald's, ice cream and exercise very little and still stay in 'very, very good health.'    
'I have absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability,' Jackson also assured reporters, after the book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House had raised questions about Trump's mental state. 
What is a coloscopy? 
A colonoscopy is an exam that detects abnormalities and changes in the large intestine and in the abdomen.
How is it performed?  
Patients are either sedated or, in rare cases, given general anesthesia, to dull the amount of pain they feel.
A long, flexible tube is inserted into the rectum. A tiny video camera is attached to the tip so the doctor can view the inside of the colon.
If necessary, the doctor can remove polyps or other types of abnormal tissue, as well as take tissue samples. 
A colonoscopy will generally take about 30 to 60 minutes. 
How do I prepare the day before a colonoscopy? 
Doctors recommend that patients eat low-fiber foods that are easy to digest starting three to four days before the colonoscopy.
The day before the procedure, patients are not allowed to eat anything solid and can only consume clear liquids.
The night before the colonoscopy, patients have to take laxatives to make sure the digestive tract is clear.
When should I get a colonoscopy?
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adults between ages 45 and 75 get screened for colon cancer.
Patients between ages 75 and 85 are recommended to speak to their doctors about when to get a colonoscopy.  
If the colonoscopy doesn't find any signs of cancer, it should be done every 10 years. 
Why is it important to get a coloscopy?
Aside from skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the U.S.
An estimated 104,270 new cases of colon cancer and 45,230 new cases of rectal cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2021.
It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in men and in women, separately, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths when men and women are combined with 52,980 deaths expected in 2021.

While Trump regularly 'speaks his mind,' Jackson argued, he 'found no reason whatsoever to think that the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process.'  
Biden hasn't helped questions about his health with his tendency toward gaffes - an afflication that has plagued him on and off throughout his more than 40 years in politics. 
In his first few months in office, he would refer to his vice president as 'President Kamala Harris' and White House staff recently had to clarify comments he made on the situation in Taiwan. 
In March, Biden stumbled three times while climbing the stairs to board Air Force One, which his staff blamed on the windy day. 
The president does stay physically active - he and First Lady Jill Biden ride bikes when they are at their vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., and he plays golf at the local country club when he's home in Wilmington.  ",-2
1576,"BRUSSELS/MILAN, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Australian fund Macquarie are set to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval for their acquisition of broadband network company Open Fiber, sources close to the matter said on Monday.
State-controlled Enel (ENEI.MI) and CDP currently have joint control of Open Fiber, which had been set up to roll out fibre optic cables to help Italy catch up with the rest of Europe.
The deal will increase CDP's Open Fiber stake by 10% to 60% while Macquarie will acquire 40%.
The approval could help a long-mooted plan to merge Open Fiber's network with that of Telecom Italia (TIM) (TLIT.MI), regaining traction at a time when TIM's top investor Vivendi is calling into question the role of the group's CEO Luigi Gubitosi after two profit warnings in the span of a few months.  read more 
CDP is the second-biggest shareholder in TIM, behind French media company Vivendi (VIV.PA), which some analysts had feared could complicate the Open Fiber deal with the EU competition enforcer.
The European Commission which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Nov. 10, declined to comment.
Enel, Macquarie and CDP also declined to comment.
The previous government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had backed the single-network plan, which would avoid duplicating investment in fibre rollout.
However, some ministers of the new government led by Mario Draghi have cast doubts over the plan because of regulatory issues, saying that alternative options are also being considered, though speculation about a tie-up has resurfaced recently.",3
1577,"THAN THAN SOE has not had a day off since covid-19 began charging through Myanmar at the end of May. She runs a charity in Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city, which transports covid patients to hospitals and corpses to cemeteries. Her organisation collects as many as 60 bodies a day. “We are very tired but we keep going,” says Ms Than Than Soe. Two volunteers recently got infected and died.
Covid is ravaging Myanmar. Daily cases, taken as an average over seven days, have hovered around 5,000 since mid-July, but limited testing means that this is probably an underestimate (see chart). The share of tests that return positive results has exceeded 35% since mid-July, which suggests widespread, uncontrolled transmission. Only Iran and Mexico have higher positivity rates. Myanmar, which borders countries that are home to about a third of the world’s population, risks becoming a “super-spreader state”, according to Tom Andrews, the UN’ S expert on the country.

Almost every South-East Asian country is experiencing its worst outbreak yet, and for many of the same reasons: low rates of testing and vaccination, weak or overwhelmed health-care systems and the presence of more transmissible variants such as Delta. But Myanmar offers the virus particularly hospitable conditions, thanks to the army. After a coup in February, testing, contact-tracing and treatment of covid ground to a halt. Public hospitals emptied of medical workers, thousands of whom joined protests against the coup. When a state bordering India reported an outbreak in June, the junta was too busy quelling resistance to do much about it.

In any case, lockdowns are impossible to enforce when people believe their lives are in danger. Violence unleashed by the coup has spurred many Burmese to take flight. Some 230,000 people fled their homes between February and June, bringing the total number of displaced people in Myanmar to 680,000. The camps where some have found refuge often have limited health care. The jungles where others flee have none.
But the struggle to find medical assistance has become a national problem, shared by refugees and city folk alike. Myanmar had few doctors to begin with. In 2018 there were just 0.7 for every 1,000 people—fewer even than in India, which had 0.9. Their number has been depleted by the junta. The regime has arrested top health officials, including the former head of the national vaccination programme. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of health workers have gone underground. The security services have attacked medical personnel and facilities, killing at least 18. Junta officials reportedly entrapped, and later arrested, three doctors by posing as covid patients seeking treatment. Many hospitals have closed their doors; the UN believes that just 40% of health-care facilities are still functioning. Almost all those that are open are full, according to the Myanmar Red Cross Society.
Many people who are ill are treating themselves at home. They are keeping doctors like Moe Oo (not his real name) busy. Through his telemedicine service, which he offers free of charge, he is teaching patients how to check their vital signs and oxygen levels, and inject antibiotics or insulin. Many find it tricky to perform such tasks, he says. But they are the lucky ones. Drugs and other medical supplies are in short supply. Shortages of oxygen have been exacerbated by a rule banning the sale of the life-saving gas to residents of Yangon unless they get permission from local officials appointed by the junta. Dr Moe Oo has watched, helpless, as four of his patients, gasping for air, have succumbed to the virus.
Myanmar is counting around 360 deaths from covid each day. This is one of the world’s highest fatality rates, relative to population. Yet it is probably an undercount, something which the junta has implicitly acknowledged: it is building ten crematoriums in Yangon, which will be capable of dispatching more than 3,000 bodies a day.■

1578,"THE INDIGENOUS territory Sete de Setembro draws its name from the “first contact” with the Paiter Suruí tribe: September 7th 1969. At the time, tribe members thought white men, with their pale skin and strange beards, were a sort of monster, whereas the indigenous were “real people”, or paiterey in their tongue.
Cousins Almir and Henrique Suruí were born in the following decade. As boys they saw the arrival of thousands of settlers, the conversion of tracts of forest to farmland and the death of hundreds of Suruí from disease and violence. As men they became caciques. But their paths diverged in the mid-2000s. Almir tried to protect the forest and find a sustainable income for his village, Lapetanha, home to 115 of the tribe’s 1,500 members. Henrique got involved in illegal logging and mining, which led to his expulsion. He founded a village elsewhere in the territory, which spans nearly a thousand square miles in Rondônia and Mato Grosso.

Such rivalries reflect a double failure on the part of the government: to keep invaders off indigenous lands and to reduce the poverty driving people in the Amazon into illicit activities. Since 1969 the region’s population has quadrupled to nearly 25m. It comprises 60% of Brazil’s territory and 13% of its population but just 8% of GDP. The area richest in biodiversity and natural resources is among the least developed and most destitute.
The consensus is that environmental enforcement must go hand-in-hand with sustainable development. What that looks like is debated. Last year Mr Bolsonaro submitted a bill to legalise mining on indigenous land. “Every day the Indian is more of a human being,” he said. Many suspect the Indians are not his chief concern. His vision of big projects like highways and dams to serve farms and cities does not include them. His father was a miner. He has said it is “abusive” to non-indigenous Brazilians that less than 1% of Brazil’s population occupies 14% of its territory.
Polls find most Brazilians opposed to mining on indigenous land because it uproots trees, pollutes rivers and leaves huge pits behind. Their land needs more protection if it is to remain pristine. Satellite images of Rondônia show farmland dotted with dirt roads and tiny towns. The only remaining big patches of forest are indigenous territories. This makes tribes natural supporters of a “bioeconomy” that will save the forest and reduce poverty, say environmentalists. In 1997 Philip Fearnside, a Manaus-based biologist, wrote that “The mother lode waiting to be tapped is not a material commodity, but rather the forest’s environmental services.” Yet society has to work out how to pay people for protecting biodiversity, carbon storage and water cycles.
The problem is that, ever since the rubber boom in the late 1800s, wealth and employment in the region have come from extraction: logging, mining, farming. In the 1970s the military regime built thousands of kilometres of roads through the rainforest for these activities. Colonisation programmes lured more than 100,000 families to states like Rondônia with the promise of “land without men for men without land”. To gain a deed to a plot of jungle they had to deforest half. As with the “manifest destiny” that drew Americans west, there was no mention of tribes already living on the land. Many were massacred or driven out.
Brazil’s constitution of 1988 tried to put some of this right. It strengthened laws to protect the environment, laid out steps to demarcate hundreds of indigenous territories and boosted Funai, the agency responsible for them. It left open the possibility of extractive activities on indigenous land, so long as Congress passed laws regulating them and local communities were consulted and paid. Mr Bolsonaro says they will be if his bill passes, but his government has not sought their input.
In the 1980s Funai introduced logging as a source of income for the Suruí, but it was banned after it went out of control. The protectionism of later governments was also unhelpful. Rules making it hard for indigenous people to sell produce from their land to businesses outside the Amazon “made it impossible for them to develop,” says Ivaneide Cardozo of Kanindé, an NGO in Rondônia. In 2000 Almir wrote a 50-year plan with goals for health and education and ideas for how to pay for them. “We’re in the process of understanding what money means for us,” he says.

The road to Sete de Setembro weaves through rocky pastures filled with humped cattle. A wall of trees marks the entrance to the territory. Inside, the forest canopy blocks the sun and the air fills with bird sounds. Lapetanha has a maloca, where elders meet under a thatched-palm roof, along with a Wi-Fi tower. In 2013 the Suruí became the first indigenous group in the world to sell carbon credits under the UN’s anti-deforestation scheme (REDD+). Natura, a cosmetics company, bought 120,000. So did FIFA before the World Cup. The tribe received around 3m reais to protect trees, and used it for projects such as a coffee co-operative.
But some tribe members claimed the money was not distributed fairly. Henrique claims Almir took too much. The scheme could have won more funding but, with help from an NGO tied to the Catholic church, which has criticised carbon credits, Henrique sabotaged it. During an audit to vet his claims, loggers returned. The project was decertified. REDD+ projects are now popping up throughout the Amazon in hopes of a global carbon market, but the Suruí case suggests that it may not be a straightforward success. And rich countries may prefer to buy credits at home. “Sending money to Brazil to stop deforestation doesn’t do anything for the German economy,” Mr Fearnside says.
The co-operative did better. Brazil’s largest coffee firm, Três Corações, agreed to buy each harvest for 450 reais a sack (the co-op takes 20%). Each Suruí family sells 30-40 sacks, depending on its plot and how many kids it has to pick berries. It is a lot of work for an income less than minimum wage. But the Amazon lacks initiatives for more lucrative economies, like pharmaceuticals or cosmetics, says Denis Minev, who runs its largest department-store chain. He points out that the government invested billions to help Petrobras develop pre-salt technology, and the Embrapa agricultural-research institute to grow soy in the cerrado. The annual budget for the top research institute in the Amazon is 35m reais, less than the footballer Neymar earns in a month.
Francisco Costa, an economist, says that 700,000 people still make a living from the forest, a sizeable group but one with an uncertain future. They are responsible for less than 5% of deforestation; most comes from soy and cattle farms, which are expanding (mining causes degradation, a precursor). Farmers make more money from the growing market for beef and soy in Asia, while Amazonians in sustainable trades like fishing or harvesting açaí have seen their incomes stagnate. It is no wonder that some are turning to illegal economic activities.
Before diamonds were discovered on Suruí land, they were mined on a nearby reserve occupied by the Cinta Larga tribe. Garimpo (wildcat mining) brought wealth but also alcoholism, prostitution and debt. In 2004 the Cinta Larga killed 29 garimpeiros. Prospectors fled to other areas; mineral veins led them to Sete de Setembro. Almir forbade the Suruí from mining but Henrique gave them his blessing: “If the forest is going to be cut down, at least let it be by Indians.”
According to a verbal agreement, 20% of profits are meant to go to the tribe, yet miners rarely keep their word. Henrique was once jailed for mining but he has been to the police countless times to report that Suruí are being exploited. At a hearing in 2015, he accused prosecutors and Funai of being complicit. “You’re in the hands of the miners and I’m the one who’s the thief?” he said. Three or four times a year, police descend on the mines, arrest the miners and set fire to their machines, which can cost 500,000 reais. But the garimpeiros always return. Some 200 are in Sete de Setembro even now, says an investigator. Fines are low, “So it’s always worth it to try again. Coffee, Brazil nuts? Nothing is capable of competing with diamonds.”
Burn, baby, burn
Mr Bolsonaro has squelched any initiatives that tried. In 2019 the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, launched a crusade against the Amazon Fund, through which Germany and Norway donated $1.2bn to projects that employ locals to protect the forest. Mr Salles accused NGOs of committing fraud, even though most of the money went to the ministry. He abolished two committees that oversaw funding and suggested using it to pay squatters who were kicked off conservation units. In the face of rising deforestation and fires, Germany and Norway withdrew their donations.
In a secret meeting in April 2020, video of which was released by the supreme court, Mr Salles urged cabinet members to “push through all kinds of deregulation” while the press was distracted by covid-19. A day after telling President Joe Biden and other leaders at this year’s Earth Day summit that Brazil would double spending on environmental enforcement, Mr Bolsonaro signed a budget that cut it by 24%. When a police superintendent accused Mr Salles of obstructing a probe into illegal logging, he was fired. Brazil will have no problem meeting its goal of ending illegal deforestation by 2030, the former chief tweeted, “Because there will be no forest left.” Mr Salles is under investigation for corruption.
As the risk goes down, the reward goes up. The price of gold has soared by 40% since 2018, to more than $1,700 per ounce. This has drawn tens of thousands of hopefuls to wildcat mines. A gold rush in Pará has split the Munduruku tribe and led to violence. Near the border with Venezuela, where the Yanomami tribe lives in isolation, 21 of its members died of covid-19, including six babies. The virus was brought in by garimpeiros. Instituto Escolhas, another NGO, says lack of regulation makes garimpo far too easy. To sell gold to a bank, Brazilians need only fill out a form. The institute estimates that a third of the roughly 100 tonnes of gold mined in Brazil each year comes from garimpo. Most is illegal.
Over 3,000 petitions have been filed to mine on indigenous land. Mr Bolsonaro’s government has approved 58, even though the law does not allow it.The permits mostly belong to big companies like Anglo American, though garimpeiros believe it is a matter of time before their trade is condoned. “We’re workers, not bums,” says Alison Oliveira, owner of one of more than 1,000 illegal barges that mine gold on the Madeira river outside Porto Velho, Rondônia’s capital. By night they dredge sand from the riverbed; by day, they sift through it with mercury, which sticks to gold. On a good week, the flecks add up to an ounce or two.
In January Rondônia passed a decree overturning a ban on garimpo in rivers. Few barges have submitted papers to operate legally (it is easier to bribe the marine force), but they see the decree as a step towards access to conservation areas where mining remains illegal. Porto Velho’s economy depends on gold, says Mr Oliveira. That politicians own barges is an open secret. He insists that miners have become more green-conscious: they now throw their rubbish away in town. Sand tainted with mercury goes back into the river, though. When this correspondent visited, his workers were dumping it as dolphins played near the barge.
Henrique Suruí scrolls through photos on his phone of chemical-filled craters and laments that young Suruí women want to marry only white miners. He feels sick when he thinks about how little the tribe has benefited from garimpo. “Bolsonaro is right when he says indigenous people need to evolve,” he says. Almir agrees. The death of both their mothers from covid-19 has reunited the cousins. They are talking of joining forces to kick out the miners and launch a new carbon-credit project. Henrique wants to find investors for a mine in which more profits would go to indigenous people. Almir is sceptical but doesn’t rule it out. “Of course we want development,” he says. “Just not at any cost.” ■

1579,"“WE WANT TO see the end of capitalism and neoliberalism,” says Catalina (not her real name), a 37-year-old protester surrounded by a group of hooded men wielding sticks. She is one of many hundreds who, since Chile eased its covid-related curfew in October, have gone out on the streets to rail against the government. Some protesters have looted supermarkets and pharmacies. Others, wearing black balaclavas, have thrown Molotov cocktails at “pacos”, or the police. For a week the main thoroughfare of the capital was full of piles of rubbish that had been set on fire. The downtown area is covered with graffiti. “Death to the government, long live anarchy,” reads one scrawl.
Chile used to be one of Latin America’s success stories. GDP per person almost tripled between 1990 and 2015; it is now the highest in Latin America. The number of university students quintupled over the same period. Income inequality fell and is now below the regional average (though far above that of the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries). Yet ever since huge protests took place in October 2019, in which at least 30 people died and metro stations and churches were razed, violence has become far more common. In the past few weeks three people have died during the protests and hundreds have been arrested.

After the protests in 2019 the government agreed to create a constitutional convention—the idea being that, by electing a body broadly representative of Chile’s citizens in order to rewrite the constitution from the era of the dictator Augusto Pinochet, discontent could be channelled into better responses than populism and anarchy. But two years on, as that democratic experiment gets under way (with just 43% of citizens voting for the 155 members of the convention in May), Chile looks in worse shape than at any point since the return of democracy three decades ago.
For a start, extremist politicians are gaining ground. In November, a general election will take place in which the centre-right president, Sebastián Piñera, cannot stand again because of term limits (separately, he is also dealing with potential impeachment proceedings). The two politicians leading the polls to replace him are Gabriel Boric, a 35-year-old allied with the Communist Party, and José Antonio Kast, a hard-right candidate who once claimed that if Pinochet were alive, “he would vote for me.” Mr Kast wants to build “a ditch” on the country’s northern border to keep out immigrants who arrive illegally. Mr Boric’s team argue that their policies are no more extreme than, say, those of Bernie Sanders, a former presidential candidate in the United States. Even so, they seem beholden to radical leftists.
Another problem is that many of the underlying issues which brought people out onto the streets two years ago have not gone away. In the early 2000s, during a commodities boom, a new middle class emerged but inequality remained severe. According to a study published in 2019 in the Lancet, a medical journal, life expectancy at birth for a woman born in the poorest neighbourhood of Santiago is nearly 18 years lower than for a woman born in the richest neighbourhood, a much larger gap than in the other five Latin American cities surveyed, including Mexico City and Buenos Aires. (Although overall life expectancy remains high.)
University tuition fees are high, but the quality of degrees is often shoddy. More than 80% of pensioners receive pensions that are below the minimum wage of 337,000 pesos ($418) a month. There were large protests in 2006, 2011 and 2016 calling for reforms to these areas, but many feel little has changed. Those who can afford to seek private schools and health care. This year Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, a political scientist, published a survey of 137 managers and board members from the country's largest 500 companies. Just under half said their parents were educated in private schools, but 96% said their children were.
Those in power often seem unconcerned by the gulf between the rich and the poor. After raising metro fares at peak hours in October 2019, Juan Andrés Fontaine, the economy minister, said Chileans could “wake up earlier” if they wanted to avoid paying the higher costs. Few Chileans set much store by the political system. Trust in institutions is low (see chart); electoral participation is exceptionally so.

The Pinochet-era constitution, adopted in 1980, was designed to give a disproportionate role to the right, argues Claudia Heiss of the University of Chile. Seats were reserved for the army in the Senate (which remained the case until 2005), while unusually high thresholds were put in place to change laws that would give the state a bigger role in the provision of certain services, such as education. Despite the fact that centre-left presidents have mostly been in power, they had to negotiate extensively with the opposition. This made politics seem like “a cartel”, says Steven Levitksy of Harvard University.
Initially, it seemed that writing a new constitution could help bring more legitimacy to a discredited system. Last year the turnout for the referendum over whether or not a new constitution should be written was, at 51%, among the highest since voting became voluntary in 2012 (78% voted yes). Young and poor people’s participation grew the most. Though Chileans’ trust in the convention has recently dipped, it is still far above that in Congress and political parties. Juan Pablo Luna, a political scientist at Chile’s Catholic University, claims that the convention has led to a “revindication of politics” among young people.
But liberals are increasingly alarmed by the direction that the convention, stuffed full of political newbies, is taking. In early October, the assembly finished approving its rules of procedure. One of these imposes penalties for “denial or omission” of human-rights violations committed by the dictatorship and by the state in the context of the 2019 uprising. The vagueness of the rule is worrying, thinks Sergio Verdugo, a constitutional expert. His concern is that the convention’s indifferent approach to freedom of speech could be reflected in the final constitution.
Similarly a group led by the Communist Party is trying to circumvent rules that mean every part of the charter is approved by a two-thirds majority. Indeed, leftists have the most sway in the assembly. “This will be the world’s first woke constitution,” thinks Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile.
All this will affect the economy, which has been scarred by a long lockdown. Stricter environmental rules—almost certainly included in the new constitution—may hinder copper exports, on which the economy depends. Senators are close to approving a bill to let Chileans make an early withdrawal of 10% of their pension pots. This would be the fourth time such an emergency measure has passed since covid-19 started squeezing family budgets. It is likely to spur annual inflation, which hit a seven-year high of 5.3% last month.
Meanwhile the violence is likely to continue. On October 8th a leftist member of the convention was hounded by an angry mob in Santiago, who hurled stones at her and branded her a “sell-out” for contemplating working with centrist members. Chile’s more aspirational politicians have often compared the country to Finland. But the events of recent weeks and years suggest that it actually resembles one of its dysfunctional neighbours.■",2
1580,"AS SOON AS the first gunshots echoed across the courtyard from the street outside, the congregation began to scatter. The worshippers at Kandahar’s Bibi Fatima mosque were all too aware of the fate of their fellow Shia Muslims in Kunduz a week earlier and immediately started running. The warning came too late. Suicide-bombers had shot their way into the building. Seconds later a cloud of dust engulfed the scene as they blew themselves up.
The blast on October 15th killed at least 40 people, though some put the toll far higher. Seven days earlier, at the Gozar-e-Sayed Abad mosque in the capital of Kunduz province, Friday prayers had been interrupted by a similar atrocity. In that attack at least 50 died. Both bombings were claimed by the local offshoot of Islamic State (IS), known as Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP).

Two months after the Taliban’s takeover and America’s withdrawal—during which an ISKP bombing killed more than 100—it is this group, rather than any residual resistance from the former government, that has emerged as the new regime’s biggest security challenge. The mosque bombings have been accompanied by assassinations of Taliban fighters. Patrols have been ambushed and fighters kidnapped and beheaded.
ISKP first gained a foothold in the region in 2014, when it was not only fiercely anti-Western, but also quickly became a bitter rival of the Taliban. The jihadists went on to accuse the Taliban of selling out for signing a deal with America and co-operating with its withdrawal. They regularly attacked the country’s Shia minority, whom they deem infidels. Their brutality became notorious in a country already accustomed to horror. They began to carve out territory in Afghanistan’s eastern provinces before being largely beaten back by the Taliban, who benefited from American air strikes on the jihadists.
In the tumultuous August days as the government of Ashraf Ghani, the former president, collapsed, hundreds of jailed ISKP fighters escaped from prison. Bolstered by these reinforcements, the group switched from trying to hold rural territory to waging an urban terrorist campaign, using the Taliban’s hit-and-run tactics and suicide-bombings against them. David Petraeus, a former director of the CIA, who also led international troops in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011, this week told British MPs that the Taliban were “becoming acquainted with how much more challenging it is to be a counter-insurgency force than it is to be insurgents and hang out in the hills”.
The Taliban’s message, as they seized power, was that they would bring peace. Clearly, they have not. Their attempts to downplay the insurgency sound hollow. “Daesh [Islamic State] is not a big threat in Afghanistan, and it has been controlled,” said the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, a day before the Kandahar blast.
Such complacency reassures neither Afghans nor the country’s neighbours. Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, on October 18th called on the Taliban to do more. “They should know if they do not deal with Daesh seriously and if Daesh is not destroyed in the region this will pave the way for the harassment of many other countries and people in the region,” he warned. Indeed the attacks on Shias may spur Iran to engage more closely with the Taliban, perhaps sharing intelligence.
The Taliban say they have been breaking up ISKP cells. There are reports of clerics associated with the militants being killed and of sympathisers being rounded up. But as Western forces discovered over the past 20 years, brutal or clumsy counter-insurgency efforts can be counterproductive. Asfandyar Mir at the United States Institute of Peace, a government think-tank in Washington, warns of a “vicious cycle” of counter-insurgency and violence against a backdrop of mass-casualty attacks, particularly against minorities.
Though ISKP is, for now, the most serious armed opposition to the Taliban, its extremism and paranoia make it unlikely to attract recruits from wider anti-Taliban constituencies, says Haroun Rahimi, assistant professor of law at the American University of Afghanistan. But the Taliban know their many enemies will be watching for signs of weakness.■",2
1581,"WITH FRIENDS like these, who needs enemies? Another family row has broken out between Germany’s sister conservative parties—the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and its bigger sibling, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The pair choose a joint candidate for chancellor, and in April Armin Laschet, the CDU’s leader (pictured, right), got the nod over the more popular Markus Söder, head of the CSU (on the left). The parties were supposed to unite behind Mr Laschet, but after months of barely disguised sulking, the CSU is now making it clear that they find him as impressive as a soggy Weisswurst. On September 8th, asked by a journalist if Mr Laschet was Germany’s next chancellor, Mr Söder grimaced and responded with a sarky “Klar!” (“Sure”). A day later Markus Blume, the CSU’s secretary-general, told Der Spiegel that the CDU/CSU would “of course” be doing better had they opted for his boss. (File that under “true, but unhelpful.”) Expect grimaces all round when Mr Laschet appears at the CSU’s pre-election congress in Nuremberg on September 11th.

Meanwhile the CDU’s miseries have only deepened. Its panicked campaign to spook voters into believing that Olaf Scholz, the popular Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor-candidate, will invite the hard leftists of Die Linke into government has utterly failed to shift the polling needle. Yet it is doubling down. Even Angela Merkel, who had been doing her best to remain aloof from the campaign fray, was sucked in this week. At what was probably her last appearance before parliament she warned that a vote for Mr Scholz—who has served as her vice-chancellor since 2018—risked undermining Germany’s much-prized “moderation”. “I’m only telling the truth!” the chancellor exclaimed, as Die Linke MPs booed. (Commentators dismayed by Mrs Merkel’s rare foray into partisanship seemed surprised to learn that Germany’s monarchical chancellor remains a party politician.) There is still a fortnight to go, and the polls may be wrong. But for now, the CDU’s campaign is looking like a case study in some future political strategists’ textbook on how to lose elections.
__________
Not that it has been plain sailing for the SPD. In Hamburg, Mr Scholz’s home town, an SPD member of the city-state’s government earned himself lasting ignominy (and his own derisive #PimmelGate hashtag) by ordering six police to search the house of “ZooStPauli”, a hapless Twitter user who had called him a “dick”. The following day saw a raid of a rather more serious nature, when prosecutors swooped on Mr Scholz’s finance ministry, as well as the justice ministry, as part of an anti-money laundering probe. The Financial Intelligence Unit, part of the finance ministry, stands accused of failing to act on banks’ warnings about questionable transactions. Mr Scholz criticised the decision to raid his ministry, saying officials should have put questions in writing.

Size is starting to matter in the Bundestag. Although Germany’s mixed electoral system preserves proportionality, it throws up perverse outcomes when the vote fragments. The last election produced 709 MPs, well over the legal minimum of 598, putting pressure on office space and lifting the parliament’s annual running costs to over €1bn ($1.2bn). This time, reckons the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Bundestag could swell to over 900 members. Only China’s rubber-stamp congress is bigger. Attempts to tweak Germany’s electoral law have so far foundered on this or that party’s objections. Those who want to throw the scoundrels out may be dismayed to see how many of them are coming in.

Although the Delta variant has lifted Germany’s covid-19 incidence rate to its highest level since May, the pandemic has largely taken a back seat in the campaign. That is not to everyone’s taste. Lothar Wieler, head of the federal disease-control agency, warned this week that hospitals could become overburdened if the vaccination rate did not pick up. Almost all the new hospitalisations are among the unvaccinated, but Germany has a lot of them: only 62% of adults are double-jabbed, and the vaccination rate has tailed off at a lower level than in comparable countries (see below). France solved this problem by making life extremely difficult for the unjabbed. A country in the middle of a tricky election campaign is unlikely to follow suit.",2
1582,"THE FIRST signs may go unnoticed. An individual might sicken here; another might die there. As few need reminding in 2021, death enters countries quietly. For trees, as for people, a whisper of unease may mark the arrival of a new disease. But as from tiny acorns, mighty oaks, so from small beginnings, devastating diseases.
Nobody is counting the trees Britain has lost to diseases, because it is difficult to keep track of millions of hectares of woodland. But on ash and elm, oak and beech, horse chestnut, alder and larch, diseases are spreading. Some kill. In London the leaves of horse-chestnut trees curl, brown and wither long before autumn arrives. In Devon and in Cumbria, ailing ash trees lift their skeletal silver fingers to the sky. In Dumfries and Galloway, hillsides of larch have been felled.

This is the era of the treedemic, which is not one disease, but many. Some are mild; others reshape the landscape. When Dutch elm disease swept across Britain in the 1960s and 1970s it was described as a national tragedy, but it was not the whole tragedy. It was the messenger speech, a warning of what is to come. Twenty-odd diseases have come to Britain since the 1960s; over 40 others, it is feared, might yet come. Attempts are being made to slow them. Forestry Commission helicopters hover over Britain, searching for signs of disease and issuing felling orders.
On an autumn day at the edge of Lake Windermere in the Lake District, Great Knott Wood sits in sunshine. This is archetypal English woodland, not particularly dark or deep but with cultural roots that spread far into the national story. Wordsworth wandered here, exulting at “Nature’s fairest forms”. Now some of those forms are threatened. Sudden larch death, which arrived in Britain in 2002, has just been found here. Within six months, says Heather Swift, the Cumbria site manager for the Woodland Trust, a charity, every larch tree in this area will have been felled.
The reason for all this devastation is simple: trees are not meant to move. Seeds might travel a few metres, or a few miles if eaten by a bird or animal. But outside Middle Earth and “Macbeth”, the plant itself should stay put. Instead vast numbers are travelling, more and farther every year. Over the past three decades, the global horticulture industry has grown so rapidly that it puts weeds in the shade. Forests are on the move and, as when Birnam Wood came to Dunsinane, this bodes ill.
Buy a potted plant and you may assume that you have bought a single species. You have not. In a recent paper in the Journal of Fungi, Alexandra Puertolas and three co-authors analysed the soil in 99 woody plants bought in Britain and the Netherlands: 90% contained organisms capable of causing diseases, some serious. It is perhaps better to think of bought trees less as plants in pots than as Petri dishes of potential pathogens which also contain a tree.
Worse still, they often do not contain the diseases of one area alone. Many enjoy an arboreal “grand tour” of Europe before being planted in British soil. Trees are not obliged to carry the country of origin, or of where they are grown, on their labels. Dieback led to regulations for ash trees being tightened in 2012, explains Richard Buggs, a senior researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, but other trees travel far. A single sapling might start life in the Netherlands and then be sent to Italy (trees grow faster where it’s sunnier) before returning, via Germany, to Britain. Like many a European grand tourist, such a tree can become riddled with disease.
The globalisation of tree cultivation means that many countries are experiencing similar problems. But they are unusually severe in Britain, which has few tree nurseries and is one of the least wooded countries in Europe, a fact it is trying to change. The value of tree imports has increased from £6m in 1992 (£12.5m in 2019 prices; $16m), to £93m today, an increase of nearly 650%. The Forestry Commission counted 4.25m new trees planted in Britain in the 12 months ending in April; the Woodland Trust, a charity, has pledged to plant 50m trees by 2025.
The potential impact of tree disease, however, dwarfs such numbers. Britain is home to 150m ash trees, and many more saplings, all of which might be infected by ash dieback. Of the trees infected, it is estimated that 90-99% will die. Dead trees must be removed (especially if they overhang roads and railways) and their environmental benefits are lost. Researchers at Oxford University have estimated that the cost of tree death on such a scale will be £15bn (0.7% of GDP).
Root cause
Humans have been exploiting forests for millennia. Ancient Roman bathers were warmed by fires kindled with North African trees. Captain Cook returned from Botany Bay with a ship filled with botanical samples. But Roman merchants and Enlightenment explorers transported dead trees and live seeds. Now, live trees are being moved. The analogy is less with dead timber than with live animals, in particular humans. “When Europeans colonised America they took with them diseases like flu and chickenpox that for them caused fairly mild symptoms,” says Mr Buggs. When they met populations unused to such diseases, the result was catastrophic.
Moving trees less would reduce the spread of disease. So would building more nurseries and cutting imports. Brexit means Britain is better able to impose phytosanitary restrictions at its borders. That would come at a cost, but it would probably be lower than the potentially catastrophic losses caused by new diseases. The Oxford researchers point out that imports and exports of all live plants, not just trees, were worth £300m in 2017—a mere 2% of the potential costs of ash dieback. It is time to see the wood for the trees. ■",2
1583,"EARLIER THIS month wildfires tore through the drought-stricken American West. The largest of them, the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon, now takes up almost 395,000 hectares—more than the city of Los Angeles. The blaze is so big that it has created its own weather by sucking up smoke and air into “fire clouds”, which can trigger lightning and more fires. Some 2,250 firefighters are working in temperatures that have soared to 47°C (116°F) in order to contain it. America’s National Interagency Fire Centre estimates that 78 large fires are raging across 13 states.
Meanwhile, heavy rain caused severe floods in Europe and China. Flooding in the area where Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands meet appears to have been caused by a low-pressure region that sucked in moisture from lakes and wet soil across central Europe. It sat there for days, disgorging colossal quantities of rain. Reservoirs and sewer systems filled, and streams jumped their banks. At least 199 people have died and hundreds more are still missing. Henan, a province of central China, suffered its heaviest rainfall in a thousand years. Dozens of rivers burst their banks and streets flooded, causing transport disruptions in many cities. Tens of thousands of people were displaced.

The Tamarack Fire, discovered on July 4th, was ignited by a lightning strike. It has burned over 41,000 acres in Nevada.

1584,"CONVENTIONAL WISDOM says that when a police shooting captures public attention, sparking outrage over police violence, officers respond by pulling back, in a phenomenon known as the “Ferguson effect” (named for a city that saw widespread protests against police misconduct in 2014). Common sense also suggests that when people mistrust the police they are less likely to call them. Criminologists are divided over whether the Ferguson effect actually exists. But a new working paper from Desmond Ang, an economist at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, and his colleagues shows that the latter phenomenon is real: after George Floyd’s murder, calls to the police plummeted.

The authors combined police-related 911 calls with data from ShotSpotter, which uses audio sensors placed around American cities to detect and alert police to gunshots. They then calculated the ratio of 911 calls to ShotSpotter-detected gunshots in the eight cities for which data were available for 2020. You might expect that, under normal circumstances, higher crime would lead to more 911 calls, lower crime would lead to fewer calls, and this ratio would remain relatively steady.

Mr Ang and his colleagues found that in the week before Mr Floyd’s death, there were around 200 calls to 911 made for every shot detected by ShotSpotter. After the 25th there were only around 90 (see chart). This drop in the call-to-shot ratio was driven by both an increase in the number of shots detected and a decrease in the volume of 911 calls. The former may raise doubts about the accuracy of the data: the protests sparked by Mr Floyd’s death made cities much noisier places than usual. But when the authors used gun deaths and injuries in their analysis, rather than gunshots, they arrived at the same conclusion. After May 25th the number of 911 calls for every gun death or injury fell by almost half.
The findings may reshape social scientists’ understanding of the Ferguson effect. Calls from the public are an important source of information for police, says Mr Ang. “Civilian and community engagement are needed for the police to do a good job, to identify and solve crimes and to ensure public safety.” Events that harm the public’s trust in law enforcement, such as unlawful police killings hinder such engagement, putting the lives of both civilians and officers at risk. ■",2
1585,"IT HAS BEEN 11 months since anyone hugged Larry. The 62-year-old accountant lives alone in Chicago, which went into lockdown last March in response to covid-19. He has heart problems so he has stayed at home since then. The only people to touch him have been latex-sheathed nurses taking his blood pressure. Larry describes himself as a “touchy-feely” person. Sex is nice, but more than that he longs for casual platonic contact: hugs and handshakes. He lies in bed, he says, yearning to have someone to hold or to hold him.
The pandemic has been an exercise in subtraction. There are the voids left by loved ones who have succumbed to covid-19, the gaps where jobs and school used to be, and the absence of friends and family. And then there are the smaller things that are missing. To stop the spread of covid-19 people have forsaken the handshakes, pats, squeezes and strokes that warm daily interactions. The loss of any one hardly seems worthy of note.

And yet touch is as necessary to human survival as food and water, says Tiffany Field, director of the Touch Research Institute at the Miller School of Medicine, part of the University of Miami. It is the first sense to develop and the only one necessary for survival. We can live with the loss of sight or hearing. But without touch, which enables us to detect such stimuli as pressure, temperature and texture, we would be unable to walk or feel pain. Our skin is the vehicle through which we navigate the world.
Certain groups have long been starved of touch. For centuries lepers were deemed untouchable. Dalits, the lowest caste in India, were literally known as such. Solitary confinement is used as a punishment in prisons. In a film made before his death in 2015 Peter Collins, a Canadian convict locked up alone, said he craved so intensely the touch of another human that he pretended the flies walking on his skin were his wife’s fingers. But not until the pandemic, with its widespread social distancing, have such vast swathes of the population been deprived of friendly physical contact for so long.
Humans need touch to form close relationships. To improve its chances of survival, Homo sapiens evolved to live in groups. Humans “need to interact with each other”, explains Alberto Gallace, a psychobiologist at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which may explain why, like other social animals, they have developed a neurological system designed to respond to affectionate touch. Stimuli applied to the skin at a certain pressure and speed—“basically a caress”, says Dr Gallace—activate a dedicated nerve fibre in the skin. Stimulating this fibre lights up parts of the brain responsible for pleasure, releasing a cocktail of hormones, including dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin, that soothe anxiety and make us feel happier.
The importance of touch starts early. A review of scientific literature conducted in 2016 found that babies who had skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth were 32% more likely to breastfeed successfully on their first attempt than those who did not. Several hours later, they also had better heart and lung function and higher blood-sugar levels. In one study in 1986 in America premature babies who were given regular massages for ten days shortly after they were born gained weight more quickly and left intensive care sooner than premature babies who were not. Their physical and cognitive development was also better than the control group in tests a year later.
The positive health effects continue. Touch depresses levels of cortisol, a hormone produced in response to stress. In addition to triggering the “flight or fight” response, cortisol smothers “natural killer cells”, a type of white blood cell that attacks viruses and bacteria. Touch can also increase the production of natural killer cells in patients with HIV and cancer, according to Dr Field. In 2014 researchers at Carnegie Mellon University observed that healthy adults who were hugged more frequently were less likely to get colds, perhaps because such embraces are a way of communicating affection, and people who feel cared for are less likely to fall ill.
A lack of touch, by contrast, is damaging. After controlling for factors such as poverty and quality of medical care, studies of infants show that the absence of touch leads to a broad range of developmental problems, argues David J. Linden, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, in a book called “Touch”. Children who are not cuddled tend to develop certain cognitive skills later than their peers. A lack of touch may fuel aggression. In 2002 Dr Field observed that compared with French adolescents, children in America received less affectionate physical contact and were more combative. But those who received daily massages became less aggressive after five days.
Without regular contact people can become “skin hungry”, a state in which they experience less touch than they want. The few studies that have been done into skin hunger suggest it is harmful. A survey of 509 adults from around the world in 2014 suggested that being deprived of touch was linked to loneliness, depression, stress, mood and anxiety disorders and secondary immune disorders.
The pandemic supercharged that. In a poll of 260 Americans who had been under lockdown for a month last April, conducted by Dr Field, 60% said that they longed for physical contact. The impact may be particularly acute in places where people are normally more tactile. In southern Italy “keeping your distance from someone is almost offensive”, says Luca Vullo, the author of a book on Italians’ non-verbal communication. And yet even Italians have surprised themselves with the level of their compliance with social-distancing measures. Most wear masks and keep their distance in queues (although when restrictions have been eased, many have found it harder to maintain, especially in restaurants, and particularly after a glass or two of wine). In Brazil, however, Claudia Matarazzo, an etiquette coach who wrote a guide in mid-2020 on how to limit physical contact without being rude, has given up trying to convince her compatriots to swap kisses for elbow bumps. Her efforts have not been helped by the president, Jair Bolsonaro, who regularly hugs and shakes hands with supporters. He failed to keep his distance even when he had covid-19.
By contrast, people from more reserved countries may hardly notice they are receiving less physical contact. Leonard Lim, a Singaporean tech worker, has not met anyone in the flesh, except for his wife, with whom he lives, and their parents, since last February. It did not occur to him that he had received less physical human contact over the past year until asked whether he had noticed its absence.
The sense of touch is easily overlooked. Its flashier cousins, vision and hearing, have entire art forms dedicated to them while chefs and perfumers serve our taste buds and nostrils. Scientists neglect it. For every research paper on touch, there are 100 on sight. In the 19th century European intellectuals dismissed touch as “a crude and uncivilised mode of perception”, inferior to sight, according to Constance Classen, a cultural historian. In Anglophone countries, the Victorian horror of the body gave popular ballast to this bias. Strictures against touch persisted in those countries into the next century. In the 1960s Sidney Jourard, a psychologist at the University of Florida, observed the behaviour of couples in coffee shops around the world. Over the course of an hour couples in Paris and Puerto Rico touched each other 110 and 180 times respectively. Their counterparts in Florida touched each other just twice. Those in London avoided any contact at all.
Out of touch
People in such countries are more demonstrative today. But Dr Field argues that many Americans were suffering from skin hunger before the pandemic. Among those surveyed by Dr Field in April only a fifth said that they touched their children frequently. Outside the home, tactile interaction has effectively been outlawed in many places. Many American states have banned teachers from touching their students. A lot of schools have similar policies. The MeToo movement means physical contact is rare in offices. And in recent decades the number of people living alone has shot up in many rich countries. So too has the time spent online. Virtual spaces bring users together but these connections are forged in an immaterial dimension. Screens are portals to digital worlds that require us to leave our bodies behind. Richard Kearney, a professor of philosophy at Boston College, calls this process “excarnation” and argues that it is fuelling a “crisis of touch”.

Some were trying to mend this before the pandemic. In Japan Deguchi Noriko, the founder of the Japan Touch Counselling Association, instructs new mothers, nurses and nursery teachers in the art of what she calls “skinship”, the act of “deepening our bond and trust with others” through clasping hands, hugging and stroking. In America urbanites were congregating at “cuddle parties”, hopeful that draping themselves over strangers would banish their loneliness.
In 2015 Madelon Guinazzo and Adam Lippin founded Cuddlist, a company which trains “cuddle therapists”. They suspected that many people longed for “platonic, mutual, consensual touch that’s purely about affection”, says Ms Guinazzo. That need was not being met, she argues, because of the “hypersexualisation” of touch in America. Their company has put therapists in contact with 50,000 clients around the world. They tend to be people experiencing too little touch or the unwelcome kind. Larry, the accountant from Chicago, began seeing Ms Guinazzo three years ago. He was uncomfortable with the idea of paying for hugs but his desire for contact exceeded the brief embraces he received from friends. He was surprised to find that the shoulder rubs, hugs and hand-holding brought him comfort and “a sense of joy”.
At present Larry can only meet Ms Guinazzo online. They evoke the sensation of touch through words and their imaginations—or try to. Zoom cuddles are not as potent as those in the flesh, says Larry. But in the age of distance, the skin-hungry must make do with what they can. Between February 10th and 13th 2020 sales of massage chairs in China were 436% higher than in the same period in 2019, according to Suning.com, a big retailer. Others are turning to technology to simulate caresses. CuteCircuit weaves haptic sensors into shirts which, it claims, can transmit the sensation of a hug using Bluetooth technology to corresponding shirts. Between April and December, traffic to its online shop surged by 238%. The pandemic has made many more people aware of their craving for touch, says Ms Guinazzo. Her business has suffered, but once covid-19 ebbs she expects demand to surge. People need to touch people, not just screens. ■

1586,"THE HEADLINE of the latest pronouncement from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the physical science of climate change is the finding that, even if the world cuts emissions by more than governments are promising, it is still “more likely than not” that Earth will be 1.5°C warmer by around 2050 than it was in the late 19th century.
That is important, and frightening, but hardly shocking. The aim of letting the world warm no more than 1.5°C, agreed on in Paris six years ago, is one to which many countries, notably the small-island states for which sea-level rise is an existential threat, are deeply committed. But many observers believe it stringent almost to the point of impossibility.

Another conclusion in the IPCC report, though, may come as news to many. If carbon-dioxide emissions were the only means by which humans were changing the climate, 1.5°C of warming would have already come about. As it is, other human emissions matter, too. Among the most important are sulphate aerosols: tiny particles produced by the combustion of coal and some sorts of oil that float in the air, sully the lungs, kill millions—and also, by reflecting away incoming sunlight, cool Earth.

The IPCC reckons that sulphates have provided a net cooling of 0.4-0.5°C since the late 19th century, and that this is a large part of the reason why that period has seen only 1.1°C of warming. But the sulphates’ influence is on the wane. In order to improve air quality, and thereby save lives, sulphur is now removed from almost all liquid fuels at the refining stage and increasingly scrubbed from the flues of coal-fired power stations, even in China. This clearing of the air is stripping away some of the noxious cooling. Speedy reduction in fossil-fuel use will remove the rest of it—thus, ironically, allowing the effects of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere to be felt all the more keenly.
In 2006 Paul Crutzen, a pre-eminent atmospheric chemist, suggested that there might be a way to save people’s lungs while still keeping them cool. In the lower atmosphere, where industry dumps them, sulphate particles are short-lived. In the stratosphere they last much longer. Putting a relatively sparse layer of sulphates into the stratosphere could thus provide the same amount of cooling as today’s lower-atmosphere smogs while doing almost no direct harm.
Crutzen’s intervention spurred renewed interest in the idea of intentionally interfering with incoming sunlight, a possibility known as “solar geoengineering”. It is an interest of which the IPCC is wary. Solar geoengineering has no role in the scenarios the panel uses to talk about future climates. As a result its new report, like its predecessors, discusses the idea only in broad terms. In doing so it notes, correctly, that the idea has significant drawbacks. But it also allows that solargeoengineering might, in principle, be used to create significant global cooling much more promptly than reducing carbon-dioxide emissions ever could.
Both the drawbacks and the potential provide good reason for researching geoengineering more thoroughly and systematically. But it would be wrong to think it a quick, easy or necessarily desirable response. Perhaps the biggest worry is that its seeming promise would be used as an excuse for inaction on carbon-dioxide emissions. A world where geoengineering was used simply to cover up, increasingly imperfectly, the effects of ever higher greenhouse-gas levels would be a fearsomely unstable one.
A more palatable approach to offsetting the diminishing effects of sulphate pollution, enthusiastically endorsed by the IPCC, is to redouble efforts to reduce emissions of another climate-changing by-product of human civilisation. Methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but one which lasts in the atmosphere for only about a decade. Reduce methane emissions and you soon reduce methane levels; reduce methane levels and you reduce global warming.
Its rising atmospheric concentration shows that today’s efforts to abate methane emissions are not up to the job. Happily, there is much more that can be done. Emissions from the energy industry could be more tightly regulated almost everywhere. Because methane is valuable, some would pay for themselves. Reducing emissions from landfill sites is not terribly difficult either. Livestock would burp less with the right feed supplements. Eliminating emissions would be hard; but quite steep reductions are entirely possible.
Carbon dioxide remains the heart of the climate problem. Exploring the possibilities, practicalities and dangers of solargeoengineering remains a good idea. But it is on methane emissions that progress can be made most quickly. And the world is getting ever hotter. Methane should be given priority on the agenda at the COP26 climate summit this November.

1587,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",3

1589,"LEE JI-HOON’S younger clients have lately been making unusual requests. “People in their 20s and early 30s showed up and asked me to draw up these excessive training plans and dieting rules,” says Mr Lee, who works as a personal trainer at a fancy gym in Gangnam, a posh part of Seoul, South Korea’s capital. The clients, most of whom are women, all have the same aim: they want to look hot for their “body profiles”.
An Instagram search in Korean for the hashtag “body profile” turns up more than 2.5m results. Most of them are glossy full-body portraits of men and women in their underwear, posted on personal accounts (though a few belong to celebrities). Some subjects are draped over chairs, recline on beds or emerge from pools and rivers. Others pose with champagne and canapés, or with foliage.

The point, like so much on Instagram, is to impress. Joo Sohyun, a 27-year-old in Seoul, says she booked a body-profile photo session because she was bored with doing nothing except work. “I wanted that identity of someone who keeps fit,” she says. Taking the profile shots was a way of proving to the world that she had worked hard to achieve a valuable goal. The whole thing, including the training programme and photo session, set her back more than 1.5m won ($1,300). Others splurge even more. Mr Lee’s packages start at 2.5m won; bespoke ones can be 7m won.
Yoo Hyun-jae, who studies youth culture at Sogang University in Seoul, thinks the trend reflects an obsession with looks and social status. The attention young people pay to their online image mirrors everyday life, where looking your best in public is considered polite and commenting on others’ appearance and offering suggestions for improvements remain common.
As in other countries, advertising exploits the associated anxiety. A company hawking diet products plasters cinemas all over the country with posters urging patrons to “reconsider your popcorn”. Serious-looking plastic surgeons admonish commuters in ads on Seoul’s subway: “Think you’re pretty? Think again.” Celebrity culture also plays a role, says Mr Yoo. The first people to publish body profiles were the pop stars from whom many youngsters take their cues.
Some commentators worry that the trend harms young people’s mental health and fosters poor eating habits. Even Mr Lee is concerned. “I was so proud when they showed me the pictures, but some of them came back a few weeks later looking worse than they did before they started working out,” he says. Mr Yoo is less fretful: “Those body-image problems are not caused by the fact that people are now taking pictures of themselves while exercising.” Hand-wringing will in any case do little to dissuade the likes of Ms Joo. “Houses are too expensive and jobs are hard to come by. This is one of the easiest and healthiest ways for young people to feel a sense of achievement,” she says.",2
1590,"IN THE EARLY months of the pandemic it was common to hear that Africa had been spared the worst of covid-19. Experts pointed to low official rates of illness or death and speculated about whether they were a result of youthful demography, Africa’s experience of dealing with infectious diseases such as Ebola and HIV, or something else entirely, perhaps underlying immunity. The premise was shaky, however. Most African countries test tiny numbers of people. Only a few keep good track of deaths. One that does, South Africa, has suffered one of the world’s highest levels of excess mortality during the pandemic. The sanguine view also neglected how, even if Africa’s waves really were less deadly than elsewhere, there might also be more of them because of low vaccination rates.
Today there is little sign of the continent being spared. As of June 28th the seven-day rolling average of confirmed cases in South Africa was 267 per million people, more than five times the global average, and rising steeply. Almost a quarter of tests are positive, suggesting that many cases are going undetected. “The latest surge threatens to be Africa’s worst yet,” says Matshidiso Moeti, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Africa. Cases are rising especially quickly in 12 countries, she says, though “health systems are already pushed to breaking point” in many more. In Namibia, Uganda and Zambia, among other places, oxygen is running out and hospital beds are full. The WHO calculates that, within weeks, the Africa-wide caseload of the third wave will surpass the peak of the second, which in turn was higher than the peak of the first.

Dr Moeti highlights two reasons for the strength of the latest wave. The first is public fatigue. In rich countries covid-19 was seen as a once-in-a-lifetime event to be endured until vaccines arrived; in many African ones it is another burden among many, with no sign of relief. Governments have been slower to impose lockdowns this time around. They have no money to pay people to stay at home, fear the effects on commerce and note the lack of public clamour for restrictions. ""The third wave has come with a severity that most countries were not prepared for,” adds John Nkengasong, the director of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a continent-wide public-health body.

The second is the arrival of new variants. Not every African country can sequence virus genomes. But more than half have reported the Alpha variant first detected in Britain and the Beta variant initially spotted in South Africa. Nearly a quarter have reported the Delta variant linked to India’s catastrophic second wave.
Those countries include Congo and Uganda. Neither has many confirmed cases of the virus. Congo, a country of 87m people, has recorded 40,000, fewer than Glasgow, a Scottish city of 630,000 people. But, in an indication of covid-19’s true spread, 32 of the country’s 600-odd MPs have died from the disease. In Uganda more than 200 MPs and parliamentary staff have tested positive in the past few weeks. This is part of a broader trend. As of February, Africa accounted for 17 of the 24 government ministers or heads of state who are reported to have died from covid-19, noted a paper in the British Medical Journal.
South Africa is at the centre of the continent’s third wave. On June 27th President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a partial lockdown, warning that cases would surpass previous peaks. Gauteng, the province that is home to Johannesburg and about a quarter of South Africans, accounts for more than half of recent cases. The week to June 26th saw more excess deaths in Johannesburg than at any time since records began in 1997. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Ambulances drive around looking for beds. In the absence of a government plan, doctors use WhatsApp groups to find out if other hospitals have space. Even the best private hospitals are wrestling with grim decisions about who gets a spot in intensive-care units—in other words, with who lives and who dies. “It’s real ‘Who gets the parachute?’ stuff,” says a doctor.
South Africa is also dealing with public fatigue, a battered economy and new variants. Delta is “rapidly displacing” the Beta variant, says Mr Ramaphosa. But the government has added to the carnage. There is no permanent health minister, following the suspension of Zweli Mkhize, who is accused of steering a contract to a firm run by associates (he denies the allegations). A large public hospital in Johannesburg is closed because the provincial government was slow to repair it after a fire in April. Mr Ramaphosa’s televised “family meetings” initially won plaudits. But his appearances are increasingly tone-deaf. The latest restrictions, which include another ban on alcohol sales, came late in the day.
Inoculation would have lessened the impact of the third wave. But just over 1% of Africans have been fully vaccinated. Of the nearly 3bn doses administered globally, fewer than 2% are in Africa.
Hesitancy remains a problem. Tanzania has yet to start jabbing arms because its late president, John Magufuli, denied the usefulness of vaccines. South Africa rejected a shipment of AstraZeneca doses on the grounds that data suggested it would not stop mild infection, an argument criticised by scientists who said it would probably reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death. In Gauteng those who can are seeking other options. Diplomatic missions are organising their own vaccines. Expatriates are flying home to get jabbed.
But the main reason for low vaccination rates is simple: a lack of supply. Dr Nkengasong notes that African countries have placed enough orders to meet Africa CDC’s target of getting 60% of the continent vaccinated by the end of 2022. The problem has been turning orders into deliveries.
An announcement made on June 30th should help. The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, and the American, French and German governments, said they would provide €600m in financing to help Aspen Pharmacare, a South African firm, manufacture vaccines. The deal could help produce as many as 250m single-shot Johnson  Johnson doses for the continent this year, including 30m for South Africa. Such volumes raise the prospect that a fourth wave could be less deadly than the third. ■

1591,"London (CNN)Here in the UK, a deep-seated debate on privacy is taking place after the Guardian newspaper announced it was taking legal action over the media's exclusion from a hearing on Prince Philip's will earlier this year.A version of this story appeared in the November 19 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here. In September, Andrew McFarlane, president of the High Court's Family Division, ruled that Philip's will would be sealed for 90 years. Among the few present was a lawyer representing the duke's estate from law firm Farrer & Co, the Queen's private solicitors, and the attorney general, the government's chief legal adviser. The media weren't told of the hearing or permitted to attend, with the public interest represented by the attorney general.A Guardian News & Media spokesperson told CNN in an emailed statement that the High Court's decision to ban the media from the court hearing without informing outlets or allowing them to make representations ""is a clear threat to the principles of open justice.""""It is also concerning that the court appears to believe that only the attorney general can speak to the public interest,"" the spokesperson continued. ""We are seeking permission to argue that the behaviour of the high court in this instance constitutes a failure of open justice and that the case should be reheard.""According to British law, if a person prepares a will prior to their death, it becomes a public document after being admitted to probate, and anyone can obtain a copy from the Probate Registry for a fee.  However, anyone can ask the court to ""seal"" a will and keep it private, according to Geoff Kertesz and Judith Swinhoe-Standen from UK law firm Stewarts. ""The court must be persuaded that it would be 'undesirable or otherwise inappropriate' to make the will public,"" they told CNN. ""Historically, the courts have approved such applications only for senior members of the royal family. It is unclear under what, if any, other circumstances the court might agree to keep a will private.""One recent senior royal whose will was made public was Diana, Princess of Wales, who gave up her HRH title when she divorced Prince Charles.Judge McFarlane said in his ruling that ""it has become the convention that, following the death of a senior member of the Royal Family, an application to seal their will is made"" and that ""it appears that such applications have always been heard in private and have invariably been granted.""He said it was understood that the first member of the royal family whose will was sealed was Prince Francis of Teck, the younger brother of King George V's wife Queen Mary, who died in 1910.Legal and royal expert Michael L. Nash told CNN: ""It was Queen Mary who used these unusual royal powers and prerogatives never used before.""Francis died suddenly at the age of 40, following a botched medical examination of his nose, according to Nash, who also authored ""Royal Wills in Britain from 1509 to 2008."" He said the prince was a ""reckless gambler"" but also an ""extremely lovable character,"" who bequeathed treasured family jewels to his mistress in a draft version of his will.Nash, who has seen a copy of the draft will that surfaced in archives in Northern Ireland, said the prince was constantly in financial trouble, and upon his death ""Queen Mary knew that the creditors, once they saw the will, would descend and everything that Frank died possessed of would have to be sold in order to satisfy these massive debts.""He continued, ""And she was absolutely mortified that the public would be able to know about the state that her brother had got himself into.""Nash also pointed out that the family has faced legal challenges to the secrecy of royal wills before, the most recent of which was considered by the court in 2007. He highlighted an application by Robert Andrew Brown, who claimed to be the illegitimate child of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret. Brown sought to open Margaret's will, as well as that of the Queen Mother, but the claim was dismissed as a fantasy, Nash said. Privacy has become the debate of the modern era for the British monarchy, with the question of how much privacy a family member deserves routinely emerging. Critics often say royals use their positions and privilege to secure exemptions and evade scandal, while also noting that the Windsors are funded by taxpayers.In his judgment, McFarlane said he was the custodian of a safe holding more than 30 envelopes, each of which supposedly contains the secret will of a dead royal. The most recent additions were made in 2002 with those of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.  McFarlane also touched upon why privacy was afforded for royal wills, saying: ""The answer to the question 'why should there be an exception for senior members of the Royal Family?' is, in my view, clear: it is necessary to enhance the protection afforded to the private lives of this unique group of individuals, in order to protect the dignity and standing of the public role of the Sovereign and other close members of Her family.""Lawyers Kertesz and Swinhoe-Standen said there was a notable difference in the handling of the Duke of Edinburgh's wills and those of royals before him.""All previously sealed royal wills are to be kept private indefinitely, but Prince Philip's will is different in that its privacy is time-restricted to 90 years,"" the pair said. ""After 90 years, certain officials may inspect it, and they may then invite the court to rule on whether the will should be made public at that point, or kept private for a further period.""Nash described the time limit as an ""important advance,"" as the previous position meant wills were concealed in perpetuity. ""That gave serious misgivings to historians, lawyers, researchers -- everybody that had a valid reason for reading the will,"" he added.""I can see in future cases that 90 years tumbling down to, say, 50 years or even less. So that there is at least some possibility of people living now being able to read (a will) at some time in the future during their lifetime.""HAVE YOUR SAYSo, what do you think: Should or shouldn't the public be allowed to read a royal will, and why?It's certainly an interesting one to ponder.

1592,"NEW DELHI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - An Indian antitrust investigation into suspected price collusion by some prominent global agricultural firms was triggered by farmers who complained about excessive pricing of imported carrot seeds, documents seen by Reuters showed.
A group representing about 1,500 farmers in the mountainous Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu, a top carrot-growing state in southern India, petitioned the watchdog in 2019 alleging that an ""unfair profit margin"" was being charged on the carrot seeds, the regulatory documents showed.
This is the first time the complaint is coming into public view. It has touched off an investigation that has the potential to affect pricing practices in an Indian vegetable seed market expected to be worth $1.2 billion in five years.
In some instances, the agricultural firms' seeds were allegedly being sold at four times the imported price, according to the documents. The farmers were also denied sale of such seeds in the northern parts of India where they were available at prices up to 50% cheaper, they alleged, according to the documents.
As part of the investigation, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) conducted a multi-city search and seizure operation on Sept. 8 at the local units of Germany's BASF (BASFn.DE), France's Vilmorin & Cie (VILM.PA) and other firms. The watchdog as a policy does not disclose any ongoing cartel investigations.
""There appears to be an understanding/arrangement between the seed importing companies to control the supply of imported variety of carrot seeds and determine their prices,"" the CCI said in May last year in a confidential order, in which it asked its investigation unit to look into the matter.
There ""appears to be a restriction on dealers not to sell to farmers other than those belonging to a particular region,"" and the CCI believed ""seed companies/distributors/dealers are apparently using their market power"" to control demand and supply in the Nilgiris, added the eight-page order.
The subsequent September 2021 raids were conducted at the local units of BASF, Vilmorin's HM Clause, a former distributor entity of Dutch-based Bejo Zaden and some other Indian entities, two people familiar with the operation said.
The investigation could take several months to complete and opens up seed firms and their executives to fines if they are found guilty of violating India's antitrust laws, the sources added.
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
BASF spokesperson Úlia de Domènech said in a statement Nunhems India - its vegetable seeds unit which was raided - was committed to complying with Indian laws and was cooperating with all regulators, including the CCI.
A Bejo India official, who declined to be named, said the company sells seeds at same prices to all distributors and in different geographical regions.
Franck Berger, Vilmorin's head of vegetable seeds, told reporters in France last month five companies were raided in India in the case, adding that HM Clause assisted the authorities.
Spokespersons for Bejo and HM Clause did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
CCI's RAID OPERATION
India's vegetable seed market is set to be worth $1.2 billion by 2026, growing 10% a year since 2020, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence. The country is among the top 15 carrot producers in the world, industry estimates show.
The farmers' 2019 complaint cited an example in which an HM Clause's carrot seed variant was allegedly imported at 7,000 rupees ($93.63) per kilogram and sold at four times the price. A similar margin was charged allegedly on a variant of Bejo's seeds.
The farmers also alleged that when they provided positive feedback on the seeds, company dealers jacked up their prices, which were also different across south and north India.
Ahead of ordering the broader investigation, two CCI officials visited the region last year and interviewed farmers and government officials and collected some seed samples from a laboratory, according to a separate internal CCI report. One farmer during that visit showed the CCI a message on his phone to claim prices of same seeds were different in north and south India, the document stated.
The CCI's confidential order noted that as the same type of carrot seed can be used across India, there was ""no apparent reason"" for selling them at different prices.
During the September raids, data from laptops and smartphones was copied by CCI officials, and some executives were questioned about their practices, the two sources said.
Carrot is a key crop grown in the Nilgiri mountains and R. Rangasamy, president of the complainant farmer group, the Nilgiri Potato & Vegetables Growers Association, told Reuters farmers were suffering due to the high pricing and sale curbs.
""The methodology to fix rates is not transparent ... We are incurring heavy losses because of this randomness,"" he said.",3

1594,"Washington (CNN)President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday that he is mulling a US diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing.""It's something we're considering,"" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office following a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.A senior administration official told CNN on Wednesday that Biden is not expected to attend the upcoming Olympics in China this February and that his administration is on the verge of implementing a diplomatic boycott of the games. The President has not signed off on having no government officials attend, the senior administration official cautioned on Wednesday, but discussions regarding the matter have all leaned in that direction. The topic of the Olympics and Biden's attendance did not come up during his three-and-a-half hour meeting Monday night with Chinese President Xi Jinping.However, the two leaders engaged in a ""healthy debate"" on a number of issues, according to a senior Biden administration official present for the discussions. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon that the decision to consider a boycott of the Olympics ""doesn't say anything"" about the Biden-Xi meeting. ""(W)e've said from ... the beginning of this administration, as it relates to how we engage with China, that we see it through the prism of competition, not conflict,"" Psaki added.Psaki repeated the administration's serious concerns about China's human rights abuses, adding that ""certainly, there are a range of factors as we look at what our presence would be.""When pressed for more information about what a potential diplomatic boycott would entail, and what that would mean for athletes, Psaki said she didn't have an update about what the US presence would be.Democratic and Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have advocated for a diplomatic boycott in protest of China's human rights abuses. Some Republicans have even suggested no American athletes attend either, but the official said a full boycott is unlikely right now.When asked whether Biden had been in touch with congressional lawmakers about the prospective boycott, Psaki said the White House is ""in regular touch at a range of levels with members of Congress about a range of issues, including the relationship with China and including an issue like this."" Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US and allies are in ""active conversations"" about how to approach the upcoming Winter Olympics in China.Blinken, appearing virtually at the New York Times DealBook Summit, was asked whether he thinks American athletes should participate since he has said in the past that China is involved in genocide, given its policies toward Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province.""We are talking to -- to allies, to partners, to countries around the world about how they're thinking about the games, how they're thinking about participation,"" Blinken said. ""It's an active conversation. We're coming -- we're coming up on the games, but let me leave it at that for today.""",0
1595,"THE SHEER number was overwhelming. Between 1950 and 2020 at least 216,000 children were sexually abused in France by Catholic clergy. Thus, on October 5th, concluded a two-year independent inquiry commissioned by the church. Jean-Marc Sauvé, who led it, said it uncovered “the lead weight of silence smothering the crimes” committed by 2,900-3,200 clergy. If lay molesters involved in church activities were also included, the number of abused could reach 330,000.
Mr Sauvé’s introduction to the report is chilling and unflinching: “The Catholic church’s immediate reaction was to protect itself as an institution” and it “has shown complete, even cruel, indifference to those who suffered”. About 90% of the victims were boys, many between ten and 13 years old. He called for “a humble acknowledgement of responsibility from the church authorities for the mistakes and crimes committed under its auspices”.

As was revealed by reports into sexual abuse by Catholic clergy elsewhere, the crimes in France involved a sinister web of misplaced trust, manipulated authority, concealment, silence and shame. The abuse was countrywide: in local parishes, scout groups, catechism classes and within families. Pope Francis expressed “great sorrow” for the victims. François Devaux, who suffered sexual abuse at the age of ten and later founded a victims group, called what they had gone through simply “hell”.
It was the efforts of survivors such as Mr Devaux that forced the church to confront its denials and cover-ups. He and others came forward in 2015 to accuse Bernard Preynat, a priest and scout leader, of sexual abuse. Mr Preynat was convicted last year. In 2019 the accusations prompted the resignation of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, convicted of covering up the Preynat affair (the conviction was overturned on appeal).
France has an unusual link with Catholicism, due to strict secular rules, known as laïcité, designed to keep the state neutral in religious affairs. It lacks the wide network of church-linked boarding schools and state institutions that helped to conceal paedophilia in some other countries. Yet this proved no protection for the victims.
Today the Catholic church in France is a hollowed-out version of its former self. Numbering 12,000, the priesthood is half what it was 20 years ago—and half of those serving are over 75. Only 49% of the French say they believe in God. Two years ago 56% said in one survey that they had a bad image of the Catholic church. This week’s report will entrench these trends.
The church is not the only French arena in which denial of sexual abuse has been exposed. Another is politics, where, until #MeToo, sexual violence towards women tended to be hushed up. Two recent books also reveal how members of Left-Bank Parisian circles deployed the principle of sexual liberty to mask abuse and incest. By exposing the manipulation and cruelty of the predators, those brave enough to speak out may in future help prevent such abuse from going undetected for so long. ■",2
1596,"Jodhpur, India (CNN)The Child Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA) of 1929 set out to ""eradicate the evil of child marriage"" in India. Almost a century later, the south Asian nation remains home to a third of the world's child brides. As of 2017, 223 million girls and women who were married off before their 18th birthday lived in India, according to the United Nations agency, UNICEF. Only a fraction of the children entered into child marriages are boys. Between April 2019 and March 2020, Childline India received nearly nine times more complaints about the child marriage of girls than of boys.Not only did the CMRA not eradicate child marriage, the law also failed to provide a way out for those children who had already been forced into marriage.  So in 2007 the CMRA was repealed and replaced by the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), which recognized that child marriages were valid but voidable. Thanks to the PCMA, a victim of child marriage has up to two years after reaching adulthood to annul their union should they wish to -- or know to.  It is difficult to say how many young women have benefited from the annulment provision of the Act. There is not publicly available information and the Ministry of Women and Child Development has not responded to CNN's multiple requests for the number of child marriage annulments.  What is known is that at least 43 child marriages have been annulled. And what all of those stories have in common is tenacious child rights advocate named Kriti Bharti.  Married off at one  Bharti helped secure India's very first child marriage annulment and told CNN she has assisted in 42 other cases since discovering the annulment provision in the PCMA.In March 2012 she met 18-year-old Laxmi Sargara. Bharti, whose surname means ""India's daughter"" in Hindi, was 24 at the time and had just formally registered her organization, Saarthi Trust. Both women lived, and continue to live, in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, famous for its regal history and architecture, and in 2017 was home to 15 million women and girls who were married as children.Sargara had been one of them. She'd been married off at the age of one to a 3-year-old boy in a different village, but only learned of the union many years later when her in-laws came to tell her that in a few days' time she'd be moving in with them. In Rajasthan, it is not uncommon for children as young as one to be married in traditional ceremonies such as the mausar -- where a wedding takes place on the 12th day of mourning after the death of a family member. The child continues to live with their parents until their gauna -- the ritual where they are then sent to their in-laws' home after puberty. Frightened, Sargara told her parents she was going to visit her older brother in the city of Jodhpur, an hour away from their village. With his help, they reached out to Bharti, who was a social worker then with a reputation for helping child marriage victims delay their gauna. ""When Laxmi approached me, she wanted something permanent, and she didn't want a divorce for a marriage that she never consented to,"" Bharti recalls. ""After poring over hundreds of judgments and legal documents, we finally realized that there is a provision of annulment that she could use.""  ""We were using a law that no one had used before, that courts themselves did not know about,"" Bharti continues. ""Today when we file a case it's much easier but back then we were setting the precedent."" Confronting tradition Three years after that historic first annulment, Bharti met Santa Devi. Devi grew up in Rohicha Kallan, a village two hours from Jodhpur. People here are farmers or make handicrafts and furniture. After her uncle died, Devi was married in a mausar ceremony at just 11 months to a boy who was 10 at the time. Like Sargara, she would continue to be raised by her parents.  In 2010 at 15, Devi learned she was married to the 25-year-old man who she said had been following her everywhere she went and showing up outside her school for weeks. It was only when she told her father about him that she learned of her fate. ""This is what our elders have always done,"" Devi recalls him saying.  Devastated, Devi was desperate for a way out. Her search would lead her to Bharti who she calls ""didi"" -- older sister. ""Back then I couldn't speak up, I didn't even know Hindi, I had never even left my village. But when the groom's family pressured me to perform gauna, I knew I had to do something. We [Devi and a friend] looked everywhere for a solution and ultimately came across news articles of Kriti didi who nullifies child marriages,"" Devi explains.  After speaking with Devi's friend, Bharti agreed to help. They had to move quickly: Devi traveled to Jodhpur to meet Bharti and fill in the paperwork just six days before her 20th birthday, the cut-off age for annulment applications for Indian women.  Legally seeking to annul the marriage was one thing. Going up against rural institutions of power was quite another. When Devi told her father about her wish to have her marriage annulled, he met with Bharti and after being counselled by her, agreed to support his daughter. But when the village heard about what Devi had done, a meeting of the jati panchayat or caste council (made up of ""leading men of a group [who meet] to deal with the problems that affect the group"") was called and a fine of 16 lakh Rupees (about US$ 21,521) was imposed on Devi's father for breaking up a marriage. Once the jati panchayat was involved, and facing a fine and the prospect of expulsion from their village, Devi's father withdrew his support. Devi says he gave her an ultimatum: ""Rip the [annulment] papers, otherwise you are not my daughter"". ""My case was probably the worst one that didi has had to deal with...the jati panchayats gave us a lot of trouble. They threatened to kill me. If didi had not kept me with her they definitely would have killed me,"" Devi says.Caste panchayats, such as the one that fined Devi's father, act as parallel systems of law enforcement, imposing penalties ranging from fines to excommunication and even so-called honor killings, a euphemism for the brutal murders of women and girls, in contravention of the country's current laws.  ""Courts were established later, but jati panchayats have long existed so they take decisions as per tradition,"" says Bharti, explaining how these institutions preserve harmful cultural practices such as child marriage.  ""The law has not been an answer to the problem of child marriage,"" says Bharti Ali, founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights. ""[Child marriage] continues despite the law being there for a long time now"". A 2021 study (available only in Hindi) conducted by HAQ found that of 20 cases where child marriages were broken off, in seven instances the decision was made by jati panchayats. India's traditional divorce law was applied in three cases, but on only one occasion was the child marriage annulled. In all the other cases, agreements were reached between the families involved. Bharti explains that people turn to jati panchayats not knowing the difference between an annulment and a divorce and expecting divorces to be expensive, laborious processes. The caste council is also known on occasion to allow for child marriages to end but families never anticipate having to pay the fine known as the jhagda -- a Hindi word which literally translates as ""fight"".  ""The study clearly points out that decisions are taken by the panchayats. If we want these provisions of law [such as the PCMA] to be used we will have to figure out what are the local mechanisms and how can we link them to the courts,"" says Ali. But Bharti is less willing to work with these traditional institutions of power, arguing that women, perceived as having a lesser status in a patriarchal system and are therefore not allowed to attend the council meetings, do not get a fair hearing.  While she acknowledges that the legal framework isn't perfect, with the justice system often failing to treat child marriage victims as victims, she argues that the courts are still fairer. ""When you look at [formal] courts, although I agree that there is a lack of sensitivity, at least they hear both parties. Jati panchayats listen to the one who holds greater weight in society and they promote child marriage so we don't want to create a bridge with them,"" she says. What gives the panchayat power to make rulings as it does on child marriage is the fact that the customary practice remains ""largely acceptable"" as Ali puts it, in vast swathes of urban and rural India. ""Everyone belongs to a certain community. They carry a social identity with them so they first look at the interests of the community and then any other cause,"" she adds. Even Lakshman Jandu, a father who turned to Bharti for help with an annulment only after the jati panchayat asked him to pay a 15 lakh rupees (about $ 20,124) fine, admits that if his daughter's suitor had turned out to be ""a decent boy"" he would not have opposed the union. ""We didn't intend to get her married then but there was a lot of pressure from the community because the other family had another son that they wanted to marry off, so we said we'd get her married so long as their son completes his education,"" Jandu explains. ""But he got into a lot of bad habits, theft, breaking into people's houses, drinking...he was completely out of his parents' control,"" says the 54-year-old father who earns a living as a chauffeur. ""I don't see child marriage as bad but when the situation ends up like this then it is bad."" Jandu's experience confirms what Bharti has seen: that despite policymakers seeing the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act as ""the exit policy"" for all victims of a child marriage, their families -- whose support is often essential -- only use it if there is some other problem in the marriage, and not because a girl was married off as a child. ""In the beginning the parents are usually against it, they worry about what the jati panchayats and the community will say. So the first thing we do is counsel the parents,"" says Bharti.  'I want girls to speak up for themselves'Child marriage rates have been declining In India. In 1970, 74% of girls were married off before their 18th birthday and 42% before they turned 15. In 2015, those percentages had fallen to 27% and 7% respectively. The trend has been attributed to access to education, and ""public messaging around the illegality of child marriage"". Despite the decline there are still a lot of girls Bharti describes as forgotten.It is also true that in India marriage offers women security and status, so Bharti knows that the young women she works with are going to need equipping to navigate life on their own, or until they chose to remarry on their own terms. ""I tell all the girls that I will only take their case if they promise to continue their education,"" she says. ""I want them to get to a place where they are able to speak up for themselves and protest if they are ever pressured to get married again against their will.""  Devi, whose marriage was annulled in 2015, had to live with Bharti during the process of annulment and later at the shelter that Bharti runs. She says continuing with her education -- and Bharti's reputation -- gave her the confidence to eventually start going back to her village home.  ""I wanted to study and work like all girls dream of growing up and working, and I got to do exactly that,"" says Devi, who now works at an insurance company. ""Now I go home often, because I've made something of myself. Initially, people were scared if they heard about me visiting; they thought I would call didi. Young girls often come to me if they think a child marriage is going to take place and I give them didi's number."" Helping young women imagine a life for themselves after child marriage and then supporting them as they build that life has been rewarding for Bharti but it has also been risky. ""I may not get breakfast, lunch or dinner on some days, but I definitely receive threats on a daily basis,"" says Bharti, who lives with her mother. ""I have also had instances of receiving fake tips about a child marriage taking place in attempts to lure me to a certain location. Call it a gut feeling or intuition, luckily I've avoided the worst,"" she adds. When asked if she has been to the police to report any of the threats she receives, Bharti says doing so would only make it harder for her to interact with the people she is trying to help because it would alienate her from them.   She knows the risks she is taking to help girls use a little-known law to fight a long-held tradition, yet she does it anyway. ""[The law had previously forgotten] about girls once they are married off, but they are the ones who need our help the most... No one is immortal, so if I can help even 10 girls along the way, I'm happy to take the risk.""  Read more from the As Equals series ",0
1597,"A CHANCELLOR EXTOLLING the virtues of innovation and entrepreneurship is about as surprising as a defence minister praising the army. Entrepreneurs can thus be forgiven for taking budget-day dispatches with a pinch of salt. But Rishi Sunak’s address on October 27th matched the warm words with action.
A panoply of programmes will funnel taxpayer money to the private sector. The government-backed British Business Bank will receive £1.6bn ($2.2bn) to allocate to its regional funds, which provide debt and equity capital for fledgling businesses. The Global Britain Investment Fund—which invests in life sciences, offshore wind and car manufacturing—gets a £1.4bn boost. A further £150m goes to a fund that aims to rebalance geographical inequalities in access to early-stage equity capital.

All of this is dwarfed by a pledge to raise government spending on research and development (R) to £20bn a year by the end of the parliamentary term, in 2024. After adjusting for inflation, that represents an increase of around a quarter from current levels. It is sorely needed. Britain’s gross R expenditure was 1.8% in 2019, compared with an average of 2.5% in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. Most of the difference is due to lacklustre R spending from Britain’s private sector compared with its international peers. But the Treasury hopes that more public funds will spur greater private investment as well.
Accompanying the extra money was an early warning of an attempt to muscle firms into spending more of it at home. Of the £47.5bn of R for which companies claimed tax relief in 2019, only £25.9bn was carried out in Britain. Noting that countries like America and Australia do not offer similar rebates for R performed overseas, the government promised to “refocus the reliefs towards innovation in the UK.”
As well as handing out cash, the chancellor set about reassuring startup founders and their investors that long-held gripes would be dealt with. One of these is a cap on the fees workplace pension schemes can pay to investment managers. Designed to protect retirement savings from outsized investment charges, it also limits pension schemes’ ability to invest in things like infrastructure and early-stage companies, due to the performance fees charged by venture capital funds. Treasury officials will now consult on loosening the cap.
Another is access to foreign talent, which is set to be liberalised next spring. A new visa programme will allow those with a job offer from a fast-growing British firm to migrate with few strings attached. A second will make graduates of top universities eligible for visas, even if they do not have a job offer. It is time for startup lobbyists to come up with a new wish-list.",2
1598,"WEEKS AFTER a team of experts from China and the World Health Organisation (WHO) conducted a joint inquiry into the origins of covid-19, their report, released on March 30th, gave no clear verdict. It said the most probable explanation was that the virus had jumped from animals to humans through an intermediate animal host. But the scientific search for a definitive answer will remain challenging because of geopolitical tensions and China’s attempts at obfuscation.
The report says it is “extremely unlikely” that the pathogen escaped from a lab in Wuhan (one is pictured), the central city where the first big outbreak of the disease occurred late in 2019. Indeed, it does not recommend further research into that possibility. Numerous other geneticists and virology experts disagree, saying the lab-leak theory remains plausible. Commenting on the report, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said the possibility of a laboratory incident required “further investigation”.


China has angrily denounced the laboratory-leak hypothesis as outright conspiracy-mongering. It will be as irritated by Dr Tedros’s remarks as it was pleased with the report’s strong downplaying of the possibility. China will be happy with the experts’ call for further study into the (very low) possibility that the virus can survive on packaging and other surfaces in shipments of frozen food, and go on to infect people. This idea is one that China has been eagerly promoting. It wants its citizens to believe—and the world at least to entertain the notion—that the virus originated outside China, even though scientists see scant evidence of that.
China’s fixation on the frozen-food theory has prompted it to take extraordinary measures to prevent the reimportation of the virus by this means (covid-19 has been all but eliminated inside the country). It has required onerous inspections of cold-chain shipments. Officials have suspended the rights of hundreds of suppliers to send frozen products to China.

Occasionally, officials report the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19, on frozen-food packaging. One such find, involving a beef product from Argentina, was made on March 28th at a warehouse in Tongliao, a city in the northern region of Inner Mongolia. It triggered an “emergency response”, with police and other officials mobilised to seal off the area, take people away for coronavirus tests and cleanse the site. “They’re putting a lot of energy into this unlikely but possible hypothesis, trying to elevate it for obvious reasons,” says Jamie Metzl, a former member of America’s National Security Council and a genetics expert.
The team’s report will do little to dispel widespread suspicions that China is co-opting the investigation process for political purposes and failing to provide adequate transparency. Risking China’s ire, Dr Tedros said the experts had faced difficulties in accessing raw data from their Chinese hosts. He insisted that future studies should “include more timely and comprehensive data sharing”. China, however, says it is being completely open. It also says the WHO should investigate whether the virus originated in America. As a new cold war develops, the fog is thickening. ■

1599,"“IT’S BEEN raining snakes amid the recent heavy downpour,” reported the Mumbai edition of the Times of India on July 26th, in a news piece about a rock python which “refused to be evicted” from an autorickshaw. The same paper contained reports of three other pythons rescued from a shipping container, and yet another that was found trapped in a fisherman’s net. A lost python spotted on a city beach made the papers the next day. Later that week a 28-year-old man found a snake in the distant suburbs, wrapped it around his neck and walked through a nearby market area as his friends made videos for social media. He died after it bit him three times.
It is not literally raining snakes. But a week of torrential downpours has had the same effect, driving snakes and other reptiles out of their burrows and into the city, where they seek warmth, shelter and gastronomic delights.

There are plenty to be found. Mumbai is highly built up and densely populated. But it is also full of ground-level foliage, warm nooks such as car engines, and lots of rubbish, the last of which attracts rats that make New York’s rodents look malnourished. The rats, in turn, attract hungry snakes.
“Rock pythons are rarely found in cities,” says Santosh Shinde of Spreading Awareness on Reptiles  Rehabilitation Programme (or SARRP, Sanskrit for snake), the outfit that rescued the reptile in the rickshaw. Nonetheless, he says, “Last year we found 25 pythons in one month.” As for venomous snakes, it would be easier to list the parts of Mumbai they are not found. SARRP rescued 130 reptiles in June, when the monsoon starts, up 14% from last year.
“In the summer we get a lot of snakes that are dehydrated and in the monsoon displacement is very common,” says Madhurita Gupta of the Snake Conservation Trust, another serpent-saving society. “But this year it has become too much.” She attributes the increasing number of snake-sightings to three factors: extreme rainfall driven by climate change, development encroaching on Mumbai’s forests and the piles of festering garbage that blight the city.
When people see a snake, they “immediately go to pray or throw [an auspicious] red cloth”, says Dr Gupta. Or they “try to kill or attack it, and then they get bitten”. Her staff are trying to teach the public to distinguish venomous snakes from others. So is Mr Shinde, who argues that, just as people know the difference between a Doberman and a Pomeranian, they should be able to tell a harmless rat snake from the deadly “big four”: cobras, kraits and two types of viper. The WHO reckons 58,000 Indians die every year of snake bites. Official estimates are lower, but still high enough to give India the highest snakebite-mortality rate in the world. On August 13th this year, Hindus mark Naag Panchami, a day on which snakes are worshipped. The best way to honour the creatures may be to learn a little more about them.",2
1600,"FOR MORE than two years, the common wisdom has been that Italy’s next government will be right-wing—and radically so. Polls have consistently indicated that the Brothers of Italy party, with its origins in neo-fascism, and the populist Northern League should together secure enough seats at the next election to form a parliamentary majority, perhaps even without needing help from Silvio Berlusconi’s more moderate Forza Italia movement.
But local elections on October 3rd and 4th showed how fragile the support underpinning the hard right is. Centre-left mayoral candidates won with more than half the votes in Milan, Naples and Bologna. Others in Rome and Turin look set to win in run-offs on October 17th and 18th.

The elections followed a nightmarish campaign for the League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, and for the leader of the Brothers—who is in fact a sister, Giorgia Meloni. On September 26th it emerged that Mr Salvini’s social-media guru, Luca Morisi, was under formal investigation on suspicion of supplying narcotics. Mr Morisi denies any wrongdoing. Four days later, Ms Meloni’s drive to give her party a moderate, voter-friendly image suffered a grievous blow when a video was released showing some of her followers joking about Hitler, giving fascist salutes and apparently arranging for the Brothers to receive money illicitly. An investigation has since been opened into a suspected breach of Italy’s law on funding political parties.
All this comes against a background of increasing division in the League. Mr Salvini’s position has become sufficiently tenuous for him to have spoken openly of being replaced. “If there is someone better than me,” he told an interviewer recently. “I’ll gladly enjoy [spending] a few hours more with my children.”
The origin of his troubles is his decision earlier this year that the League should join Italy’s current government—a broad coalition headed by the former president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi. The League’s support for Mr Draghi earned it three places in the cabinet and a say in the spending of around €200bn ($230bn) from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery funds.
But backing a government headed by a central banker who once defined himself as a liberal socialist was diametrically at odds with Mr Salvini’s populist instincts. It has also offered the Brothers a chance to steal the League’s populist thunder by remaining in opposition. Mr Salvini did opt to stay out of the cabinet, but has cut an increasingly awkward figure. In his efforts to hang on to the populist vote, he has repeatedly sniped at policies that ministers from his own party have endorsed.
Nowhere has his predicament been more obvious than in the contrast between his courting of the anti-vaccine lobby and the government’s vaccine mandates. He originally described the EU’s plans for a pass for the vaccinated, those who had recovered from covid-19 or been tested in the previous 48 hours, as “insane crap”. Ignoring his objections, Mr Draghi’s government has since made the pass obligatory for access to a host of venues and services.
Later this month Italy will become the first European country to require the pass for entry to both private and public workplaces. Even more embarrassingly for Mr Salvini, the government’s policies have been openly backed by the business minister, the League’s Giancarlo Giorgetti, and its regional governors in the industrial north—united in a desire to avoid further economically crippling lockdowns.
The League has been steadily losing electoral support since mid-2019 and now polls around 20%, down from 30% or so two years ago. In recent months, and for the first time, it has been overtaken by the Brothers. It is not clear whether Ms Meloni’s party will be able to shrug off the latest allegations and hang on to that lead. But Italy’s right looks badly weakened. ■",2
1601,"WHO IS RISHI SUNAK? Listen to the chancellor’s recent rhetoric, and you could be forgiven for thinking he was cast in the mould of a predecessor, George Osborne, who slashed the state in response to the global financial crisis. In a speech to the Conservative Party faithful on October 4th Mr Sunak described borrowing as “immoral”, and emphasised his eagerness to restore order to the public finances. But the budget he delivered on October 27th confused the picture. Reeling off spending measures, he refused to apologise for raising taxes and lauded the spending they supported. “The Conservatives are the real party of public services,” he trilled.
Mr Sunak displayed rare munificence. Government departments will get real increases in their budget of 3% a year on average until 2024-25, an increase reminiscent of largesse last seen consistently in the 2000s. Even more eye-popping are the chancellor’s plans for the size of the post-pandemic state. According to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), a watchdog, spending will grow from 39.8% of GDP before the pandemic to 41.6% by 2026-27, the highest sustained share since the 1970s. Tax will rise from 33.5% of GDP to 36.2%, a level not seen since the early 1950s. The announcements recalled not Mr Osborne, but a very different predecessor: Labour’s Gordon Brown.

The Brownite giveaway was prompted by a surprisingly perky economy. In March the OBR projected GDP growth of 4.1% this year. Now, thanks to rosier employment figures, it predicts 6.5%. In the same period, medium-term damage expected from covid-19 has gone from a gloomy 3% of GDP to a cautious 2%. Part of this is simply the passage of time revealing that investment has performed better than expected. But Mr Sunak is also benefiting from his adroit handling of the pandemic, which limited the hit to corporate balance-sheets.
All of this means Britain is borrowing less than expected. People are earning more, which increases the tax take. And Mr Sunak has raised taxes. In September he announced a health and social care levy, which will bring in a net sum of £12bn ($16bn) by 2024-25, and increased dividend tax rates. This year has seen the biggest overall tax rise since 1993—which is not a message the Tories will put on leaflets at the next general election.

Mr Sunak did offer some red meat to Conservative members. There was relief for payers of business rates, a cut to corporate-tax rates for banks and the now traditional fuel-duty freeze (as has happened without fail for the past decade). But none of these will cost more than £2bn a year by 2024-25. Mr Sunak also announced new fiscal rules: there will be no borrowing for day-to-day spending in three years’ time and debt will fall as a share of GDP. On current plans, he will meet these targets, but he has left less margin for error than his predecessors did with their rules, which all went unmet.
By the next election, Mr Sunak plans to be using most of the windfall delivered by better economic growth to lower borrowing (or, perhaps, as a slush fund for tax cuts). But now, he is spending—and in particular to ease the pressure on public services brought about by the pandemic. The health department will see the biggest increase, because hospitals must deal with both covid and an enormous backlog, but most will have at least some sort of rise. This will begin to reverse the cuts applied by Mr Osborne (see chart).

Given how much of the budget was trailed before, some wondered whether anything would be left for the main event. But the chancellor managed a few surprises. Half the planned increase in departmental spending in 2024-25 will restore foreign aid to 0.7% of GDP, a target abandoned during the pandemic. A welcome simplification to the mess of alcohol taxation was seized on by Mr Sunak, a Brexiteer, as a benefit of leaving the EU (it would not have been possible as part of the bloc). Firms running retail, hospitality and leisure properties will enjoy a temporary cut to business rates, to help their post-pandemic recovery.
The most impressive rabbit Mr Sunak pulled out of his hat was an increase in the generosity of Universal Credit, a benefit for working-age people. He faced criticism in September for allowing a pandemic-related uplift to expire, which cost recipients £1,000 a year. Rather than reverse the cut, Mr Sunak reduced the rate at which the benefit is withdrawn as people earn more. The Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, was quick to point out that together with higher minimum-wage rates, the change would still leave the poorest fifth of households £280 a year worse off.But it does at least cushion the blow.
Critics complain that the outlook for households’ disposable income is still pretty dismal. Mr Sunak’s cursory treatment of climate change smacked of complacency—and the trove of documents released alongside his speech revealed little that would fulfil Britain’s bold climate-change ambitions. Given the number of global leaders about to descend on Glasgow to discuss the matter, it was slightly odd to announce a cut on short-haul flights taxes (and not to raise fuel duty).
Before the budget, there was lots of noise about the growing distance between Mr Sunak and the prime minister, Boris Johnson. There were even rumours that Mr Johnson would move the chancellor to a different, less prominent job, so perturbed was he by his rival’s star power. But the fiscal event revealed them to be aligned, at least as far as governing the country is concerned. Both are happy to spend big if circumstances call for it. Neither is a small-state ideologue. ■",2
1602,"ON FEBRUARY 1ST researchers around the world saw the tweet for which they had been waiting: “We say with caution, the magic has started”. Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute, had been posting regular updates on the course of Israel’s covid-19 epidemic since its mass vaccination campaign had begun six weeks earlier. By February 1st he was seeing the number of hospitalisations dropping significantly among the over-60s—a cohort in which the number vaccinated had reached 70%, seen as a crucial level, three weeks before. After an expected but still somewhat nail-biting lag, the vaccine was doing its thing.
By February 6th about 85% of the over-60s in Israel—and 40% of the general population—had received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine (or in a few cases the Moderna mRNA vaccine) and 75% of the over-60s had received their second dose, too. In that age group hospital admissions for covid-19 were about two-thirds what they had been at their peak in January and still falling (see chart 1). At the same time, the country as a whole was seeing its caseload rise.

The vaccine was not the only thing which arrived in Israel late last year. So did B.1.1.7, a highly contagious variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for covid-19, which was first identified in Britain in September. It set about filling up hospital wards in Israel just as it has done in Britain, Ireland and Portugal. Despite an extended lockdown it is still doing so.

It is no surprise that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved new biological tricks over a year spent infecting more than 100m people. But the near simultaneous arrival of not just B.1.1.7 but also B.1.351, which is now the dominant strain in South Africa, and P.1, a variant first seen in Brazil, is making the roll-out of mass vaccination more complicated and more confusing than might have been hoped when the first evidence of safe, effective vaccines became available last November. How fast the various new variants can spread, how well today’s vaccines work against them and how soon new vaccines better attuned to them—and to the other variants which will turn up over time—become available will determine the course of the pandemic.
Testing the bounds
As of February 10th at least nine vaccines had been authorised for use in one or more countries. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, first out of the gate, has now been authorised for use in 61, as well as for emergency use by the WHO. The number of doses administered, 148m, now exceeds the number of confirmed covid-19 cases recorded over the entire course of the pandemic. All of the vaccines appear very good at preventing severe cases of covid-19 of the sort that lead to hospitalisation and/or death; in trials which compared the vaccinated with control groups the efficacy with which the various vaccines prevented these outcomes was 85-100%.
Their efficacy against all symptomatic cases of the disease found in trials has been lower, ranging between 66% and 95%. Some of that range is down to intrinsic differences between the vaccines. Some is down to trials being done according to different protocols and in different populations, sometimes against different variants of the virus. It is hard to disentangle such effects. The general message, though, is fairly clear. The vaccines make serious cases of all sorts very rare, and mild-to-moderate cases caused by the original strain of the virus a lot rarer than they would be otherwise.
That is undoubtedly good news; it lessens the death toll, the suffering and the strain on hospitals. But the situation is not perfect. For one thing mild and moderate cases can be worse than they sound. Many cases of “long covid”, a debilitating form of the disease in which some effects last for months, follow original infections that were not severe enough to require hospital admission. It is not yet clear whether long covid is less likely in people who have been vaccinated.

What is more, this pattern of effects does not reveal what the vaccines are doing about transmission. As Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, points out, there are two ways one can imagine a vaccine bringing about the pattern of protection the covid-19 vaccines have been seen to provide (see chart 2). In one of them the same number of infections occurs as would occur otherwise, but the consequences of these infections are systematically downgraded. Thus almost all of the infections which would lead to severe cases lead to moderate or mild cases, and many of the infections that would have led to moderate or mild cases produce no symptoms at all.
The alternative is that the total number of infections is being reduced, but the ratio of severe to mild to asymptomatic cases stays roughly the same. The already low number of deaths and hospitalisations shrinks to something hardly there. The number of mild cases is similarly deflated (although, since bigger, remains palpable). And so is the number of asymptomatic cases. Indeed, the main difference between the two scenarios is that in one the asymptomatic cases rise, and in the other they fall.
The passing game
In the real world there is almost certainly a bit of both going on: lower infections overall and a lessening of the symptoms that follow, with different vaccines offering different profiles. But considering the two extremes is still instructive. Vaccines which do little more than downgrade the symptoms will be doing relatively little to stop the spread of the virus. Honey-I-shrank-the-infections vaccines, on the other hand, will be making a big dent in the epidemic’s now infamous R number—the number of new infections to which each infection gives rise. If you imagine reducing what are known as “non pharmaceutical interventions”—masks, social distancing, shelter at home orders and the like—that difference would begin to matter a lot.
Some people will not be vaccinated, either because of pre-existing conditions which make it dangerous for them, because there isn’t enough vaccine for everyone, or because they choose not to (see article). If the vaccines are basically downgrading symptoms, then these unvaccinated people will be at risk. If they are making the virus less transmissible that risk will be lessened.
A covid-19 vaccine that is highly effective in preventing transmission will, therefore, be particularly useful. According to a model by Imperial College London, all other things being equal, a vaccine that blocks 40% of infections and thus prevents 40% of disease would have a similar impact on the number of covid-19 deaths as a vaccine that got rid of 80% of disease but left infection untouched.

Epidemiologists are waiting with bated breath for results that will tell them how good existing vaccines are at reducing asymptomatic infections and infectiousness. Data from Israel suggest that the viral load in swabs from infected individuals is lower if they have been vaccinated. Clinical trials of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine suggest that the jab may halve infections as detected by PCR tests. Such results suggest that covid-19 vaccines are likely to reduce overall transmission of the virus. But understanding quite how much transmission is blocked—and the degree to which some vaccines are better at blocking transmission than others—will take months.
And then there is the further complication of the new variants. Vaccines seem to have no particular problem with B.1.1.7. It just complicates things by running through the unimmunised parts of the population that bit faster. B.1.351, which has now been found in more than 30 countries, is of greater concern. At least three vaccines—those from Oxford/AstraZeneca, J and Novavax—have been found to be less effective at stopping it from causing disease than they are against variants elsewhere. There is increasing evidence that P.1, now also reported in a number of countries beyond Brazil, also appears to be better at avoiding immunity created by prior infection and by some vaccines.
Countries that have already vaccinated a lot of people could be brought back to square one by the spread of such variants. Britain, where 13m people had been vaccinated as of February 10th, and millions more have been infected and thus have some immunity (British studies have found reinfection very rare for at least five months), is trying hard to keep B.1.351 from making inroads in the population. Health authorities are mass-testing neighbourhoods where cases of B.1.351 have been spotted and are doing particularly meticulous contact tracing when a case is found. Border controls have been tightened.
Eking out an advantage
Not all such new variants can be spotted and stopped at borders. Mutations can arise anywhere—sometimes the phone call is coming from inside the house. But there may be a limited range of mutations about which people need to worry. The new variants all differ from the original virus and from each other in various ways. But P.1 and B.1.351 both share a particular mutational quirk—technically called E484K but mercifully nicknamed Eric or Eek—which makes a specific change to the spike protein on the outside of the virus. Eek has now been found in some isolates of B.1.1.7. too. Researchers are beginning to think that the change Eek represents is what allows those variants to infect people even if they have been vaccinated or previously infected.
It would be great if there were no vaccine-resistant strains. But given that there are, the possibility that they are all using the same trick offers a bit of comfort. It suggests that Eek may be the best way for new variants to avoid immune responses capable of dealing with the original strain, or at least the way evolution can most easily find. If the variants have all converged on the same trick, tweaking vaccines to protect against one may protect against all—and against any later variants to which natural selection teaches the same ruse. If the virus had found a whole panoply of ways by which to avoid existing immune responses things would look a lot worse.
Whether or not Eek turns out to be crucial, new ways of broadening immunity are on their way. Some vaccine-makers are developing booster shots designed to help people vaccinated with earlier versions of their jabs deal with new variants. Others are developing vaccines intended to work for multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants straight away. On February 3rd GlaxoSmithKline and CureVac, a German biotech company with an mRNA vaccine in late-stage clinical trials, added their names to those developing such “multivalent” vaccines.
Tweaked covid-19 vaccines will not be required to go through large scale clinical trials to prove their efficacy, any more than updated seasonal flu shots do; small trials that look for markers of immunity in the blood may suffice. Britain’s National Health Service, which should be able to vaccinate all adults who choose to be jabbed by the end of the summer, is already starting to make plans for a round of covid-19 booster shots aimed at new variants in the autumn. Increased surveillance may yet provide advance warning of which variants need to be dealt with by subsequent tweaks. It will take luck, diligence and hard work, but the magic that started at the beginning of this year may be made to last for many years to come.■

1603,"A PERK OF being locked up by a fascist dictator is that it leaves you with a lot of time on your hands. Altiero Spinelli, an Italian communist, spent the bulk of his youth imprisoned by Benito Mussolini. During one stint of internment in 1941, Spinelli used his spare time to come up with the Ventotene Manifesto, named after the island off Naples to which he was banished. Pieced together on cigarette papers, it provided a socialist blueprint for a federal Europe, earning the communist thinker a legacy as one of the more obscure founding fathers of the EU.
Aside from the European Parliament building in Brussels, which bears Spinelli’s name, communists left little mark on the club. Across western Europe, moderate Christian and Social Democrats ran the show. The Eurocommunists, who looked to Brussels rather than Moscow, were briefly in vogue in the 1970s and 1980s. Wily socialists, such as François Mitterrand, soon put them out of business. In Italy, where communists once won 34% of the vote, the party fell apart after communism collapsed in eastern Europe. And countries that had lived under communism were desperate to join the EU, in part so the ideology could not return.

The spectre of communism no longer haunts Europe. But it does occasionally jump from behind the curtain and shout “boo”. Sometimes the surprise comes from the least likely spots. Austria is probably the most bourgeois country in Europe: rich, cosy and more than a little smug about it. Yet its second city, Graz, is now run by the Austrian Communist Party, which came first in local elections with 29% of the vote. Wags soon renamed it Leningraz.
It was a revolution decades in the making. A low threshold for winning seats on the city’s council meant that communists could scrape a few even in dry years, and busy themselves with running the city’s housing policy. Popular measures helped, such as communist councillors donating two-thirds of their salaries to the needy. “What we are doing now would have been ordinary social democrat policy in the 1970s,” says Max Zirngast, a councillor who spent three months in a Turkish jail for criticising Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s autocratic regime before entering the world of Austrian municipal politics. A world without capitalism is still the aim. But a city with more social housing will do for now.
Tradition rather than grassroots fervour keeps the red flag flying in Cyprus. The island’s communist party, AKEL, is one of the country’s two main parties. It prospers thanks to an almost Anglican attitude to communism: just as one does not have to believe in God to go to church every Sunday, so Cypriots can vote for communists without wishing to seize the means of production. Card-carrying communists in shiny Mercedeses are a common sight. Force of habit rather than belief explains the party’s persistence, argues James Ker-Lindsay of the London School of Economics. As one of the biggest parties, AKEL is helped by being able to dish out the patronage that still dominates Cypriot politics.
In Europe, parties can be tiny but still influential. Christian Democrats found themselves supporting decidedly unChristian ideals due to panic about those to their right. Crackdowns on asylum-seekers and cuts to welfare budgets were triggered by parties that mustered barely a tenth of the vote. The same logic works for the far left. In an age of fragmentation, any party that can win even 5% of the vote becomes relevant. Take Portugal. Antonio Costa, the Socialist but still centre-left prime minister, relied on both the Portuguese Communist Party and the Left Bloc to remain in office.
Parties do not always use this power well. The communists voted against Mr Costa’s budget, leaving elections likely early next year. It was an odd decision. The budget was stuffed with lefty spending pledges, such as increased pensions and free child care. Now the leftist parties face losses in an election, the polls suggest. Such cock-ups are common. In the Czech Republic, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia opted to support Andrej Babis, a billionaire, as prime minister. Three years later, the party was kicked out of parliament for the first time since 1948.
It is little surprise that the most successful far-left parties of recent years have eschewed outright communism. Some of Syriza’s leaders spent time in the Greek communist youth movement, but the party which ran Greece from 2015-19 bristled at mention of the c-word. (Hardcore lefties repay the favour by seeing Syriza and its eventual compromise with the EU as an example of what not to do in power.) Podemos, a far-left Spanish party, is part of the governing coalition, but its brand of anti-austerity populism comes from a different tradition to Europe’s remaining reds.
That country of single blessedness
Yet some traditional Marxist parties are savvy. The Workers’ Party of Belgium (PTB), which began life as a home for Marxists who found Belgium’s Communist Party a bit soft, is now a mainstream party. Pressure from the PTB led to Belgium gumming up a free-trade deal between the EU and Canada, which sent diplomats on a crash course on the rules of Belgian federalism. Popular campaigns to slash taxes on energy put left-wing rivals in government in an awkward spot. In the Flemish parliament, it mischievously complained that a pay cut for MPs had not actually gone through, two years after its approval. If polls are borne out, the far-left party is set to become the third-largest in the national parliament.
Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, provides the base of the PTB’s support. The region was the centre of continental Europe’s Industrial Revolution; now it is the apogee of deindustrialisation. Disaffected voters in depressed regions have been fodder for the radical right across Europe. Canny politics from the far left in Belgium has flipped that trend, dragging voters to the other side. In 1869 Karl Marx called Belgium the “the snug, well-hedged, little paradise of the landlord, the capitalist, and the priest”. In 2021 Belgium offers the EU’s best hope for the ideology that bears his name.■",2

1605,"TO SHOW HOW her husband would hit her, Ana (not her real name) makes a fist with her slender fingers and swings. He began soon after their marriage when she was 16: he was bullied at work but brutish at home. One night he drunkenly told Ana to leave their house in León, Nicaragua’s second city. When she tried to, he put his machete against her neck while she clutched their baby daughter. Five years ago the beatings abated. Threats to call the police quietened him, says Ana. He may not respect her, but he respects the authorities.
Now 53, Ana may never leave the relationship. But her bravery in managing it, and discussing it in a café over hibiscus tea, attests to surprising changes that have come to Nicaragua. In 1995 and again in 2016, foreign researchers asked women in León if they had suffered physical violence from their partner in the past year. In 1995 some 28% said yes. In 2016 just 8% did. The number who said they had never been beaten by a partner rose from 45% to 72%. Surveys over the same period show a similar shift across the country.

Such population-wide success stories are rare. Mary Ellsberg, who conducted both studies, reckons only America, after the passage in 1994 of the Violence Against Women Act, can boast of such a steep drop in domestic violence over so short a period. America’s government spent billions to achieve that. Nicaragua, the second-poorest country in the Americas, did it on the cheap. Its example suggests how other cash-strapped countries can tackle the scourge.
The revolution of 1979, led by Daniel Ortega, bequeathed to Nicaragua a strong women’s movement. The presidents who followed Mr Ortega after his ousting in 1990 were hardly feminist, but they let women’s groups organise and listened to them. Their efforts helped pass laws which made domestic violence a crime, and prompted various governments to issue five-year plans with policies to curb it. Shelters proliferated across the country, as did women’s police stations with counsellors, medics and privacy.
Women also toiled to change attitudes. Campaigners knocked on doors and went into classrooms. An NGO helped launch “Sexto Sentido” (“Sixth Sense”), a slick telenovela full of messages about domestic violence, safe sex and other taboos. It helped women understand their rights and their worth, says Johana Ocon, an activist in Malpaisillo, a town outside León. She describes women’s private chats as hormigas (“ants”): one will achieve little, but thousands will create a support network to help women avoid and flee violence.
Progress faltered after Mr Ortega returned to power in 2007. He distrusts women’s groups, perhaps because they believed his stepdaughter, Zoilamérica, when she accused him in 1998 of sexually abusing her as a child. His government has abolished women’s police stations and halved the number of shelters. Foreign donations dried up as Mr Ortega turned Nicaragua into a dictatorship. Ms Ocon has been unable to visit schools for half a decade. Domestic violence seems to be worsening with the pandemic.
That does not mean the recent advances will be reversed. Ana sees a new generation, with strength and self-esteem that cannot easily be taken away. Her daughter, now 30 years old, has never been beaten.",2

It is the strictest such law to be implemented anywhere in the United States since 1973. Unusually, it allows private individuals to sue anyone who helps anyone else get an abortion. The court said the law raised “serious” constitutional questions, and suggested that the plaintiffs pursue those through state courts.

1607,"CALL IT AN October surprise. Almost every day over the past two weeks countries across Asia have revealed plans to loosen pandemic-induced restrictions on inbound tourism.

Two days later Singapore expanded its quarantine-free travel lanes beyond just Germany and Brunei. Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thailand’s prime minister, said on October 11th that fully vaccinated tourists would be able to visit many parts of the country without quarantine from November 1st.

Even parts of Australia, which has had among the harshest travel policies in the world, will welcome travellers again from next month. “For double-vaccinated people around the world, Sydney, New South Wales, is open for business,” said Dominic Perrottet, the state’s premier.

Yet India is an exception in throwing open its borders to all tourists. Most Asian countries welcoming travellers are doing so only for those from a carefully chosen list of countries, with acres of small print. Thailand initially planned to open its doors only to ten, mostly European countries. Bali is welcoming travellers from 19, half from Europe and none from its own region of South-East Asia. Singapore’s list has expanded from two to 11, with most in Europe, and even then only on designated flights. Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, threw cold water over Mr Perrottet’s reopening a few days later when he said that it will at first apply only to Australian citizens, residents and their families.
Indeed, the more reliant a country is on tourism, the greater seems to be its caution. In 2019 tourism made up about half of Fiji’s exports, a fifth of Thailand’s, and nearly a tenth of Malaysia’s. India, by contrast, relied on tourists for just 6% of exports. The share for Singapore is smaller still, but the city-state’s economic model depends on being open to the world. The announcements are less an indication of enthusiasm for welcoming visitors back than of the sense that it would be especially damaging to delay longer: now is when people book their winter holidays.
That is one reason why the reopening is so limited. Many Asian economies desperately need a decent season of inbound tourism but do not feel fully prepared to welcome lots of visitors. Even in Thailand, where tourism accounts for a fifth of jobs, 60% of people said in a recent survey that November 1st was too soon for the country to open up. Yet that must be balanced against people’s livelihoods. On October 21st Mr Prayuth announced that Thailand would in fact open to 46 countries, more than half of them European. “If we wait until everything is fully ready, we’ll be too late. Besides, tourists may choose to go elsewhere,” he wrote on Facebook.
A phased approach allows locals to get used to the idea of tourists again. It will also help businesses, which must refill their swimming pools and rehire workers after nearly two years of closures. Taking things slowly is useful for governments, too, which are watching covid-19 case numbers and worry that they may need to throttle back.
“The first markets to open up will be vulnerable to overtourism,” says Liz Ortiguera of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, an industry body. The choice of European countries may in part reflect that concern. The vast majority of tourists in Asia come from other Asian countries, who tend to make shorter trips and therefore spend less per visit. Europeans and Americans, having travelled all the way, often stay longer and spend more freely, says David Vanzetti of the University of Western Australia. As countries re-open, they are trying to maximise profits while keeping visitor numbers manageable.
The near-total halt in travel and tourism caused by the pandemic is unique in being caused by a lack of supply rather than demand, says Xiang “Robert” Li of US-Asia Center for Tourism  Hospitality Research at Temple University in Philadelphia. People still want to travel, and will get back on the road as soon as they are allowed. After past crises, such as the SARS outbreak in 2002-04, travel recovered domestically at first, then regionally and eventually across long distances. The same will be true this time, perhaps even more so after nearly two years of public-health messages that painted the outside world as a mortal threat. “We used to take travel for granted,” says Mr Li. But after 18 months of being grounded, “we realise that tourism is not just superficial fun. It actually is part of the contemporary lifestyle and has a lot to do with our well-being, who we are, and how to be happy.”

Editor’s note (October 21st): This piece has been updated to include Thailand’s announcement that residents of several dozen more countries would be allowed to enter from November 1st. It has also been corrected to note that they can travel only to certain parts of the country.

1608,"NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Indian retailers demanded a government probe of the company after a Reuters investigation showed the e-commerce giant had copied products and rigged search results in India.
The Reuters report, reviewing thousands of internal Amazon documents, found that the U.S. company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in India, one of the company’s largest growth markets.
Wednesday's report showed that, at least in India, manipulating search results to favour Amazon’s products, as well as copying other sellers’ goods, were part of a formal strategy at Amazon – and that at least two senior executives had reviewed it.
The Reuters investigation drew bipartisan criticism of Amazon from U.S. lawmakers.
Linking to the story on Twitter and Facebook, Warren, a long-time critic of Amazon, said ""these documents show what we feared about Amazon’s monopoly power — that the company is willing and able to rig its platform to benefit its bottom line while stiffing small businesses and entrepreneurs.""
""This is one of the many reasons we need to break it up,"" she said.
Warren, a prominent Democrat, advocated the breakup of Amazon and other tech giants in 2019 when she was running for president. Since then, as a senator from Massachusetts, she has continued to apply pressure on companies like Amazon.
Ken Buck, a Republican on the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee, also shared the story on social media, saying, ""These documents prove Amazon engages in anticompetitive practices such as rigging search results and self-preferencing their own products over competitors.""
""More concerning, it contradicts what Jeff Bezos told Congress,"" the Colorado lawmaker said. ""Amazon and Bezos must be held accountable.""
Asked for comment on the reactions, Amazon issued a statement similar to one it provided for the Reuters investigation.
""These allegations are incorrect and unsubstantiated,"" it said. ""We display search results based on relevance to the customers, irrespective of whether such products are private brands offered by sellers or not.""
Amazon said it ""strictly prohibits the use or sharing of non-public, seller-specific data with sellers, including with sellers of private brands,"" and investigates reports of its employees acting contrary to that policy.
The company did not comment on the criticisms by U.S. lawmakers or Indian retailers.
INDIA RETAILERS, START-UPS CONCERNED
In sworn testimony before the subcommittee last year, Amazon founder Bezos said the company prohibits its employees from using data on individual sellers to help its private-label business. In 2019 another Amazon executive testified that the company does not use such data to create its own private-label products or alter its search results to favour them.
The Amazon documents reviewed by Reuters showed how the company's private-brands team in India secretly exploited internal data from its India unit to copy products sold by other companies, then offered them on its platform.
The company promoted sales of its private brands like AmazonBasics by rigging search results on its platform in India so that its products would appear, as one 2016 strategy report put it, “in the first 2 or three … search results.”
A group representing millions of India's brick-and-mortar retailers said on Thursday the country's government must launch an investigation into Amazon.
""Amazon is causing a great disadvantage to the small manufacturers. They are eating the cake that is not meant for them,"" Praveen Khandelwal of the Confederation of All India Traders told Reuters. The group says it represents 80 million retail stores in the country.
Indian retailers say foreign e-commerce businesses like Amazon and Walmart Inc's (WMT.N) Flipkart indulge in unfair business practices that hurt smaller firms, allegations the companies deny.
The Alliance of Digital India Foundation, a nonprofit representing some of India’s biggest startups, said the practices detailed in the Reuters report were ""highly deplorable"", calling into question ""the credibility of Amazon as a good faith operator in the Indian startup ecosystem"".
In a blog post, the group urged the Indian government to take action against “Amazon’s predatory playbook of copying, rigging and killing Indian brands”.
A top official in the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, urged consumers to shun the company on Thursday.
""I call upon people of this country to #boycottAmazon,” Ashwani Mahajan, co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, said on Twitter.",3
1609,"AT THE END of July, when the Taliban were beginning to make gains across Afghanistan, but had yet to capture any of the country’s main cities, dozens of retired British army officers wrote a letter to the government. Signed by five former chiefs of the defence staff and two former heads of the army, it complained that Britain’s programme for resettling Afghans who had previously worked for the British army was not up to the job. “Too many of our former interpreters have unnecessarily and unreasonably been rejected,” the signatories wrote. “If any of our former interpreters are murdered by the Taliban in the wake of our withdrawal, the dishonour would lay squarely at our nation’s feet.”
Barely two weeks later, the Taliban walked unopposed into Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital. The British government is still struggling with its responsibilities. On August 18th Parliament was recalled to debate the situation. Many MPs, including some Conservatives, were critical of the government, including its efforts to remove Afghans who worked for British troops. In the face of growing discontent, Boris Johnson, the prime minister, announced a new scheme to resettle 20,000 Afghans in Britain over the next five years. It did not halt the criticism.

Before British soldiers left in 2014, they employed Afghans as interpreters, drivers and the like (as did The Economist). Many more were hired as contractors by firms and charities working on behalf of the British government. From 2013 to June this year, just 1,400 families were settled in Britain. In April, as the American withdrawal gained pace, the government set up a scheme to resettle more. It has not made that much difference. By early August, only another 1,400 had moved. America has also struggled to issue visas to its former Afghan workers, but politicians there can at least blame a cumbersome legal process imposed by Congress. In Britain, government departments have more discretion, and ought to have been able to move faster.
There are 3,500 applications still being processed—and more are expected. The government reckons it can evacuate around 1,000 people a day. Sir Laurie Bristow, the British ambassador, has stayed at Kabul airport, signing visas personally. But for many people who would qualify, reaching the airport is now a challenge. Though troops—mostly from America but including several hundred Britons—are controlling the runways, the Taliban are guarding the entrances. And the evacuation will come to an end when American troops give up the airport, which is currently planned for August 31st. As Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, admitted on a radio show, “some people won’t get back.”
The government’s new scheme is unlikely to improve their lot. The “bespoke resettlement scheme” Mr Johnson announced is modelled on a similar one established for Syrian refugees. The details are so far hazy but that means it will probably select families from refugee camps in third countries, not from Afghanistan directly. Nor can Afghans expect reasonable treatment if they arrive any other way. Mr Johnson has made clear that his tough stance on asylum will not be lifted even in such difficult circumstances. The government will not, he stressed in the parliamentary debate, “be allowing people to come from Afghanistan to this country in an indiscriminate way.” The Taliban will now decide just how much dishonour is to lie at Britain’s feet. ■",2
1610,"RIYADH, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Qatar Energy, one of the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, is working on a plan to reinvent itself as environmentally responsible for investors via a framework that will pave the way for it to sell ""green"" bonds in a deal likely to be worth several billion dollars, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Qatar Energy is working on establishing an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework that would allow it to issue green bonds - debt earmarked for environmentally friendly uses, the sources said.
If completed, it would be the first sale of green bonds by a national oil company in the hydrocarbon-rich Gulf.
Qatar Energy in a statement on Thursday denied the Reuters report.
A consultancy is working on the framework and QE sent a request for proposals to banks about two weeks ago, one of the sources said, without naming the consulting firm.
Once the ESG framework is established, Qatar Energy plans to structure a green bond deal, though the debt sale is unlikely to happen this year, the source said.
It was not immediately clear what proceeds from the expected sale of green bonds would be used for.
There is a lack of clear definitions or standards for what constitutes a green bond globally, with some regions and countries setting out their own guidelines, including the European Commission announcing a European Green Bond Standard in July.
Previously named Qatar Petroleum before recently rebranding, the state-owned energy giant, which supplies one in five LNG cargoes globally, raised $12.5 billion in its debut jumbo bond issuance in late June - 2021's biggest out of emerging markets.  read more 
The rebranding to Qatar Energy was part of the company's new shift towards ESG considerations, another of the sources said.
The company signed a contract in February for the first phase of its North Field LNG expansion project, which aims to boost Qatar's LNG output to 126 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2027 from 77 mtpa currently.
Global watchdog the International Energy Agency has cautioned that investors should not fund new oil, gas and coal supply projects if the world wants to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century.
Capital expenditure by the company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures through 2025 is projected at 300 billion riyals  ($79.99 billion), the prospectus for the June bond sale said.
World leaders will gather at the COP26 United Nations climate summit from Sunday to try to agree on steeper emissions cuts at an event billed as the last big chance to slow rising global temperatures.
Interest in ESG-related initiatives and deals has surged in the hydrocarbon-rich Gulf amid growing awareness among global investors about ESG risks and stark warnings about the dangers of global warming.
Both the Saudi government and its sovereign wealth fund have hired advisers this year to help structure similar ESG frameworks. The governor of the sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, said it would sell green bonds soon.  read more 
Saudi Arabia on Saturday became the second Gulf country to announce a net-zero emissions target - 2060 - after the United Arab Emirates earlier this month set 2050 as its goal for achieving carbon neutrality.  read more

1611,"LEADERS OF CHINA and America share an obsession: the notion that a large enough coalition of Western democracies might have the heft to confront a rising China about its authoritarian, state-capitalist ways, and demand that it follow a new trajectory, one that does less damage to norms and universal values that have governed the rich world since 1945.
China fears a broad, American-led coalition as the one force that might still be able to contain it. Not so long ago its foreign minister, Wang Yi, mocked the Quad, an informal group uniting America, Australia, India and Japan, as so much “sea foam”. After America hosted a Quad-leaders summit, China has called the group a destabilising scheme to build an Asian NATO. The Trump administration expanded the role of the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing pact between America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The group issued a statement in November 2020 about the crushing of political freedoms in Hong Kong. But the Five Eyes should be careful not to be “poked and blinded”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman growled. Australia and Canada are being punished with trade sanctions and detention of their citizens to teach them the cost of helping America in disputes with China.

Under President Joe Biden, American enthusiasm for coalition-building has only grown. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, explained to CBS News recently why America seeks allies to confront China’s government about repression at home and aggression overseas, as well as its adversarial approach to trade. “We’re much more effective and stronger when we’re bringing like-minded and similarly aggrieved countries together to say to Beijing: ‘This can’t stand and it won’t stand’,” Mr Blinken said.
In fact, these two rival powers are obsessing about something that is not likely to happen. For one thing, America’s allies have few illusions that any group of outsiders, even one led from Washington, can tell today’s China what will and will not stand. As a Western diplomat in Beijing glumly notes, such countries as Britain, France and Germany “are close to accepting the inevitability of China’s rise”, and so are out of alignment with America. For another, lots of Western democracies are fractious and mistrustful, especially after four years of Trumpian bridge-burning. European and Asian democracies alike are wary of joining America in anything resembling a cold-war effort to check China’s aggression—especially if it jeopardises profitable trade relationships.
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said this year that it would be counter-productive for Western powers “to join all together against China”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has also spoken out against the “building of blocs”. In recent telephone and video calls with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders, there is no record of her raising sweeping sanctions imposed by China on European politicians and researchers, in retaliation for EU sanctions targeting officials accused of brutally repressing Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang.
Official read-outs instead record Mrs Merkel talking of co-operation and praising a draft trade pact agreed with China last year, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which would offer more access to China’s market for some EU firms, notably German carmakers. Ironically, the agreement may be doomed by the sanctions that Mrs Merkel wants to ignore. Those punished by China include members of the European Parliament, which must approve the pact. The EU trade commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis, said on May 4th that efforts to finalise the deal are on hold.
EU unity is further undermined by members with close investment ties to China, such as Greece. One member does not conceal its admiration for Chinese autocracy, charges a European diplomat in Beijing: “The EU has its traitor in the ranks: Hungary.” Nor is there consensus within the Five Eyes. In recent weeks, New Zealand’s government declared itself uncomfortable with the intelligence-sharing pact’s releasing geopolitical statements.
China loves all such signs of disunity, praising European nations for seeking “strategic autonomy”, a French phrase that means not marching in lockstep with America. Yet in its paranoia about American-led alliances bent on containment, China risks missing a change that is actually happening in the real world.
Even as they concede that the time for trying to change China is over, rich-world democracies are defensively China-proofing their economies and their societies. They are setting up new investment-screening laws, investigating whether foreign powers are meddling in their domestic politics and universities, and writing public-procurement rules to block bidders who raise national-security concerns. The EU is proposing new curbs on state-subsidised firms wanting to compete in European markets. Such policies do not always name China, but it is the target.
Standing together, sort of
Foreign ministers of the G7 countries—America, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan—met in London on May 3rd-5th. Their closing communiqué condemns Chinese abuses in Xinjiang, including “the existence of a large-scale network of ‘political re-education’ camps, and reports of forced labour systems and forced sterilisation”. The solutions offered are purely defensive, and make no pretence that the G7 can change Chinese policies. The risk of importing goods made with forced labour will have to be tackled through “our own available domestic means”, the ministers say, by raising awareness and advising businesses.
Such words do not frighten China. Confident in the power offered by its vast market, it hopes that foreign governments will hurry up and realise that resistance to its rise is futile. If resistance means forming blocs to contain China, then America’s allies already agree. But those same democracies are also channelling a growing distrust into defences that will introduce new frictions into relations with China. Friction is a form of resistance, too. ■",2

1613," (CNN)Potential pay outs of up to $450,000 to migrant families separated at the US-Mexico border are the latest political flashpoint in the Republican criticism of President Joe Biden's immigration policy -- and the political back-and-forth has put a tense relationship under further strain.The debate has not only put the Biden administration in a politically precarious position, but more acutely, Biden's response to the payments has stressed the already-fragile relationship between the government and families, according to immigrant advocate groups who work directly with them. After Biden swatted down media reports about financial compensation for those separated under the previous administration, the Justice Department told attorneys representing families who are seeking damages that settlement will not be that high, sparking confusion among attorneys and advocates about the Biden administration's position on the matter.""It does not help when there's a lack of clarity about what the federal government is willing to do for the families,"" said Nan Schivone, the legal director at Justice in Motion, which helps locate separated families.""When the news broke, it was not helpful because it sowed a lot of seeds of confusion about the willingness of the government to care for the families and atone for the past unlawful actions, the unlawful actions of the past administration,"" she added.Republicans have lambasted the administration for considering financial compensation for separated families, arguing in part that it should not exceed what's provided to the families of fallen soldiers. In a nearly four-hour congressional hearing this week, at least five Republican senators repeatedly raised the ongoing settlement negotiations in questioning of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who deferred to the Justice Department, which is handling the settlement negotiations. Mayorkas is the chair of the family reunification task force ordered by Biden. In recent months, tensions have also flared between the Biden administration and allies over the administration's border policy, but concern over the handling of remedies for separated families puts one of the most sensitive matters at the forefront. Behind the scenes, families at the center of the damages cases are still reeling over the moment more than three years ago when they were separated from their loved ones and are waiting for the Biden administration to execute on its promises. ""It's only been words. I can't have confidence in something like that,"" Daniel Paz, a father who was separated from his 7-year-old daughter at the US-Mexico border in May 2018, told CNN, in Spanish.  Paz reunited with his daughter, Angie, after seven weeks. And in June 2018, the Trump administration ended the so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy, in which the Justice Department initiated criminal prosecutions of every adult illegally crossing the border.Paz still gets emotional recalling the moment when officials took his daughter, along with other children, while at a border facility. ""The kids were yelling. ... We begged for them not to do it,"" Paz, a member of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, said. ""It was like a horror movie."" Paz, an asylee, is seeking damages from the federal government. More than 3,000 children were separated from their families at the US-Mexico border under former President Donald Trump and attorneys are still trying to reach the parents of 270 migrant children, according to a November court filing in an ongoing family separation case. For parents who experienced their children being taken from them, with no hint of where they were going, it's been difficult to trust the federal government, regardless of who's president. ""These families have very little reason to trust the US government based on their experience when they were separated and deported,"" said Wendy Young, president of Kids In Need of Defense, which has worked closely with separated families. ""You can't really underestimate the amount of trauma that these families have gone through. That fundamentally makes them very nervous and skittish,"" she added. KIND recently partnered with the United Nations refugee agency to target outreach to families and field questions or concerns they may have. Karla Emeli Portillo Molina is among those parents who were deported without their children. She was separated from her 14-year-old son in 2017 and sent back to El Salvador months later without him. ""I was crying. I became depressed. I didn't want to leave without my son,"" she told CNN in Spanish. She was reunited with her son, now 18, in California this year. The expediency with which her paperwork was completed and approved for her to reunite gave her confidence in the Biden administration. Lawsuits have stemmed from the ""zero tolerance"" policy and separation of families. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class action lawsuit in 2019 seeking damages for the toll the separations took on families, and attorneys representing families have filed separate claims. ""The statute doesn't have an immigration status exception and the federal government often settles lawsuits whether person is a citizen or non-citizen,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director at the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, adding that migrants can legally apply for asylum either at or between ports of entry at the US-Mexico border. ""Harm is harm. And Congress is clear you can't brutalize someone and then say, 'Well, they were here illegally.' The fact is these were asylum seekers,"" he told reporters Thursday, noting that there's no settlement deal on the table right now. The Biden administration's task force, meanwhile, has made some inroads, reunifying 60 families, with more anticipated. ""Establishing trust with families who were intentionally and cruelly separated under the prior administration's Zero-Tolerance policy is a top priority for the Department of Homeland Security, and is essential to the effort to reunify those families,"" a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. ""DHS recognizes the intense trauma these families have experienced, and is working closely with non-governmental organizations to take this trauma into account in the reunification process,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Mayorkas has previously met with families separated at the border under the last administration. That trauma extends to children, including Angie, Paz's daughter.""She doesn't play like she used to,"" he told CNN in Spanish. ""Now, she's worried with adult problems."" ",0

The launch comes against a backdrop of increasing missile tests by both North and South Korea in recent weeks, causing concern about an accelerating arms race.

1615,"THE APPLE will surely fall, even if ever so slowly. When Tim Cook took the helm from Steve Jobs, the firm’s co-founder, a decade ago, even the most boosterish of Apple fanboys worried that the company was destined to decline. Without Apple’s original Willie Wonka, the digital chocolate factory was about to be run by an automaton who made his career organising global supply chains and scrutinising spreadsheets. How could someone with so little dazzle inspire Apple employees to continue creating “insanely great” products, in Jobs’s famous formulation?
It turned out Mr Cook could. As he celebrated his tenth anniversary as Apple’s boss on August 24th, no one made a peep. And for good reason. He has staged what is arguably the greatest succession success in tech, an industry littered with managers who failed in the effort to follow in the founders’ footsteps. In fact, in pure financial terms, he has been a far more successful chief executive than the late Jobs, who succumbed to pancreatic cancer six weeks after stepping down.

No chief executive in history has created as much overall shareholder value as Mr Cook (see chart 1). When he took over from Jobs the company had a market value of $349bn. Today it is worth $2.5trn (see chart 2), more than any other listed firm ever. Under his aegis annual sales surged from $108bn in 2011 to $274bn last year. Net profit more than doubled, to $57bn, overtaking Saudi Aramco’s oil-fuelled earnings and turning Apple into the world’s most profitable company. Less widely noticed, during his tenure the “Apple economy”—its own annual revenue plus everything other companies make on one of its platforms—has grown sevenfold, to more than $1trn.

Given such achievements, Mr Cook could have retired amid gushing tributes around now (and with a spot in the billionaire club). Instead, he is likely to stick around at least until 2025, when his current stock grant will fully vest. This in turn raises the question of how long he can keep Apple on its stratospheric trajectory. The short answer is that it will be much harder than in his first decade. Many of the global tailwinds that have lifted Apple to such dizzying heights are now reversing.

For a longer answer it helps to understand what Mr Cook got so right. Besides being an exceptional manager, he proved adept at harnessing the forces that have powered the tech industry—and with it global economy—in the 2010s.
The first of these was the mobile-led digitisation of life. To satisfy the world’s voracious appetite for mobile computing, he kept pushing for constant improvement of the iPhone. Whereas the iPhone 4s, announced shortly after he became chief executive, was still essentially a souped-up mobile phone, the iPhone 13, expected to be launched in September, will be a hand-sized supercomputer with a processor nearly 50 times faster. Even Apple’s Watch and AirPods, the main new products since he took over, can be seen as extensions of the mighty iPhone. More than a billion of Apple’s smartphones are now in use globally, one for every seven Earthlings.
Another force which Mr Cook has deftly harnessed is globalisation, in particular the rise of China. Even before he took over from Jobs, he was instrumental in outsourcing assembly of Apple’s devices to the country. Its biggest contract manufacturer, Foxconn, now employs about 1m people there. Most of them assemble iGadgets. On top of that, untold numbers work for suppliers of other components. And besides using China as a factory, Mr Cook was early to see its potential as a market—now Apple’s biggest after America and Europe, generating 19% of revenue and, possibly, a bigger share of profits.

Mr Cook’s third coup was understanding the importance of network effects—the economic mechanism in digital markets which makes big businesses even bigger. That is something that eluded even Jobs, who was ambivalent about the iPhone’s App Store. By contrast, Mr Cook doubled down on the digital “flywheel”: the App Store attracted more app makers, which attracted more users, which attracted even more developers and so on—until it became the world’s foremost digital marketplace by revenues. Today it hosts nearly 2m apps, which facilitated $643bn in billings and sales in 2020 for app developers, according to a study sponsored by Apple.
Mr Cook was also the first big-tech boss to signal, loudly and often, that companies of Apple’s size and reach must take some responsibility for their impact on the wider world. Under Jobs, a gadget’s looks were more important than how they were made. Today Lisa Jackson, a former head of America’s Environmental Protection Agency and now a vice-president directly reporting to Mr Cook, is involved in product development from the start. Apple has set itself the laudable goal of becoming carbon-neutral across all its products by 2030. And Mr Cook has called privacy “a fundamental human right” and, among other things, forced app makers to ask users whether they want to be tracked by advertisers.

Admittedly, being pro-privacy aligns with Apple’s business model, which unlike those of Facebook and Google does not make money by collecting data to sell targeted ads, and climate-cuddling plays well with the sensibilities of Apple’s mostly well-off users at little cost, given Apple’s relatively shallow carbon footprint. This has helped keep regulators off Apple’s back—and made it into the world’s most valuable brand, according to one estimate.
Cooking lessons
In other words, after ten years of Cookery Apple is a bigger and better version of itself, says Horace Dediu, a long-time Apple watcher. That, though, is not to say it is invulnerable. Three challenges stand out: growth, geopolitics and competition.
On the surface, growth looks healthy enough. To the surprise of those analysts who have for years predicted the iPhone’s decline, the device keeps raking in money. Global unit sales are down from a peak of 231m in 2015, but only a bit: Apple still sold 200m of them last year. But the market for smartphones will eventually mature. And even if this takes time, Apple will increasingly run up against a problem familiar to all large firms: the bigger they get, the harder it becomes to grow rapidly.
Mr Cook has been able to tap into other sources of revenue, notes Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a website that analyses all things Apple. The firm’s services business, including the App Store and Apple Music, has surged from $8bn in sales in 2011 to $65bn in the past four quarters (see chart 4). Though wearables like the Apple Watch and accessories such as the AirPods are a smaller business than the iPhone, they generate lots of revenue: nearly $9bn in three months to June. Last year AirPods ended up in more than 200m ears and Apple Watches on 34m wrists, respectively outselling all other high-end ear buds and all Swiss timepieces combined.

At some point, however, Apple will need another keystone innovation like the iPhone. Hence talk of “iGlasses”, which would add a digital layer to the physical reality perceived by the wearer, and even an “iCar”. Although the firm does not confirm this, it is an open secret that it has been working on both for years. Leaks suggest that augmented-reality glasses may finally be coming in the next year or two and Apple reportedly has plans to release a vehicle that is both electric and self-driving in 2024. But it is also widely known that things have not been going well and timelines have slipped in the past.
The car, which unlike the glasses is not a natural extension of Apple’s current consumer-tech line-up, would be difficult to pull off. Even without a petrol engine and a gearbox, a vehicle is much harder to manufacture than a smartphone. Apple’s automotive thinking appears to have gone back and forth between building its own self-driving cars from scratch or providing the necessary electronics and software to other carmakers.
Mr Cook’s second big challenge is geopolitics. Apple has so far escaped the mounting tensions between the West and China, where most of the firm’s products are assembled and many of them are sold. Mr Cook has made all sorts of concessions to the authorities in Beijing, from moving its Chinese users’ information to data centres in the country, where they can be accessed by local law enforcement, to taking down some apps in the Chinese version of its App Store. “We follow the law wherever we do business” is Mr Cook’s motto.
Now, though, the pugnacity with which the Chinese government has gone after its own technology giants must be making some in Apple’s futuristic headquarters in Cupertino, Silicon Valley, nervous. Though it has been beefing up manufacturing in other countries, particularly in India and Vietnam, Apple does not have an alternative to China for the bulk of its assembly. It is hard to see where else it might find one. Only China has a ready army of workers needed to quickly ramp up production of the latest iPhone.
Judging by Apple’s latest supplier list, the firm has even increased its reliance on Chinese companies. Of the top 200 suppliers, 51 were based in China, up from 42 in 2018. At the height of the trade war then-president Donald Trump waged with China in 2019, Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, estimated that in the worst-case scenario Chinese retaliation could reduce Apple’s profits by nearly 30%.
Apple’s jams
The fallout could be worse if Apple’s products and services were banned in China. As the Communist Party turns increasingly authoritarian and the West increasingly suspicious of China, Apple may become a target of Beijing’s wrath or the sort of nationalist-tinged boycotts that have hurt Western brands from the NBA to Zara.
And if Apple’s importance to China’s economy continues to offer a protective shield, this may anger governments and consumers in the West. According to human-rights groups, some of Apple’s suppliers are linked to forced-labour camps for Uyghurs, an oppressed Muslim minority, in Xinjiang. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, has called out Apple for hypocrisy for touting privacy protection at home while allowing the government in Beijing to access personal data in China. “At some point something will happen that becomes a loyalty test,” thinks Willy Shih of Harvard Business School.
Apple says that it has found no evidence of any forced labour in its supply chain. And Mr Zuckerberg himself could also be accused of being hypocritical, since Facebook is making billions from Chinese advertisers on its social networks. But even if those controversies end up being resolved in Apple’s favour, they are feeding into pushback against its behaviour at home: witness the recent brouhaha over its plans to scan private pictures on iPhones for child pornography.
Mr Zuckerberg’s China-related broadside also hints at Mr Cook’s third challenge: competition. Network effects are not the only thing benefiting firms like Apple. Another is the lack of real rivals. Some view Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft as a cartel whose members have tacitly agreed not to encroach on each other’s core businesses. Apple has never made an effort to be a social-media powerhouse and Facebook has not attempted to create an alternative app store. Instead of building its own search engine, Apple cut a deal with Google, making it the default search engine on the iPhone (and charging an estimated $8bn-12bn annually for the privilege, equivalent to 14-21% of Apple’s net profit in 2020).
Such cosiness is fraying. To sustain trillion-dollar valuations all the tech giants are searching for new sources of growth—and finding them on one another’s turf. Giving iPhone users more control over their data may be rooted in a genuine wish to protect their privacy, but it also keeps data out of Facebook’s hands, which could help Apple build its own advertising business. Apple is also rumoured to be working on its own search engine.
The rivalry is heating up in its principal hardware business, too. In America the iPhone remains dominant. Globally, however, iPhones account for one in seven smartphones sold, according to Canalys, a data provider. Earlier this year Xiaomi, a Chinese firm, overtook Apple as the world’s second-biggest smartphone-maker by volume.
Apple’s forays into newer markets face stiff competition. Its HomePod smart speakers came late and did not make much headway against Amazon’s and Google’s products. Apple’s mixed-reality glasses, should they indeed see the light of day, will have to duke it out against Facebook’s Oculus, Microsoft’s HoloLens and other fancy headgear. And an iCar would be taking on Teslas and a car park’s worth of offerings from established carmakers.
Regulators may also try to make digital markets more competitive. Apple is expected to win its trial against Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite”, a popular online video game, which accuses Apple of illegally protecting its App Store. A ruling should come later this year. Even if Apple prevails in American courts, however, trustbusters elsewhere may not let it off the hook as easily.
In July Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s deputy head and the EU’s trustbuster-in-chief, warned Apple that the bloc’s proposed Digital Markets Act will not allow it to hold up privacy and security as reasons to limit competition in the App Store, as Apple has argued in the Epic lawsuit. Loosening of the App Store’s rules and lower commissions (currently up to 30% on most app purchases) could make a serious dent in the company’s lucrative services business.
An executive of Mr Cook’s stature and experience may well be able to overcome these headwinds. Whether that will be Mr Cook himself is less clear. He is 60 and has said he will “probably” not stay on for another ten years. This raises the question of who might have the vision and the skills to succeed him.
One former executive has a radical proposal: Apple should stop being a pedlar of luxury goods. The firm’s “obscene” gross margins of more than 40% in the past quarter make it lazy, he argues. To maintain them, the firm squeezes developers and suppliers. Instead, it should use its power and cutting-edge technology to develop devices and services for the 3bn people on Earth who have yet to enjoy the benefits of the digital era.
Too many Cooks?
This could help solve Apple’s growth conundrum. But it is unlikely to fly with its margin-loving shareholders. The possible successor to Mr Cook mentioned most frequently, Jeff Williams, is a less radical departure from the status quo. Mr Williams is considered by many insiders to be “Tim Cook’s Tim Cook”: a doppelganger not just in looks (tall, lean and grizzled) but also in thinking and experience. He has been doing Mr Cook’s old job overseeing Apple’s supply chain and operations since 2010. Those skills have served the company remarkably well in the past decade. To keep thriving Apple’s next chief executive may need a different set of abilities. ■

1616,"London (CNN Business)The threat by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to quit China after one of its stars, Peng Shuai, disappeared from public view, leaves at least two global brands watching anxiously to see how this will play out.Peng, a two-time former Grand Slam doubles champion, has vanished from the public eye since she accused former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex in a social media post on November 2 that was deleted within minutes. Concerns for her safety have grown after Chinese state media released a screenshot of an email, purportedly from Peng and sent to the WTA, walking back her allegations and claiming ""everything is fine.""In an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, WTA chief executive Steve Simon said the welfare of the player and the need for her allegations to be properly investigated were ""bigger than the business"" that the WTA has in China. ""We're definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it,"" Simon said.Two of the WTA's official partners — Porsche, owned by Volkswagen (VLKAF), and German software maker SAP (SAP) — may feel differently about putting their own business in the world's second biggest economy at risk by backing the association's stance on Peng.CNN Business has contacted both companies for comment. Neither has so far responded.The silence from the WTA's corporate partners contrasts with growing calls for China to conduct a full and transparent investigation into her allegations. The United Nations Human Rights office on Friday urged Beijing to provide proof of her wellbeing, and the German Olympic Sport Federation made a similar call.Whether the WTA will follow through on Simon's threat to pull the WTA out of China is unclear. But for now, its sponsors are ""caught in the middle,"" said Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute in London.""If they appear to back the WTA, the Chinese Communist Party and China will punish them in the Chinese market. If they don't, women in democracies may boycott their products,"" he told CNN Business.Porsche has been in China for more than 20 years, according to the company. In August, the luxury sports car brand said it would build a permanent research and development center in Shanghai to improve local Chinese product development, ""allowing a sustained focus on what is Porsche's biggest single market."" Porsche executive board chairman Oliver Blume said at the time: ""Having a permanent home for this work in China will bring obvious benefits, particularly when it comes to reflecting and predicting our customers' needs in China — a nation that has truly welcomed Porsche and taken our cars to heart to the extent that it's been our biggest sales market for six consecutive years.""

1617,"“HI, JUST CHECKING in. Can I put in some more?” The bosses of promising startups are bombarded by such texts these days. Big funds in particular are falling over themselves to grab a piece of the tech pie (see chart). Yet one founder seems to have received more than his fair share of pitches: Ali Ghodsi, the chief executive of Databricks. And he has said yes to many. On August 31st the company confirmed that, only six months after a $1bn financing deal, it had raised another $1.6bn, valuing it at $38bn—$10bn more than after the previous round. Among the Silicon Valley cognoscenti, these numbers cement Databricks’ status as the most hyped company of the hour.

The software-maker is soon likely to be known farther afield. Later this year it is expected to stage the largest-ever initial public offering (IPO) of a software firm—larger than that in late 2020 of Snowflake, its most serious rival. Alternatively, some predict, it could be snapped up by Microsoft in the largest ever software takeover. Whatever the outcome, there is substance to the hype. Databricks could become, in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), what Oracle and its databases once were in the world of conventional corporate software: the dominant platform on top of which applications are built and run.

Databricks was founded in 2013 to commercialise Spark, a piece of open-source software that processes reams of data from different sources to train algorithms which then become the engines of AI applications. The firm added features, including code that makes it easier for developers to program the system as well as manage their workflow, and offered the package as a cloud-based subscription service.
Yet Databricks only really took off when it added another component called “lakehouse”. It is a combination of two sorts of databases, a “data warehouse” and a “data lake” (hence the portmanteau). Both have historically been separate because of technical constraints and because they serve different purposes. Data warehouses are filled with well-defined corporate data that allow a firm to look into its past, for instance at how its sales have evolved, something called “business intelligence” (BI). Data lakes are essentially a dumping ground for all sorts of data that can reveal a firm’s future, including whether sales are likely to go up or down. Yet this separation is increasingly inefficient and unnecessary, explains Max Schireson of Battery Ventures, an investor in Databricks. “Doing BI and AI in different systems today is kind of stupid,” he notes.
Firms have jumped on what Databricks offers, in particular incumbents worried about being disrupted by an AI-driven startup. Comcast, an American broadband provider, uses it to allow its customers to use their voice to select movies; ABN Amro, a Dutch bank, to recommend services; and H, a fashion retailer, to optimise its supply chain. Databricks now claims more than 5,000 customers and annualised subscription revenue of $600m—75% growth year-on-year.
Throwing Databricks at Snowflake
Mr Ghodsi has set his sights even higher. “Ultimately, everything data should be on Databricks,” he says. He is planning on investing the newly raised capital to keep growing and become the leader in lakehouse systems. Nobody should fault Mr Ghodsi, who once taught computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, for his ambitions. Yet realising them will not be easy. Other firms are already pushing into the territory. He will probably be able to fend off the three big cloud-computing providers: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. Although they have more than enough resources to compete and provide integrated AI packages, they share one big problem. Firms increasingly prefer not to store all their data in a single cloud, fearing they will get stuck with one vendor. Instead, they opt for products, such as Databricks’, that run across several clouds.
Snowflake is a different story. It, too, is building lakehouses. It is also taking a different approach. Whereas Databricks is adding BI to its AI platform, Snowflake, which has grown up in the data-warehouse world, is adding AI to its cloud-based BI package, meaning that their respective products will increasingly overlap. Whereas most of Databricks’ code is open-source, Snowflake’s is proprietary. And whereas Databricks has mostly stuck to a “land-and-expand” strategy, whereby small software deals grow into bigger ones, Snowflake practises a more conventional top-down sales model that focuses on big deals from the start.
All this will make for a battle over the next few years. But it could be rudely interrupted if Microsoft snaps up Databricks. The software firm is already one of Databricks’ investors and co-operates closely with it. Among other things, Azure offers a version of Databricks’ platform and Microsoft uses its name in presentations about its strategy, something it rarely does with other firms. It would be a good fit. At its core, Microsoft is still a company selling tools for developers to write applications and platforms to run them on. And Databricks represents both a complement and a strategic threat: it lets data, rather than people, write the code.
Databricks’ IPO is not meant to take the firm public, according to some analysts, but to put a price on it, so that negotiations can start somewhere. But the hype surrounding the company could thwart such plans. Snowflake is now worth about $90bn. If Databricks’ IPO outdoes Snowflake’s, its asking price may well be north of $100bn. And like Pinterest, a social-media firm which Microsoft considered buying earlier this year, it may become too pricey even for a company as loaded as world’s biggest software firm. ■

1618,"SHORTLY BEFORE Ángel Hernández handed his wife the glass of barbiturates that would kill her, he asked her once again if she wanted to die. “The sooner the better,” she replied. Ravaged as María José Carrasco’s body was by multiple sclerosis, she struggled to swallow the poison. In the end she forced it down through a straw.
Ms Carrasco’s death in 2019 provoked a media storm in Spain. In Madrid the investigating judge initially referred the case to a court that specialises in violence against women. The prosecutor pushed for Mr Hernández, then 70, to serve six months in prison. But on June 25th Spain enacted a law allowing those with a “serious or incurable illness” or a “chronic or incapacitating” condition to seek help to end their own lives. Twelve days later, Mr Hernández was acquitted.

In much of the West public opinion has long been in favour of assisted dying. In 2002 60% of Spaniards supported voluntary euthanasia, a share which had risen to 71% in 2019. Writ large, secularisation and increasingly liberal values have solidified support. But so has personal experience, particularly that of baby-boomers who, having witnessed the suffering of their parents, are fighting for the right to deaths of their own choosing.

Change has been rapid. Assisted dying is now legal or decriminalised in at least a dozen countries, with legislation or court challenges pending in many others. On November 5th Portugal's parliament approved a revised bill which would allow those with “grave, incurable and irreversible” conditions to receive help to end their lives (the constitutional court had in March blocked an earlier version as being too imprecise). Other largely Catholic countries such as Chile, Ireland, Italy and Uruguay are also moving towards enshrining a right to die. In Belgium, Colombia and the Netherlands governments have broadened assisted dying laws to include terminally ill children.
After years of struggle, activists and politicians have found ways through or around reluctant legislators. The right to die has been ticked through American ballot boxes, squeezed through Australian legislatures, and gavelled through Canadian and European courts. Proponents are using public consultations, campaigns and petitions to demonstrate public support. And growing evidence from countries with assisted-dying laws has undermined fears it will become easy to “kill granny”. The changes are snowballing as advocates in one country learn from their counterparts elsewhere.
Assisted dying remains uncommon. Most cases are cancer-related, and the number of deaths is tiny. But they are nonetheless changing how people think about dying. In some countries assisted dying has been extended to those with mental disorders and dementia, and even to old people who feel tired of life. A clandestine network of baby-boomers who share methods to kill themselves has sprung up on the internet. Even some proponents are beginning to worry about a slippery slope.
Thirty years ago, assisted dying was illegal everywhere bar Switzerland. But in 1997 the state of Oregon approved the Death with Dignity Act, initiating a spate of liberalisation. In Oregon, two doctors must agree that a patient is of sound mind and has less than six months to live before he or she can receive the lethal drugs. These must be administered by the patient (known as physician-assisted dying) rather than injected by a doctor (voluntary euthanasia). Around 2,000 people have died under the law, with no wrongful deaths reported. Versions of the law are now on the books of ten states, home to a fifth of Americans, as well as Washington DC.
Oregon’s rules are also being copied internationally, with some modifications. New Zealand’s Oregon-style law came into effect on November 7th. In Australia, the state of Victoria passed a similar law in 2017, and since then all but one of Australia’s six states have followed suit. In Britain, an Oregon-style bill passed its second reading in the House of Lords in October. But to become law it would also need the support of the House of Commons and the government, which looks unlikely. Three-quarters of Britons support a right to die, but only 35% of MPs do.
Some campaigners are circumventing cautious representatives by going through the courts. In February Peru’s constitutional court ruled that the Ministry of Health’s refusal to help a woman with degenerative polio end her life violated her rights to “dignity” and “autonomy”. Several countries, such as Austria, are beginning to flesh out a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011 that people have the right to decide the time and manner of their deaths. After Germany’s highest court declared in 2020 that a ban on repeatedly helping others die was unconstitutional, Dignitas Germany, a non-profit, began to help people kill themselves.
Even after a legislature or court opens the door to assisted dying, those pursuing the option can face high hurdles. With 68 safeguards, Victoria’s law excludes some of the people it was intended to help. Doctors are forbidden to bring up assisted dying with their patients, so many do not know it is an option. Colombia decriminalised voluntary euthanasia in 1997, but is only now regulating the practice. As a result, many Colombian doctors refuse to get involved for fear of prosecution. Approval is rare and can be withdrawn.
Despite such strictures, the expansion of the right to die is not without controversy. In Canada, the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that a ban on medical assistance in dying (MAID) violated the national Charter of Rights. Now MAID is available to all Canadians who suffer from chronic physical illness or disability. Uniquely, the law allows patients to determine what constitutes “unbearable” suffering. In 2020, only 6% of written requests for MAID were refused.
Some advocates for the disabled shudder that the amended law devalues the lives of those with disabilities. It’s “literally unthinkable” that MAID would be doled out instead on the basis of race, sex or any other protected characteristic, says David Shannon, a quadriplegic lawyer who campaigns against assisted dying. Others argue that the foundations of the disability movement lie in creating the freedom to make one’s own choices.
Opponents also fear that Canada may end up helping people die before it has helped them live. Disabled people who do not receive enough support may choose to die because society has failed them, opponents argue. They worry this may prove particularly true for people whose lives have been filled with abuse, racism and poverty, though data from America show that those who choose assisted death are overwhelmingly middle-class, white and educated. Proponents contend that those who want to die should not be held hostage to society’s failures.
From 2023, Canada will extend MAID to those who suffer solely from mental illness, on the ground that to do otherwise would be discriminatory. Many Canadians find this troubling. They worry that doctors may indulge the suicidal urges that are a symptom of many psychiatric disorders: one in ten schizophrenics kill themselves, according to some studies. Other critics question whether a patient could have tried every possible treatment when the medical and social understanding of mental illness remains so rudimentary, and mental-health services are so often inadequate.
But most people underestimate how serious an intractable psychiatric condition can be, says Mona Gupta, a Québécoise psychiatrist and bioethicist. They see depictions of mental illness in popular culture but have never met someone severely affected. John Scully, who has lived with severe depression and PTSD for decades, agrees. At home at night in Toronto, Mr Scully, who is 80, is haunted by the horrors he witnessed as a war correspondent: the dead torn apart by vultures, the AK47 scoped to execute him. He also experiences physical pain. “There is no cure,” he says. Nineteen shock therapies, countless medications and six stints as a psychiatric patient have failed to bring relief.
The “only help available”, Mr Scully believes, is assisted dying. He sees it as a far more dignified choice than suicide, which he has attempted twice, and he thinks it would be less painful for his family. Like other bioethicists, Dr Gupta thinks mental disorders should be seen in the same light as other conditions that create chronic pain. For doctors, she says, the assessment process would be much the same: distinguishing between an impulsive death-wish and a considered one, and determining if a patient is mentally competent. Such cases are rare. In 2020 in the Netherlands, only 88 people with mental illnesses—12% of all those who made requests—had their requests for help approved by a specialist euthanasia clinic. Many are heartened by simply having the option.
Canada is making the same mistakes as the Netherlands, reckons Theo Boer, a Dutch ethicist who once supported his country’s euthanasia laws. Since Dutch doctors pushed to legalise assisted dying 20 years ago, he believes that voluntary euthanasia has gone from being a “last resort to prevent a terrible death to a last resort to prevent a terrible life”. Voluntary euthanasia is a short-cut to death, like a C-section is a short-cut to birth, he reasons. In the Netherlands as a whole one death in 25 is assisted, he notes, but in some cities that figure can be as high as one in seven.
The choice to die is often murkiest for those with dementia. In 2016 a Dutch woman with severe Alzheimer’s awoke during her euthanasia and, as she struggled, her family had to hold her down. Before dementia overcame her, she had made a written request for euthanasia, and the doctor prioritised that choice. In 2020, after the doctor was cleared of wrongdoing, the Supreme Court clarified that doctors cannot be prosecuted for carrying out euthanasia on patients with advanced dementia, even if they no longer express an explicit wish to die. The Netherlands averages around two such cases a year.
Bert Keizer, a geriatrician who has carried out some of the Netherlands’ most controversial euthanasia cases, is deeply uneasy about the new guidelines. Typically euthanasia happens with the agreement of the patient, doctors, and the family. But in cases of dementia, he muses, “the one who it’s all about'' is “removed from the event”. Implicit in the court’s ruling is a judgment that the person one was has more value than the person one has become. A patient who wanted to live could be denied that choice.
Swiss law, by contrast, mandates that those seeking to kill themselves be mentally competent. This can create a different terror. Alex Pandolfo has early-onset dementia. He has decided to die in Switzerland, yet he has postponed the day of his death once. If he waits too long, he will condemn himself to the future he does not want.
Some proponents of assisted dying are pressing to expand eligibility, to include those who feel they have lived a “completed life”. In 2020 the liberal D66 party in the Netherlands proposed a law to make suicide pills available to people over 75 who felt they were done living. Critics point to research from the University of Humanistic Studies in Utrecht, which shows that death wishes in older people are subject to change, and in some cases are caused by loneliness and social isolation. Few truly want to die, and those who do often meet other criteria for euthanasia, a commission found in 2016. Supporters argue that it is important to provide the option, even though few will take it in the end. Just 3% of the members of Dignitas, which campaigns for assisted dying, end up receiving help to end their lives.
Some who are simply tired of life do choose to press ahead. At 76, Dawn Voice-Cooper, who suffered from several debilitating but not life-threatening ailments, saw her future and did not want to live it: The pain of having her ears syringed; the indignity of swimming with a colonoscopy bag; the diminishing freedom to move as her arthritic joints stiffened. Life was exhausting and would only become more so. “I don’t want to die but I can’t live like this,” she said. In October she travelled from her home in Britain to an industrial estate on the edge of a Swiss forest. After listening to Nick Drake’s “Day is Done”, she died, with her friend Mr Pandolfo (and a tabloid reporter) by her side.
“Many people are not waiting for laws to pass,” warns Katie Engelhart, author of “The Inevitable”, a book about the right-to-die movement. It reveals a secret world where people, fed up with restraints imposed by laws or doctors, order lethal substances over the internet. Their reasons are often existential rather than physical: a loss of purpose, fear of being a burden or of losing their dignity. People who seek death through legal channels have similar reasons. In Oregon the most common concerns among people who qualify to die owing to terminal illness include loss of enjoyment (94%), loss of autonomy (93%) and loss of dignity (72%).
Some shrug off this phenomenon, arguing, “Assisted dying is not suicide.” But Ms Engelhart believes that such deaths are inevitably linked to the strictures around assisted dying. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, one in five people over the age of 40 who kill themselves have a terminal or debilitating illness. Yet many lonely suicides are not planned and considered, so a black market in suicide can also bring terrible risks. Earlier this year a 28-year-old Dutch woman died after taking a substance from an affiliate of Last Will Cooperative, a right-to-die organisation, seemingly impulsively. Several members of the group, including its leader, have since been arrested. Prosecutors suspect the group is involved in dozens of deaths.
In the West, assisted dying is helping to change the culture of death and dying. People are talking about death more, and even scripting it, says Naomi Richards, a British anthropologist. Death is becoming an event to be scheduled, controlled, reached via a byway past ageing or suffering. In an Instagram age, it is possible to imagine a “good death” being idealised and curated. Ellen Wiebe, a Canadian doctor, says she has helped people die “on a beach, in a forest and in the middle of a party”. Such deaths may seem particularly appealing when, for generations, dying has been medicalised and hidden, and during a pandemic in which so many have died alone in hospital.
For those left behind, an assisted death can feel like a blessing or a curse. Some, such as Tom Mortier, who has taken his case to the European Court of Human Rights, feel angry and resentful that their relative was taken too soon. But most find solace. Heather Cooke’s son, Aaron Ball, chose to die last year, at 42, while suffering from metastatic colon cancer. Ms Cooke suffers the agony of a mother who has lost her only child, but is also glad that he died in peace, at home, surrounded by his family. Medically assisted dying was a “gift” for us, she says. “But I understand why people fear it.”",2

1620,"THE NATURAL world is filled with complexity. The more closely scientists study everything from planets to atoms, the more structure they find and the more detailed their explanations must get. But if you want to predict the behaviour of such systems, how much detail do you need? To understand how Earth’s oceans will behave, say, do you need to track every individual molecule of water within them?
This year’s Nobel prize for physics was awarded to a trio of researchers who have studied complex, chaotic and apparently random systems and developed ways to predict their long-term behaviour. Half of the prize of SKr10m (about $1.1m) was shared by Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, in Hamburg. The other half went to Giorgio Parisi of Sapienza University, in Rome. 

Drs Manabe and Hasselmann laid the foundations of the modelling of the Earth's climate that led to “quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming”, according to the citation by the Nobel Committee for Physics of Sweden’s Royal Academy of Science. Dr Parisi was awarded his share for his discoveries around the “interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales”.
In the 1960s, Dr Manabe, an atmospheric scientist, wove together emerging strands of understanding of the dynamics and thermodynamics of Earth’s atmosphere to make the first reliable prediction that doubling the level of carbon dioxide present would also increase the planet’s surface temperature. His work led to the development of physical models of Earth’s climate and laid the foundation for the climate models used today. 
Around the same time, scientists such as Edward Lorenz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were beginning to describe weather as a chaotic system—in other words, something that had so many interacting individual components, such as temperature, pressure, humidity and wind speed, that even small variations in initial conditions could result in enormous differences at a later stage. In this description, weather evolved rapidly and became essentially unpredictable even just a few days into the future. 
In the 1970s, Dr Hasselmann developed models to show how weather, despite itself being chaotic and unpredictable in the short-term, could nonetheless yield reliable models to predict Earth’s climate over much longer periods. In describing his work he made an analogy to Brownian motion, the jostling movement of pollen grains in water that was first observed down a microscope by Robert Brown, a botanist, in 1827. Almost 80 years later, Albert Einstein posited that the slow zigzagging of the grains could be explained by their continual bombardment by much tinier, fast-moving water molecules. The large-scale climate can similarly be seen as a consequence of numerous much smaller events.
Around 1980 Dr Parisi found some of the rules that govern apparently random phenomena. He studied a type of material called “spin glass”, in which, for example, iron atoms are mixed randomly into a grid of copper atoms. The iron atoms each behave as tiny magnets but, unlike the case of a normal lump of magnetised metal, the north-south poles of the iron atoms in a spin glass do not point in a uniform direction. Dr Parisi devised a way to understand how they find their optimal orientations. His mathematical ideas not only help explain some of the complex systems of Earth’s climate, as described by his two fellow laureates, but also other apparently random phenomena in fields as diverse as biology, neuroscience and machine learning. 
This year’s physics prize is the first scientific Nobel to be awarded for understanding the Earth’s climate. Asked if this was a not-so-subtle message to world leaders ahead of the upcoming cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, members of the Nobel committee said the prize was meant to celebrate the discoveries themselves. But, they added, it also showed that the modelling of climate and the notion of global warming rested on solid physical science. Human beings can no longer say they did not know how or why Earth was heating up.",2
1621,"THE MEGAPHONE has been taken away. On January 8th Twitter, a social network, announced that it was “permanently suspending” President Donald Trump's account. Viewed in isolation, the two tweets that led to the ban were, by Mr Trump’s standards, fairly innocuous. But Twitter said it had taken its decision in the wake of the riot at America’s Congress on January 6th, in which five people died as legislators’ offices were ransacked by a crowd of Mr Trump's supporters after Mr Trump had encouraged them to march on the Capitol. It said that continuing to give Mr Trump access risked allowing him to incite further violence.
Other social networks have taken a similarly tough line. Facebook has said that Mr Trump's account will be banned for “at least” the remainder of his term in office, which is due to expire on January 20th. Snapchat, a smaller social network, has likewise blocked the president's access. Besides defenestrating Mr Trump, Twitter also banned the accounts of Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell, two of the president’s dwindling circle of allies. And it promised to do the same for accounts dedicated to QAnon, a nutty but resilient conspiracy theory that holds that America is run by a cabal of Satanic paedophiles.

The suspensions mark the most drastic actions that social-media firms have yet taken to enforce their rules on what can and cannot be said on their platforms. Both Twitter and Facebook had said previously that politicians would be held to lower standards than ordinary users, on the grounds that their utterances—even the sort of inflammatory or false ones of which Mr Trump was fond—were of wide interest. More recently, they had taken to labelling or blocking a greater number of untrue or potentially harmful posts. Twitter, for example, had pushed back on some of Mr Trump’s wilder claims about the election by appending notices to some of his tweets, saying that their contents were disputed. But the outright bans prove that tech-company bosses such as Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg feel there are limits to such indulgences.
Reaction has been split. Mr Trump’s opponents, as well as many academics who study online media, welcomed the decision; some called it overdue. After his personal account was banned, Mr Trump used the official account of the American presidency to accuse Twitter of attempting to silence him, and of giving a platform to some of the “most vicious people in the world”. (Twitter later deleted those tweets, though it did not ban the account). Some prominent politicians from the Republican party, which Mr Trump leads, condemned the decision. “Speech should be free whether you agree or not,” said Ben Carson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. “We aren’t in China.” Even Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader, weighed in (on Twitter) to oppose the ban, saying it set a precedent that “will be exploited by the enemies of freedom of speech around the world”.
Nor was it just social-media companies cracking down. Apple and Google act as gatekeepers to virtually every smartphone on the planet. In the wake of the riots both have banned Parler, a Twitter alternative popular with American right-wingers, from their app stores. Both firms said that some of the rioters had used the app to plan. Amazon quickly followed suit, kicking Parler off its web-hosting service, effectively removing it from the internet and causing an exodus of users to Telegram, a messaging service. Whether Parler's disappearance is permanent will depend on its ability to find a new host willing to stomach its reputation.
Disentangling principles from expediency is tricky. Like almost everything else in modern America, tech firms have been sucked into the country’s all-consuming culture wars. Republicans accuse social networks of censoring conservatives; the Democrats of allowing lies and threats to proliferate unchecked. Both have threatened regulatory crackdowns. Having lost the election, and with the Democrats due to take control of both the presidency and of Congress, Mr Trump is a lame duck. He is made lamer by the fall-out from the Capitol Hill debacle, with even close allies scrambling to distance themselves from him. The political cost of banning him is therefore lower than it has ever been.
All the same, it is hard to avoid the sense that the social-media firms have reached a point of no return. Disquiet about their power and reach is not confined to political partisans. Britain, Australia, Singapore, Brazil and the EU have passed, or are mooting, new rules designed to regulate social media. The banning of the world’s most powerful politician will raise the temperature even further. The firms’ in-house enforcement policies—which are spotty and inconsistently applied—will come under even more intense scrutiny.
So far, most analysis has focused on the implications for American politics. But the fallout from the decision could cause just as many headaches elsewhere. Critics of Twitter’s decision lost little time pointing out that the firm is apparently happy to continue to host Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader. Amid a wave of extra-judicial killings, Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, likes to boast about how many alleged ""drug dealers” he has personally slain. Facebook has been one of Mr Duterte’s most important political tools.
One early flashpoint could be India, where Facebook is embroiled in the struggle between the left-wing Congress party and the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Both sides accuse the firm of favouring the other. Indian culture wars can be even more lethal than the American sort: anti-Muslim riots in Delhi last year that killed more than 50 people. Shortly after Twitter announced Mr Trump’s ban, Tejasvi Surya, the president of the BJP's youth wing, tweeted that “if they can do this to POTUS, they can do this to anyone”, and suggested that the sooner India passed new rules regulating tech firms, “[the] better for our democracy”.

1622,"IT BEGAN WITH a case of homesickness. Ibrahim El Kaakour missed his family’s olive groves in Baasir, so four years ago he gave up his engineering career abroad and returned to Lebanon. At the time farming was just a hobby for his family. But Mr Kaakour had a goal, to reinvigorate the groves—and Lebanon’s long-dormant olive-oil industry, which traces its roots all the way back to the Phoenicians. He launched Genco Olive Oil, named after Vito Corleone’s front company in “The Godfather”.
Mr Kaakour is not alone. A short drive from Baasir lives Walid Mushantaf, who converted wheat fields into olive groves in 2010. Now the company he co-owns, Bustan El Zeitoun, grows Italian olive varieties (among others). Deeper in Lebanon’s mountains, Rose Bechara Perini’s firm, Darmmess SARL, grows the local souri variety on her extended family’s land. She calls Deir Mimas, her picturesque home town, the Bordeaux of olive oil.

They all face the same challenge. Though olive oil was once a key ingredient in Lebanese cuisine, today locals don’t use it much. They prefer imported vegetable oil, which until recently was quite cheap thanks to the overvalued Lebanese pound. Meanwhile, the smallholder farmers who grow most of the country’s olives have let the quality of their product slip. The upshot is that the average Lebanese consumes 1.6kg of olive oil each year, a tenth of what the average Spaniard consumes.
Lebanon’s long-running financial and economic crisis compounds the challenge. The country produces little, so nearly everything, from bottles to fertiliser, must be imported using dollars. As the Lebanese pound plunged in value, prices rose and dollars became scarce. There is also a shortage of fuel, which will be needed to run the olive presses once the annual harvest starts in September. And then there is the pandemic, which has ravaged restaurants, big buyers of extra-virgin olive oils.
The drop in the pound has made imported vegetable oil costlier, which should help growers like Mr Kaakour. But he has his sights set on the international market. He wants to export high-end, extra-virgin olive oil, using olives from all over the country. Lebanese wine is a model. Before the 1970s, not much was exported. Then, during the civil war, Serge Hochar of Chateau Musar in Ghazir, near Beirut, started blending reds and selling them abroad. The brand took off after winning acclaim at the Bristol Wine Fair in 1979. Today about half of Lebanon’s wine is exported.
Its olive-oil producers also believe they can compete with foreign heavyweights, such as Spain and Italy, in terms of quality, if not scale. The labels of Mr Kaakour, Mr Mushantaf and Ms Bechara Perini have won awards in international competitions. The founder of one of those competitions, Antonio Giuseppe Lauro, believes the Lebanese product is improving. Mr Kaakour hopes to make him and others an oil they can't refuse.

1623,"AT ORBITAL SPEEDS a tennis-ball-sized piece of space junk packs enough energy to obliterate a satellite. It makes good sense, then, to track orbiting debris, the better to steer spacecraft away from danger. That this is hard was underscored on April 23rd, as a SpaceX capsule sped toward the International Space Station (ISS). The crew were preparing to sleep when ground control hastily announced they had just 20 minutes to complete a safety procedure before a potential impact. The object, probably a piece of defunct spacecraft, later whizzed past harmlessly.
At the moment, space-going junk is mapped mostly by radar. But of an estimated 34,000 orbiting objects ten or more centimetres across, only about 29,000 are being tracked with reasonable accuracy. Smaller pieces are more numerous, and harder to follow. Those between one and ten centimetres across number more than 900,000; those at least a millimetre across, perhaps 128m. Even tiny bits of debris can do damage. In May the Canadian Space Agency said an untracked piece of junk had punched a hole 5mm across in Canadarm2, a robotic limb attached to the ISS.

As orbiting objects multiply, the danger grows. Roughly a dozen sizeable pieces of space debris break up every year as a result of collisions, exploding rocket fuel, or the rupturing of pressurised tanks or old batteries. Solar radiation chips off bits of paint and metal. And the number of launches is increasing. According to BryceTech, a consultancy in Virginia, at the end of 2001 there were 771 active satellites orbiting Earth. Ten years later that population had grown to 965. Since then, it has nearly quintupled, to roughly 4,500—and this does not include defunct satellites. And small, cheap satellites are a booming business. Maciej Konacki, an astronomer at the Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw, who has studied the matter on behalf of the European Union, reckons there could be 100,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of the decade.
One sign of this crowding is that forecasts of potential impacts have roughly doubled in the past few years, says the Space Data Association, an industry group based in the Isle of Man which calculates collision risks for its members. But the rise conceals some good news. Part of the reason for more predicted impacts is better forecasting. As the quality and quantity of information grows, many potential collisions which would have gone unnoticed in the past are now foreseen.
Collision warning
Radars operated by America’s Department of Defence have long been the biggest providers of “space situational awareness”. Little more than ten years ago, position fixes were generally accurate only to within a few hundred metres. Since then, says François Laporte, an expert at CNES, France’s space agency, the accuracy of America’s debris tracking has improved by an “extraordinary, marvellous” order of magnitude, to a few tens of metres.
One big advance has been “Space Fence”. This is a system built in the Marshall Islands for America’s air force. It is billed (admittedly by its maker, Lockheed Martin, an arms firm) as the world’s most advanced radar. It went into service in March 2020 and now makes 2m observations a day, many of closely spaced objects just 5cm across. In time, that level of scrutiny should more than triple the number of items which have their orbits regularly updated in a catalogue maintained by the 18th Space Control Squadron, at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
Since 2014 the EU has been chipping in too. Seven of its members pool their space-surveillance and tracking assets in an arrangement called the EU SST Consortium. Europeans worry that American data on debris may not remain forever free and freely available. Pride also plays a role. Mr Laporte says Europe’s spacefarers want to see debris for themselves, “not just through the Americans”. The consortium has yet to increase meaningfully the number of catalogued objects—“We’re not even in the same league” as America, says Mr Laporte. But satellite operators welcome the effort nonetheless.
One problem is that there is no consensus on the best way to predict an object’s future orbit. To do this its position must be recorded several times, to observe how its path is being altered by the gravitational pulls of the Earth, Moon and sun, the pressure imposed on it by solar radiation and, in low orbits, the drag caused by wayward wisps of air from the upper atmosphere, and so on. Different teams often come up with different results, says Dr Konacki, who was once a delegate to the EU SST Consortium. Any extra data should help make the process more accurate.
The private sector is gearing up its efforts, too. In April LeoLabs, a firm in Silicon Valley, switched on its fourth debris-tracking radar station. This facility, in Costa Rica, joins others in Alaska, New Zealand and Texas. A fifth is being built in the Azores. LeoLabs can currently track objects slightly bigger than tennis balls. The short wavelength and high power of the radars mean it may eventually be able keep tabs on bits of junk just 2cm across.
LeoLabs sells data to satellite operators, space agencies, America’s armed forces and insurers keen to calculate better actuarial tables for spacecraft. Dan Ceperley, the firm’s boss, notes that government agencies often take several “hand-wringing” hours to answer requests for a satellite’s probability of collision. His firm’s website lets customers see within seconds whether a proposed manoeuvre will lead, over the next week, to danger from any of the objects in LeoLabs’ catalogue.
Besides using radar, debris can also be tracked optically. In collaboration with Curtin University, in Perth, Lockheed Martin runs FireOPAL, a system of 20 cheap cameras aimed at the sky from various parts of Australia. For several hours at dawn and dusk, when these cameras are in the dark but sunlight still illuminates debris orbiting above, the cameras take pictures every ten seconds. The closer an object, the more it appears to move relative to the stars, allowing triangulation of its position. For items at an altitude of 400km, says Phil Bland, who is in charge of Curtin’s side of the project, the system is accurate to within 30 metres.
FireOPAL’s greatest success so far was locating a satellite half a metre across, 26,000km up. The smallest objects the lenses capture in low orbits are about 30cm across. Rod Drury, Dr Bland’s counterpart at Lockheed, says the firm now plans to expand FireOPAL around the world.
Lasers are another option. Around 40 outfits, including some belonging to the members of the EU SST Consortium, are shooting laser pulses at “retro-reflectors” fitted to many satellites. Clocking the return time allows positions to be calculated with an accuracy of a few millimetres. Seven laser stations also use a more powerful pulse that can spot debris without retro-reflectors, to within around a metre.
For finding stuff in high orbits, though, neither lasers nor radars are much help. But telescopes work. ExoAnalytic Solutions, a Californian firm, tracks junk up to 170,000km away—nearly halfway to the Moon—using instruments “just laying on the shelves” at astronomy shops, according to Clint Clark, the firm’s “Vice President of First Impressions” (as some marketing bosses like to be known in California). As for debris in geosynchronous orbit, a mere 36,000km up, ExoAnalytic’s 300 telescopes, scattered in 35 clusters over five continents and Hawaii, track grapefruit-sized objects to within an accuracy of about ten metres. The company is adding a couple of sites a year, to improve the degree of precision. Customers include insurers keen to see if policyholders fly their satellites as safely as they claim to.
These efforts are impressive. Even so, back at LeoLabs Dr Ceperley reckons that ten times more tracking capability is needed than is available today. Such demand has allowed Northstar Earth  Space, a new firm in Montreal, to raise money to build, at $25m a pop, three 100kg satellites that will use telescopic cameras to track junk from orbit. The plan, according to Northstar’s boss, Stewart Bain, is to launch the satellites in 2023, into an orbit with an altitude of 575km—the celestial equivalent, he quips, of “riviera or beach-front property”. If this goes well, another nine will join them in subsequent years, to create a panopticon a dozen strong.
Where there’s muck there’s brass
For customers, none of this comes cheap. Northstar, for example, plans to charge annual subscriptions of between $10m and $100m. But that will buy more than just a degree of collision-proofing. It will also permit the manoeuvres made to avoid such collisions to be fine-tuned, or even deemed unnecessary. That will save fuel, extending a satellite’s useful life. And it will also reduce pauses in service, which are almost inevitable when a satellite’s orbit is being adjusted.
Naturally, this orbital-tracking technology has military value as well. Knowing objects’ orbits can reveal much about an adversary’s capabilities—including, perhaps, orbital combat. Movements that represent any deviation from normal patterns are most telling, says Scott Norr, an expert at Lockheed in the use of Space Fence for military intelligence. To illustrate why, he points to an object that had been considered to be just a piece of debris from a Russian military launch. In May 2014 the “debris” sprang to life. Its movements since then have fuelled fears that it could be an anti-satellite weapon. Whether other such “sleepers” are hidden in plain sight among the clouds of rubbish orbiting Earth remains to be seen. ■

1624,"THE PANDEMIC has been very good for sellers of cornflakes, and very busy for those who make them. With so many people spending so much time at home, cereal consumption has boomed. Kerry Williams, an instrument technician, says this has translated into almost constant overtime shifts at his Kellogg’s plant in Pennsylvania, sometimes as long as 16 hours a day. That would be hard enough. But what makes it that much harder, he says, is seeing Kellogg’s, one of the world’s biggest producers of ready-to-eat cereals, pull in giant profits even as his pay has barely increased. “We feel it’s time that this money trickles down to us, because without the workers on the floor there would be no Kellogg,” he says. Mr Williams and about 1,400 colleagues at Kellogg’s factories round the country, from Tennessee to Michigan, have been on strike for two weeks.
They are far from alone. On October 14th about 10,000 employees of John Deere, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, walked off the job in five states. More than 20,000 nurses and workers in California and Oregon with Kaiser Permanente, a health-care company, have voted to strike. About 60,000 behind-the-scenes film and TV workers were also set to head to picket lines, having voted 99% in favour of a strike, but a last-minute deal averted that. Headline writers are referring to the wave of industrial action as “Striketober”.

Partly it is the resumption of trends visible before covid-19. Nearly half a million workers were involved in work stoppages in both 2018 and 2019, the most in more than three decades. That reflected both dissatisfaction with pay and working conditions and the unions’ confidence that, in a tight labour market, they had leverage. The pandemic has only reinforced these dynamics. Having been lauded as essential workers for the past 18 months, everyone from nurses to food-packers expects better treatment. And with companies struggling to find staff, workers are emboldened.
A dominant feature of the American economy over the past few decades has been sluggish wage growth, albeit with decent gains just before the pandemic. The question now is whether Striketober signals a clearer turning-point, a shift in the balance of power towards labour. Workers have reason for guarded optimism.
Labour’s share of non-farm output (the portion of economic output going to workers in wages and other forms of compensation) reached nearly 65% in 2000. At the end of 2019, on the eve of the pandemic, it was down to 60%, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Even more notable has been the rise in inequality. Between 1979 and 2019 the top decile of wages in America rose by 41% in real terms, whereas the bottom decile increased by just 7%.
Several things have weighed on blue-collar wages across the rich world. Advances in technology, including automation, have chipped away at workers’ bargaining power. So, too, has the globalisation of production. In America the weakness of unions has exacerbated these trends. Just one worker in ten belongs to a union today, half the proportion of the early 1980s.
Strikers seem to have the public on their side, at least for now. On a blustery autumn morning outside the Kellogg’s plant in Lancaster, a town in central Pennsylvania, a few dozen workers pace back and forth in front of the gates, maintaining a round-the-clock picket. Cars honk their horns in solidarity. Opinion polls suggest that 68% of Americans support unions, up notably from a decade ago. “Everyone in this country is a little tired of the greed,” says Allan Torres, a middle-aged veteran of Kellogg’s packing operations.
The details of each dispute are different. The film and television workers complained about excessive hours. At Kellogg’s, workers object to aspects of a two-tiered system that lets managers bring in new staff on stingier packages. The company counters that it provides industry-leading pay and benefits.
Yet a common feature is the workers’ belief that they now have the upper hand. The strikers at Kellogg’s say the company has brought in buses with replacement staff to show that the factory can run without them. But, they say, the buses are not full. With just a light wisp of white smoke rising from the Lancaster plant, their assumption is that production has ground to a halt. “The grocery shelves aren’t going to be looking so good,” says Mr Torres.
Even without the strikes, there is no doubt that American workers are getting pickier. Nearly 4.3m quit their jobs in August, the most in the two decades or so that the Labour Department has monitored these data. Celine McNicholas of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think-tank, notes the exodus has been most pronounced in restaurants and retail operations, service sectors with few unions, low wages and little sick pay. “Folks are saying, ‘This is not a job worth it to me right now’,” she says. “They’re being asked to take it or leave it, and they’re leaving it.”
Labour organisers also know they have an ally in the White House. Joe Biden has repeatedly said that he aspires to be the most pro-union president in American history. Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of trade unions, has pointed to a friendly administration, worker activism and public backing as a potent combination. “We have everything lined up,” she said in a recent speech.
Not everything, though. “Labour laws have proven time and again to be completely stacked against workers who are interested in forming and joining unions,” says Kent Wong, director of the UCLA Labour Centre. Without legal changes that would, for example, prohibit companies from permanently replacing workers who walk off the job, the strike wave may fizzle out. The PRO Act, legislation that would strengthen collective-bargaining rights, has passed the House of Representatives. But it is almost certain to fail in the Senate without Republican support.
Some of the biggest companies are waging their own battles against worker activism, and largely succeeding. An Amazon warehouse in Alabama was seen by labour organisers as their best shot at bringing unions to the e-commerce giant, but in April workers voted against unionising by more than two to one, amid allegations that the company had used intimidating tactics. Meanwhile, faced with a unionisation campaign in Buffalo, Starbucks has sent in out-of-state managers and temporarily closed outlets. It says this is a standard training procedure; labour organisers suspect it of trying to disrupt their efforts.
At the same time, companies are bowing to the reality that they have to offer higher wages to attract and retain workers. Amazon has increased its average starting hourly pay to $18 (from $17 earlier this year) for warehouse workers, well above the $15 that campaigners have long called for as a legal minimum. Walmart, McDonald’s and CVS are among the scores of others also raising pay, helping to fuel the biggest increases in blue-collar wages in years.
At the Kellogg’s picket lines, the workers trumpet an old union mantra when asked how long they plan to stay off the job: “One day longer, one day stronger”. For American businesses, a different rhyming slogan encapsulates their strategy in the face of Striketober: a few dollars higher, the union drive will expire.■

1625,"ON AUGUST 26TH central bankers will gather for their annual Jackson Hole jamboree with the shine having come off their record. A year ago they had forestalled a financial crisis during the pandemic’s first wave. Today an inflation surge has made a mockery of the Federal Reserve’s forecasts; a parliamentary committee has said that the Bank of England has a “dangerous addiction” to buying bonds; and everybody expects the European Central Bank (ECB) to undershoot, over a period of years, its shiny new “symmetric” inflation target of 2%, unveiled in July.
The disquieting sense of monetary powerlessness is compounded by the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, which threatens to raise prices and depress global growth. Monetary policy cannot do much about port terminals closing because of outbreaks—as China’s Ningbo-Zhoushan did on August 11th—nor about Australia and New Zealand returning to lockdowns. In America consumer confidence tumbled in the first half of August. It was not for want of monetary stimulus.

Yet the trickiest challenge facing central banks is when and how to reverse the past year-and-a-half of quantitative easing (QE), the buying of long-term bonds using newly created money. On current forecasts rich-world central banks’ balance-sheets will have reached a combined $28trn in size by the end of the year, about two-fifths of which is attributable to QE during the pandemic. Critics says central banks face a “QE ratchet” because their bond holdings only go in one direction: they surged after the global financial crisis and never fell much before the pandemic struck. Even many emerging markets, now grappling with an inflation problem, have dabbled in QE and must soon decide its future.

Debate over QE within central banks is dominated by short-term considerations about the need for stimulus. Yet there is only weak evidence that accumulating or holding bonds helps economies much when, as now, financial markets are calm. The trouble is that investors have been encouraged to interpret decisions about QE as a signal about when central banks might raise interest rates, a policy whose effects are more tangible. The resulting sensitivity of interest-rate expectations to QE announcements makes the policy hard to unwind. The Fed is nervous about triggering another “taper tantrum”, the episode in 2013 when the suggestion that it might curtail its bond-buying shook markets. In the euro zone things are further complicated because QE has also had the side-effect of mutualising some of the debts of member states.
Central bankers should be explicit about the purpose and effectiveness of QE. Buying bonds is an essential tool for stabilising financial markets in a crisis like that of spring last year. But it is increasingly clear that it should fall to government spending or tax cuts to rescue the real economy when interest rates have already reached zero. Today’s economic data bear that out: one reason America has a troublesome price surge while the ECB’s inflation target looks unfeasibly high is that America has had much more fiscal stimulus—cumulative QE, as a share of GDP, has been similar. Being explicit about which tools serve what purpose, and playing down the perceived link between bond-buying and interest rates, would let central banks unwind QE.
That would be welcome because of QE’s long-term downsides, of which there is growing awareness. One danger about which The Economist has long warned is that bloated central-bank balance-sheets are a threat to the stability of the public finances. Purchases of long-term bonds are paid for by creating central-bank reserves—electronic cash which carries a floating rate of interest (commercial banks hold these reserves and receive any interest). Should policymakers need to raise interest rates to fight inflation, the new reserves will become costlier to service. Because central banks are owned by governments—Britain’s has explicitly underwritten QE—any such burden will ultimately fall on taxpayers.
A rapid exit from QE would remove that danger. But the overarching goal should be to recognise the tool’s limitations and consequences. At present central bankers do not want to talk down their own firepower and do not see it as their job to take account of QE’s fiscal threat. Instead the state should take an integrated view of its finances. That may involve redesigning how institutions work, by giving governments the job of weighing up the policy’s costs and benefits. At the same time, central banks might be given an advisory role on the size of government deficit that would help stabilise economies in a downturn. As it is, the justifications for QE have become murky, as have the interactions between fiscal and monetary policies. It is time for transparency and a clear division of labour. ■

1626,"ACROSS MUCH of Asia, the pandemic has given national leaders an excuse to unleash authoritarian instincts—think Thailand, the Philippines or India. Australia, though, provides a stark contrast. There, authority has conspicuously ebbed away from the federal government and to the vast country’s six states.
The shift is clearest in the way states have imposed their own quarantine rules. Australia closed to the outside world at the outset of the pandemic. But individual state governments also saw out-of-state Australians as a peril. Backed by state police and pursuing a zero-covid policy, they slammed their borders shut. They have since opened and closed them on states’ individual whims, depending on the perceived threat of infections from other states.

No more striking exercise of state power has occurred since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919, when states last closed themselves off from each other. But then the Commonwealth of Australia was not even 20 years old. Regional identities were stronger than national ones. Canberra was not yet then the federal capital. And the role of the prime minister of the federation had not yet been properly construed: the premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, the most populous states, wielded more power.
This time the federal government is stronger. But it has also bungled. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, looked witless early on by insisting he would attend a rugby match. His government joined a suit brought by a mining tycoon challenging Western Australia’s popular decision to close its borders. More recently Canberra insisted on overseeing Australia’s vaccine rollout but failed to lay on sufficient supplies. It struggled to get what jabs it had into arms after blocking state health authorities from taking the lead. These have since stepped in, with mass-vaccination clinics, but the political harm has been done. Mr Morrison’s ratings languish. In contrast, the premiers of the two most isolationist states, Western Australia and Queensland, have won landslide re-elections.
The pandemic has given people “a lesson in how real the states’ sovereignty is”, says Frank Bongiorno, a historian at the Australian National University. A sense of state identity has re-emerged among citizens. Australians tune in to state leaders’ daily press briefings on the pandemic. A new “national cabinet” that includes state premiers has been formed to co-ordinate the response. Greg Melleuish of the University of Wollongong says these days they enjoy “the limelight they don’t normally get”. Perhaps for the first time, Australians are familiar with premiers of other states.
Much of the ground for states’ re-emergence, argues Geoff Gallop, a former premier of Western Australia, had already been laid. Once home to corrupt political machines, reformed state capitals have in recent decades earned a better reputation. More sleaze attaches to governments in Canberra. States have taken the lead in areas that the federal government has wilfully neglected, Aboriginal affairs and climate change above all.
Yet does this all amount to a permanent shift in relative power? Perhaps not. Who holds the purse strings still counts. The government in Canberra began accruing power after the second world war with the introduction of a federal income tax. Closing borders and imposing lockdowns is an easier call with the federal government’s promise of massive support for state economies.
Nor is a permanent shift away from federal authority always desirable. Take climate: Australia’s international commitments to cut carbon emissions can only be made in Canberra, not state capitals. As for the new national cabinet, it does not behave as a cabinet should, by assuming collective responsibility. Rather, individual premiers like to grab the microphone. Besides, its importance will fade with the pandemic.
Right now, the federal government must push more forcefully for reopening, not just between states but to the outside world, too. Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, warns that inter-state rivalry risks curdling national unity. As it is, isolation has caused Australia to turn inward. It is shut off from its huge diaspora and it has halted the immigration on which the country was built. A “fortress Australia”, anxious about the world and inclined to throw up barriers against it, is, as Mr Fullilove warns, a smaller Australia. If ever the federal government had a case to make against the states’ perspective, it is that one.",2
1627,"EDTECH HAS never quite fulfilled its promise to galvanise poorly performing school systems. Past investments in educational technology often failed because of badly specified hardware and clunky software, which put off potential users. But as with much else, the closures forced on the world by the covid-19 pandemic has put pressure on schools, parents and pupils to embrace innovation. Has its moment arrived?
The picture is inevitably mixed. The covid-19 crisis has exacerbated the digital divide. The poorest students living in places with the creakiest digital infrastructure have been least able to take advantage of virtual schooling. But what has been achieved in many places has nonetheless been remarkable. Nowhere more so than in India, where more than 4,000 edtech start-ups, attracting over $2bn of venture-capital funding, have emerged in the past five years. “Necessity is the mother of all invention,” says a teacher at a school in Chandigarh in Punjab that has embraced edtech. “It came as a blessing in a bleak situation and made a world of difference.”

Two big hurdles have confronted edtech in the past: adoption and access. India’s severe lockdown, leaving the country’s 1.5m schools and 250m K-12 pupils (from kindergarten to 18) desperate to maintain at least some learning, provided the spur to overcome the former. And cheap smartphones and tablets, combined with some of the lowest data prices in the world, have gone a long way towards solving the access problem. At the beginning of the year, before covid-19 hit, India already had more than 500m smartphone users, which meant that 77% of Indians had access to the mobile internet. That number has since risen significantly.
When covid shut down India’s schools, low-income families that had regarded smartphones as a luxury for entertainment suddenly saw them as a necessity for education, notes Shankar Maruwada, the chief executive of EkStep, a not-for-profit group (established by Nandan Nilekani, the founder of Infosys, an IT-sourcing giant, and his wife Rohini) that built Diksha, a national digital teaching-and-learning platform.
India’s smartphone revolution was made possible in part by the launch in 2015 of the cheap Jio network. But there is a caveat. In poorer families, phones are shared. Children may have only an hour or so each day to follow online lessons and send their work back to teachers. Some children still have no access at all, especially in rural areas.
Edtech falls into three main categories. There is software for teachers, such as TeacherApp, which has enrolled nearly 1m teachers and has 10,000 average daily users. There is also tech for parents, such as Top Parent, an app which assists home education and has been downloaded more than 135,000 times in the past six months. Third and most important, is tech for pupils, ranging from software that helps prepare them for tests to programs that use artificial intelligence to help children skills at their own pace (known as personalised adaptive learning or PAL).
Levelling up
One such system, Mindspark, has been developed over more than a decade and now has a database of over 45,000 test questions. The interactive software packages continuous assessment of each pupil’s progress with instructional games, videos and classroom activities. Students learn through a constant process of explanation and feedback. The software adapts to the student’s level. It is designed to enable over-burdened and often under-trained teachers to move away from the rote learning common in Indian classrooms towards “teaching at the right level”.
Byju’s, a different kind of learning platform, now valued at nearly $11bn, making it India’s second-most valuable startup, offers personalised tutoring apps from what it claims to be India’s best teachers. Parents get monthly updates on their children’s progress. It has about 65m users. Most of them use a limited service free of charge but about 4m pay an average $135 a year for personalised mentoring. “It is extremely engaging and the videos are visually attractive. Mentors give extra attention to areas where I struggle, and take great care in explaining things,” says Kriti, an 11th-year student (ie, aged 16-17) from Chandigarh who has used Byju’s for several years. “During the lockdown many of my friends started using these programs because they could not go to private tutors. I think after the pandemic is over, most of the students will continue to use Byju's instead of going back to their physical tuitions.”
Whereas Byju’s has mostly focused on better-off students in big cities, ConveGenius, social enterprise, offers a PAL platform to government-run and budget private schools. It aims to help the 90% of Indian children who are not at the appropriate level of learning for their age because of poor teaching and overcrowded mixed-ability classrooms. Its chatbot can run on Android, WhatsApp or the web. Third-party evaluations suggest that ConveGenius has cut the number of pupils struggling to learn foundational skills from more than 50% to 23%, while the number of advanced learners has more than doubled. Others suggest students can gain as much as two academic years of learning in a single year.
Before lockdown, ConveGenius was growing steadily with about 500,000 pupils in 5,400 schools, under a deal with state governments. When the schools closed, Jairaj Bhattacharya, its CEO, turned directly to parents and pupils. Launched in April using WhatsApp and mapped to the state curriculum, its consumer product now has 4.5m users. Mr Bhattacharya says that the deal with state governments, such as Madhya Pradesh, is that ConveGenius provides its service free but owns all the “customer” data. He claims that, with the platform capable of handling 100m users, there is plenty of potential for monetising.
Some firms, such as ClassKlap, combine software for pupils, teachers and parents. Its IMAX package, sold to more than 1,200 budget private schools, provides apps for children to learn at home, for teachers to improve their skills and lesson planning, and for school principals to manage their business. 
Most schools in India will not reopen until the end of the Diwali holiday in mid-November. As they gradually do so, the relief of children and teachers at sharing a classroom again will be powerful. But the use of edtech to help teachers teach, children learn and administrators understand what is happening in their schools has been accelerated by about five years, according to Varun Kumar, ClassKlap’s founder.
An important development, notes Sridhar Rajagopalan, the chief learning officer of Educational Initiatives, the creators of Mindspark, is that teachers now regard edtech as an increasingly useful tool to make their lives better, rather than as a threat to their status and livelihoods. What is more, the central government in Delhi and state administrations are enthusiastic proponents of digital technology to help them oversee education systems and improve standards. In the state of Gujarat, for example, with the onset of the pandemic every textbook for the curriculum was given a QR code on Diksha that teachers and children could scan and receive through their smartphones. Test papers were also sent out each week, to be completed by 4.3m pupils, corrected by teachers and the marks recorded, all by scanning.
Vinod Rao, Gujarat’s education secretary, says that the system allows his department to see and analyse performance in granular detail across the state. The data enable individual assessment of a large majority of students (Dr Rao reckons that only about 20% lack access to phones), which will be used to target remedial work on those who most need it.
Girin Beeharry, the director of global education at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, an NGO, believes that the future of schools will be a hybrid. Classroom teaching will be blended with digital tools, especially teacher-facing apps that “go with the grain of the system”, to make learning more engaging and the system more resilient. Mr Beeharry likes an approach that Bridge International Academies (BIA), a once-controversial school operator in Africa, is pioneering with impressive results in Nigeria’s Edo and Lagos states. BIA has contracted with those governments to manage and reform almost entire school systems by applying its technology and pedagogy to support public-sector teachers. BIA is hoping to interest Indian states in similar deals.
The next test
For all that edtech has ridden to the rescue during the covid crisis, questions about its real impact remain. Compared with conventional interventions by teachers, which tend to be focused on pulling up the worst-performing pupils, edtech lifts the standards of the whole class. But quality varies. Adaptive learning systems, such as Mindspark and ConveGenuis, tend to do much better than other forms of edtech. An outfit like Byju’s can point to relatively affluent subscribers voting with their wallets.
Whether edtech can deliver a system-wide revolution will remain uncertain until it is tried at real, statewide, scale. Many changes will be required for that to happen: quality standards need to be established; digital infrastructure must be put in place; teachers must receive the training needed to use the learning systems effectively; and parents must have confidence that the prospects of their children are improved.
EkStep’s Mr Maruwada likens the effect of the pandemic to that of the second world war as a spur to innovation. “Covid has been a trigger for frenzied activity. The effects will be completely transforming in the long term but they will be non-linear and are difficult to predict. But critically, states are now realising the scale at which edtech needs to be applied.”",2
1628,"NOW Cop26 has drawn to a close, you may be left feeling a little befuddled about how best to do your bit for the planet.
Does it make sense to stop eating imported fruit if you plan to fly to the sun for some much-needed family time next year?
Is a shower more eco-friendly than a soak in the tub?
To answer such questions — and help us better understand the implications of our consumer choices — PROFESSOR MIKE BERNERS-LEE, professor of sustainability at Lancaster University, has calculated the carbon footprint of absolutely everything . . . with some surprising conclusions.
Like most people I don’t particularly enjoy instructions on how to live.
I may have spent 15 years researching the impact of the carbon emissions that are slowly heating our planet.
But I’ve also had plenty of practice in not being quite as good as I’d like to be.
We all want to live our lives responsibly but we have to live. That’s not to say we don’t need to change our habits. We do. We are in a climate emergency. But a sense of scale is required.
A friend once asked how he should best dry his hands to reduce his carbon footprint — with a paper towel or electric drier? This same person flies across the Atlantic dozens of times a year.
The flying is hugely more significant than the hand-drying, so my friend was just distracting himself from the real issue.
The reason I decided to work out the carbon footprint of everything I could think of was to help you get a feel for roughly how much carbon is at stake when you make simple day-to-day choices.
Everything we do has some impact — where we travel to and how, whether we buy an apple in season or asparagus in winter, whether we have a quick shower or luxuriate in the bath.
What is a carbon footprint? It’s a measure of the impact of our activities on the amount of greenhouse gases being produced and released into the atmosphere.
All we consume and do and think about, both at home and work, has a carbon impact — that is, a climate change impact.
But you might be very surprised by some of the things that have a hefty carbon load and some that don’t.
I use a measure called ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ to calculate the volume of harmful gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, refrigerant and other gases) generated in the making and consumption of any product or service.
Take a tomato: any calculation needs to take into account how it was grown (naturally or in a heated greenhouse), the type of fertiliser used (some require a complex manufacturing process, others emit greenhouse gases), and how it was packaged and transported (by road, ship or air, the latter being a carbon disaster).
As a consumer, you need to consider that 1kg of locally grown tomatoes has a carbon footprint of 400g CO2e compared to an astounding 50kg CO2e produced by 1kg of organic, ‘on the vine’ UK cherry tomatoes grown out of season in March.
Choose those tomatoes and they can be the highest-carbon food of all, even though grown here.
Bananas, on the other hand, may travel far before they land in our fruit bowls, but as they tend to be shipped rather than airfreighted and require less packaging because they are protected by their skins, they are a low-carbon — and extremely nutritious — food.
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS BAD FOR PLANET
Gold and diamonds are precious precisely because it takes effort, industry and resources to extract them, and this takes their carbon footprint sky high, particularly for jewellery which comes from far afield (£500 worth of gold and diamonds from Africa has a carbon footprint of 710kg CO2e).
That’s aside from the bad working conditions for some miners. Far better to wear jewellery passed down through the family, re-fashioned from existing gems or made from natural materials like shells.
GROW YOUR OWN BOUQUETS
Out-of-season cut flowers are bad news for climate change, because they either have to be put on a plane to get here or grown with artificial heat.
A single red rose may be romantic, but when grown in a Netherlands hothouse or outdoors in Kenya and airfreighted to Europe, it will set you back 2.4kg of CO2e compared to zero carbon for a rose grown in your own garden.
A bouquet a week of imported flowers could add 1.5 tonnes of CO2e a year per person.
Grow your own flowers or look for bouquets of local-grown, seasonal blooms (1.7kg CO2e for 15 UK outdoor-grown stems).
An alternative is indoor plants, which are far less carbon-intensive.
DON'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT A DISHWASHER
A high-efficiency dishwasher always wins on carbon footprint over washing the dishes in hot water as long as you run a full load (between 470g to 600g of CO2e per full load) and particularly if you set it to run at night when electricity demand is low and the grid becomes more efficient.
Rinsing plates before stacking the machine is the worst option and ranks alongside ironing your spouse’s socks. If this is your routine, liberate yourself, sharpish.
ORDER A COFFEE WITHOUT MILK
The quickest way to slash the carbon footprint of your morning coffee (or tea) is to drink it black (49g of CO2e per cup for instant coffee or 87g a cup for a black filter or Americano compared with 235g CO2e for a large cappuccino).
Cow’s milk has such a high emissions toll that even the splash in tea accounts for three quarters of a cuppa’s carbon footprint. For a large latte (552g of CO2e) you could have nine Americanos or 25 cups of black tea.
If you buy takeaways, add 110g of CO2e for the disposable cup. At home, use one sturdy mug and only wash it at the end of the day.
JUST HOW BAD ARE IMPORTED BANANAS?
The distances bananas travel to reach us are vast.
But at just 110g of CO2e each, bananas are actually a great food for anyone who cares about their carbon footprint.
Grown in natural sunlight with no hothousing required, they keep well.
So although they are often grown thousands of miles from the end consumer, they are transported by boat (about one per cent of the carbon footprint of airfreight) and they require hardly any packaging as they have skins.
The only really bad bananas are those you allow to rot in your fruit bowl.
These join the scandalous 22 per cent of food binned by consumers in the UK.
Use overripe bananas in baking or enjoy with lashings of custard.
GO FOR THE UGLIEST APPLE IN THE SHOP
Buy the most misshapen apples. It encourages the supply chain not to chuck less-than-perfect-looking fruits away.
Apples are low-carbon but local and seasonal is best (32g of CO2e per kg). This changes when out of season.
UK apples bought in early summer will be last year’s fruit, which will have been kept refrigerated, so requiring electricity. This makes imported apples (80g of CO2e per kg) a better option.
NO WINTER ASPARAGUS
Perhaps the single most carbon-intensive winter vegetable is fresh asparagus flown in from Peru (4.7kg of CO2e per pack.)
That’s because a mile by air typically has about 100 times the carbon impact of a mile by sea. The same applies to airfreighted baby corn, baby carrots, mangetout, green beans, fine beans, okra, shelled peas, lettuces, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.
Enjoy lashings of UK asparagus in summer (270g of CO2e per pack) then wait a year to eat it again.
THE SCOOP ON THE MOST ECO ICE CREAM
A soft scoop from a van comes with a hefty carbon price tag of 500g of CO2e per cone as the vanilla ice cream’s dairy-based and kept cold in a less efficient mobile refrigeration unit, often belching out diesel fumes.
A chocolate flake makes the footprint of an ice cream higher again, though perhaps we can agree this is a necessary evil.
Opt for a plant-based ice cream for your cone, instead. Better still, buy a choc ice (140g of CO2e) or an ice lolly (70g of CO2e) from a shop, which has a lower figure as its refrigeration will be more efficient.
CROCS ARE TOPS
Shoes vary a lot in their carbon footprint, depending on what they’re made of and how long they last.
Running shoes made in China might come in at 8kg of CO2e a pair, but specialist leather is more (15kg of CO2e).
At the lowest end of the scale are a pair of Crocs, made with just 250g of expanded EVA (foam rubber).
They are sold unpackaged so the carbon toll is just over 1kg CO2e per pair.
ARE REUSABLE NAPPIES THAT SAINTLY?
A cloth nappy may seem better than a disposable but if washed at 90 degrees and tumble-dried to soften, it’ll carry a higher carbon footprint (165g of CO2e per nappy) than a disposable (130g per nappy).
The lowest carbon option is reusable nappies washed at 60 degrees, line dried, and passed on to a second child (60g CO2e per nappy).
Up to 20 per cent of the carbon footprint of a disposable nappy arises from the methane it emits as it rots down in landfill.
Biodegradable disposable nappies break down more rapidly in landfill so give off more of the gas.
WINE BOXES OVER BOTTLES
The bottle usually has a bigger footprint than the wine. Shipping is only a small part, so it doesn’t matter much where your wine comes from.
Far more important are the road miles — in your country and the country of origin.
For this reason, locally produced wine could cut the footprint by 20 per cent (1.3kg CO2e a bottle from Britain or France) and, oddly, I estimate Australian wine shipped to the UK (in huge sealed tanks) probably has a slightly lower footprint (at 1.4kg) than Sicilian transported in bottles by road (1.65kg).
By buying wine boxes or cartons you can reduce the footprint by a factor of about five.
EAT FROZEN BERRIES WHEN IT’S COLD
Fresh strawberries flown in from South Africa in winter or those grown in a hothouse come with an eye-wateringly high carbon cost of 3.65kg CO2e for a 250g punnet.
Far better to eat UK strawberries in summer. Or opt for frozen British berries (770g CO2e for 250g) which are super-nutritious and easier than fresh fruit to eat without wastage, as you can take just what is needed from the freezer.
NEVER, EVER FLY BUSINESS CLASS
Flying, particularly long haul, is bad for the planet. Emissions from airborne planes have a greater impact on greenhouse gases than those burning the same amount of fuel on the ground. A business class seat, as it takes up more room, has a greater percentage of the flight’s total carbon footprint. A single flight is equivalent to using 340,000 plastic bags.
If you do fly, choose economy. Go abroad less often, stay away for longer and only fly to do something you can’t do here in the UK.
RATION BATHS AND TIME YOUR SHOWERS
abandon a daily bath, folks — just have one a week. A quick dip can be anything from 500g to 1.5kg of CO2e depending on your heating system.
Far better to have a quick, daily shower. Five minutes is 160g to 250g of CO2e (depending on your hot water system). You could treat yourself to 15 minutes under a power shower for the 1kg of CO2e you generate running a hot bath.
ONE TAP THAT YOU SHOULD TURN ON
At 400g of CO2e per litre, bottled water is 1,000 times more carbon intense than tap water, so it really pays to ditch the plastic bottles.
The carbon emissions come mainly from packaging and transport, but add 83g CO2e per litre for the plastic, and 20g CO2e to melt the plastic pellets and mould them into bottles.
Transport is also significant because water is so heavy.
SWAP YOUR CAR FOR THE TRAIN 
Trains are generally a lot greener than cars, though a good petrol car can beat a train’s carbon footprint if the car is full of people. Even two people travelling together are better off driving an efficient car than travelling first class by train.
The carbon cost of a train trip depends on how fast it goes (air resistance increases with speed), how many stops there are (each stop wastes energy) and type of fuel used (electricity beats diesel).
Travelling by an Underground train is lower-carbon per passenger mile than an intercity train (68g of CO2e) — mainly because people are packed in so tightly.
YOU MUST EAT YOUR (SOURDOUGH) CRUSTS
Homemade sourdough or locally baked artisan loaf has a smaller carbon footprint than mass-produced sliced bread (630g of CO2e per loaf compared to 1kg of CO2e for mass-produced).
More than 60 per cent of the emissions of all bread production comes from the wheat cultivation (and most of that is the fertilizer used). A third comes from the milling and baking.
Transport is a tiny fraction if bought locally. Buy only what you need and always eat the crusts! Food waste thrown into landfill is very bad news.
Rice, unlike bread, is a surprisingly high-carbon staple (at 4kg to 7.1kg of CO2e per kg depending on planting practices).
This is due to the methane that bubbles out of the flooded paddy fields and the carbon-excessive nitrogen fertilisers that are often applied. This means a kilo of rice can cause more emissions than burning a litre of diesel.

1629,"THE NOTION that the modern economy lacks “good jobs” is as uncontroversial as saying that Lionel Messi is good at football. Pundits decry the disappearance of the steady positions of yesteryear, where people did a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay. “Where have all the good jobs gone?”, wonders one recent book, while another talks about “the rise of polarised and precarious employment systems”. President Joe Biden takes after Donald Trump in promising to bring good jobs “back”. But what if the whole debate rests on shaky foundations?
It certainly lacks historical awareness. Compare the current discussion with the one during America’s postwar boom. Few people back then believed that they were living in a golden age of labour. Commentators were instead full of angst, worrying about the “blue-collar blues”. They said that unionised factory jobs—the very sort that today’s politicians yearn to restore—consisted of repetitive, dangerous work which involved all brawn and no brain. Others fretted over pay. Workers “are getting increasingly frustrated by a system they think is not giving them a satisfactory return for their labours”, proclaimed a high-ranking official at America’s Department of Labour in 1970.

In fact the notion that the world of work is in decay is as old as capitalism itself. Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, a Swiss writer who inspired Karl Marx, said that factories would turn people into drones. John Stuart Mill worried in the mid-19th century that the rise of capitalism would provoke social decay. People would focus on nothing other than earning money, he feared, turning them into dullards (just look at Americans, he warned). The rise of big business and white-collar work in America provoked a new set of anxieties. It was soon predicted that the self-made men of yore would be replaced by effete company drones who did what they were told.
This is not the only reason to question today’s pessimistic narrative. By any reasonable standard work is better today than it was. Pay is higher, working hours are shorter and industrial accidents rarer.
It is harder to tell whether workers enjoy their work more than they did. Gallup, a pollster, has kindly supplied Bartleby with a smattering of job-satisfaction surveys from the 1960s and 1970s. Certainly there is little to suggest that workers back then were any happier than they are today. More comparable data, also from Gallup, from the early 1990s onwards show gradually improving job satisfaction. Last year 56% of American employees said they were “completely” satisfied with their job, an all-time high. A growing “precariat” of insecure workers gets a lot of headlines. But 90% of American employees said in 2020 that they were completely or somewhat satisfied with their job security, up from 79% in 1993.
If the jobs-are-bad narrative falls down on the facts, why is it so pervasive—and so intuitive? Partly it is because no one has bothered to look at the evidence. Other observers just don’t like the constant change and churn which has always been part and parcel of capitalism. More still may subscribe, perhaps subconsciously, to what Friedrich Hayek, a philosopher, called an “atavistic” view of markets. The very notion that people must sell their labour, for cash, in order to survive may violate some deeply held notion that humans are a fundamentally co-operative species, rather than a competitive one.
Yet perhaps the most important reason is that people dislike acknowledging trade-offs. Mill seemed unable to square his concern about the stultifying effects of capitalism with his argument that the division of labour had massively increased living standards. People often make similar errors today. The decline of trade unions may have hurt some workers’ wages; but it is less commonly acknowledged that this has also made it easier for less “traditional” workers, such as ethnic minorities and women, to enter the labour market. Sedentary office jobs can make people fat; but people are far less likely to die on the job than they once were.
A relentless focus on the problems of labour markets still has its uses. It encourages people to think about how to make improvements. The evidence suggests that on average managers have got better in recent years but clearly some firms have a long way to go. Many people are still exploited by their employers. Today’s world of work is far better than its critics would like to admit. But there is every reason to try to make it better still.

1630,"ON OCTOBER 21ST a consortium led by Lockheed Martin, one of America’s biggest aerospace companies, announced plans to build a permanently crewed commercial space station called Starlab, and launch it into orbit around Earth by 2027. Not to be outdone, on the 25th, Blue Origin, a firm that is Jeff Bezos’s ticket into space, unveiled plans for a yet more ambitious effort. Orbital Reef, pictured above as an artist’s impression, is a joint venture with (among others) Lockheed’s competitor Boeing. It will host up to ten people and will serve, as Blue Origin put it, as a “mixed-use business park”. The hope is that this orbiting industrial estate will open by the end of the decade.
Private-enterprise missions to orbit are not new. Mr Bezos’s rival Elon Musk, for example, has been offering them, via his rocketry firm SpaceX, for several years. But these two projects, if they succeed, will be on a far grander scale. Eye-catching though they are, however, they are not alone. Several other firms, egged on in some cases by NASA, that country’s space agency, have similar ideas. The firms’ owners hope to make money. NASA hopes to save America’s amour propre. And, acting together, these motives seem likely, some time this decade, to result in the first real settlement of outer space by private enterprise.

The men in the high castles
The underlying reason for all this activity is the imminent death of the International Space Station (ISS). This intergovernmental but American-dominated effort, the first elements of which were launched in 1998, was designed to last about 15 years, so is already past its sell-by date. Cracks and air leaks have multiplied. And, on September 9th, the smell of smouldering plastic wafted through it, though no open flames broke out.
NASA believes that, with upgrades, the ISS can limp on until 2028, or perhaps a bit longer. But either way, it will not be long until thrusters on the most expensive object ever made push the whole caboodle to fiery doom over the Pacific Ocean. No other intergovernmental habitat will supersede it. But NASA is encouraging commercial replacements instead.
The agency’s plan is to pay the firms behind these replacements for services rendered, such as hosting astronauts or conducting research in the microgravity that the perpetual freefall of orbit offers. That, says Phil McAlister, a senior space-flight official at the agency, may save NASA as much as $1.5bn a year. But Mr McAlister also claims that commercial opportunities in orbit are now so abundant that industry should be able to support much of the cost of private space stations, even without government contracts.
NASA calls its side of this enterprise the Commercial Low-Earth-Orbit Destinations (CLD) project. Last year it awarded $140m to Axiom Space, a firm in Houston that is already manufacturing such a station. It will soon hand out a further $400m to two, three or possibly four of a dozen other firms which hope to enter the market. Officials at the agency are privately thrilled with the unexpectedly high number of bids they have received for a share of this money. But they are not commenting publicly about the competition until the winners are announced later this year.
Of Axiom’s project, the first module will, if all goes to plan, be launched in September 2024 and will dock at one of the ISS’s two ports. It will be joined, six and 12 months later, by a second and a third module. After a fourth and final module, equipped to generate extra solar power, arrives in 2027, Axiom Station, as the whole assembly will be known, will detach and become a “free flyer” with nearly double the usable volume of the ISS.
The cost of doing all this will be about $3bn, says Matt Ondler, Axiom’s top technologist. Though no trifle, that is but a small fraction of what the ISS has cost. Every year, NASA spends roughly $3.5bn merely to maintain and operate the station. And that covers only about three-quarters of the cost of doing so. The rest is provided by Canada, Japan, Russia and participating European countries.
Axiom’s lower budget is partly explained by elimination of the waste common in government spending. But the firm is also harnessing lessons from the ISS to cut costs for things that range from blocking radiation, via recycling urine to recovering water from rubbish. Beyond that, much kit is cheaper and better now than when the ISS was designed in the 1990s. Today’s solar panels generate, kilo for kilo, six times more power. And lots of the components developed for smartphones and cars will be used in Axiom Station. Mr Ondler reckons it will cost, per unit of capability, about a hundredth of the bill for the ISS.
Axiom’s competitors, for their part, have kept quiet about their stations’ expected costs, but all the firms envisage a range of ways to make money. Hosting astronauts, tourists and even marketing campaigns will be one source of revenue. Servicing and refuelling satellites could be another. Many people also believe there will be demand for pharmaceutical and biotechnological work in microgravity, including the 3D-printing of human organs for transplantation and the development of stem-cell therapies.
On Earth, gravity means that cells printed onto scaffolds intended to create structures that are the same shape as natural organs have to be suspended in a viscous gel, to stop them dripping off the scaffold. This means high pressure is required to force them through the nozzle of the printer that sprays them onto the scaffold, a process that damages a fair number of those cells. In orbit, though, nothing drips, so the gel is no longer needed. Cell cultures, meanwhile, benefit from microgravity because their components remain in suspension in their nutrient fluids, rather than tending to settle out, as happens in Earthbound fermentation tanks.
The firms also plan to host microgravity manufacturing. Axiom, for example, says one of its potential customers thinks it can produce better eyesight-restoring retinal implants in space than on Earth. Other firms with which it is in talks hope to harness freefall to make purer fibre optics for lasers and, more challengingly, to forge stronger alloys for things like jet turbines.
At first blush, all this sounds a bit like sci-fi. But the technology to achieve it exists. For one thing, robots operating in freefall can achieve extraordinary precision. As Christian Maender, head of “in-space” manufacturing at Axiom, puts it, “they need not fight the weight of their own systems”. Launch costs have fallen sharply too, especially since NASA gave privatisation a shot in the arm by ending its staggeringly expensive Space Shuttle programme in 2011. Mr Maender reckons the next decade will see them halved again. Investors, for their part, are enthused. Axiom says it has had to turn some away.
Who knows if the Moon’s a balloon?
Part of Blue Origin’s Orbital Reef is to be provided by Sierra Space, a division of an aerospace firm called Sierra Nevada Corporation which already had a separate project to make a space station out of big, inflatable bladders. Once ejected into space from a rocket’s fairing, such a bladder will expand into a habitat 11 metres long and with a diameter of eight metres, somewhat resembling a cylindrical paper lantern.
To stop its modules being punctured by bits of high-velocity orbiting debris and cosmic dust, Sierra has designed shielding that incorporates layers of Kevlar and Vectran—fabrics used in things like bulletproof jackets and the airbags that cushion the fall of spacecraft dropped onto Mars. The outer layers will break up these incoming objects. The smaller, and therefore less energetic, fragments that result will then be stopped by the underlying layers.
Sierra’s modules will be fitted out, by astronaut handymen and women, with a rigid internal structure that incorporates avionics and control interfaces. Crew quarters, galley, toilet and facilities for research, manufacturing and satellite-servicing can be installed as required (see picture below, of a ground-based mock-up). Connected together, three of these modules will provide nearly as much pressurised volume as does the ISS.

The ISS, however, took about 40 launches to assemble. Sierra reckons it can loft and equip three modules with just eight or nine launches. The firm plans to shuttle goods and crew between Earth and its orbital facilities using a spaceplane called Dream Chaser that it is developing. (Orbital Reef is to be supplied by Boeing’s Starliner capsule, but Dream Chaser might pitch in for that job, too.) Dream Chaser will be able to land on any long airport runway. That, Sierra hopes, will provide a competitive edge for the manufacture of fragile, urgently needed goods, not to mention providing a comfortable and convenient ride for rich space tourists.
Sierra’s plan is for Dream Chaser to make its much-delayed maiden flight next year, and to have its station operating in 2027, so that its “anchor” tenant, NASA, can move in before the ISS’s demise. Others, it hopes, will follow. Earlier this year, for example, the firm said it was working with Redwire Space, a company that is also part of the Orbital Reef project, and which has been using the ISS to test processes intended to manufacture speciality ceramics, crystals and fibre optics.
The second phase of NASA’s CLD plan is to award, in about 2025, big contracts for specific orbital services. The agency hopes that by the middle of the decade at least two companies will be far enough along to secure such contracts, and to begin offering services in orbit shortly thereafter. When the time comes to abandon the ISS, the agency is keen not to be left in the lurch with no human-suitable habitat in orbit around Earth. Experts caution, though, that the ageing space station might not make it to 2028. Some Russian officials, noting spreading cracks and other signs of senescence, have proposed that their country jump ship by 2025.
It could, therefore, get dicey. If no American firm is operating a space station by the time the ISS is abandoned, America’s leadership in space may suffer. To make matters worse from an American point of view, China’s new and expanding space station, Tiangong, could become fully operational next year. Todd Harrison, a space and defence expert at CSIS, an American think-tank, says China’s goal of signing up international partners for Tiangong involves “actively courting” America’s European allies. Were America to find itself bereft of a space station, Britain, France or Germany might, he reckons, join Tiangong.
That seems a stretch, diplomatically speaking, especially given other collaborations between NASA and Europe’s spacefaring powers. But even the raising of such ideas shows that times are changing. Prognosticators would, however, be wise to factor in the ambition and ingenuity of America’s aerospace industry. For an inkling of what might be achieved consider Nanoracks, a company based near Houston that is one of Lockheed Martin’s Starlab partners. In addition to Starlab, Nanoracks is at work on a completely different type of space station that is both more basic and more technologically challenging. This involves converting, in orbit, discarded rocket stages into stations it calls outposts.
The lathes of heaven
The idea of converting rocket stages harks back to Skylab, America’s first space station, which was built, on the ground, out of the third stage of a surplus Saturn V rocket. In this case, though, the conversion will be of the upper stage of one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9s, or a similar rocket, and will be done in space by a small robot affixed to the stage in question.
After the stage achieves orbit, the robot will cut metal and assemble parts to create a docking port, windows and other fixtures. When Jeffrey Manber, Nanoracks’ boss, pitched the idea a half decade ago, he says, “my company laughed at me”. NASA, however, was intrigued. The agency paid for a study on the feasibility of using a robot to convert the upper stage of an Atlas V. The results were promising.
NASA has therefore coughed up more than $12m for a test aloft, planned for January. If all goes well, a robot will soften a sample of metal in orbit by generating frictional heat with a spinning tool, and will then cut that metal without, it is hoped, creating scraps that could become projectiles dangerous to other satellites. This has never yet been done in space. A camera will capture the action, which, for extra safety, will take place inside a containment vessel. A welding test will be launched later, says Robbie Harris, Nanoracks’ head of technology for outposts.
If Mr Manber’s proposal works, building private space stations could become (at least by the standards of space flight) cheap indeed. And the cheaper those stations get, the more uses they may be put to. Orbiting greenhouses intended to develop hardy crops are one idea. Biopharmaceutical laboratories are another. A third, for the truly adventurous, is honeymoon hotels in space. How that will work out in practice remains to be seen. The accommodation will be cramped, for sure, and the champagne may have an unnerving tendency to float out of its glasses. But there is no question that, viewed from out of the porthole at least, the Earth will be moving. ■",2
1631,"“THERE WAS a lot of blood all over the place,” remembers Patricia, her voice cracking. She survived the night in 1990 when government soldiers shot and chopped to death about 600 civilians who had been sheltering from Liberia’s civil war in the Lutheran Church in Monrovia, the capital. “We saw the pregnant women, their stomachs open, the children on their mother, sucking, crying.”
Today, not far from the bullet-scarred church, gold letters on the Temple of Justice declare: “Let Justice Be Done To All”. Yet not a single person has been convicted in Liberia for the massacre—or for any war crimes committed during the back-to-back civil wars between 1989 and 2003, in which about 250,000 people were killed.

Much has changed since the conflict ended. Clinics and schools have sprung up, tarred roads hum with traffic and, above all, peace has endured. Yet Afrobarometer, a pollster, found that in 2018 half the population had paid a bribe in the previous year. Rapes of women and children are all too common. So are murders. Two sons of former presidents have been killed since September. Some human-rights activists blame a culture of impunity that dates back to the wars.
Impunity is not hard to spot. Prince Johnson, an influential senator, is a former warlord who, in a video available on YouTube, can be seen drinking a Budweiser beer and barking instructions as his men cut off the ear of a former president, Samuel Doe, in 1990. Mr Johnson, who has admitted that his men killed Doe, has declined to comment beyond saying, “There is no need to dwell in the past.”
George Boley, a congressman, is another former rebel leader who was deported from America because of allegations that his men had burned captives alive and raped villagers before slitting their throats. Charles Taylor, a warlord and former president, was convicted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for atrocities in neighbouring Sierra Leone’s civil war. He is now in prison in Britain. But he has never faced justice for his alleged crimes in Liberia itself.
In 2009 the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) recommended that some of the most violent warlords face trial. But that recommendation was not acted upon by the government of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was then president. Activists and politicians, including Rustonlyn Dennis, a congresswoman, are trying to revive the idea, through protest and by proposing draft legislation. “This country will never go forward if people don’t take responsibility,” says Ms Dennis. Others say a court is needed to deter people from taking up arms again. “In absence of punishment there will not be peace,” says Dempster Brown of Liberia’s Independent National Human Rights Commission.
Yet not everyone favours trials. Sam Walker of Liberia Peace and Reconciliation Forum, a group opposing the tribunal, says it would be a “witch hunt” and even claims it could renew conflict. He prefers alternatives, such as getting victims and perpetrators to talk. Others worry about the price tag, given that Sierra Leone’s special court cost about $300m. “What do we prioritise?” asks Meo Beyan, the assistant minister of justice, listing pressing needs such as jobs, education and health care.
Still, many suspect President George Weah’s own worries are the real barrier. His run for president in 2017 was backed by Mr Johnson, whose support Mr Weah is thought to want in the next election, in 2023. In 2019 he tried to kick the question of a tribunal to the Senate, which advised against “reopening old wounds”.
Though the government drags its feet, a tribunal has some odd supporters. Joshua Blahyi (pictured), known as General Butt Naked, led a group of drugged child soldiers who often fought wearing nothing but sneakers and charms. He told the TRC he was responsible for the deaths of 20,000 people. Today he claims to be a repentant Christian and, despite his documented history of almost incomprehensible violence, is entirely at liberty. Is he in favour of a war-crimes court, even if it might jail him for the rest of his life? “Definitely,” he says. “It’s Liberia’s only hope.” ■",2
1632,"MIHIR, A 25-YEAR-OLD who lives near the Indian city of Durgapur, has big plans. They all depend on coal. Every day, he rides his bicycle around collieries and depots gathering sacks of coal slipped to him by conniving workers or security guards. Once he has stacked the bike with as much as it can carry he pedals off to a brickworks or a small forge and sells all ten or 11 sacks. After the necessary bribes and kickbacks have been paid, Mihir makes enough not only to keep him, his mother and sister clothed and fed, but also to save for a motorbike. That will allow him to double the scale of his operation, which should provide enough money to build a second storey on the family’s tiny house. When that is done he will be able to propose to his sweetheart.
Durgapur’s coal deposits first came to commercial attention in the 1770s, the decade in which James Watt revolutionised the steam engine. In the 19th century, developed in part by the grandfather of Rabindranath Tagore, India’s most famous poet, they provided the fuel for the subcontinent’s growing railway network and its steamships. After independence Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, ordered a huge steel mill to be built in the city to make use of them.

Even now nobody in Durgapur can imagine life without coal. Few have heard of climate change. Those who have assume that it is someone else’s problem. To Mihir, the very idea that the government might one day impose restrictions on coal is absurd. “Why on earth would they do that?” he asks. After all, the racket in which he plays the tiniest of parts is a big source of funds for political parties, he says. Very important people have a big stake in keeping it going. According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, a national law-enforcement agency, they include the government of West Bengal state. Bijan, a former maintenance worker at a mine in Durgapur who is now an environmental activist, sighs, “It is difficult to understand how coal-mining can be reduced, let alone stopped. You need a complete paradigm shift for that.”
Asia (including Australia) produces and consumes three-quarters of the world’s coal. Roughly half of China’s electricity comes from it. For India the figure is three-quarters. Of the 1,002 coal-fired plants planned or under construction around the world, fully 865 are in Asia and the Pacific, according to Global Energy Monitor, a watchdog group. Asia also produces most of the world’s cement and steel, activities which release copious quantities of greenhouse gases. And as its people get richer, they buy more cars and take more flights.

In 1990 the Asia-Pacific region’s burning of fossil fuels produced six gigatonnes of CO2, according to the IEA, representing about a quarter of the world total. In 2020 Asia emitted 16.5Gt, or 49%. The IEA reckons that under national governments’ stated climate policies the total will grow by about 9% by 2030 before falling back to 95% of today’s level in 2050. That is a larger climb than in the rest of the world bar Africa, and a smaller long-term cut.
Asian governments, like those elsewhere, have pledged to do better. In 2020, with the world watching, Xi Jinping, China’s president, told the UN general assembly that his country’s NDC for Glasgow would commit it to net-zero emissions by 2060. Japan and South Korea, perhaps embarrassed to be beaten to the punch by China, both promised shortly afterwards to reach net-zero by 2050. Poorer countries are getting in on the act, too. Indonesia has matched China’s pledge. The Maldives, a strong proponent of “one point five to stay alive”, has offered to reach net-zero by 2030, which is quicker than most rich countries.
In theory such cuts are perfectly plausible for Asia, just as they are elsewhere. Chinese and Indian academics and activists have sketched out plans to bring emissions in those countries down to zero over 40 or 50 years. In late 2020, for example, 19 Chinese research institutes published a potential path to eliminating their country’s net emissions completely by 2060. It foresees power generation being emission-free by 2050, with renewables and nuclear plants supplanting coal and gas. After that, negative emissions, provided in this case by power stations burning new-grown biomass and sequestering the CO2 produced underground, as well as a reforestation scheme, would offset residual emissions.
Lauri Myllyvirta of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, an independent research group, calculates that, to stick to the Chinese academics’ plan, China would need to build four times the 770 gigawatts (Gw) of solar capacity that the world can muster today and three times the world’s current 743Gw of wind power. But that is not inconceivable; massive investment is something that China does. For renewables, what is needed is less than a doubling of the current rate of deployment, undertaken when costs are low and still falling. For nuclear it would be more than a doubling of what is already the world’s fastest expansion, though the trend in costs is not so encouraging. But given how many other industries have ballooned in China, and that the country has assured access to many of the strategic minerals required, it is not so far-fetched.
Similar paths can be mapped for India, though the country has yet to set a net-zero target or commit to a point at which it expects emissions to peak. Earlier this year Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a retired Indian civil servant, published a plan to eliminate emissions by 2070. It concluded that a $15 per tonne carbon tax would be sufficient to stop the use of coal for power generation by 2060. Mr Myllyvirta argues that, although investment in renewables would have to expand dramatically, as in China, this is not impossible. India built six times more renewable generation capacity from 2016 to 2020 than from 2011 to 2015. If renewable installations grow as fast over the next five years, they will reach the sort of annual additions needed to displace coal, Mr Myllyvirta says.
There are two problems with this. One is that even these remarkable ambitions will not produce a trajectory which meets the Paris goals. In a global-net-zero-emissions-by-2070 scenario, which the IEA says should keep warming below 2ºC, Asian emissions in 2050 need to be a fifth of those now predicted on the basis of current policies, and a third of those predicted on the basis of announced pledges. Even with net-zero pledges from most big Asian economies bar India, a serious shortfall remains.
Between cup and lip
The second is that technical feasibility is not the same as political palatability. There is little popular pressure on Asian governments to act, even when it seems in their clear interest. Earlier this year, when a ferocious storm struck Zhengzhou, a city in central China, causing severe flooding, there was almost no commentary among Chinese netizens about the link to global warming—this despite the city’s much-ballyhooed retrofitting to absorb more rainwater on the assumption that climate change meant more severe storms. Whether the muted reaction was because censors deterred such talk or because people simply did not make the connection is hard to say. Either way, the government does not face a clamour to do more to cut emissions—though that could change.
In Asia’s democracies, too, climate change is not so far a big part of political debate. Even though Bangladesh is one of the countries most obviously and dangerously exposed to rising sea levels and worse storms, ordinary Bangladeshis assume that averting catastrophic climate change is the responsibility of people far away, notes Saleemul Huq of the International Centre for Climate and Development, an NGO. Farmers and fishermen know that climate change is harmful, he says, and would like their government’s help, but they are unlikely to see a link with the construction of new power plants.
The state of West Bengal, where Durgapur is to be found, lies just across the border with Bangladesh and is as vulnerable to storms and rising seas. Yet a fiercely fought election earlier this year barely featured climate change. Even more than in rich countries, elections in poorer ones hinge not on policy pledges, but on the size of the competing bungs that candidates promise to voters.
When Asian governments do promise policy change, they often lack the administrative capacity to enforce it. The conversion of virgin jungle and peat forest to palm-oil plantations, a big source of emissions in Indonesia, has been banned since 2011. In 2019 Greenpeace, an environmental group, claimed that deforestation had actually accelerated since the ban. In federal countries such as India, states are not even theoretically obliged to follow many edicts from the centre.
Resistance to change largely reflects vested interests. The miners of Durgapur are among 700,000 Indians whose job is wresting coal from the ground. But the seam of jobs and profits derived from coal goes far deeper. Many of the country’s coal-fired power plants are privately owned. They sell power to the grid under lucrative take-or-pay contracts. The railways earn almost half their freight revenue by hauling coal around. That income, in turn, subsidises the 8bn or so passenger trips taken each year. The railways are state-owned, as are many mines. And the coal industry is concentrated in a few relatively poor states, which would suffer disproportionately from any attempts to stifle it. So legions of workers, investors, politicians, bureaucrats and even rail passengers can be counted on to lobby for coal. Similar stories can be told of logging in Indonesia, cement-making in China and other emissions-belching industries around Asia.
Yet there are also countervailing forces. In many cases, the most pressing reason for pushing back against polluting industries is not climate, but clean air. Although CO2 is the most important product of fossil-fuel and biomass burning in climate terms, more tangible pollutants such as soot and sulphate particles do more immediate damage to health, costing millions of lives. Indonesia wants to stop deforestation partly because the fires that are used to clear land for palm plantations shroud the country in acrid smoke for half the year, upsetting urbanites and infuriating neighbouring countries. Air pollution riles city-dwellers in India, which has some of the dirtiest cities in the world, and China, where it has prompted the closure of a number of coal-fired power plants in urban areas.
Asian greens
Asian leaders are now vying to burnish their reputations with greenery. Sheikh Hasina, prime minister of Bangladesh, has become a spokeswoman for poor countries at risk from climate change (a stateswomanlike stance helps deflect foreign criticism of her autocratic nature). Nor was it by chance that Mr Xi’s NDC announcement at the UN came when America had made no comparable commitment. Appearing resolute on climate change allows China to show up its rival and assert the superiority of its political and economic system.
Cutting domestic CO2 emissions also fits with Chinese leaders’ plans for their economy. For 15 years policymakers have been trying to reduce the country’s dependence on massive, debt-fuelled investment in heavy industry, and the switch to cleaner energy will reinforce that shift. And encouraging emissions to fall elsewhere also provides an economic fillip. China is already the world’s biggest producer of solar panels and electric vehicles. It aspires to dominate other green technologies, too, including nuclear power.
Another point is that big Western development agencies have stopped lending to coal plants, as have many rich-world banks. At this year’s UN general assembly Mr Xi announced that China would follow suit, removing all new coal projects from its Belt and Road Initiative. Scarcer finance is driving up the cost of building coal-fired plants. At an auction in India in November 2020, developers offered to sell output from as-yet-unbuilt solar farms for two rupees ($0.03) a kilowatt-hour, not just cheaper than new coal but less than the cost of electricity from many already built and debt-free coal plants. Such arithmetic is altering planners’ ideas about the future even in the absence of ambitious emissions targets. The Vietnamese government’s latest long-term outlook for power generation cuts the expected power needed from new coal plants this decade by half. And those projections were made before the recent global spike in coal prices.
The direction of change seems clear, but vested interests (which include those of millions like Mihir whose lives are mixed up in fossil fuels purely through force of circumstance) look likely to slow it down. To fight that slowing effect will take money that many countries do not have. India’s state-owned power-distribution firms, for example, which need to invest heavily in improved transmission and storage if the renewables boom is to go as far as it should, are already saddled with around $70bn in debt. State-owned banks, their biggest creditors, are mired in non-performing loans. Privatisation, which might be part of the solution, has never enjoyed broad political support.
The pandemic has pushed up public debt across Asia. It has also highlighted pressing needs in public health and education. That makes it a difficult time to steer a vastly bigger share of public investment towards climate stabilisation and an opportune moment to renew calls for outside help, often couched in terms of “climate justice”. In Asia as elsewhere, those at greatest direct risk from climate change are mostly poor folk in the tropics and subtropics. These people have in the past been responsible for very few CO2 emissions. What is more, their poverty can be attributed in part to the lack of development allowed their forebears compared with that enjoyed by the ancestors of people in economies which grew rapidly through exploiting fossil fuels.
This, the argument runs, imposes a moral burden on those living in countries which were first enriched by fossil fuels, and then imposed the power that development created on almost all the other countries, in Asia and elsewhere, now trying to develop.
The need to maintain a clear path for development has been central to the approach which poorer countries have taken to climate diplomacy since before Rio. So has the idea that rich countries bear particularly onerous obligations. It is enshrined in a phrase from the UNFCCC which is endlessly, and often angrily, cited at all COP summits: that countries of the world should participate in the effort to stabilise the climate “on the basis of their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities”. And though the term climate justice does not appear in the main part of the Paris agreement (it is relegated to the preamble, which “[notes] the importance for some of the concept of ‘climate justice’ ”), the phrase “common but differentiated responsibility” turns up repeatedly. The way developing countries interpret this is clear in Asian NDCs, which explicitly say that more cuts will be forthcoming if more assistance is given.

Thus Indonesia’s government promises an emissions cut of 41% by 2030 if it gets enough outside support, but only 29% if it has to go it alone. The Philippines takes the logic to its furthest extreme, saying that it will cut emissions by 75% by 2030 if it is showered with cash. If it pays its own way the cut will be just 3%.
Rich countries will ﬁnd lots of reasons to push back at what can seem, and to some extent is, straight extortion. Some of their citizens already chafe at expenditure on climate action at home; subsidising it abroad is even worse. And there are rarely if ever adequate mechanisms for ensuring that the help will actually produce the promised cuts.
For all but the biggest economies, however, cutting emissions at home makes no appreciable difference at all unless they fall elsewhere, too. The cuts that are necessary in Asia are enormous; according to the IEA, the pledges announced in the region’s NDCs foresee a fall in the region’s annual CO2 emissions of 9bn tonnes between 2030 and 2050, a 20-year change which outweighs the total emissions of North America and Europe combined. If such a cut does not happen, the best eﬀorts of the rest of the world will not achieve anything like enough. Rich countries can do a lot by accelerating the rate at which new emission-cutting technologies are developed. But if they do not find some way to make the deployment of technologies both old and new more affordable far beyond their borders they will not see those technologies deployed as fast as they need to be.
One way to look at the problem, which has long been popular with Indian climate negotiators, is through carbon budgets. To a close approximation the level at which carbon dioxide will peak, and thus the amount of anthropogenic warming the world will undergo, depends on the total amount dumped in the atmosphere. According to the latest IPCC report, a 50% chance of keeping temperatures below 2°C requires keeping total emissions below 3.7trn tonnes. The report also reckons that, all told, 2.4trn of those tonnes have already been emitted through industrialisation and deforestation, mostly to the benefit of the 1bn or so people who live in the rich world. This means that only 1.3trn tonnes of emissions are left in the 2°C budget for more than 6bn other people, 4bn or so of them Asian, who might reasonably aspire to reach similar standards of living, or to want them for their children.
That is why many Asian governments insist they need help to deliver the development their citizens require but at the same time transform the energy systems and industrial landscapes powering their economies. The alternative is to abandon the climate target or to abandon growth—both of which would have dire consequences that would be felt soonest, and in their greatest severity, in poorer countries.
Negative emissions have been introduced into climate policy in large part to offer a way around that lose-lose choice. They can be used, in effect, to expand the total carbon budget. Before turning to that possibility, though, it is worth looking at the argument, increasingly heard in some circles, that if developed countries could only agree to slow or even abandon growth they would, at least, maximise the remnant of the global carbon budget available to poor- and middle-income countries. This is often accompanied by the belief that were such restraint to be deemed impossible, it would demonstrate that capitalism and climate stability cannot coexist.
Those arguments are not remotely convincing to this newspaper. But they raise questions about the relationship between how an economy powers itself and the shape it takes. A principle of thermodynamics, the science of heat and work which 19th-century physicists developed to explain the steam engine among other things, was that all energy was fundamentally equivalent in its ability to do work. Investors in the 19th century knew that, in economic terms, the energy stored in coal was much more valuable than any other kind, and built their world accordingly.
High-level discussion of the energy transition that is needed for a fossil-fuel-free world tends to take the physicists’ view: watt is a watt is a watt. Watts associated with carbon emissions simply need to be replaced by watts that are not. Looking at the 19th-century Industrial Revolution that this 21st-century transition seeks to reverse, though, suggests that things may be a bit more complicated than this.■

1633," (CNN)With less than one month until the Army's deadline to vaccinate its active-duty force, the service will begin barring soldiers who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 without an exemption from reenlistment, promotions, and other ""favorable personnel actions.""In a memo dated November 16, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said soldiers who refuse the vaccine would be ""flagged,"" preventing them from ""reenlistment, reassignment, promotion, appearance before a semi-centralized promotion board, issuance of awards and decorations"" and more.The Navy and the Marine Corps issued similar guidance last month, paving the way for the discharge of service members who refuse to be vaccinated.Soldiers who have received an exemption or whose exemption request is pending will not be flagged.The guidance, which also applies to the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, was sent as the head of the Oklahoma National Guard finds himself in dispute with the Pentagon for refusing to enforce the vaccine mandate.The Army's deadline for all active-duty military members to get vaccinated is December 15 while National Guard soldiers are required to be vaccinated by June 30, 2022. Soldiers, including Reserve and Guard, can be flagged even before these deadlines for refusing the vaccine.""The Soldier will remain flagged until they are fully vaccinated, receive an approved medical or administrative exemption, or are separated from the Army,"" Wormuth wrote.A soldier is flagged on the date they make a ""final declination"" to be immunized after meeting with a medical professional and receiving a second order from a commander to get the Covid-19 vaccine.Flagged soldiers will also be ineligible for tuition assistance, attending military or civilian schools, and being paid their enlistment bonuses.Though the Air Force hasn't issued specific guidance about reenlistments or promotions, Secretary Frank Kendall made it clear Thursday that airmen who refuse the vaccine will be discharged.""The bottom line is that willfully disobeying a lawful order is incompatible with military service and to get a vaccination is a lawful order,"" Kendall said in a Facebook event when asked about the vaccine mandate.Last month, the Navy made it clear that it will pursue discharge for any sailors who refuse vaccination without a pending or approved exemption. ""Commands shall not allow Sailors refusing the vaccine to promote or advance, reenlist, or execute orders with the exception of separation orders,"" the Navy said in a press release in October.Shortly thereafter, the Marine Corps followed suit, saying in its vaccination guidance that Marines refusing the Covid-19 vaccine without an exemption would be processed for administrative separation. ""A Marine who has not yet been fully vaccinated is not considered worldwide deployable and shall be assigned or reassigned, locally, to billets which account for health risks to the unvaccinated marine and those working in proximity to the Marine,"" the guidance said. ""Marines refusing the vaccine shall not reenlist or execute order, with the exception of separation orders.""Vaccination requirements for the military have led to a debate between the Pentagon and the commander of the Oklahoma National Guard over the chain of command in the military and the federal government's authority. Pentagon officials have said that all National Guard members are subject to military readiness requirements, including vaccines, even when they are not called up under federal authority. But Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino has argued that he answers to Oklahoma's Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt who ordered him not to enforce the Pentagon's vaccine mandate, The Washington Post reported. ",0
1634,"THE HUMAN brain may be the most complex object on Earth. It contains 85bn nerve cells and trillions of interconnections. As these cells process information, people experience consciousness and thought. The brain is made even more mysterious by the fact it is scrutable only when alive. To truly understand brains means examining them while they are functioning inside the body.
Few humans in their right mind would volunteer to plug today’s instruments and sensors into their living brains. Doing so often involves having someone drill into your skull, with the risk of infection or brain damage. And so neuroscientists seeking to understand human brains turn to humanity’s nearest animal relatives, primates.

This is controversial. Monkeys’ usefulness as a model for human neurology also raises the stakes of conducting experiments upon them: the better their brains serve as analogues for human ones, the more it follows that they probably suffer analogously, too. Animal-rights activists rightly point out that monkeys cannot consent to such treatment. It is unlikely they would acquiesce were they able to do so.
The controversy has had an uneven impact round the world. In Europe and America, under pressure from animal-rights groups, the amount of neuroscience research carried out on monkeys is flat or declining. Both places have or are considering laws requiring an end to their use. But as we explain this week, neuroscience research on monkeys is booming in China and Japan.
America and Europe should narrow this gap. Allowing China to forge ahead in brain science without mounting a comparable programme of research would be strategically foolish. A Chinese neuroscience laboratory in Shanghai has already attracted one of Germany’s leading researchers and his laboratory. As he and his colleagues work out new ways to gain access to and manipulate the brain, China will be the first to enjoy the fruits of that effort. To avoid depending on China for access to such knowledge, America and Europe need to take action now.
More knowledge of the brain is not always a force for good. Given the Chinese state’s official policy of military-civil fusion, there is probably little that can be done to stop the Chinese Communist Party obtaining the capability to build neuro-weapons on the basis of its brain-research programmes, should they bear fruit. But liberal societies should at least keep track of what is possible, and how it works, through research programmes under their own control.
And were laboratories in China and Japan to come up with treatments for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s as a result of their studies of monkeys’ brains, it would be near impossible for Western countries to refuse to buy them to treat their citizens. Leaving others to do the dirty work of generating knowledge using means you consider to be unethical, while at the same time encouraging it by adding to demand is not taking the moral high ground. It is hypocrisy. Better for Western countries to carry out the necessary but troubling research themselves, working to the standards they deem necessary.
Taking responsibility for the suffering they cause starts with maintaining America’s and Europe’s high-quality primate research. Keeping up with China’s expansion also makes sense. Neuroscientists should be braver in publicly defending their work. Governments must protect their ability to carry out legal research.
Some experiments on monkeys can be avoided by using computer simulations or by growing brain cells in Petri dishes. But the brain is so poorly understood at present that probing living ones will remain essential for some time. A radical alternative to the use of monkeys in neuroscience would be to rely instead on consenting humans. After all, people already join biomedical studies and they readily don non-invasive brain-scanning hardware.
Grey areas
Getting sensors inside the skull, next to human neurons, is still difficult. However, the tools used to probe brains are becoming smaller and less invasive. One day they may resemble an injectable, connected silicon dust more than an implantable electronic device. Such instruments would make the prospect of gaining informed consent from human subjects less daunting. But to get to that point, humans will have to rely on monkeys for some time. People do not yet understand their brains well enough to study themselves safely. ■",2
1635,"“IT IS ALWAYS darkest just before the day dawneth.” The greatest line in putting a brave face on adversity was penned by a colourful soldier-parson, Thomas Fuller, during the English Civil War. Four centuries later Joe Biden’s supporters in Washington, DC, can be heard muttering the same consolatory hope.
These are dark times for the Democratic president. Burdened by supply glitches and the resurgence of covid-19, the economy grew by just 2% over the summer. Mr Biden’s big ambitions to pass a first national climate policy and hugely expand the safety-net meanwhile ran into the congressional sand. Every Republican rejected his plans. That left Democratic senators needing to agree on them unanimously, and they could not. The bungled retreat from Afghanistan compounded these problems, triggering a slide in his approval ratings from which Mr Biden has not recovered. Only Donald Trump was more unpopular at this early stage in a presidential term.
Yet is this the nadir? Or is even worse in store for the Democratic president? Voters in Virginia and legislators in Washington, DC, may be about to offer some clues.

As one of the first states to go to the polls after a general election, Virginians have a long tradition of taking new presidents down a peg. Of the eight gubernatorial elections held in the state since 1989, the incumbent president’s party has lost seven. Democrats thought they had a fair chance of avoiding that fate on November 2nd. Virginia has moved to the left in recent years. Moreover, their candidate to be its next governor, Terry McAuliffe, was the only recent exception to its anti-incumbency record—in 2013, when he won a previous spell as the state’s governor while Barack Obama was in the White House. Yet opinion polls suggest his race against Glenn Youngkin, a self-funding private-equity boss, is too close to call. And the momentum appears to be with the Republican.
Given the state’s history, a loss for Mr McAuliffe was always likelier than Democrats thought. But it would be another bad blow for Mr Biden, not least as an indicator of where the wind is blowing ahead of next year’s mid-term elections. They also tend go against the president’s party. And the Democrats’ tiny congressional majorities mean that would mean them losing control of the Hill. Given the disloyalty of the Republican opposition, that in turn suggests Mr Biden’s tricky current opportunity to pass legislation may be the only one he gets. In politics, things can always get worse.
That is why the Democrats’ ongoing intraparty negotiation over his climate and social policies matters so much. The president and the Democratic congressional leaders—Chuck Schumer in the Senate and Nancy Pelosi in the House—had wanted to pass the fat budget bill they have squeezed the policies into by the end of October, ahead of Virginia’s elections and the COP-26 climate-change summit in Glasgow. That would also have enabled Mrs Pelosi to pass a bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill—authorising $579bn of new spending on roads and bridges and the like over five years—that House progressives have made hostage to progress on the budget bill. Instead, ahead of his departure for Europe and the COP, Mr Biden was able only to outline the much-reduced budget package his party seems able to agree on.
Only by comparison with the president’s opening bid—a $3.5trn smorgasbord of emissions reduction, free community college and myriad other schemes—could that outline agreement look modest. It would amount to about half as much spending, mostly paid for by increased taxes on businesses and a surcharge tax on the mega-rich. Yet by scrapping some of the relative luxuries in Mr Biden’s initial plans—such as free community college—and funding programmes such as child-tax credits for shorter periods than had been envisaged, Democratic leaders have kept most of his priorities. Even Senator Bernie Sanders, after weeks of griping at the couple of Democratic opponents of a more capacious budget bill, conceded that the end result could be “really quite consequential”.
Almost a third of the planned spending, around $555bn, would go on climate policies, including on expanded tax credits for renewable energy producers and consumers and a network of charging stations for electric vehicles. Another $400bn would be spent on providing free pre-school for all three- and four-year-olds and subsidising childcare for most American families. Lesser priorities, such as affordable housing and job-training programmes, have been drastically scaled down.
The most significant omissions from the outlined agreement are a national paid-leave plan (which America, uniquely among rich countries, lacks), a proposal to penalise utilities for failing to shift to renewables, and another to negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has strong political and business ties to the coal industry, objected to the first two. Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona nixed the third, but has negotiated a watered-down alternative with the White House which could yet make it into a final deal.
There is no reason to think Mr Biden’s hurried outline will help him much in Virginia or Glasgow. Indeed, for now it has triggered a new round of intra-Democratic recrimination and horse-trading, over drug-pricing and other loose ends. But the impression of chaos many have taken from this is exaggerated. With no margin for slippage, Mr Biden’s lawmaking is bound to be fraught, and could yet founder. But his party appears to be grudgingly behind the outlined agreement. The House progressives who blocked the bipartisan infrastructure bill have formally endorsed it. Mr Manchin and Ms Sinema have not; but given that they negotiated it, it seems likely that they will. Mr Schumer and Mrs Pelosi will try to get the outline written into a bill, and conceivably voted on, by the end of the week.
The signing of both infrastructure and budget bills into law would be a triumph for Mr Biden. He would then have produced three major pieces of legislation (following the passage of the $1.9trn covid-19 relief bill in March) in his first year. Taken together, they would not have produced the New Deal-style makeover Democrats were dreaming of. Mr Biden’s agenda would have plugged a lot of gaps and produced lasting change. But whether this success (which is not to be counted on) would constitute a new political dawn for the president is another matter.
Where the Republicans tend to disregard lawmaking, Democrats consistently exaggerate the importance voters attach to it. Approval ratings tend to be determined more by fundamental conditions—such as the state of the economy and public health—than the passing of tax credits. And the fundamentals are not in Mr Biden’s favour.

1636,"THE RESULT of Virginia’s race for governor on November 2nd will “set the tone” for next year’s mid-term elections. So said Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic governor of the state, as he launched a get-out-the-vote campaign last Friday. If so, the party is in trouble. President Joe Biden won the state by ten percentage points last year, but Mr McAuliffe is now polling just two points ahead of his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, according to a statistical model built by The Economist. That gap is small enough for Mr Youngkin to close at the last minute.

Our model aggregates publicly released polls and attempts several modest corrections to the underlying data. First, we remove any uniform biases from each polling firm. These may arise from methods of collecting or processing data—or, in rarer cases, from the ideological bent of the polling house. We then subtract any systematic differences between pollsters who try to ensure they have representative shares of Democrats, Republicans and independents and those who do no such weighting. This helps control for the tendency for non-party-weighted data to bounce around more than party-weighted polls; in some cases it also removes an extra layer of bias. Lastly, we use the model to fit a trend line through all the adjusted points. This method yielded a closer prediction for the recent recall election in California than most other public averages of polling data.

If the election were held today, our model suggests Mr McAuliffe would defeat Mr Youngkin by about two percentage points. That should not comfort the Democrats. Our model also finds plenty of uncertainty in the polling data: it gives the former governor only a roughly two-in-three (67%) chance of winning the race. Even a modest polling error could blow the aggregate off course. In 2017, when the state’s current Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, won the office, the polling average in Virginia underestimated his margin by six percentage points.
Win or lose, the tone the election sets for the mid-terms is likely to be bad for the Democrats. The party in the White House usually loses both the subsequent election for Virginia’s governor and seats in the national House and Senate elections the year after. And a close relationship exists between the swing against the incumbent party in those gubernatorial contests and in the House vote nationally. With Mr Biden’s net approval rating underwater and a trend against the Democrats in congressional generic-ballot polling, even a five- or six-point margin for Mr McAuliffe on November 2nd would portend defeat in the mid-terms.",2
1637,"It has not been seen on TV screens for nearly 20 years despite having been one of Britain's most watched programme and exported to half of the world's countries.
But now The Benny Hill Show - famous in the 1970s for the comedian's slapstick character chasing scantily-clad young women, but threatened by the 'cancel culture' of the modern age - has made a surprise comeback on a nostalgia channel.
The show, which consisted of short and often risqué comedy sketches, made Hill a huge star on first the BBC and then ITV, airing for four decades from 1955.
But Hill was dumped by broadcaster Thames in 1989 amid fears from executives that his raucous and racy sense of humour were seen by some as sexist and vulgar.
The rights to Hill's TV shows were controlled following his death in 1992 by his estate and Thames TV and had not been licensed to any UK broadcaster since then.
But a series of re-runs which began last night now form part of the festive schedule on Freeview channel That's TV Gold, renamed That's TV Christmas for the season.
The channel, also available on Sky and Freesat, launched under its new name at 9pm last night with a double bill of The Benny Hill Show - the first in a seven-week run.
TV specials from Kenny Everett, Mike Yarwood, Tommy Cooper and the Carry On team are also on the schedule, alongside rare repeats of prank show Beadle's About.
One series that is still a regular on TV screens at Christmas is Morecambe and Wise, but a new long-long episode is set to bring fans a treat this year.
The BBC are set to screen the old episode next month after it was found in an attic by Eric Morecambe's son Gary, 65, inside a film canister marked only with a BBC stamp.
It has only ever been shown once before more than 50 years ago on October 8, 1970 when it was watched by an audience of 14million.
But the 45-minute film has now been restored and colourised by BBC experts, and contains sketches with songs and music from Paul Anka, Patricia Lambert and Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen.
A BBC source told the Daily Mirror: 'We were so excited to hear that this episode, long considered lost, still exists. This should be a real Christmas treat for comedy fans. It's an absolute delight.'
Hill has been cited as one of the first victims of 'political correctness' when his slapstick gags and cross-dressing became uncomfortable viewing for some viewers nearly two decades ago.
At the time Thames pulled the plug, the comic had earned the company an estimated £100million and his final episode attracted 9.58million viewers. 
Hill was born 'Alfred Hall' in 1925 in Southampton and was remembered by his relatives and schoolfriends as the 'class clown'. 
He dropped out of school as a teenager and worked as a milkman before serving in the British Army during the Second World War as a mechanic with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
While the conflict continued, he enjoyed entertaining troops in variety shows and adopted his stage name, Benny Hill, in homage to comedian Jack Benny.
After the war, Hill performed in London music halls and got his break in TV after comparing a BBC entertainment show.
His programme aired from December 1962 to December 1968 on the BBC, and from December 1969 to May 1989 on ITV, before re-runs took place until 1992. 
At his height of his fame more Britons tuned in to watch Benny Hill than the moon landing and the comedian won his first of many awards in 1954 when voted TV Personality of the Year.
The Benny Hill Show received a total of 11 awards during his time with ITV and his shows were exported to more than 140 countries.
A string of modern comedians have hailed Hill's influence on them. TV star David Walliams previously said in 2017 he wished Hill was 'celebrated more on TV'.
Comedian Tim Vine from Not Going Out has claimed to have kept all his old Benny Hill VHS tapes, saying: 'I never tire of it, and I think he's hugely underrated.'
And the late Caroline Aherne, writer of sitcom The Royale Family, told a Channel 4 documentary in 1998: 'I loved Benny Hill so much'. 
And comedian Ben Miller of Armstrong and Miller fame said: 'His early work was ground-breaking. He is the most successful comedian on a world-wide stage that Britain has ever produced.' 
When Hill died, US actor Jack Lemmon said: 'In recent years my favourite comedian above all was Benny Hill, who was a master in his field. 
'Most comedians deliver a barrage of powder puffs; Benny gave you a cannon shot.'
Hill's health declined in the late 1980s and he died of coronary thrombosis aged 68 in in Teddington, South West London, two months after suffering a mild heart attack.
Kris Vaiksalu, That's TV Christmas head of programming, said: 'We are excited to have secured the rights to two of the biggest shows in British TV history, The Benny Hill Show and Beadle's About, for our seasonal rebrand this year.  
'These shows are part of our national cultural heritage. Watching age-old comedy is a national Christmas tradition but for two decades these particular favourites have been missing from the festivities.
'We all need some festive cheer following the past year. Our viewers have inundated us with requests to show Benny Hill and we're thrilled to be able to make this Christmas wish come true.'
He continued: 'But there are lots more crackers on That's TV Christmas. We've lined up a Christmas TV nostalgia-fest with some of the most famous names in TV and music from the past four decades.
'We aim to give our viewers a special Christmas time full of magical memories. You better watch out… because Benny Hill and Jeremy Beadle are back on your telly this Christmas!' 
Other shows in the coming weeks include Beadle's About, the hidden camera show presented by prankster Jeremy Beadle, which ran from 1986 for ten years. 
The Benny Hill Show is showing on That’s TV Christmas for seven weeks, available on Freeview channels 91 and 264, Sky channel 187 and Freesat channel 178 ",-2
1638,"EVERY SPRING, the Qingming festival brings families together for displays of respect and sorrow at the burial sites of their deceased relatives. Some travel a long way to reunite over the three-day holiday, which ended on April 5th. Among them this year were the Zhaos of Leyun, a village in the lush Daba mountains of Sichuan province in the south-west. For migrant parents like them, there are living relationships that cause quiet grief, too. When their daughter, Lin, was just one month old the couple left her with her grandmother to allow them to return to their factory jobs on the coast. That was six years ago. Since then, Lin has spent only about 30 days with her parents. To her, this holiday’s get-together was with virtual strangers.
There are about 31m people in China like Lin—children who have been left behind in their home towns or villages, usually in the care of relatives, while both of their parents work elsewhere. The largest wave of internal migration in history—involving about 300m people who have moved to cities over the past four decades—has battered many other families, too. In 2015 Unicef, the UN agency for children, estimated that more than one in three children in China, or close to 100m, had experienced the prolonged absence of at least one parent. In nine out of ten cases, the main reason was migration.

Another important cause has been China’s rigid system of household registration, known as hukou. Someone without hukou in the city where he or she lives is frequently denied access to local government-funded services, such as health care and schooling. Migrants therefore often have little choice but to leave children behind in their registered place of residence. Across China, many lives are racked by the pain this causes. At first Lin pined for her parents, says the girl’s 57-year-old grandmother, a bean farmer. Then her pleas grew fainter, until one day they stopped. Now Lin refuses to speak to her parents when they ring home. She shrinks from their attempts to hug her during their rare, fleeting visits back to Leyun.
In recent years concern has grown in China about the plight of such children. State media have reported on their sufferings, including the torment of those abandoned with no one to look after them (in 2010 there were at least 2m without carers). About six years ago huge public debate was triggered by two such stories. One involved four siblings in the south who killed themselves with pesticide. They had been left behind with no guardian. The second was about another two left-behind siblings in the same region. They were murdered by two relatives who had been raping one of the children, a disabled 15-year-old girl.
In February 2016 the government responded to the outcry by publishing guidelines for the protection of left-behind children. These called for their numbers to be reduced “significantly” by 2020. They advised local authorities to monitor guardianship arrangements—it is illegal to let minors live alone. They also urged hospitals and schools to do a better job of reporting cases of suspected harm. In 2017 a new rule required village officials to register all left-behind children. Another, in May 2020, made failure to report neglect or abuse a possible crime. According to official figures, in 2018 local governments paired 76,000 unsupervised children with guardians, and helped the return to school of 160,000 left-behind children who had dropped out. Since 2017 the central government has kept a database of left-behind and vulnerable children, based on the records supplied by villages.
Officials have focused their attention on a subset of those affected. The guidelines in 2016 count as left-behind only those who are under 16 and have two parents working elsewhere. That year the government said there were just 9m children who could be classified as left-behind according to this definition. By 2018 the tally had fallen to under 7m. But children who have been separated from only one parent are often harmed, too. And it can matter which parent has left them. A Chinese study published in 2017 found that school drop-out rates were lower among rural children living with only a mother rather than only a father (rates were highest when both parents were away). In 2019 a paper in Frontiers in Psychology, a peer-reviewed journal, concluded that the presence of at least one parent at home, especially a mother, lessened the risk that a left-behind child would self-harm as a teen.

Rural parents often believe their presence is most vital when a child starts school. So they are more inclined to work elsewhere before their children reach that age, says Lu Shuang of the University of Hong Kong. More than a quarter of children in China under the age of two are cared for by people who are not their mothers, reports Unicef. The Chinese study of 2017 found that, as a proportion of all left-behind children, the number of under-fives had grown from 30% in 2000 to 40% in 2015. Many are never breastfed, depriving them of lifelong health benefits. That was so for Lin.
As they grow older, children face other traumas. Since 2015 surveys by On the Road to School, an NGO based in Beijing, have revealed consistently high levels of depression among left-behind children. In 2019 nine in ten of them said they had suffered from emotional abuse, and six in ten reported physical harm. Close to one in three had been sexually abused.
Such abuse often goes undetected. “The separation from parents means that children do not have the impulse to open up to them,” says Wan Miaoyan, a lawyer in Chengdu who has worked on cases related to such crime. She recalls one in which relatives discovered what had happened only when they came across a letter that the victim had written to herself. In it she described being raped by a teacher. A child therapist says current systems of support rely on people from the same village who may themselves be abusers, rather than on professional outsiders.
Those systems are thinly stretched. Provinces with high numbers of left-behind children—Sichuan, a populous one, tops the ranking—tend to be among the poorest, with scant resources to devote to the task of protecting the vulnerable. But local governments are making an effort. Keep the Children Company, an official scheme in Sichuan, has involved setting up “children’s homes” (a space in the village where they can play, read books and receive help with their homework), and appointing “mothers” to whom children can turn for emotional support. The central government has helped. Since 2010 it has trained people in 660,000 villages as “child-welfare directors”, that is, to perform social work. It has also allowed the use of poverty-alleviation funds for spending on children’s welfare.
In 2015 Lin’s village of Leyun was among the first to introduce a Keep the Children Company project. Liu Chunhua, an energetic kindergarten teacher, was chosen to lead it. In Chengdu, the provincial capital, she learnt how to broach sex and mental health with the village’s 20 children. Her efforts have paid off. A shy teen in Leyun was bewildered when she got her first period. A friend, also puzzled, prodded her to speak to “Mama Liu”. The teacher explained to the girl what was happening to her body and taught her how to wear pads. Village elders often gossip unkindly about the parents of left-behind children. Ms Liu has put a stop to that. She knows the harm it can do. Villagers had once taunted her own left-behind daughter with the false notion that Ms Liu only came back to see her eldest son. Her daughter became so dejected that Ms Liu quit her factory job and moved back to the village.

But keeping tabs on children is getting harder. Most villages once had a school, where teachers could check that students were not hurt, sick or distressed. In the past two decades, however, over 360,000 underused village schools have been closed to save money. Leyun’s hangs on by a thread. A decade ago it had 70 pupils. Now it has only two, in the youngest year-groups. Other children go to a school in Pujia, a town an hour’s walk down the mountain. They usually return to the village at weekends. Lin attends a kindergarten there. Asked if she gets good marks, Lin says she is slapped on the hand fewer times than her classmates.
One glimmer of hope is that growing numbers of migrants are able to find jobs closer to their native villages, as factories move inland. Some parents from Leyun are settling with their children in nearby towns. And the covid-19 pandemic is a cause of unexpected joy for some: it has forced many migrant workers to return to their original homes. Half of Leyun’s youngsters are currently living with both of their parents. That is “unheard of”, says Ms Liu, the teacher.
Many of these parents were also once left-behind children. But rural conditions have improved immensely since those days. Zhu Yidan, a 25-year-old volunteer teacher who grew up as a left-behind child in Sichuan, says that when she was growing up people had to walk cross-country to reach villages. Now there are paved roads and children have enough food, clothing and toys. Parents can video-chat with them daily and buy presents for them online.
But a new problem is emerging. Increasing numbers of children are being left in urban areas by one or both parents who move away for work. There were about 28m such children in 2015, nearly three times as many as in 2000. Those who follow their parents from village to city have better diets and mental health than those who remain in the countryside, studies show. But those who are subsequently left behind in cities suffer higher rates of violence than those who stay in villages. Ms Wan, the lawyer, says there is “a debt owed by this country to its left-behind children”. The account is far from settled. ■",2
1639,"A STALWART OF the previous regime, now in charge of dismantling it. A camel-rustler turned warlord, now ensconced in a palatial home. And an avuncular economist, who once was a communist.
These are unlikely bedfellows. Yet they are entrusted with the task of building democracy in Sudan. Barely two years after a ruthless Islamist despot, Omar al-Bashir, was deposed, they are supposed to be shepherding the country towards elections in 2024. “We call it the Sudan model,” smiles Abdalla Hamdok, the economist (below left). He is the prime minister appointed by protest leaders in 2019. “A model of partnership between civilians and the military, paradoxically, to bring democracy.”

That model emerged from a power-sharing pact struck in 2019 between leaders of the protesters, who had first taken to the streets eight months earlier, and the generals who had tossed out Mr Bashir when it became clear he would fall. At the top is Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan (centre), Sudan’s de facto president and chairman of the sovereign council, a military and civilian body that oversees Mr Hamdok’s mostly civilian cabinet. Burhan is a general who rose to prominence under Mr Bashir.
Beneath him is a desert warlord, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti). He heads the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary unit that grew out of the Janjaweed, militias notorious for rape and butchery of civilians in the Darfur region. Mr Dagalo (pictured right), now deputy chairman, rose to power through ruthlessness towards rebellious Sudanese. Today he is jostling for primacy in a struggle that may determine whether Sudan’s third attempt at democracy since independence from Britain in 1956 also ends in failure.
Each tells The Economist that the spirit of unity is undimmed. “All components of the transition work together in harmony,” says General Burhan. As evidence he points to successes: a peace deal signed with armed rebels, and the repeal of repressive laws, such as one that banned women from wearing immodest clothing.
General Burhan also highlights the restoration of full ties with America and Israel, which prompted America to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. This has paved the way for Sudan to win relief on more than $56bn of its debt. “Our international isolation of more than 30 years is now over,” says the general.
But behind the façade of camaraderie tension runs deep. Speaking more candidly than his colleagues, Mr Hamdok warns of a “political crisis” stemming from three challenges that could derail the transition. The first is division among civilian leaders. “This was probably the broadest coalition the country has seen for decades,” Mr Hamdok explains. “It managed to topple the dictatorship. But immediately afterwards we started seeing cracks and divisions.” Several of its members have withdrawn from the coalition and returned to the streets. Those that remain squabble over jobs and government portfolios. Critics blame Mr Hamdok’s aloof and timid governing style for failing to maintain unity.

The fragmentation makes it harder for the civilians to handle the prime minister’s second challenge: to rein in the army. Mr Hamdok says he had “very frank discussions” with the generals early on about the army’s excessive power over the economy. General Burhan says this has ended, but that stretches credulity. Several firms which used to belong to Mr Bashir’s family, for instance, now belong to the army.
General Burhan, meanwhile, has emerged as the most powerful and effective of the three. He has muscled in on foreign policy, which is Mr Hamdok’s job. He has strengthened Sudan’s relationship with Egypt and overridden civilian objections to the deal with Israel last year. He has also burnished the army’s nationalist credentials by taking back control of disputed territory on the border with Ethiopia. “Burhan is a shrewd general,” says Yasir Arman, a former rebel who is now advising Mr Hamdok. “He bought time to shore up the army’s position. And now it is stronger than ever.”
But General Burhan’s assertiveness may have exacerbated the third problem Mr Hamdok identifies: fragmentation within the armed forces, and competition between the army and the paramilitary RSF. Created by Mr Bashir as a counterweight to the army and the intelligence service, the RSF has its own command structure and funding. As part of the power-sharing deal, Mr Dagalo is supposed to integrate his forces into the army, which would mean giving up some of his power. The general says this will happen “in the right time”. Mr Dagalo insists it has already happened.
But this superficial harmony could quickly evaporate. In June the RSF and the army began barricading their respective headquarters in Khartoum with sandbags. “It had reached a point where they could have been killing each other on the streets,” says Shaddad Hamid Mauwid, an academic at Khartoum University. Talks between General Burhan and Mr Dagalo have since calmed nerves. Some reckon the general may have agreed to postpone integration indefinitely. Yet that would put him at odds with Mr Hamdok, who feels Sudan should “have one national army”.
Big questions remain about Mr Dagalo. Few doubt he has presidential ambitions. (Over a sumptuous breakfast at his home he tells The Economist he has been taking English and French lessons.) But his footing looks a bit shaky. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which used to pay for thousands of his soldiers to fight in Yemen, no longer have much use for him. And the death of Chad’s dictator, Idriss Déby, has deprived him of another regional ally. Recent visits to both Qatar and Turkey suggest he is seeking new friends.
Perhaps in a sign of anxiety, Mr Dagalo warns of a “coup” by people tied to the old regime. Though this is unlikely, Islamists from Mr Bashir’s former party may conceivably ally with factions in the army to force Mr Dagalo out, notes Jean-Baptiste Gallopin, a French researcher. This could set off fighting across Sudan. Yet other observers believe Mr Dagalo himself would pose a bigger threat to the transition, should he fear for his economic interests—or his freedom. An investigation into a massacre of over 100 protesters in 2019 may point the finger at his gunmen.
Mr Hamdok has been sounding the alarm. In June he warned of civil war if the armed factions are not unified in a single army. He has set a deadline for forming a legislature with civilians in charge and called for a constitutional convention to clarify the place of the army in politics. “For all the years since independence to today, we have been dominated by the military,” he says. The civilians have a chance to reverse this. But only a fleeting one. ■",2
1640,"Another 23 road-blocking Insulate Britain activists could be locked up within weeks, it emerged today, as the eco mob announced another 'nonviolent civil resistance' demonstration.
The group said they would protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice tomorrow in 'solidarity' with protesters being jailed, despite the court complex being closed at weekends  
Nine offenders were jailed for up to six months yesterday. Insulate Britain says 23 more people are also being summoned to court for contempt of court in the coming weeks, where they are all likely to receive similar sentences to those handed down to others.  
Today the husband of one eco-zealot who is now going on hunger strike in prison said he was 'terrified' for her as they come to terms with spending Christmas apart.
Emma Smart, 44 - who will be housed in Europe's largest women's prison which is home to murderers and child rapists - was handed a four-month sentence alongside Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Tim Speers, 36, and James Thomas, 47, for taking part in a protest on the M25 on October 8.
Ana Heyatawin, 58, and Louis McKechnie, 20, were sent to prison for three months, while Ben Taylor, 27, was jailed for six months after boasting he would immediately block the roads again if not imprisoned. 
Smart was sent to HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, which was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in 2004. Up to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 people in each one. 
Each wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take it back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months. 
When a woman arrives at the prison they are searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day. Notable former inmates include murderer Rose West, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya. 
A study in July 2016 by HM Inspectorate of Prisons found prisoners were normally offered about five options for lunch and the same for dinner. A typical prison lunch consisted of a sandwich, wrap or portion of pasta, served with a piece of fruit or crisps and biscuits. Typical dinners included a choice of curry, pie, baked fish or casserole, accompanied by rice, vegetables, potatoes, and a choice of dessert or fruit such as apples and oranges.
The most recent report of Bronzefield by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons in 2018 said many inmates were facing 'significant mental health problems', 'self-harm among prisoners remained high' and 'violent incidents had increased significantly over the previous four years' - but concluded that it was an 'overwhelmingly safe prison'.
But another report released two months ago found an 18-year-old inmate who lost her baby at the jail in 2019 should never have given birth alone in her cell. The probe found the mother, known as Ms A, pressed her cell bell twice and asked for a nurse but nobody came. One hour later a prison officer shone a torch into her cell but said there was nothing out of the ordinary. But the inmate said she was on all fours at the time and described being in constant pain, before passing out then awaking to find her daughter had been born but was not breathing.
The male Insulate Britain protesters have gone to Category B HMP Pentonville - known as 'The Ville' - in Islington, North London, which houses about 1,300 men who live in a mixture of single and shared rooms over seven wings. 
Smart, a biologist, told the High Court in London this week that the court proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways. However, she has faced allegations of hypocrisy after undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her husband Andy Smith in 2012. 
Mr Smith, 45, who volunteers as a climate activist full time but has not taken part in any demonstrations with Extinction Rebellion offshoot Insulate Britain, said he is 'terrified' for her. Mr Smith said he was aware that Smart would be going on a hunger strike if she was put behind bars, adding: 'It's something we discuss quite frequently'. 
He added: 'She is incredibly resolute in her actions. I stand by her in all the decisions she makes. Morally they are in the right in this instance and she really stands by her convictions. She's an incredibly passionate person who has spent her whole entire adult life trying to save wildlife and protect the environment. 
'That's deeply ingrained in who she is. That freedom to go out on to the street and protest has been taken away from her, so her going on a hunger strike in prison is another way to continue that process.
'All nine of them in court today were pretty resolute that you can sentence them, but this isn't going to resolve the problem and people will still continue to protest. Obviously I'm terrified. It's a horrible thing for her to go through but I stand by her decision to do that. It's (going on hunger strike) something we discuss quite frequently, the different ways we can make sacrifices to highlight injustices. I'm aware that she had previously talked to other people who've already done hunger strikes and been on hunger strikes. She's a scientist, she's done her research.'
He added that the sentences were less than the supporters of the group were expecting so they were 'relieved', but still felt it was a 'complete injustice'. He said: 'I completely stand with them on what they've done and how they've acted. I would obviously rather the judge side with them but they did break the law and then they were willing to face the consequences of breaking the law.'
Announcing her intention to go on hunger strike after being jailed, Smart said: 'Our Government is betraying us, betraying our vulnerable people and betraying our children's future. I believe that my intentions are morally right, even if my actions are deemed legally wrong.  This court may see me as being on the wrong side of the law, but in my heart I know I am on the right side of history. I will not be a bystander.' 
Following two months of motorway chaos caused by Insulate Britain, Smart told the court that she was there to 'ensure future survival' and compared watching the climate crisis to watching a child trapped in a burning house. 
'She said: 'I'm asking when you consider my sentence that my actions are proportionate to the crisis we are facing, where 8,500 people die a year from cold and hunger in their own homes. I cannot stand by and watch. 
'I would run to them. Our Government is betraying us, our vulnerable people and our children's future. I will not be a bystander while our Government fails and betrays its people, I will continue to do what is necessary.'  
Eco protester Smart and her husband drove 80,975 miles in 858 days in an 18-year-old Toyota during the world tour from 2012 to 2016.  
Ahead of her trip in 2012, Smart told BBC: 'It's a massive scale it's taken 18 months of planning and saving and we are working extremely hard but here we are now about to set off and it's all very real.'

HMP BRONZEFIELD
Ana Heyatawin, 58, and Emma Smart, 44, have both been sent to HMP Bronzefield after being jailed.
The jail in Ashford, Surrey, was Britain's first purpose-built prison for women when it opened in June 2004, as well as being the 10th privately-run prison in England.
Up to 572 women inmates can be held at the Category A jail across four houseblocks which can hold about 130 women in each one. Each wing has a servery unit for women to collect their food, which they can either eat together on the wing or take back to their rooms. Telephones are also provided in each room. It has a 17-bed healthcare facility, and a mother and baby unit for 12 women and 13 babies up to the age of 18 months.
When a woman arrives at the prison they will be searched and their welfare assessed by a doctor and nurse. They will also receive a meal and drink, before beginning an induction process the following day. 
Notable former inmates at Bronzefield include murderers Rose West and Joanna Dennehy, child abuser Vanessa George and the Labour MP Fiona Onasanya. 
HMP PENTONVILLE
Louis McKechnie, 20, Ben Buse, 36, Roman Paluch-Machnik, 28, Oliver Rock, 41, Tim Speers, 36, James Thomas, 47, and Ben Taylor, 37, have all be taken to HMP Pentonville after being jailed at the High Court.
The Category B jail - known as 'The Ville' - in Islington, North London, houses about 1,300 men who live in a mixture of single and shared rooms across seven wings.
When a prisoner first arrives they are allowed to contact one relative by phone and see a medical professional about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.
They then have a four-day induction period to explain the prison rules, and education opportunities. A service provided by Novus lets them study for qualifications in subjects such as carpentry, food safety and painting.
The jail also has four gym areas and a multi-faith chaplaincy service and works with the Catch 22 organisation which helps prisoners involved in gangs.
Notable former inmates over the last 40 years include footballers George Best and Nile Ranger; singers George Michael and Pete Doherty; and actor Keith Allen. 
The couple broke their global trip into four phases and regularly blogged about their travelS inside their 4x4.
The first leg of their trip saw them travel to France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Mongolia, Russia, Ukraine and Poland.
This was followed by visits to Portugal, Morocco, Western Sahara, Spain and Andorra. 
The couple also travelled to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosova along their world expedition.
When news of the trip emerged in October, critics branded it a sign of 'hypocrisy at its very finest'.   
Insulate Britain began a wave of protests on September 13, demanding that the Government makes plans to insulate the UK's homes. 
They blocked roads around London as well as in Birmingham, Manchester and Dover - causing miles of tailbacks in rush hour. 
The nine eco-zealots were jailed over a protest on October 8 at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire which saw a total of 16 people arrested - but dozens more activists are set to be issued with committal proceedings in the next few days.
The group and its supporters chanted 'We are unstoppable, another world is possible' as they were led to the cells through the dock by security officers at the court in London. 
Heyatawin and McKechnie were both jailed for three months while Buse, Paluch-Machnik, Rock, Smart, Speers and Thomas all received four-month sentences. 
The shorter jail term for Heyatawin was because of her medical issues, while McKechnie's was due to his younger age. The men will be at Category B Pentonville jail in Islington and the women at Category A Bronzefield in Surrey. 
Insulate Britain said the protesters were expected to serve at least half of their sentence. They had been facing a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine for contempt of court. 
The demonstrations have seen the campaigners glue themselves to the road before being removed by police. At least 174 activists have been involved on 19 days of protests so far and there have been 860 arrests. 
Group spokesman Tracey Mallaghan said after the case: 'The right thing to do is highlight injustice, breaking the law if needed. This is what the Suffragettes did and Martin Luther King did, and it is what Insulate Britain has done.'
It comes after Taylor told the court on Tuesday that if he was not in jail he would 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'.
Taylor's submissions were described yesterday by Dame Victoria Sharp as 'inflammatory' and a 'call to arms', and he was therefore given a longer sentence of six months 'to deter (him) from committing further breaches'. 
The judge, sitting with Mr Justice Chamberlain, said there was no alternative to jail sentences given the group's actions were so serious and they had made it clear they intended to further flout court orders. 
She said: 'The defendants, or some of them, seem to want to be martyrs for their cause and the media campaign surrounding this hearing appears designed to suggest this. We, however, have to act dispassionately and proportionately.'
FOUL-MOUTHED RANTER - Ben Taylor: 6 months
Defiant Taylor, 27, was handed the longest sentence for what judges called an 'inflammatory' call to arms, in which he told the court that the government must 'f****ing act' on the group's demands. He also boasted that he would immediately go out and block another road if he was not jailed.. The court therefore extended his detention 'to deter Mr Taylor from committing further breaches'.
DEVOUT CHRISTIAN - Dr Benjamin Buse: 4 months
The meek University of Bristol researcher, 36, was the only defendant to have a barrister representing his interests. The court was told that Dr Buse, who has published on topics like 'microanalysis of Uranium', was a devout Christian and popular member of his local church in Cheddar. Barrister Owen Greenhall said he volunteered for charity and donated hundreds of pounds to good causes every month.
THE REBEL SCARED OF JAIL - Oliver Rock: 4 months
The 41-year-old carpenter from south London, admitted he was 'c**pping himself' about going to jail and enjoyed drawn-out cinches with his partner before the final hearing began. He said that after feeling 'depressed' that the 2003 Iraq War march had failed, he was inspired to take up more extreme tactics, in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion, which he joined in 2019. He told the court he only earned about £10,000 a year, often making 'small stage sets'.
HUNGER STRIKER - Emma Smart: 4 months
The 44-year-old, from Weymouth, announced via an Insulate Britain spokesman that she would be going on hunger strike. She told the court that the proceedings were 'obscene' and glowered at barristers representing National Highways. But Smart, a biologist, has previously been criticised for undertaking a gas-guzzling 81,000-mile drive across the globe with her partner, Andy.
STUDENT AGED ONLY 21 - Louis McKechnie: 3 months
The student from Weymouth, who turned 21 yesterday, was given a month off his sentence in recognition of his youth. He said his only income was his student loan, which all went on living expenses, so he would struggle to pay his share of the bill in paying the government's legal costs.
THE OLDEST DEFENDANT - Ana Heyatawin: 3 months
The oldest of the defendants, the blue-haired 58-year-old from Wells, had her sentence reduced to three months, after she told the court about her litany of health issues, including a personality disorder, depression, sciatica and bad eyesight.
'ENLIGHTENED CAPITALIST' - James Thomas: 4 months
The 47-year-old architect said he had previously regarded himself as an 'enlightened capitalist sort of guy', but was inspired to abandon his career and join protest movements after seeing a film about the successes won by the Suffragettes and their campaign of direct action. He said that the 'scariest part' of his time inside would be the impact on his relationship.
INSPIRED BY GRANDPARENTS - Roman Paluch-Machnik: 4 months
The 28-year-old from Ealing said that learning about the experiences of his grandparents, all four of whom escaped Poland during the war, had helped inspire his activism. An active member of Extinction Rebellion since 2018, he has travelled the country giving talks on climate change and training others how to participate in 'Non-Violent Direct Action'.
'SANE IN AN INSANE WORLD' - Tim Speers: 4 months
The 36-year-old, from east London, pontificated in court, 'in an insane world, the sane will be seen as insane'. He believes that Insulate Britain has led 'one of the most successful campaigns in history'. He was first arrested on Waterloo Bridge in 2019 at an Extinction Rebellion protest, commenting: 'I refuse sit back while greed and ignorance takes life to extinction.'
Before the group were sentenced, the National Highways barrister said the legal costs of bringing proceedings against the nine activists had reached £91,000. She argued the judges should make an order for the costs against the defendants and that, even if they are unable to pay them, such an order would be an 'important symbol'.
She also said the agency had a duty to attempt to recover the costs, as they are from public funds. But Dame Victoria Sharp said she and Mr Justice Chamberlain will give their decision on costs in writing at a later date. 
The nine activists said they did not have the funds to pay their share of the legal costs. Taylor said he has been volunteering for a couple of years and is currently claiming Universal Credit, which has recently been cut. He added: '£10,000 is a lot of money so unless there is a deadline, it will take a long time to pay off.'
Smart told the court she has been working as a volunteer in wildlife conservation and climate activism, and does not have any money. Addressing National Highways' legal team, she said: 'You are claiming more for postage than I have earned in the last three years. The fact you are profiting from our stand and trying to save the lives of ... people is obscene. Take what I have, come to my house and sell my clothes because that's all I have.'
Rock said he is a carpenter and was badly affected by the pandemic as he built theatre sets, while Speers said he was a full-time volunteer and claims Universal Credit. Speers added: 'I might be dead before I can pay these costs.'
A further 23 protesters have also defied one or more of several injunctions granted to Transport for London and National Highways over the past two months. And Insulate Britain said it expects these 23 people to be summoned in the coming days, which would bring the total to at least 32 people who are due to face contempt of court. 
Lawyers representing the Government said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters and were expected to be brought by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27. Evidence is also being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2.
Raj Chada, solicitor at Hodge Jones and Allen law firm which supported the protesters, said: 'With these prison terms, the long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience is under attack again. 
'Rather than leaving courts to imprison those that raise the alarm, it should be the Government that acts to protect us against the climate crisis.' 
The group has insisted it intends to continue with the protests until the Government agrees to insulate homes.
Dame Victoria told the court that police bodycam footage of the protest showed officers struggling to remove the demonstrators from the road.
The court heard the activists moved towards oncoming traffic before some successfully glued themselves on the road after being told to clear.
The judge said: 'The footage shows a somewhat chaotic scene with the defendants very close to traffic, and in some instances moving traffic, and the police attempting to restrain them from continuing with their protest and re-entering the road.'
Dame Victoria Sharp told the activists that it is 'integral' that orders made by the court 'must be obeyed'. She said: 'In our democratic society, all citizens are equal under the law and all are subject to the law.
'It is integral to the rule of law, and to the fair and peaceful resolution of disputes, first, that orders made by the court must be obeyed, unless and until they are set aside or subject to successful challenge on appeal, and secondly that a mechanism exists to enforce orders made by court against those who breach them.
'In this jurisdiction, that mechanism is provided by the law of contempt.' 
Insulate Britain activists were also told by the judge that ordinary members of the public 'have rights too'.
Dame Victoria Sharp told them: 'In a democratic society which recognises the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, protests causing some degree of inconvenience are to be expected and, up to a point, tolerated.
'But the words 'up to a point' are important. Ordinary members of the public have rights too, including the right to use the highways.
'The public's toleration of peaceful protest depends on an understanding that, in a society subject to the rule of law, the balance between the protesters' right to protest and the right of members of the public to use the highways is to be determined not by the say-so of the protesters, but according to the law.'
The judge also said the public has an 'interest in deterring disobedience to its orders and in upholding the rule of law'.
And Buse said in a statement: 'Care for the earth and all life requires me to act. My faith requires me to act, believing in the sacredness of creation and the demand for justice, justice for the trampled and exploited.
'Whilst acknowledging the importance of the courts, I have continued to break the injunction multiple times for we have a duty to the earth, to life, to future generations, to care and protect, this is the most important function of government, society and law.
'As we enter into the difficult years shifting to low carbon, and feeling the effects of climate change, we all need to be engaged in peaceful transformation; attempts to punish and crack down on peaceful protest opens the door to violent protest, which I deeply wish to avoid.'
Speers added: 'Never before has a civilisation had the burden and the privilege to see its own collapse coming.
'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified and criminalised, and those profiting from death are protected and rewarded. We asked for a chance to live. That's all.
'We did so in the tradition of non-violent protest upon which this country was built. In response, the Government declared it would do 'everything we can to stop them'.'
'In an insane world, the sane will be seen as insane. And in a democracy steeped in lies and corruption, good people have a duty to disobey bad laws. 
 
'We did our duty and I await the day when a judge in a court of law is brave enough to do theirs.'
An Insulate Britain spokesman said yesterday: 'This morning our Insulate Britain supporters have been sentenced. We are being failed and betrayed by our government. Our nine chose not to standby and be complicit in genocide.' 
After today's sentencing an Insulate Britain supporter read out the following letter in court, which said: 
'Over the last nine weeks, 174 ordinary people have held the government to account, asking that they deliver on their most basic of duties, to protect the British people, the economy and all we hold dear in our society. Your government has now chosen to act. It has chosen to imprison us for this demand.
'By imprisoning us, the government shows its cowardice. They would rather lock up pensioners than insulate their homes. They would rather lock up teachers than create thousands of proper jobs. 
'They would rather lock up young people than take practical steps to reduce emissions. They will lock us up and leave thousands to die of cold this winter. We knew we would face prison when we took this action, but we could not stand by while the government betrays the general public.
'Following the widely recognised failure of our government at COP26, we are continuing to ask them to get on with the job: of cutting carbon emissions; of insulating cold and leaky houses; of protecting the people of this country from climate collapse, because the lives of our children and those of all future generations hang in the balance.
'To the government we say, you can't imprison a flood, there are no unlimited fines against a famine, you can't bankrupt a fire.
'To the public we say, no one is coming to save you. In the past, when governments have failed to protect their people the right thing to do is to highlight this injustice, breaking the law if needed, this is what the suffragettes and Martin Luther King did and it is what Insulate Britain has done.
'We call on you to recognise that you also have a duty to act, as our government is betraying us. They can't even act to insulate Britain. What hope do we have of them protecting our children, our economy or our country?
'We say to those who look on in fear and denial: this will impact you and all that you love and look at what we did. A few hundred people captured the country's attention for months. Think what 1000 people can achieve? You have a choice. To act, to come and join us help change the tide of history, or to be a bystander and be complicit in enabling genocide. This tide will not come again, will you join us?'
During Tuesday's hearing, Taylor said if he was 'not put in prison' for breaching an injunction banning disruptive protests on the nation's roads, he will 'go and block the motorway at the earliest opportunity and will continue to do so until the Government makes a meaningful statement and acts on it'. 
He added that 'whatever sentence or sanction' he was given 'will be counter-productive and will only serve to fuel the campaign of Insulate Britain'.
Taylor said: 'If you send me away to prison, ten people will step forward in my place. If you send each of us away, 100 people will step forward and take our places. If you send 100 of us away, 1,000 people will step forward to take our place.
'If you somehow manage to stop all non-violent protests, then things will only turn violent.' 
Speers described the country's democracy as 'steeped in lies' and said 'good people have a duty to breach bad laws'.
He said: 'In this world, those trying to avert catastrophe are vilified. On a tradition of non-violent protest, in response, the Government said they will 'do everything to we can to stop them.' 
'That was from Grant Shapps, who had a second job under another name.'
Paluch-Machnik told the court the injunction 'is not just in context with the crisis we're in'.
He said: 'The Government would rather imprison pensioners than insulate their homes.'
Mr Paluch said retrofitting homes is the cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis and added: 'We are asking for a fully funded state-operated retrofitted service, like the NHS.
'Some of those who have spoken have said they're not afraid. I'm afraid you will take away my home and me away from my friends, family and partner. 
'But I'm more afraid of inaction and the climate catastrophe that has already began to crash on some of us. I stand by the action that brought me before this court, and if that sends me to prison, then so be it.'
He urged the court to look at 'more than the letter of the law' and 'make the commitment to insulate Britain'.
Heyatawin told the High Court she is 'traumatised' by the Government's attitude to climate change.
She said she 'does not accept the morality of the injunction' and said 'it is meaningless in the context of climate collapse'.
Ms Heyatawin added: 'I know how to behave. I think I'm a good person. I felt compelled to stop the world and get off. We are hurtling towards ecocide, genocide and our own suicide.'
Rock invited the court to observe a minute's silence 'to imagine what the climate crisis means for the future'.  He said: 'I'm proud of our actions and I stand by what we have done, we have not done this for personal gain. 
'I take responsibility for my actions and I did that in an attempt to mitigate the suffering of people in this country who cannot afford to adequately heat their homes.'
The only defendant to have a lawyer was Dr Ben Buse, a Bristol University researcher. Owen Greenhall told the court Dr Buse was active in his local church and a highly regarded member of the community.
Myriam Stacey QC, representing National Highways, told the court the message that the defendants are 'proud of their conduct' and 'will continue to defy the injunction order made' is 'loud and clear'.
She added: 'No apology has been made in relation to the breach of the order.'
Ms Stacey said the group had emailed National Highways in September saying the protests would continue 'unless the Government make a meaningful statement that they will start the process of decarbonising homes in Britain'. 
Ms Stacey said further committal proceedings will be issued against other Insulate Britain protesters by the end of the week, relating to protests on October 27.  
She also said evidence is being gathered to bring proceedings in relation to protests on October 29 and November 2. All nine defendants were sentenced by Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Chamberlain.
'Contempt of court' is an offence that normally happens when someone risks unfairly influencing a court case, which may stop somebody from getting a fair trial.
It can include taking photos or shouting out in court, refusing to answer questions as a witness or publicly commenting on a court case such as on social media.
Another form it takes is disobeying or ignoring a court order, which is what the Insulate Britain activists have done by breaking an injunction on their M25 protests.
Those who breach the injunctions were found in contempt of court and could have faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. In the end, they were jailed for between three and six months. 
The High Court has so far issued five injunctions to prevent protesters from blocking roads - four to National Highways and one to Transport for London (TfL).
The hearings did not taking place in a criminal court because none of the protesters have been charged with a criminal offence by police. This is despite at least 161 activists having been involved in the demonstrations over the two months, resulting in at least 860 arrests.
The protesters were instead facing contempt of court proceedings for breaching a High Court injunction, which is a civil matter but can still result in a jail term.
An emotional Mr Rock told LBC radio on Tuesday: 'I feel terrified - I'm c***ping myself this morning, and I feel like crying. I've got all these emotions coming out of me. It seems ridiculous that we're in this situation.
'What we're asking the Government to do is just an extremely practical no-brainer thing that they should be doing, and they're choosing instead to potentially lock us up, fine us, seize our assets.
'I'm expecting that we might get sentenced maybe today, probably tomorrow. We've been told that quite probably we'll get custodial sentences, so there's a high likelihood that by this evening I'll be in a prison cell somewhere.' 
The Government plans to introduce new measures to clamp down on protests, including allowing police to stop and search people where there is a reasonable suspicion they are carrying items intended to cause disturbance, such as glue.
After yesterday's sentencing a statement from the nine activists jailed was read by an Insulate Britain supporter outside the Royal Courts of Justice.
It read: 'Over the last nine weeks, 174 ordinary people have held the Government to account, asking that they deliver on their most basic of duties, to protect the British people, the economy and all we hold dear in our society.
'Your Government has now chosen to act. It has chosen to imprison us for this demand.
'By imprisoning us, the Government shows its cowardice. They would rather lock up pensioners than insulate their homes.
'They would rather lock up teachers than create thousands of proper jobs.
'They would rather lock up young people than take practical steps to reduce emissions.
'They will lock us up and leave thousands to die of cold this winter. We knew we would face prison when we took this action, but we could not stand by while the Government betrays the general public.' 
The activists' statement continued: 'Following the widely recognised failure of our Government at Cop26, we are continuing to ask them to get on with the job - of cutting carbon emissions, of insulating cold and leaky houses, of protecting the people of this country from climate collapse - because the lives of our children and those of all future generations hang in the balance.

'You have a choice. To act, to come and join us help change the tide of history, or to be a bystander and be complicit in enabling genocide.
'This tide will not come again, will you join us?'
Following the sentencing, Greenpeace UK programme director Pat Venditti said: 'Jailing climate activists during a climate crisis is like silencing a smoke alarm while half the building is on fire.
'What this country needs are fewer injunctions and more insulation. Instead of cracking down on climate activism, the UK Government should crack down on cold homes.
'One will be an international embarrassment, the other a sign of real climate leadership.
'An ambitious home insulation programme funded by the Government would lower energy bills, cut planet-heating emissions and boost the UK's energy security - it's a triple win.
'Boris Johnson must show that he hasn't left his commitment behind at Glasgow Central station and he's ready to roll up sleeves and lead by example on tackling the climate crisis.'
Liberty director Gracie Bradley said: 'We should all be able to stand up for what we believe, but when the means to do so are continually narrowed - whether that be at the ballot box, in the courts or in the streets - people will take to more urgent routes.
'While Insulate Britain knew that by breaching the injunction they risked jail, these sentences clearly are disproportionate and another threat to protest rights for all of us.
'For years, injunctions have been used by the powerful to stifle dissent and restrict protest rights, while demonstrators have been demonised.
'The impact has been stifling free expression, undermining the ability of all of us to stand up for what we believe in - particularly people from marginalised communities who are most cut off from the corridors of power.
'Today's sentences must be seen in the context of the expansive and oppressive powers in the Policing Bill, itself a grab for more power by a Government that despises scrutiny and accountability.
'The right to protest protects all of us and is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. We must not allow those in power to demonise demonstrators in a cynical attempt to silence us all.'
Duncan Smith, executive director of operations at National Highways, said: 'Safety is our top priority and we welcome this outcome.
'We respect people's right to protest but do not condone the actions of anyone who puts their lives, and the lives of road users, at risk.
'The judge's decision will hopefully make people think again about carrying out reckless and dangerous protests such as these and endangering people's lives.
'The injunctions remain in place and we stand ready to do what is necessary to limit the impact of any protests on the strategic road network, and to keep drivers safe and on the move.'

1641,"LATIN AMERICA’S economies are punch-drunk from the pandemic. No other region suffered a bigger drop in GDP in 2020 or a higher death rate. Even before the coronavirus arrived, the larger Latin economies lagged behind emerging-world success stories in Asia and Europe. They were held back by poor governance, excessive dependence on commodities and protectionism. In the steepness of its barriers to trade, the region is second only to sub-Saharan Africa. From 1995 to 2015 its participation in global supply chains rose by just 0.1%; in the rest of the world supply-chain trade jumped by 19%.
But the Americas now have a chance to make progress. The capriciousness of Chinese regulators, the tangled state of global trade and the trend towards reshoring and nearshoring are prompting firms in the United States to reassess where they should build factories and invest their cash. With the right policies, Latin American countries could be attractive locations for new plants supplying the United States and each other. This is the best chance in decades to pursue a policy of regional economic integration.

Whether that actually takes place will depend in part on President Joe Biden. Already, Latin American governments are being courted to take part in Mr Biden’s Build Back Better World partnership, an infrastructure-investment programme that is intended to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Yet, for all its good intentions, the Biden plan lacks ambition.
As well as promoting infrastructure-building, Mr Biden should urge his neighbours to lower trade barriers, harmonise provisions across the hundreds of trade agreements which already criss-cross the region and clear up onerous customs procedures. This could help persuade investors to take the plunge.
Nobody should underestimate how hard it will be to overcome Latin America’s scepticism of markets. Big economies such as Brazil and Argentina have long been protectionist, coddling domestic firms behind high trade barriers. The results of past trade deals have sometimes been disappointing.
Policy mistakes continue. Left-wing leaders, such as Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, want less private capital in the economy, not more. Peru has recently elected a far-left leader, Pedro Castillo, who has been seeking to calm the market’s apprehension about his economic policies, with only some success.
Partly as a result, Latin America has failed to transform itself economically as East Asia has done over the past generation. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994, real income per person in Mexico, measured by purchasing power, has fallen further behind that in the United States.
However, you can find signs of openness. Uruguay is seeking new trade deals with China and, as part of a regional grouping, South Korea. In Ecuador Guillermo Lasso, the president and a former banker, is valiantly battling populism. Countries that have been open to trade, like Chile and Costa Rica, have outgrown their inward-looking Latin American peers.
Even Mexico holds out some hope. In recent years its exporters competed directly with China’s in industries that China came to dominate. Now Mexicans have adapted. Whereas the country’s overall growth has been disappointing, its manufacturers have shifted from low-value textiles into automotive, aerospace and semiconductor industries that will benefit from being close to the United States and far from China.
Mr Biden could help by pairing access to badly needed investment through Build Back Better with a drive for trade liberalisation. In September members of the Biden administration visited Colombia, Ecuador and Panama to gauge interest in the initiative, which could also boost Latin America’s defences against climate change.
The alternative to integration is grim. Further economic stagnation in Latin America would leave governments struggling to cope with the rising costs of climate change. A lack of jobs and growth would rile their increasingly frustrated citizens, many of whom have taken to the streets in recent years.
Similarly, a further inward lurch in Latin America would not serve the security and commercial interests of the United States. At the very least it would be a missed opportunity to expand markets for the country’s firms. Mr Biden has a chance to help create a more prosperous region. He should take it. ■",2
1642,"A Virginia cop who was fired for anonymously donating $25 to a Kyle Rittenhouse defense fund after being outed by hackers and the media is now demanding his job back from the woke, 'hypocrite' police chief who fired him. 
Speaking to DailyMail.com on Friday, as the Rittenhouse verdict came in on Friday, Norfolk Police Lieutenant William 'Bill' Kelly explained why he thought Rittenhouse deserved his help back then, and why he stands by the decision now. 
Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all counts on Friday after a two week trial. He buckled in tears as the verdict was read aloud and is now a free man. 
Seven months ago, long before the trial had even started, 42-year-old Kelly was fired for donating anonymously to the teenager's then-growing defense fund.  
Kelly, a 19-year veteran and father-of-three who had moved into the internal affairs division at the time, made a $25 donation to a Give Send Go online campaign for Rittenhouse's legal team after watching social media videos and journalists' footage from the August 2020 Kenosha riots. 
He wrote alongside his donation: 'God Bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You’ve done nothing wrong. Every rank-and-file police officer supports you.' 
Scroll down for video 
He thought nothing else of it, until his name appeared in an article by The Guardian among the names of other cops who gave to the fund. Their details had been hacked by a group and provided to the media. Kelly was fired and vilified by the police chief and city manager in Norfolk, who called his actions 'egregious'.  
In an interview with DailyMail.com, he explained why he thought Rittenhouse was innocent from the beginning. 
'Everything I'm saying is just my personal opinion. I've been a homicide detective, a violent crimes investigator for years. I have a background. I watched the video of the shooting and I'd seen the video of the journalists of Mr. Rittenhouse before the shooting and the protesters before the shooting and I thought it painted a pretty clear picture that Mr. Rittenhouse had a very strong claim for self-defense.
'I was very surprised when he was charged soon after the shooting with these murders and the shooting of the third victim,' he said. 
Kelly, a self-confessed 'news junkie', saw that a GoFundMe account for Rittenhouse had been canceled, and a site called Give Send Go had set up another page for him. 
He logged on and donated, making sure to leave out personal details because he says he didn't want to associate himself with the police department. 
'I was interested in giving him the chance to defend himself in front of a jury. I know that lawyers are expensive, and it's hard sometimes to get the message out there. I wanted to make sure that he had the means necessary to make his claim in court.
'It mattered. The comments I made, my belief that he has a strong claim for self-defense was a personal opinion. I didn't want my city or police department to be associated with it, so I chose to donate anonymously.
'It was only after the hackers broke into it that they were able to connect those dots,' he said. 
A hacker group called 'Distributed Denial of Secrets' obtained his name and email address from the fund and provided it to The Guardian, which published a story including his name. The Daily Dot followed. 
Within a day of it coming out, the Norfolk Police Department was receiving widespread calls to fire Kelly from all over the world. 
'It wasn't people local, it was people from all around the country who read an article and sent a nasty tweet. In the absence of that outcry, there would not have been any kind of disciplinary action against me, I'm confident,' he said. 
The city decided that the comments 'eroded' the public's trust in the police and Kelly was fired in April. 
He has since filed a grievance, but the process is ongoing and in the meantime, he's had to survive on his savings. 
Speaking from his home in Norfolk, he said he wishes the city officials had waited at least until tensions surrounding the case had calmed, if not until the trial. 
'If people consumed as much information as I did about the case they may have come to a different conclusion. And honestly even if they did consume as much information as I did and they came to a different conclusion - that's fine. 
'This is America. You can agree with your neighbors and other people in your community and you can disagree with them. Just because someone has a different opinion than you, it doesn't mean you should destroy their lives, take their job away.
'My opinion on the self-defense claim of Mr. Rittenhouse has no impact on my ability to do my job as a police officer.'
He says the only reason he was fired was because he supported the teenager. 
'If I had a different opinion and I donated to a fund for the victims and made comments about how Mr. Rittenhouse was a murderer, nobody would have cared or tried to get me fired.'
In his grievance, he points to the fact that the police chief Larry Boone attended a BLM protest in May last year in full uniform, while on duty. 
In the photo, Boone is holding a sign that reads Black Lives Matter, with the names of people who have been shot by cops - including some in Norfolk - around it. 
'The hypocrisy is dumbfounding. For the leader of our organization to be able to advocate support for a movement that is at the very least divisive in America today, in uniform while on duty... he was holding carried the name of a person who had recently been shot by a Norfolk police officer. 
'The sign demanded justice for that person, but that shooting was still under investigation to determine whether or not that officer should be charged criminally. It's very inconsistent.
'Yet I cannot, off-duty, on my own time make a donation and some comments that are well within the realm of public, acceptable discourse?' 
The bigger issue, he says, is that he was fired for daring to have an opinion that went against woke officials and public pressure to condemn the teenager.  
 'The outcome of the trial has nothing to do with my vindication - right or wrong, an American has the right to express their opinion within the realm of public discourse. 
'That same freedom exists regardless to the outcome.' 
Now, he says the censorship of right-wing political views is 'chilling' police officers all over the country.
They feel 'disposable' unless they submit to a liberal ideology. 
'It made me feel disposable. Not only how it affected me, how it affected other officers. I was contacted by others who said they immediately deleted their social  media accounts after I got fired out of fear that they would go through them and find something innocuous to use against them.
'I've been contacted by officers who say, ""what if Trump runs in 2024 and I put a sign for him in my front yard, can media get a hold of that? If enough people complain, will I lose my job?""
'The effects of this kind of censorship are wide. It ripples through the entire department. It's a chilling effect.'
Kelly and his wife have been surviving on her salary as a school teacher and his savings to get by, but he is hoping he will be reinstated soon and given backpay. 
The couple have three kids, the oldest of whom is 18. 
He is desperate to return to work and was just ten months away from vesting for his pension when he was fired. If he doesn't get his job back, he'll lose the pension he worked almost 20 years for. 
'I love being a cop, it's a part of me and who I am. It was a huge hit to me to lose my  job. If I got the chance again, I'd jump on it,' he said. 
Kelly said that even though Rittenhouse has now been acquitted, he does not believe public discourse will change because people have 'dug in' to their opinions. 
'I don't think the discourse will change. People are dug in on their heels... they'll point to some other boogie-man as an excuse as to why he was acquitted. They won't be forced to look at the facts of the case. I don't think they'll change their mind.
'Honestly, most of America is pretty polarized. People on both sides who seem to be ideologically dug in to their position.
'They try to view fact patterns through it and it's hard to break free from it,' he said. 
The City of Norfolk did not respond to inquiries about whether it intended to give him his job back. 
He is hoping for a hearing date at the end of January, but wants to resolve the issue privately before then.    ",-2
1643," (CNN)Streaming services continue to roll out expensive series based on presold concepts, but those big swings can produce big misses, with two prime examples this weekend: ""Cowboy Bebop,"" Netflix's live-action spin on a popular anime show; and ""The Wheel of Time,"" Amazon's poor-man's version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (before its actual one) based on popular fantasy books.Both shows fall flat, for different reasons. ""Cowboy Bebop"" seeks to replicate the style and tone of the violent animated series, a space western that features a trio of bounty hunters (or ""cowboys""). They're played by John Cho (under a tousled mop of hair), Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, hunting a bizarre array of targets, firing off playful banter and weapons in near-equal measure.While much of the action is episodic, the season is connected by a larger plot involving the villainous Vicious (Alex Hassell), from the Cho character's past, and the alluring woman (Elina Satine) that came between them -- a thread that feels so familiar as to become a bit of a snooze.Introduced in Japan in 1998 and in the US via Adult Swim three years later, the series demonstrates once again that it's not easy to approximate the tone of a cartoon in a live-action format, even one that's adult in its content. (Netflix is also streaming the original show to maximize the bangs -- and there are a lot of them -- for its bucks.)All told, the new series is big, loud and lavishly produced, with a music-infused sensibility that works in its favor, or at least should.Yet somehow, the producers have managed to make a show that appears to have provoked skepticism among the original's devotees -- who speak of it with the kind of reverence once reserved for ""Citizen Kane"" -- without effectively inviting newcomers into the party.Whatever the cause, the chemistry feels off. And while the action sequences are stylishly choreographed, ""Cowboy Bebop"" finally bangs out a pretty dull tune. At least ""Bebop"" doesn't aspire to being much more than fun, while ""The Wheel of Time"" -- adapted from Robert Jordan's books -- has a more epic scope that adds to the sense of dramatic inertia.Rosamund Pike provides a degree of star power -- or at least the most recognizable face -- as the mysterious Moiraine, who comes to a small village where she enlists five young men and women on a quest to thwart the return of ""the dark one,"" with one member of the quintet, still unknown, representing the prophesied savior of their world.The dark one's slavering minions, naturally, are in hot pursuit, but the characters simply don't possess enough pop to draw in those who don't come immersed in the mythology, and the special effects are uneven. What emerges thus feels like another fantasy-based soap opera, populated by fantastic creatures and stiff dialogue filled with ominous warnings like ""The dark one is coming for your friends.""Put the blame on ""Game of Thrones,"" which prompted every streamer to take a hard look at fantasy concepts with literary underpinnings to tap into that genre. As noted, Amazon's really big bet is an upcoming series based on ""The Lord of the Rings,"" which only feeds the sense that this represents a once-over-lightly version of it.While there have been successes, the streaming world has also absorbed expensive failures as it tests these waters, with ""Cursed"" and ""Jupiter's Legacy"" among Netflix's recent one-season wonders.On the plus side, it's nice to see streamers taking chances on material that requires such ambition. Nevertheless, there's not much to ""Cowboy Bebop"" that would merit saddling up for an encore, or anything about ""The Wheel of Time"" to provoke enthusiasm about the prospect of it marching on.""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""The Wheel of Time"" premiere Nov. 19 on Netflix and Amazon, respectively.",0
1644,"THE ROMANS perfected concrete, and their legacy still stands in the form of the magnificent roof of the Pantheon, the world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome. Since it was completed in around 125AD by the Emperor Hadrian, an awful lot more concrete has been poured—some 30bn tonnes every year, at the moment, to put up buildings, roads, bridges, dams and other structures. The grey stuff has become the most widely used construction material on the planet, and demand is growing.
This is bad news for global warming. The problem is that concrete’s crucial ingredient, cement, which is mixed with sand, gravel and water to make the stuff, is responsible for a huge amount of greenhouse-gas emissions. Taking in its various stages of production, the 5bn tonnes of cement produced each year account for 8% of the world’s anthropogenic CO2 emissions. If the cement industry were a country it would be the third-largest emitter in the world, after China and America.

So far, concrete has few practical alternatives. The development of cross-laminated, “engineered”, timber—which, being produced from wood, can be a renewable resource—is gaining interest, even for some high-rise buildings. But compared with concrete, engineered timber remains, for now, a novelty. Concrete’s biggest users, especially China, which makes more than half of the world’s cement, are not about to stop employing it. Hence cleaning up the industry might seem a hopeless task. But it isn’t, for technologies are being developed to make concrete greener. Green enough, perhaps, for it to go from adding CO2 to the atmosphere, to subtracting it.

The place to start is where emissions are greatest. Cement production begins with the quarrying of limestone, the main component of which is calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This is mixed with clay and passed through a rotating kiln at more than 1,400ºC in a process called calcination. The heat drives off the carbon and part of the oxygen, which combine to form CO2. The remaining lumps, called clinker, are made of molecular complexes of calcium oxide and silica, known collectively as calcium silicates. The clinker is then cooled and milled into cement. More than half the emissions involved in cement-making are a consequence of calcination, and most of the rest result from burning coal and other fossil fuels to power the process (see chart). All told, nearly one tonne of CO2 is released for every tonne of fresh cement.
Hot stuff
The inevitability of calcination’s creation of CO2 makes capturing the gas before it can enter the atmosphere, and storing it away, the most effective approach to decarbonise the cement industry, according to a study by Paul Fennell of Imperial College, London, and his colleagues, published earlier this year in Joule. The captured CO2 could be held underground or used by other industries—for instance to make synthetic fuel (see box overleaf). But it might also be injected back into concrete at the point when it is being mixed with water to cure it. Water promotes chemical reactions that cause cement to harden. CO2 has a similar effect and, in the process, gets locked up as calcium carbonate.
In fact, reversing calcination in this way makes concrete stronger than if water alone is used. So, not only is some of the original emission thus dealt with, less cement is needed for a given job, lowering overall emissions still further. McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons reverse calcination could, at present, sequester up to 5% of cement’s emissions. As the technology improves it expects that might rise to 30%.
Several companies are starting down this route. CarbonCure, a Canadian firm, has fitted equipment which injects CO2 into ready-mixed concrete to more than 400 plants around the world. Its system has been used to construct buildings that include a new campus in Arlington, Virginia, for Amazon, an online retailer (and also a shareholder in CarbonCure), and an assembly plant for electric vehicles, for General Motors, in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
At present the CO2 used by CarbonCure has been captured by industrial-gas companies. But firms are developing equipment intended to collect the gas directly from cement kilns. And Calix, based in Sydney, Australia, is working on an electrically powered system which heats the limestone indirectly, from the outside of the kiln rather than the inside. That enables pure CO2 to be captured without having to clean up combustion gases from fuel burnt inside the kiln—so, if the electricity itself came from green sources, the resulting cement would be completely green.
A pilot plant using this technology has run successfully as part of a European Union research project on a site in Belgium operated by Heidelberg Cement, a German firm that is one of the world’s biggest cement-makers. A larger demonstration plant is due to open in 2023, in Hanover, to help scale up the technology.
Energising rubbish
Another approach—less green, but still better than using fossil fuels—is to substitute some of the coal burnt in kilns with municipal and industrial waste. Several firms are already doing this. Cemex, a Mexican building-materials giant, for example, makes a kiln fuel called Climafuel out of municipal waste that has been denuded of its recyclable substances. This is rich, in the form of plant material (“biomass”), in carbon that has recently been in the atmosphere, and is simply returning there, rather than having been dug up as fossil fuel. Up to 60% of the coal used by some of Cemex’s British cement plants has been replaced with Climafuel.
Companies are also looking at ways to substitute some of the cement in concrete with other materials. Many add fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, or crushed slag from the blast furnaces used to make iron. But neither of these approaches is sustainable in the long run. As Peter Harrop, boss of IDTechEx, a firm of analysts in Cambridge, England, and the co-author of a new report on the future of concrete and cement, observes, coal use is dwindling and steel production aspires to move to newer, cleaner technologies.
For Dr Harrop, an important part of the answer is to “tech-up” concrete in ways which mean that less of it will be needed to do particular jobs. This means adding things like synthetic and natural fibres—or even graphene, a substance stronger than steel that consists of single-layer sheets of carbon atoms. Only small amounts are needed to produce beneficial results.
Graphene and other reinforcement will lead to new, ultra-high-performance concretes, which Dr Harrop thinks will be particularly suitable for 3D printing. This builds up precise layers of material under robotic control, and greatly reduces waste. “Using much less cement is a very important part of the answer,” he adds, especially as cement production looks otherwise set to double over the next 20 years.
Additives can also make concrete last longer and reduce the need for maintenance. At the University of Michigan, Victor Li and his colleagues use synthetic and natural fibres, along with CO2 injection, to produce a bendable concrete they call Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC). The internal structure of this material was inspired by nacre, a flexible material commonly called “mother of pearl” that coats the insides of the shells of molluscs such as abalone and oysters.
Adding such flexibility to concrete lets bridges and roads cope more easily with heavy traffic, and improves the earthquake resistance of tall buildings. ECC develops only tiny surface cracks when it ages. Dr Li says it is thus better at keeping water out and preventing corrosion of reinforcing steel bars inside. Such corrosion can cause reinforced-concrete structures to crumble within a few years of their construction—sometimes resulting in their collapse.
To zero and beyond
Substitution of materials could go still further. Solidia, a firm in New Jersey, makes cement containing calcium silicates with a higher ratio of silica to calcium oxide than the standard “Portland” variety. This has two consequences. One is that Solidia’s process requires less heat (and therefore less fossil fuel) than conventional calcination, and so releases less CO2 in the first place. The other is that, when mixed into concrete, Solidia’s silica-rich silicates can be cured more rapidly than regular cement by using captured CO2 instead of water. Solidia is working on applications for its cement with one of its investors, LafargeHolcim, a Swiss building-supplies giant.
Taking all these developments into account, how green could concrete get? Dr Fennell says it would be reasonably easy to reduce the industry’s CO2 emissions to around 80% of present levels per tonne of concrete produced by better energy use and the modification of materials. But companies could really pull the stops out if they moved to kilns largely or entirely powered by biomass, such as wood. The carbon in this would, until recently, have been CO2 in the air. If, after being turned back into that gas by being burned in the kiln, it was stored away and not released, the consequence, as new trees grew to replace those consumed, would be a net flow of carbon out of the atmosphere.
This sort of system, called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), is one way climate modellers imagine providing the “negative emissions” needed for net-zero or net-negative emissions targets. BECCS-based electricity generation is often talked of, but BECCS might actually be better suited to cement-making—because in a carbon-conscious world the CO2 capturing equipment will already be there, dealing with results of calcination. And if that happened, one of the pariahs of global warming might thus redeem itself by helping alleviate the damage being done to the planet, and so leave behind a legacy as impressive in its way as that of the Romans. ■

1645," (CNN)After months of negotiations, the House passed the Democrats' sweeping $1.9 trillion budget reconciliation package on Friday. The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would transform the nation's social safety net despite being whittled down to roughly half its original size amid infighting between the party's moderate and progressive wings. It would create a universal pre-K program, assist families with child care and send them the enhanced child tax credit for another year. It would also provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges through 2025 and offer federal help to those who fall below the poverty line.It would funnel nearly $570 billion into climate measures, attempt to address affordable housing shortfalls and provide money to parents to buy their kids food over the summer.The legislation would increase the deficit by $367 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But that doesn't count revenue raised from enhanced tax enforcement, which the office found would bring in $207 billion over 10 years.The legislation's path in the Senate remains uncertain, and more revisions are expected. Some Democrats, particularly Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have voiced concerns about various provisions in the bill, as well as the speed at which it is going through Congress.Democrats are planning to use a procedure called reconciliation so that they can approve the bill in the Senate with just 50 votes, which would alleviate the need for support from Republicans. But since the Democrats have only 50 members in the chamber, they still can't afford to lose a single vote within their own party.Here's what's in:Universal pre-K: The bill would provide free pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. It would expand access to 6 million children a year. Funding would last six years. The provision, along with the child care measure, would cost an estimated $381.5 billion, according to the CBO.Child care: The legislation would limit child care costs for families with children younger than age 6 to no more than 7% of income for those earning up to 250% of state median income, expanding access to about 20 million children. Funding would last six years. The provision, along with the universal pre-K measure, would cost an estimated $381.5 billion, according to the CBO.Paid family and sick leave: Biden also wants to create a federally funded paid family and sick leave program for the millions of Americans who don't already receive the benefit from their employer. He first called for 12 weeks of paid leave, which was then reduced to four weeks during negotiations. The House bill includes four weeks of paid family and sick leave, costing an estimated $194 billion -- but the provision is likely to be cut out of the legislation once it is taken up by the Senate. Manchin is opposed to including the benefit in this bill, and Democrats can't afford to lose one vote. A program that provides four weeks of paid family and sick leave would cost $205.5 billion, according to the CBO.Enhanced child tax credit: The beefed-up child tax credit -- which provides $300 a month for each child under age 6 and $250 a month for each one ages 6 through 17 -- would be extended through 2022 for more than 35 million families. Heads of household earning up to $112,500 and joint filers making up to $150,000 annually would qualify for the enhanced payments. But, unlike in 2021, only these families would receive the funds in monthly installments next year. Eligible parents with higher incomes would have to claim the credit on their tax return the following year.The credit would be made permanently refundable so the lowest income families would continue to qualify. The enhancement, which was part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package Democrats enacted earlier this year, is currently only in place for 2021. This credit, along with the earned income tax credit, would cost about $203 billion, according to the CBO.The House bill unveiled in September would have extended the credit through 2025.Earned income tax credit: The expanded earned income tax credit would be extended through 2022, helping 17 million low-wage childless workers. The boost, also part of the relief package, is only in place for this year. It nearly triples the maximum credit childless workers can receive, extends eligibility to more people, reduces the minimum age and eliminates the upper age limit. This credit, along with the enhanced child tax credit, would cost about $203 billion, according to the CBO.The earlier House bill would have extended it permanently.Home health care: The proposal calls for permanently improving Medicaid coverage for home care services for seniors and people with disabilities, with the goal of reducing the more than 800,000 people on state Medicaid waiting lists. It also aims to improve the quality of caregiving jobs. The measure would cost nearly $158 billion, according to the CBO.Originally, Biden had hoped to shower $400 billion on this effort as part of his infrastructure package.Affordable Care Act subsidies: The enhanced federal premium subsidies would be extended through 2025 under the bill. It would reduce the cost of coverage on the Obamacare exchanges, particularly for moderate-income and middle-class Americans. The boost, also part of the Democrats' relief package, is currently set to expire after 2022. This provision, along with Medicaid expansion, would cost $126 billion, according to the White House's latest estimate. And the number of uninsured Americans would drop by 3.4 million, mainly due to the subsidies extension and the Medicaid provision, according to the CBO.The initial House bill would have made the enhancement permanent.The legislation also would extend for one year a provision of the American Rescue Plan that allows those receiving unemployment benefits to qualify for federal subsidies that reduce their monthly premiums to as little as $0.This provision would cost $74 billion, according to the CBO.Medicaid coverage gap: The Democrats are calling for providing Affordable Care Act premium subsidies for low-income Americans in the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid, enabling them to buy Obamacare policies with no monthly premiums, through 2025.Doing so would cost about $57 billion, the CBO estimates.The original House bill would have provided premium subsidies to low-income Americans until the Department of Health and Human Services would have set up a federal Medicaid expansion program that would have picked up the entire tab for enrollees' medical care. However, several Democrats from states that already expanded Medicaid raised objections because their states have to foot 10% of the bill, while the federal government picks up 90%.The bill would also increase the federal assistance for expansion states to 93% through 2025.And it would require state Medicaid programs to provide 12 months of eligibility to women after they give birth. States now typically provide 60 days of coverage.Medicare hearing benefits: Hearing services would be covered under Medicare, starting in 2023, but vision and dental benefits would not be included. Only 30% of seniors over age 70 who could benefit from hearing aids have ever used them, the White House said.This measure would cost $36.7 billion, according to the CBO.Climate change: The bill would deliver nearly $570 billion in tax credits and investments aimed at combating climate change. It would offer tax credits to families that install solar rooftops or buy electric vehicles, for example. The investments are aimed at providing incentives to grow domestic supply chains in solar and wind industries. The legislation also calls for creating 300,000 jobs by establishing a Civilian Climate Corps that works to conserve public lands and bolster community resiliency.Affordable housing: The legislation would funnel $25 billion into the construction, rehabilitation or purchase of affordable homes for low-income people and for the creation and preservation of affordable rental housing. It would provide $65 billion to address the capital needs backlog of public housing and would bolster rental assistance to hundreds of thousands of families. The measure would also invest in down payment assistance and in community-led redevelopment projects in under-resourced neighborhoods. And it would provide $24 billion to fund housing vouchers and supportive services.The effort would cost about $148.1 billion, according to the CBO.Pell grants: The measure would increase the maximum Pell grant by $550 for more than 5 million students enrolled in public and private nonprofit colleges and expand access to undocumented students brought to the US as children, who are known as Dreamers.It would invest in historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve underrepresented communities. And it would increase funding for workforce development.These provisions would cost a total of $39.8 billion, according to the CBO's estimate.Children's nutrition: The bill would expand free school meals to nearly 9 million children during the school year and provide the parents of 29 million kids a $65 per child per month benefit to purchase food during the summer.Immigration: The President has called for a $100 billion investment to reform the nation's immigration system, as well as reduce backlogs, expand legal representation and make changes to the asylum system and border processing. But the Senate parliamentarian, who has the final say on whether the legislation adheres to procedural rules, has ruled twice against arguments from Democrats to include an immigration provision in the economic bill. Still, some Democrats are continuing to push to include protections for undocumented immigrants in the bill and plan to present another plan to the parliamentarian. The cost of the immigration provision is not currently included in the total cost of the legislation. State and local tax deduction: It is critical to some Democrats from the Northeast and West Coast that the package lifts or repeals the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, that was put in place by the Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. Under the House bill, deductions would be capped at $80,000 per year over a nine-year time span. But many Democrats are opposed to lifting the cap, which would largely benefit higher-income households. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have proposed an income threshold limiting those who can deduct a higher amount.Here's how Democrats will pay for itThe Democrats fractured over measures to cover their original sweeping $3.5 trillion spending proposal. Initial plans to make companies and well-off Americans pay by raising the corporate tax rate and the top marginal individual income and capital gains rates were scuttled by Democratic moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.The party then floated a billionaire tax on the capital gains of the super-wealthy, but that quickly withered after resistance from Manchin, another key Democratic moderate, and several others in the Senate and House.Biden and congressional Democratic leaders ultimately settled on a mix of corporate and individual revenue raising measures, along with two prescription drug provisions.Under the House version, most middle-income families with children would get a tax cut in 2022 -- thanks to an expanded child tax credit -- and those without kids would generally see little change in their tax bills, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Overall, nearly 40% of households would see a tax cut and nearly 19% would pay more in 2022 than they do now, according to the analysis. However, about 70% of those earning more than $1 million a year would enjoy a tax cut.Corporate taxes: The bill would put in place a 15% minimum tax on the corporate profits that large companies report to shareholders, not to the Internal Revenue Service. This would apply to companies with more than $1 billion in profits. The legislation also includes a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks. Also, it would impose a 15% minimum tax, calculated on a country-by-country basis, that American companies pay on foreign profits, consistent with an agreement Biden recently won among 136 countries. The provisions would yield an estimated $814 billion, the Joint Committee on Taxation said.Taxes on the rich: The wealthiest Americans would pay a 5% surcharge on income above $10 million, and an additional 3% levy on income above $25 million. Next year, about 30,000 tax filers are expected to make $10 million or more, according to the Tax Policy Center. About 12,000 of them are likely to earn at least $25 million.The bill would also close the loopholes that allow some affluent taxpayers to avoid paying the 3.8% net investment income tax on their earnings. And it would continue the limitation on excess business losses. This measure would raise $640 billion, the committee estimates.IRS enforcement: The bill would beef up IRS enforcement so that it can ensure that people are paying what they owe to Uncle Sam. The new enforcement measure would focus on Americans with the highest incomes, not those earning less than $400,000 a year. The CBO estimates that the provision would raise revenue by $207 billion -- far less than the $400 billion that the Treasury Department had projected. But White House officials have been arguing for weeks that the numbers would not line up due to methodological differences, criticizing the way the CBO accounts for the indirect effects the enhanced enforcement would have. Medicare drug negotiation: The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors' offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services Secretary would negotiate up to 10 drugs in 2025. The number would rise to up to 20 medications starting in 2028. This controversial provision, which was dropped from the package and then restored after a deal was reached in the Senate, is a far more limited proposal than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past.The legislation would also impose penalties if drug companies increase their prices faster than inflation. And it would redesign Medicare's Part D drug plans so that seniors and people with disabilities wouldn't pay more than $2,000 for medications bought at the pharmacy. The bill would also cap what Americans pay for insulin at $35 a month.About 10 fewer drugs would be introduced in the US market over the next three decades if the bill were enacted, the CBO projects. About 1,300 drugs are expected to be approved over that time period under current law, the agency said.Drug rebate rule: The bill calls for blocking the implementation of a Trump administration regulation that would change the drug industry's rebate system, though it isn't set to go into effect until 2026. The rule effectively would ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers. Instead, drug companies would be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. Altogether, the prescription drug measures would save around $297 billion, including about $79 billion from allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, according to the CBO. Prior House efforts to permit drug price negotiations would have saved far more.Here's what's out:Free community college: Biden initially called for making tuition free for two years at community colleges, but it's been dropped entirely from the bill.Medicare dental and vision benefits: The bill does not include expanding Medicare to include vision and dental coverage, both longtime goals of Sanders. Dental coverage, in particular, would have been costly.This story has been updated with details on the House passage of the bill and Congressional Budget Office estimates of its cost.",0
1646," (CNN)Netflix didn't make ""Tiger King 2"" available in advance, and zapping through it, it's easier to understand why.Adding relatively little to the story, and jumping all over the place, the project is mostly defined by how self-referential it is, with almost all roads leading back to the impact of the original docuseries, which was, let's face it, 19 months ago. If you're feeling nostalgic for the the early days of the pandemic for some reason or eager to see what Joe Exotic (as well as several lawyers) are up to, the five-episode season of ""Tiger King 2"" is streaming now on Netflix.The docuseries picks up where the first season left off, with Joseph Maldonado-Passage serving a 22-year prison sentence for violating the Endangered Species Act and an attempted murder-for-hire plot against rival big cat sanctuary owner Carole Baskin.Baskin and her current husband, Howard, have said they felt betrayed by their portrayal in the first season of the show and declined to participate in the second. The series revisits the disappearance of Baskin's first husband, Don Lewis, but doesn't shed new light.The rest of the returning cast of colorful characters seem to be enjoying the notoriety ""Tiger King"" has brought them.The timing of ""Tiger King's"" initial release in March of 2020, in hindsight, couldn't have been better. The timing now feels like a bit of a snooze. Assuming that counts as the concept's second life, let's hope nobody's planning on seven more.",0
1647,"THE STORY of a quiet revolution in asset management begins with Jack Bogle. Actually, it starts in 1974 when Paul Samuelson, an economist and Nobel prizewinner, published an article in the Journal of Portfolio Management arguing that the bulk of mutual-fund managers should go out of business. Most failed to beat the market average and those that did could not be relied upon to repeat the trick. An archetype was required. Someone should set up a low-cost, low-churn fund that would do nothing more than hold the constituents of the S 500. Mr Bogle decided that Vanguard, the mutual-fund group he founded in 1975, should take up the challenge. His index fund was denounced on Wall Street as unAmerican. It received only a trickle of inflows. But by the time of Bogle’s death last year, Vanguard was one of the world’s biggest asset managers, largely on the strength of its index funds.
An investor can now buy exposure to the market return (beta, as it is known) for a few basis points. Indeed, “beta is becoming free” is an article of faith among industry bigwigs. Technology allows access to stockmarkets at vanishingly low cost. BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, the other firms of a leading triumvirate, owe their growing heft to index (or “passive”) investing. These three are the industry’s big winners; everyone else is “fighting for scraps”, as the boss of a midsized asset manager puts it.

These firms benefit from a virtuous circle, in which lower costs mean lower fees, more inflows and yet lower costs. Their dominance is only the most salient sign of consolidation in the asset-management industry. The biggest firms are getting bigger. A global elite has emerged of firms that each manage more than a trillion dollars in assets. Unsurprisingly the idea has taken hold that size is a strategic advantage. If you are not a niche player in an industry, you had better be a scale one, says business-school wisdom. No one wants to be stuck in the middle.
Bigger is not always better in asset management. A point arrives when size becomes a spoiler of performance. The portfolio manager may lose focus. The size of the fund begins to push up trading costs, notably in illiquid assets in which the buying and selling of large tranches tends to move prices adversely. But asset managers benefit from operational gearing. As the value of managed assets goes up, profits rise even faster. Fees are a fixed percentage of assets under management: the bigger the fund, the higher the revenues. But costs—mostly the wages of research analysts, office space, marketing and so on—do not rise in lock-step.

Scale is both a friend and an enemy, says Manny Roman, boss of PIMCO, a giant fixed-income manager. If you have a lot of exposure to bad positions, it is hard to escape. But buying at scale can also mean keener prices—on new corporate-bond issues or from a seller looking to get out of a big position. There are other advantages. Research capabilities and technological muscle can be spread over a large number of similar markets and securities.
Industry types distinguish between manufacturing (managing assets) and distribution (selling funds to retail investors). Fidelity, a family-owned Boston-based giant, does both. Scale matters in retail distribution, where brand is important. In indexing there is also a real scale advantage, says Cyrus Taraporevala, of State Street Global Advisors. Index funds hold stocks in proportion to their market capitalisation—by the value weighting in the index. Trading costs are tiny. The fund buys a stock when it qualifies for the index (as a handful of new ones do each year) and sells any that drop out. In between it simply holds them. The market for large-capitalisation stocks is liquid enough to absorb sales or purchases whenever index funds need to match inflows or redemptions. The marginal cost of running an ever-bigger fund is trivial: it just requires a bit more computing power. There are no expensive portfolio managers.
Beta is not the only passive strategy. Trillions of dollars are also invested in “factor-based” or “smart-beta” strategies. These rely on powerful computers to sort stocks by characteristics, such as low price-to-book (“value”) or high profitability (“quality”), that have been shown to beat market averages in the long run. The churn in these portfolios is higher than for index shares. But the analysis and trading are automated. Increasingly bond investing is going passive, too. The value of bonds held in exchange-traded funds (or ETFs, baskets of securities listed on an exchange like company shares) passed $1trn last year. The largest bond ETFs track an index, such as the Bloomberg-Barclays Aggregate, and are often more liquid than the individual bonds they contain. Factor-based bond ETFs are also growing in popularity.
The growth of the big three passive managers is part of a trend towards greater industry concentration. Of assets managed worldwide by the industry’s leading 500 firms, the proportion managed by the top 20 firms has risen from 37% in 2005 to 42% now. But the search for scale economies to offset pressure on fees is not the only factor behind this. The bigger fund-management groups increasingly look to offer expertise across asset classes, from large-cap equities to private assets. A lot of asset managers, including BlackRock, are betting on the benefits of scope as much as scale.

The heads of big pension funds now want three things, says David Hunt, boss of PGIM, the asset-management arm of Prudential Financial, an insurance giant. They want to understand their whole portfolio of assets (to get a sense of how diversified it is); to push fees down by concentrating their buying power; and to have a long-term relationship with asset managers. That means cutting the number they use. So managers offering the full spectrum of products (stocks, bonds, property, private assets and so on) will have an edge. This trend towards fewer managers is happening on the retail side as well. The proliferation of funds sows confusion. There is too much choice. So the retail gatekeepers—the brokerages, online platforms and mobile apps—are starting to cut back the number of funds they carry.
If index funds and ETFs are winning investors, who is losing them? One way to infer this is the spread of fees. The more liquid the assets, the greater the fee pressure. The managers of so-called “core” active funds, generally large-company shares listed in rich-world stockmarkets, have seen fees fall towards the indexers’ level. It is hard to categorise but industry wisdom is that “closet indexers” are gradually being winnowed out. These funds are ostensibly “active” (ie, they are stockpickers) but they manage their portfolios to ensure that their performance does not deviate much from the index.
For all the talk about polarisation, the change in asset management is not that dramatic. The squeezed middle—firms in the top 250 but outside the top 20—have lost around five percentage points of market share since 2005. But they retain a 50% share. Inflows follow performance, but outflows do not. Investors are remarkably conservative. For individuals, a move from one mutual fund to another often triggers capital-gains tax. Institutional investors suffer from inertia, or perhaps from a failure of nerve. What if your underperforming active managers suddenly improve after you drop them? As a consequence, says an executive at a big asset manager, the industry’s market structure “forms like stalactites and stalagmites—drip by drip”.
In any other industry, mergers would speed up the sorting into scale and niche. There has been a spate of tie-ups in recent years: Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management in Scotland; the marriage of Janus, an American outfit, with Henderson, a British one; Invesco and Oppenheimer; and Franklin Templeton and Legg Mason. None has been a roaring success. Perhaps that is not surprising. In an industry where human capital plays a big role, it is not easy to find cost savings. People are not as fungible as offices. Integrating IT systems is a headache. Corporate-culture clashes are common. There is a risk of losing clients if things go wrong—and even if they don’t. New clients will steer clear while a merger is pending.
Despite the pitfalls, the merger wave continues. Morgan Stanley recently acquired Eaton Vance to fold into its asset-management business. Nelson Peltz, an activist investor, has taken biggish stakes in Janus-Henderson and Invesco with a view to pursuing mergers. The industry seems set for a shake-up. A bold response for a midsized firm would be to downsize: strip back to the core; cut prices; offer fewer products; and focus on those in which one has a chance to be distinctive. In a different industry Steve Jobs followed something like this strategy when he returned to Apple in 1996. Apple was fighting for its survival, however. Things are not that desperate in asset management. The fee pressure on new business is intense, but a lot of existing customers will stay put. A mediocre firm with a big back-book can stay alive for quite a while.
Perhaps that explains all the talk of “zombie” asset managers—firms from which life is slowly draining as their initially fat margins grow ever thinner. Is there another means of escape? The virtue of passive funds is their low cost; they buy stocks in the index or whatever the quantitative screen prescribes. There is no need to think deeply about the companies behind the securities. But that virtue is also a vice. Investors increasingly care about what companies do. And many active asset managers hope there might be a living from that.■",2
1648,"JUST OCCASIONALLY, you can see the tectonic plates of geopolitics shifting in front of your eyes. Suez in 1956, Nixon going to China in 1972 and the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 are among the examples in living memory. The unveiling last week of a trilateral defence pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (introducing the awkward acronym of AUKUS) is providing another of those rare occasions. 
AUKUS envisages a wide range of diplomatic and technological collaboration, from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence, but at its core is an agreement to start consultations to help Australia acquire a fleet of nuclear-propelled (though not nuclear-armed) submarines. One consequence of this is Australia cancelling a contract, worth tens of billions of dollars, signed in 2016 with France for diesel-electric submarines. In announcing AUKUS on September 15th with the prime ministers of Australia and Britain, Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson, President Joe Biden stressed that it was about “investing in our greatest source of strength—our alliances”.  However, America’s oldest ally, France, has reacted with understandable fury. Jean-Yves Le Drian, its foreign minister, called it a “stab in the back”. On September 17th President Emmanuel Macron withdrew France’s ambassadors from Washington and Canberra (though not London). 
The powerful reverberations of AUKUS show what a profound shift it represents. For America it is the most dramatic move yet in its determination to counter what it sees as the growing threat from China, particularly the maritime challenge it poses in the Pacific. Not only is America sharing the crown jewels of military technology, the propulsion plant for nuclear submarines, with an ally for only the second time in 63 years (the other time being with Britain). It is also robustly signalling its long-term commitment to what it calls a “free and open Indo-Pacific”. 

Many countries in the region which share the sense of threat from China welcome that. AUKUS will now provide a potent backdrop for the first in-person meeting of leaders of the Quad—America, Australia, India and Japan—in Washington, DC, on September 24th. Last month, amid a chaotic withdrawal from Kabul, there was talk of America’s lack of staying power and a loss of faith among its allies. For all the anger in Paris, AUKUS changes that narrative. “The larger significance of this is that the United States is doubling down on its allies, and its allies are doubling down on the United States,” says Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney. “Unfortunately, France is collateral damage.”
In Australian eyes the developments that led to AUKUS were largely made in China. It was the heavy-handed pressure that China has applied on Australia, the most striking recent example being the response to its call for an independent investigation into the origins of covid-19, that led to urgent interest in ways to push back. Ditching the submarine contract with France was a bold move. Although the deal with Naval Group, a company in which the French state has a majority stake, had run into difficulties over its escalating costs and delays, and had few friends among politicians or the press, it was nevertheless one of the largest contracts in the history of Australia and was widely thought to be too big to dump. That the government has done so, despite the prospect of hefty penalties, reflects both the scale of its bet on America as an ally and the attractions of the submarine technology it will obtain: far stealthier and with far longer range than the diesel-electric ones.
Britain may be the least important of the AUKUS trio; certainly, its role is belittled in the French decision not to recall its ambassador to London (Mr Le Drian called Britain the “third wheel” in the deal). Even so, for Mr Johnson the pact illustrates his country’s changing role in the world. It conveniently chimes with the post-Brexit effort to promote “Global Britain” (henceforth to be energetically championed by a new foreign secretary, Liz Truss). And it gives substance to the “tilt to the Indo-Pacific” that was embraced in a comprehensive review of foreign and defence policy published in March. 
For the French, too, AUKUS crystallises what they view as profound realities in international relations, notably the idea that Europe needs more “strategic autonomy” so as not to depend excessively on America. However the muted reaction among France’s European partners casts familiar doubt on how serious such autonomy can be. After news of the AUKUS deal emerged, a German official called for “coherence and unity” among Western powers, which he said would require “a lot of effort” to bring about. France has concluded that it will struggle for fair treatment in the face of the reflexes of Anglophone allies to club together (the trilateral deal comes on top of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance that involves the same three countries plus Canada and New Zealand). But French fury, especially against Australia, is also driven by a personal sense of betrayal.
That goes beyond the loss of a giant contract, painful as that is. France sets great store by its role in the Indo-Pacific region, where it keeps some 7,000 troops and has nearly 2m citizens, including in its island territories such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia. It has been assiduously building what it thought was an ever-closer relationship with Australia. As recently as August 30th the communiqué from high-level Australian-French ministerial consultations spoke of “the strength of our strategic partnership” across many areas, and stressed “the importance of the Future Submarine programme”. Yet neither at that summit nor at the many others over the months when AUKUS was in the works was France given any notice of it. The “six months of secrecy” was “quite a performance,” says François Heisbourg, a French foreign-policy expert who through his think-tank had for years been involved in cultivating connections with Australia.
The fallout in France is one of several caveats to what otherwise appears to be a strategic coup for the three partners in AUKUS. The administration’s idea of working together with allies to check China makes sense. But a major split with a key ally—one with serious Indo-Pacific interests—hardly helps. Creative efforts will now be needed from the AUKUS squad to try to mitigate the damage.
Second, there is what this says about American diplomacy. The French were bound to be upset, but the handling of them was graceless. That comes on top of the Biden administration’s poor handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. One example of foreign-policy incompetence looks unfortunate; two in quick succession look like a pattern. That is not a good omen for the management of the relationship with China, which involves elements of military competition, economic laissez-faire and collaboration over, say, climate change and arms control.
Third, American foreign policy has often been criticised, including by Mr Biden, for placing too much emphasis on the military dimension and not enough on diplomacy and other tools. The nuclear-submarine initiative is a big move on the defence front, but China is increasingly powerful in the region on the economic and financial fronts. China responded to AUKUS by criticising its “cold-war mentality”. The next day it applied to join the CPTPP, an 11-country transpacific trade pact that America helped to instigate as a way to limit China’s influence, but then abandoned. 
There is no quick fix for America’s mistakes in economic policy. Indeed, the rivalry between China and America, together with its allies, will play out across many areas over many years. It is the defining geopolitical challenge of the 21st century. And now in AUKUS it has acquired a new landmark.",2
1649,"ONE YEAR ago, America’s Democrats were celebrating: Joe Biden had just made Donald Trump a one-term president. This year’s (much smaller) election day left them in a considerably grimmer mood. In Virginia, Glenn Youngkin became the first Republican to win a gubernatorial race since 2009. Democrats are on course to lose the lower chamber of the statehouse, as well as races for lieutenant-governor and attorney-general. In New Jersey, Phil Murphy, the incumbent governor, came within just a percentage point of losing despite winning by 14 points in 2017. The party’s progressive wing fared even worse: voters in Minneapolis rejected a measure to replace the city’s police department with a “Department of Public Safety,” and a socialist mayoral candidate in Buffalo, New York lost to her defeated primary opponent who was running as a write-in candidate. Partly these results simply hew to form: the party in power tends to fare poorly in off-year elections. But the size and shape of the defeat augurs ill for Democrats’ chances of holding their congressional majorities in next year’s midterm races.
A few factors may have exacerbated the Democrats’ poor performance. Mr Biden had hoped to have Democratic candidates boasting about all the party has accomplished so far. But his congressional agenda has stalled amid factional party infighting, which may have depressed the base. Terry McAuliffe, whom Mr Youngkin defeated, ran a flat-footed campaign focused almost entirely on Mr Trump, who was not on the ballot. Moderate Republican voters who supported Mr Biden last year to get Mr Trump out of office may have found their way back home.

Mr Youngkin, by contrast, appeared moderate enough for moderates and Trumpy enough for farther-right voters, running up Belarusian margins in white rural counties. His campaign focused on parents’ rights and education; he vowed to ban critical-race theory from being taught in schools (which it is not). Mr McAuliffe called that tactic a racist dog-whistle, but failed to muster a more persuasive response or present a broader positive vision for the state. New Jersey’s race followed a similar pattern. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor, ran a moderate campaign focused on cutting taxes, and he avoided mentioning Mr Trump. That may have helped him win independents, while Mr Murphy’s low-key style (perhaps along with some complacency) may have kept Democratic turnout low.
The bigger force at play, however, is the typical backlash against the party that controls the White House. The off-year Virginia governor’s race has swung against a newly elected president in every contest since 1981. The average swing in vote margins against the incumbent party is about ten percentage points, though the penalty can be as high as 17 in rare cases. In comparison, the two Democrats’ margins in New Jersey and Virginia were 14 percentage points lower on average than Mr Biden’s margin against Mr Trump there in 2020. In other words, the merits or detriments of individual candidates notwithstanding, Democrats faced predictable patterns of revolt against the ruling party.
Democracy in America is “thermostatic”, observed Christopher Wlezien, a political scientist, in a 1995 journal article establishing a theory of politics bearing the same name. He used data on preferences and levels of government spending to show they move in a slightly inverse relationship. As the government spends more money, people want it to spend less—and vice versa. And elections are also somewhat thermostatic. Once a party takes power, its members tend to become the target of peoples’ dissatisfactions about whatever grievances they have against their government, and they get voted out. The nationwide swings against Democrats on Tuesday are further evidence of this trend. Covid-19 and supply-chain woes, for instance, may not be Mr Biden’s fault, but the president takes the blame.
Yet this implies Democrats are powerless to combat electoral losses, which they are not. Though results from elsewhere in the country seem to offer hints on the surface, they do not offer a clear answer to the party’s dilemmas. Much has been made of the results of a referendum to replace the police department in Minneapolis, Minnesota with a “Department of Public Safety” that would have been focused less on punishment and traditional law-enforcement tactics and more on addressing social inequities and causes of crime. The failure of such a “woke” pipe-dream in a liberal city could be seen as a rebuke of the Democratic Party’s most left-leaning members and their toxicity to the brand, were it not for the results of a vote in Austin, Texas, where voters rejected a proposition that would have increased the funding and staffing for their own cops. More than anything the mood among America’s voters seemed to be a reflection of the general unpopularity of the Democratic Party and its leader.
The thermostat will probably continue to get colder. Not only have voters tended to side against presidents in off-year governors’ races, they also tend to punish them in mid-term elections to Congress. Since 1934, the party controlling the White House has lost an average of 28 seats in the House and four seats in the Senate. A thermostatic backlash threatens the party’s control of Congress for at least five years, and perhaps the next four after that.
Were Mr Biden or Kamala Harris, his vice-president, to win the presidential election in 2024 but lose in 2028 (presidents usually win two terms), thermostatic dynamics would not favour the Democrats until the first mid-term of a Republican presidency in 2030. But even in the scenario Mr Biden or some other Democrat were to lose in 2024 and Democrats regain control of Congress in 2026, that would still leave them without legislative power for two cycles after next year’s mid-terms. If the results on November 3rd stem largely from the typical patterns of American politics, they portend a dark decade ahead for the Democrats, notwithstanding Mr Biden’s plummeting approval ratings. And this week’s shellacking suggests that the party has no sound strategy for how to combat such trends.

1650,"IN THE DUNES north of Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the sun sets and the party begins. Girls discard their abayas, the black shrouds that envelop them in public, and begin jiving to techno music with boys. A few swig from bottles, but most prefer Captagon pills, nowadays the Gulf’s favourite drug, at $25 a pop. They call it Abu Hilalain (Father of Two Half-moons), after the two letter “c”s (for Captagon) embossed on the pills. Part of the amphetamine family, it can have a similar effect to Viagra—and conquers sleep. “With one pill,” says a raver, “we can dance all weekend.”
Though Saudi rulers have opposed the regime in Syria for a decade, the pill-popping by young people is funding it. For Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, the drug has become a boon—at least in the short run. His country has become the world’s prime pusher of Captagon. As the formal economy collapses under the burden of war, sanctions and the predatory rule of the Assads, the drug has become Syria’s main export and source of hard currency. The Centre for Operational Analysis and Research (COAR), a Cyprus-based consultancy, reckons that last year authorities elsewhere seized Syrian drugs with a street value of no less than $3.4bn. That compares with Syria’s largest legal export, olive oil, which is worth some $122m a year. The drug is financing the central government, says Ian Larson, who wrote a recent report on the subject for COAR.

Syria has long been involved in drugs. In the 1990s, when it ruled Lebanon, the Bekaa valley was the region’s main source of hashish. But mass production of drugs within Syria began only after the civil war erupted in 2011. Officers fed their men “Captain Courage”, as they called Captagon. Shia fighters from Afghanistan and Lebanon, who came to support the Syrian regime, brought their skills in making and trafficking drugs. Hizbullah, Lebanon’s biggest Shia militia, which has given crucial support to the Assad regime, acquired large tracts across the border in Syria’s Qalamoun mountains. They expanded hashish cultivation and developed a new cottage industry, making Captagon pills.
Syria began exporting them in about 2013, as its formal economy shrivelled, thanks to war, economic sanctions and corruption within the regime. Chemical plants in the cities of Aleppo and Homs have been converted into pill factories. In the Gulf the mark-up for pills can be 50 times their cost in Syria. Smugglers hide them in shipments of paper rolls, parquet flooring and even pomegranates. Saudi princes use private jets to bring the stuff in.
Seizures by police in foreign waters testify to the size of the trade. Italian police last year uncovered 84m pills worth over €1bn on a single ship. It was then said to be the world’s biggest interception of amphetamine-related drugs. In May the Malaysian authorities, acting on a Saudi tip-off, seized 95m pills. The Libyan port of Benghazi, linked by a regular shipping route to Syria, is said to be a key entrepot.

The Assads insist they are not involved. “Propaganda”, says Shadi al-Ahmad, an economist in Damascus, the capital, who is loyal to the regime. But because Mr Assad finds it hard to pay his troops, he farms out much of his country to warlords who oversee the smuggling. The army’s fourth division, which is commanded by Maher al-Assad, the president’s younger brother, is said to take a big cut. Other relations run operations at the Mediterranean ports of Latakia and Tartous. A Lebanese drug-runner close to Hizbullah and wanted by Interpol boasts on Facebook of his ties to the Assads and senior Hizbullah clerics. “It’s out of control,” says an insider in Damascus.
The regime may see Captagon as a lever in regional power struggles. It “uses drugs as a weapon against the Gulf”, says Malik al-Abdeh, a Syria watcher close to the opposition. “The message is: normalise relations, or we’ll destroy your youth.”
In any event, the regime’s loyalists are not the only ones involved. The Kurds who control Iraq’s north-eastern border with Turkey draw on the experience of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which operates routes through the mountains to Europe. Sunni Syrian rebels under Turkish protection in northern Syria are at it too. And the route south through Jordan to Saudi Arabia is getting busier. “All the militias get their earnings from smuggling drugs,” says a tribal leader in southern Syria. He says southern militias have helped thousands of refugees cross the border into Jordan, their knapsacks full of pills.
For the Syrians left behind, drugs may destroy what remains of society after a decade of civil war.  “Young men who haven’t been killed, exiled or jailed are addicts,” says a social worker in Sweida, a city held by the Assads in the south. A recent survey of Syrians in the north found that in January this year 33% said they knew a drug user. That is up from 7% in 2019. So prevalent is the habit that during this year’s Ramadan, in April and May, the prime-time serial on state television was “On a Hot Plate”, portraying a family of drug dealers.",2
1651,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",3
1652,"THE COUNTER of Fahad Subeihi’s falafel stand is stacked with piles of sliced tomatoes, onions and pickled turnips dyed pink. “The students love it,” he says. Mr Subeihi’s stand is located in the Jabal Amman neighbourhood of Jordan’s capital, Amman, amid a bevy of Arabic-language schools. Mr Subeihi estimates that, before the pandemic, half of his customers were foreigners, mostly Western students.
Jordan has cornered the market in Arabic-language training in the region. Unlike many of its neighbours, it is relatively stable and at peace. Its nickname, the “Hashemite Kingdom of Boredom”, may turn off thrill-seekers. But it attracts Western universities and grant programmes, which have largely stopped sending students to more volatile countries.

“Amman has become our largest centre,” says Pauline Koetschet of the French Institute of the Near East (IFPO), which teaches mainly European students. IFPO used to have centres in Aleppo and Damascus, but closed them because of Syria’s civil war. It still has a centre in Beirut, Lebanon’s unruly capital, but schools are increasingly worried about sending students there. “We have universities that tend to prefer Amman for security,” she says.
Oman and Morocco also offer stability, but Jordan has other advantages. Unlike Oman, at the tip of the Arabian peninsula, Jordan is in the heart of the Arab world. And although Morocco is still a popular destination, its dialect, called darija, is difficult to understand. Jordan’s, on the other hand, is close to the Modern Standard Arabic taught in most Western classrooms.
“I feel like Amman has a monopoly on Arabic-language students from America,” says Patrick, who studied Arabic on a grant from Boren, a language programme funded by America’s Defence Department. In normal times Jordan is Boren’s second-most popular destination for grant recipients after Taiwan. (Arabic and Mandarin are languages the programme deems crucial to national security.) Students on Boren grants cannot train in countries for which the State Department has issued high-level travel advisories, which have become common during the pandemic. Even before, though, the rule meant nearly all of Jordan’s neighbours were out of luck.
The pandemic has cut into the number of Arabic-language students travelling to the region, so Jordan has been hit particularly hard. Katy Whiting of the Sijal Institute, an Arabic-language school in Jabal Amman, says that normally over 200 students would be enrolled at Sijal during the summer. As it is, 30 are attending classes in person and another 30 are studying online.
The absence of students has hurt neighbourhoods like Jabal Amman, which is eerily quiet. Muhammad Zuher says his restaurant, Kmajeh, near the popular Rainbow Street, used to draw a steady crowd of Western students. Now it is largely empty. Still, he is confident the students will return. “They want security, safety and to practise Arabic with locals,” he says. “Welcome to Jordan.” ■",2
1653,"HANNAH TANG, a company manager in Beijing, first went under the knife when she was 18. The surgeon made an incision across each of her eyelids, then stitched folds of skin back to transform her monolids into “double eyelids”. The result was eyes that look bigger, rounder, and in Ms Tang’s opinion, more beautiful. Now 35, Ms Tang (not her real name) has since had two more eyelid surgeries, as well as botox injections in her neck and monthly non-invasive “skin booster” treatments. “Pretty much everyone I know around me has had fillers or surgery,” she says.
China’s cosmetic-surgery market is booming. Some analysts think it is now the world’s biggest. In 2019 the Chinese “medical-aesthetics” industry (which includes surgery, injections and skin treatments) had revenue of $27bn, around one-fifth of the global total, estimates Deloitte, a consultancy. It reckons the average annual rate of growth in China’s market between 2015 and 2019 was 29%, compared with a global average of around 9%. By 2023, Deloitte estimates revenue will reach $48bn.

Figures can be vague partly because “there is a huge hidden market” that goes unreported, says Yi Wu of Maastricht University in the Netherlands. For example Dongguan, a city in southern China, has over 6,000 unlicensed clinics but only 43 licensed ones. The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery has not included detailed data on China in its global reporting since 2011.
Starting young is common. In 2020 61% of patients were aged 16-25, up from 48% two years earlier. More than 90% are under 35, and 85% are female. In America, 81% of cosmetic-surgery patients are over 30 and nearly one-quarter are over 55. Ms Wu believes part of the reason young people have surgery is the influence of Confucian parenting, which means that children grow up without unconditional approval. This normally leads to academic pressure, she says, but it can also be internalised so that children feel the need to improve their appearance from a young age.
Double-eyelid surgery accounts for half of all treatments. (In America breast augmentations are the most popular procedure, although in 2020, the year of Zoom, more Americans fixed their noses than their breasts.) Some say the desire for rounder eyes is about looking more Western. But women care more about achieving the “golden ratio” of facial proportions, a more Chinese requirement, reckons Joyce Xu, who works in marketing in Beijing.
The golden ratio is an upside-down triangle: big eyes, relatively flat cheekbones, a narrow jaw and a small mouth. Ms Xu (also not her real name) started Botox injections to that end when she was 27.
As middle-class incomes have risen, surgery has become more affordable. Ms Xu’s quarterly injections are 3,000-5,000 yuan ($460-770) each time, which she deems a bargain. However, the popularity of such things has led to widespread fakery. An estimated two-thirds of injectables in China are unlicensed. In February Gao Liu, an actress, shared shocking pictures on social media of her botched nose job. It resulted in the tissue on the tip of her nose dying and turning black.
Horror stories such as Ms Gao’s may not slow growth. One consequence of starting on treatments so young is that your “baseline appearance gets forgotten,” notes Ms Wu. As a movie character almost said, there’s a great future in plastic surgery. ■",2
1654,"FEW COUNTRIES produce more cannabis than Morocco, where locals mix it with tobacco and call it kif, meaning “supreme happiness”. The pleasure extends to Europe, where much of the cannabis ends up. Farmers in the Rif, a poor mountainous region in northern Morocco, produce most of the supply. They operate in a legal grey area. Growing cannabis is against the law in Morocco, but it is tolerated in the Rif.
A bill passed by parliament, but yet to be approved by the king, may clarify the situation, at least somewhat. It would legalise the cultivation, use and export of cannabis for medical and industrial purposes (such as for hemp in textiles). The proposed law, though, would not legalise cannabis for recreational use. And it would allow cannabis farming only in certain regions of the country, such as the Rif.

The Rif has little else going for it. “There’s no infrastructure, no schools, no hospitals, nothing—nothing except cannabis,” says Charif Adardak, who heads an NGO that promotes development in the Rif. It has long been a restive place owing to the government’s neglect and what locals call hogra (humiliating treatment by the state). The previous king, Hassan II, crushed a revolt there in the 1950s. His son, Muhammad VI, has been more conciliatory, backing development projects in the region.
But King Muhammad’s plans have not got very far. Large protests by Riffians in recent years have at times turned violent. The region still relies on cannabis production. The government, in turn, sees its tolerance of the trade as a way to buy peace.

One of the reasons Morocco is moving towards legalisation now is because in December the UN removed cannabis for medicinal use from its list of the most dangerous drugs. The proposed law will improve the lot of Riffians and free them from international drug-smuggling networks, says Abdelouafi Laftit, Morocco’s interior minister. Regulating the trade may also allow the government to curb environmental damage in the Rif, which has suffered from deforestation and soil degradation as farmers have adopted new, hybrid strains of cannabis.
Many cannabis farmers in the Rif think the government is blowing smoke. Some fear they will be run out of business by corporations or well-connected businessmen who are better able to navigate the rules. Farmers in the Rif are unaccustomed to growing cannabis to the strict legal standards that importing countries often impose on the medicinal sort.
Others worry about future competition from other regions. There isn’t enough demand for medical cannabis to keep even the Rif’s farmers in business. Cannabis is grown on 73,000 hectares of land in Morocco, says Tom Blickman of the Transnational Institute, a Dutch think-tank. Demand for medical cannabis might support between 5,000 and 8,000 hectares.
Demand is greater for industrial cannabis, but it is of lower value. Its production is “about quantity not quality”, says Mr Blickman. That’s bad for the Rif. Tucked away in the mountains, the region’s remoteness and inaccessibility make it an ideal place for illicit cannabis farming. But the production of industrial cannabis is easier in flat areas with better infrastructure that can support large farms.
People in the Rif are also frustrated that the proposed law does not provide amnesty for the roughly 48,000 farmers who have cannabis-related arrest warrants hanging over them. Some, though, see the law as a prelude to legalisation of recreational cannabis. That would make many Moroccans supremely happy. ■",2
1655,"IN 1745, AS the river Liffey, having broken its banks, clawed at the foundations of the house in which he sat, the young Edmund Burke experienced a strange, perverse thrill. The man who would go on to found modern conservatism drew inspiration from this experience in a later essay on the sublime, writing of the unmatched delight that terrible destruction could stir—provided that it is watched from a certain distance.
The most terrible thing about the spectacular scenes of destruction that have played out around the world over the past weeks is that there is no safe place from which to observe them. The ground under the German town of Erftstadt is torn apart like tissue paper by flood waters; Lytton in British Columbia is burned from the map just a day after setting a freakishly high temperature record; cars float like dead fish through the streets-turned-canals in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou. All the world feels at risk, and most of it is.

Greenhouse-gas emissions have produced a planet more than 1°C (1.8°F) warmer than it was in Burke’s pre-industrial days. Its atmosphere, stoked up and out of joint, is producing heavy weather in ways both predicted and surprising. And, with emissions continuing, it will get worse.
Unfortunately, 2021 will probably be one of the 21st century’s coolest years. If temperatures rise by 3°C above pre-industrial levels in the coming decades—as they might even if everyone manages to honour today’s firm pledges—large parts of the tropics risk becoming too hot for outdoor work. Coral reefs and the livelihoods that depend on them will vanish and the Amazon rainforest will become a ghost of itself. Severe harvest failures will be commonplace. Ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland will shrink past the point of no return, promising sea rises measured not in millimetres, as today’s are, but in metres.
Six years ago, in Paris, the countries of the world committed themselves to avoiding the worst of that nightmare by eliminating net greenhouse-gas emissions quickly enough to hold the temperature rise below 2°C. Their progress towards that end remains woefully inadequate. Yet even if their efforts increased dramatically enough to meet the 2°C goal, it would not stop forests from burning today; prairies would still dry out tomorrow, rivers break their banks and mountain glaciers disappear.
Cutting emissions is thus not enough. The world also urgently needs to invest in adapting to the changing climate. The good news is that adaptation makes political sense. People can clearly see the need for it. When a country invests in flood defences it benefits its own citizens above all others—there is no free-rider problem, as there could be for emissions reduction. Nor does all the money come from the public purse; companies and private individuals can see the need for adaptation and act on it. When they do not do so, insurance companies can open their eyes to the risks they are running.
Some adaptation is fairly easily set in place. Systems for warning Germans of coming floods will surely now improve. But other problems require much larger public investment, like that which has been put into water-management in the Netherlands. Rich countries can afford such things. Poor countries and poor people need help, which is why the Paris climate agreement calls for annual transfers of $100bn from rich to poor.
The rich countries have not yet lived up to their side of this. On July 20th John Kerry, President Joe Biden’s special envoy on climate change, reiterated America’s pledge to triple its support to $1.5bn for adaptation in poorer countries by 2024, part of a broader move to increase investment in adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. More such efforts are vital.
But they also have limits. Making do with less water may be possible; getting by on none is not. Some levels of temperature and humidity make outdoors activity impossible. There comes one flood too many, after which you abandon the land. When the reef is gone, it is gone.
If the Paris goal of keeping the rise below 2°C is met, the full extent of those limits will not be tested. But emission-cutting zeal may not accelerate as required. And the climate system could prove more sensitive than it has shown itself to be to date, as some scientists believe possible, producing more warming per tonne of carbon in the atmosphere.
Hence it is also prudent to study the most spectacular, and scary, form of adaptation: solar geoengineering. This seeks to make clouds or particle layers in the atmosphere a bit more mirror-like, reflecting away some sunlight. It cannot provide a straightforward equal and opposite response to greenhouse-gas warming; it will tend, for example, to reduce precipitation somewhat more than temperature, potentially changing rainfall patterns. But research over the past 15 years has suggested that solar geoengineering might significantly reduce some of the harms from greenhouse warming.
What nobody yet knows is how such schemes could be developed so as to reflect not just the interests of their instigators, but also those of all the countries they will affect. Different countries might seek different amounts of cooling; some ways of putting solar geoengineering into effect would help some regions while harming others. Nor is there yet a compelling rejoinder to the risk that the very idea of such things tomorrow reduces the incentive to be ambitious in cutting emissions today.
When good men do nothing
To think about solar geoengineering requires facing those problems—and the risk that powers with little interest in them may try out such schemes regardless. It also means facing squarely what kind of being humankind has become. Watching the rising waters of the Liffey, Burke “considered how little man is, yet in his mind how great…Master of all things, yet scarce can command anything.” Manipulating the climate that humanity has destabilised—unwittingly, at first—spurs similar thoughts of simultaneous power and impotence. It is not nature that humans cannot command, but themselves, in all their insignificance and world-altering might. ■

1656,"POLITICIANS’ PRIVATE finances are a big political issue in central Europe, as Andrej Babis well knows. Mr Babis, a billionaire who is prime minister of the Czech Republic, faces a general election on October 8th and 9th. A week before it, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a reporters’ alliance, released an extravaganza of leaks from 14 financial firms, which it called the “Pandora Papers”. It charges that Mr Babis transferred $22m through shell companies in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), a tax haven, in order to buy a villa near Cannes anonymously. Mr Babis was already facing years-long investigations over alleged conflicts of interest and improper receipt of EU subsidies by Agrofert, an agricultural business he founded. He denies any wrongdoing.
Mr Babis was not the only politician tagged. Wopke Hoekstra, the Netherlands’ finance minister, was shown to have invested €26,500 ($30,500) in a friend’s safari company, also through a shell company in the BVI. Mr Hoekstra kept his shares while serving as a senator but sold them before becoming a minister, and broke no laws. But his Christian Democratic party has officially promised to take “firm action” against the use of tax havens.

Like the consortium’s earlier investigations (which include the Panama Papers in 2016 and the Paradise Papers in 2017), the Pandora Papers show that secretive financial networks that can aid tax avoidance and money-laundering involve not just countries typically seen as corrupt, but many of those viewed as cleanly governed. Russians, Saudis and Americans are all heavily represented in the leaks. Besides the British Virgin Islands, the jurisdictions they used include Luxembourg and South Dakota.
For the politicians concerned, the leaks are embarrassing but not devastating. The Netherlands has been mired in coalition talks for more than six months, but Mr Hoekstra seems likely to keep his job. As for Mr Babis, he is a skilled populist whose supporters tolerate the accusations against him. His party is in first place in the polls. According to a survey, two-thirds of Czechs think the government is run mainly by private interests. But whereas Czechs complain that their politicians are dirty, they do not seem to bother to elect cleaner ones.",2
1657,"Oct 21 (Reuters) - When Sebastian Kanovich co-founded Latin American digital payments startup dLocal in Montevideo in 2016, he struggled to get global retailers to take him seriously.
""It took us a lot of No's before getting the first Yes,"" he told Reuters. ""We were not only from Latin America, but from Uruguay, not known for technology.""
Five years on, it's a different story.
dLocal (DLO.O) listed on the Nasdaq exchange in New York in June and is now worth $16 billion, thanks to partnerships with the likes of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Uber (UBER.N) in 30 countries, and other Latino tech firms are riding the wave.
In the first nine months of 2021, Latino startups from Brazil's online lender Nubank to Colombian delivery firm Rappi raised $14.8 billion in new money, a jump of 174% since last year, data provided to Reuters by CBInsights showed.
The Latino boom has caught the eye of some of the biggest names in private equity and venture capital such as SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. Now Wall Street's banks are looking to tap into the gold rush by taking more Latino ""unicorns"" public in the United States.
At least 10 Latin American tech startups including Brazil's apartment rental service QuintoAndar as well as Mexico's used-car dealer Kavak and fintechs Clip and Creditas are preparing initial public offerings (IPOs) for next year, six people with knowledge of the deals told Reuters.
All the sources requested anonymity as the discussions about the planned listings are confidential.
Kavak, QuintoAndar and Clip declined to comment. Creditas said it could not share any information about an IPO at this time.
Nubank, which counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) as an investor, is aiming for a valuation above $55 billion in a U.S. IPO next year to become the region's most valuable financial institution, Reuters reported in August.
GLOBAL ASPIRATIONS
The rise of Latin American unicorns - private firms worth at least $1 billion - is being driven by a once-in-a-generation internet boom that has accelerated under pandemic lockdowns as more shoppers move online, bankers and deals lawyers say.
""Companies in the region have matured in the last five years and now we think there will likely be between two and three IPOs by Latam tech companies per quarter by next year,"" said Rodrigo Maldonado, executive director at Morgan Stanley in Brazil, referring to U.S. listings.
While Latin America still lags Asia, Europe and the United States in terms of volumes of tech startups, the widespread and increasing use of smartphones, wireless networks and payments cards has created a ready demand for new digital services.
Smartphone-savvy consumers in the region have become increasingly comfortable with digital wallets and even starting to make virtual doctor appointments with smartphone apps.
That's why venture capitalists are still minting tech unicorns in Latin America, and some more established startups are pushing ahead with U.S. listing plans despite the recent market sell-off that hit technology stocks.
""If you look at the pipeline from Latam now, it is pretty amazing what could come from the region - not only from Brazil, but also from countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Peru,"" said Alex Ibrahim, head of International Capital Markets at the New York Stock Exchange.
""And a number of those high-growth startups from those countries are betting on big global markets like the United States,"" he said.
Many stock markets in Latin America are dominated by more traditional companies such as banks and commodities players, which is pushing startups to look north for listings. Tech firms account for less than 10% of Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index, for example, whereas they make up nearly a third of the S&P 500.
Gone are the days, though, when Latino startups were seen as a cheaper entry point for investors than U.S. ones. Most financing is now at valuations on a par with Silicon Valley rivals, investment bankers and venture capitalists told Reuters.
""I see multiples for startups in Brazil and Mexico as very similar to those elsewhere, (especially) if the company has global growth aspirations,"" said Martin Escobari, co-president at U.S. growth investor General Atlantic, which has a dozen Latin American startups in its portfolio.
There are still challenges for tech companies to overcome in the region, including a paucity of engineering talent.
General Atlantic estimates Latin America's universities train 40,000 software developers a year, far below the 100,000 it estimates the fast-growing tech sector needs annually.
Other factors such political and economic instability are also making investors more cautious when looking for businesses they believe will be resilient.
The region has a history of going from boom to bust too, such as in 2014-15 when a number of large investors pulled back following an economic downturn that doomed the prospects of several fledgling tech ventures.
But deep-pocketed investors, such as SoftBank and Sequoia, are betting this time is different, and are poised to rake in big returns from some early bets. Eye-popping gains are, in turn, inspiring a new generation of tech founders and investors.
""Tech companies first emerged in the region roughly 20 years ago, but only now all the building blocks are in place: infrastructure, entrepreneurs, venture capital investors and capital markets,"" said General Atlantic's Escobari.
FINTECH FAVORED
Startups focused on financial technology, or fintech, are mopping up much of the funding with a 40% share of the overall pot in 2020, according to LAVCA, the association for private equity in Latin America.
Many of them sell financial services to the ""unbanked"", or those unable to access traditional banking, and Brazil's Nubank, C6Bank, which is backed by JPMorgan (JPM.N), and SoftBank's Creditas have benefited most from the investor interest.
With fintech in vogue, non-financial startups such as Kavak and QuintoAndar have started offering financial services to consumers including car loans and insurance.
Sequoia has only made a half dozen Latin American investments - including Nubank and Rappi - but Sonya Huang, a partner at the venture capital firm, said it planned to back one or two companies a year, in sectors such as finance, e-commerce, health and education.
""The region is very different from the U.S. or Europe, but there are some big theses which have proved right globally - like digital or mobile-first banking - and they can be applied in the region,"" Huang told Reuters.
Japan's SoftBank renewed its bets on Latin America with a $3 billion fund last month, less than three years after launching its first regional fund. Since 2019, it has invested in roughly 50 Latino startups, said Alex Szapiro, SoftBank's head of Brazil and operating partner.
""Now, capital is basically a commodity for the region.""

1658,"BRAZIL SEEMS the sort of place where vaccination against covid-19 should have taken off quickly—and not just because it is suffering heavily from the disease. Impressive vaccine-making institutes—Butantan in São Paulo and Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro—provide excellent support for its existing immunisation programmes. Natália Pasternak, a microbiologist at the University of São Paulo, says that if it had put its mind to it, her country could have developed a vaccine all of its own.
Even though it did not take that route, Brazil has been intimately involved in the validation of covid-19 vaccines developed elsewhere, hosting four phase-three trials—in part, alas, because the high infection rate meant such trials could expect fairly quick results. One might have thought that would put the country first in line for deliveries. But as of the first week of January Brazil, a country of 212m, had just 6m doses of a covid-19 vaccine within its borders. Because that vaccine has yet to be approved by the country’s regulators, not one dose has been used.

Since December three covid-19 vaccines made by Western companies have been approved for use by regulatory bodies that the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers “stringent”. American and European regulators have endorsed two vaccines, one created by BioNTech, a German biotech company and produced by Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical firm, and one made by Moderna, an American biotech company. A vaccine created at Oxford University and produced by AstraZeneca, an Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, has been approved in Britain and India—the country which produces most of the vaccines used in developing countries. Vaccines made by Russia and China have also been authorised for use in their home countries and some others (see chart 1).

For there to be any vaccines, let alone a plethora of them, less than a year after the first cases of covid-19 were reported is an unprecedented achievement. It also brings new challenges. In rich countries, where most of the vaccine development went on and was paid for, these are primarily in manufacture and distribution: how to manage the logistical task of getting vaccines into the right people as fast as possible. Middle-income and poor countries face problems of acquisition. And everywhere disparities within and between countries are highlighting pre-existing inequalities and political dysfunction.
Brazil’s plight shows the damage that politics can do. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, has consistently mocked and minimised concern about covid-19. In early June João Doria, the governor of São Paulo, signed a deal with Sinovac, a Chinese biotech company, to host phase-three trials of its CoronaVac vaccine in his state; the deal gave the state 6m doses and the right to make 40m more at the Butantan Institute in São Paulo. Mr Bolsonaro, who had ignored overtures from vaccine-makers, scoffed at his rival’s move and poured scorn on the Chinese vaccine. In late July the central government did order 100m doses from AstraZeneca. But it is not as yet approved in Brazil, and production there, which will be handled by Fiocruz, will take months to certify and ramp up.
“No health secretary could imagine in his worst nightmare that this could happen,” says Fábio Vilas-Boas, the health secretary of Bahía, a state of 15m people in Brazil’s poor north-east. It is among dozens of cities and states that are following São Paulo’s lead in negotiating directly with vaccine-makers to guarantee supplies. Bahía has agreed to host trials of Sputnik V, a vaccine developed in Russia, in exchange for priority access to 50m doses. A group of private Brazilian clinics has agreed to buy 5m doses of Covaxin, an experimental vaccine developed by India’s Bharat Biotech which, to the surprise of many, was recently given approval for emergency use by Indian regulators.
This disturbing public-health scavenger hunt reflects a more general dynamic. The demonstrated efficacy of the three vaccines developed by Western pharmaceutical companies has made vaccination feel like an urgent possibility around the world, especially in middle-income countries like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa. But supplies of those vaccines have, by and large, been snapped up by the countries where they were developed and their rich-world neighbours.
What is more, two of those vaccines, the ones from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are delicate enough to require special treatment—and also pretty expensive. Seth Berkley, the boss of Gavi, a public-private initiative that distributes vaccines in low-income countries, says that outside the rich world the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is likely to be used only in very small populations, such as health workers in big cities.
It is the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine that has the most to offer the world at large. It is cheaper and more robust, and the expertise needed to manufacture it is reasonably widespread. There are plans for it to be manufactured at nine “nodes” around the world, allowing a great deal to be made. The node that matters most to Dr Berkley is that in South Korea. It will be producing the vaccine for COVAX, a consortium set up by Gavi and others that is devoted to providing covid-19 vaccines around the world.
Unfortunately, only the nodes in Britain and India have so far received regulatory approval and started production, and most of their production is slated for domestic use. Regulatory approval for the others, including Fiocruz in Brazil, may take some time. Dr Berkley expects approval for the South Korean node to take 40 days. After that the WHO will still have to weigh in before COVAX can get moving.

In a world where the supply of a cheap Western vaccine along these lines was already plentiful there would be little interest in the less well-attested vaccines from China, India and Russia. As it is, they provide a welcome option for some countries, as well as a fillip for their originators (see chart 2 ).
China and Russia see their vaccines as offering a boost to their prestige and soft power as well as providing them with trade and diplomatic opportunities. China wants to “project a narrative that it’s taking care of countries that have been left behind,” says Oliver Stuenkel of Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university in São Paulo. This kind of vaccine diplomacy could shape the geopolitics of 2021 and beyond.
Sigue Sigue Sputnik
In August Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, announced that the Gamaleya Centre in Moscow had developed the world’s first covid-19 vaccine: its precedence was underlined by naming it Sputnik V, a reference to the epoch-making satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. As Elena Amelina, who runs a research laboratory at Russia’s Pulmonology Research Institute, explains: “The goal was not just to produce a working and reliable vaccine, but to be seen as being ahead of the planet—as if it was an arms or a space race.”
The analogy, though, had a fatal flaw. No one doubted there had been a great leap forward when the Soviet Union launched the world’s first satellite: the pings Sputnik gave off as it circled Earth could be picked up on transistor radios. When it came to Sputnik V, though, you had to take Mr Putin’s word for it. The need for a speedy announcement had not allowed time for full trials; the data were scanty.
The Russian government thinks perception is everything. The human immune system takes a different view, and independent regulators try to follow its lead. The lack of reliable trial data prevented any acceptance of Sputnik V in the West. The same was true for the Sinovac vaccine which Chinese authorities approved for emergency use in August, and the vaccine from Sinopharm approved for general use there in December.
This does not mean that those vaccines do not work; just that they had not been shown to do so when first approved. Since then trials in various places have persuaded some regulators in other countries that the non-Western products are worth buying and safe enough to use. Others are waiting for further trials to report before taking the plunge.
In Bahrain, which has the second-highest vaccination rate globally, people have enthusiastically taken to the Sinopharm vaccine after supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab ran low; trials in the UAE have found it to have an 86% efficacy rate. Trials in Turkey and Indonesia suggest that CoronaVac provides protection, but data on its efficacy remain thin. Indonesia has since started vaccinating people of working age with CoronaVac—though not older people, because the data do not as yet seem to support it. The results of the São Paulo CoronaVac trial, which were due after The Economist went to press on January 7th, are eagerly awaited beyond Brazil.
Other forms of approbation are also available. Sputnik V is similar in its design to the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine—both use a harmless adenovirus to deliver a genetic transcript describing SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein—and in December AstraZeneca and the Gamaleya Centre agreed to work on trials that combine the two vaccines. Dr Amelina sees this as a chance for the Russian vaccine to improve its reputation, a view echoed elsewhere; Russian state media, meanwhile, have portrayed it as the West coming begging for help. If further investigations work out well, it is possible that the vaccine will end up more warmly received abroad than at home, where in December 58% of the Russian people, used to being lied to, told pollsters they would be unwilling to take it.
There is domestic hesitancy in China, too—and not without reason. The country has a long history of vaccine scandals. But the 1.5m vaccine doses that were distributed last year did not all go to people obliged by the government to take them, such as soldiers, party officials and labourers being sent abroad; some of the rich and well connected happily snagged doses for themselves. Mass vaccination programmes are now being introduced with ambitious goals but no great sense of urgency. The number of cases of covid-19 is tiny and life is close to normal.
Europe’s regiments

It is possible that in time Western governments will increase the amount of vaccine available to others. Many ordered more than they needed from various suppliers in order to be sure that they would get their hands on at least one that worked (see chart 3). Canada has dibs on enough doses to immunise 505% of its population; Britain and America have coverage of 290% and 200%, respectively. When they feel assured of a supply that will meet the needs of their fully up and running vaccination programmes, such countries will probably redirect what is surplus to requirements.
At the moment, though, a fully up-and-running programme is a rarity. This is particularly true in continental Europe, where vaccine roll-out has been much slower than in America and Britain (let alone Israel, which is leading the world). One reason seems to be that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is giving conditional approval for the vaccines, rather than simply authorising their emergency use. This higher standard has benefits, including not having to indemnify suppliers against lawsuits, but requires more data and takes more time. American and British regulators have been quicker.
Another problem is that the EU, acting as a bulk purchaser for its member states, plumped much more heavily for AstraZeneca’s product than for Pfizer’s—and the EMA has yet to approve the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. The EU also ordered a lot of the vaccine being developed by Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical company, in collaboration with GSK, a British one. Unfortunately, trials showed this vaccine to be poor at generating immunity in older patients. A new formulation may well put matters right. But it is unlikely to be approved and available much before the end of the year.
The final reason for low vaccination rates in Europe has to do with planning, logistics and the availability of appropriate workers. Most of the planning did not envisage the urgency which soaring case rates have added to the first weeks of the campaign. France’s plan, for example, involved repeated medical visits to ensure care-home residents gave informed consent, a time-consuming step which in the current circumstances has driven frustration. The speed of action varies not just from country to country but also from region to region. Some bits of Italy have already administered more than three-quarters of their initial allocation of vaccine. Others have barely managed a third of that.
The pace of vaccination may improve as a sense of urgency works its way through the system. President Emmanuel Macron has berated French ministers and health authorities, repudiating their public calls for patience as vaccination programmes are ramped up. Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, has put pressure on the EMA to pick up the pace. A fresh order of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is in the works.
America is doing better. Even so, only about a quarter of the 17m doses distributed up to January 5th were recorded as having been used by that date. Even allowing for a reporting lag, that means many sit untouched in the freezers. One reason is that a lot of planning focused on cold-storage capacity—needed by both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines—rather than actual administration. “We should have been focusing on ‘How many can you vaccinate today, tomorrow, the day after?’,” says Claire Hannan of the Association of Immunisation Managers.
Some states and cities are now adopting what California’s governor Gavin Newsom has called a “much more aggressive posture” in order to get vaccines used. His state is working to set up more vaccination sites, to enroll the National Guard to help and to allow dentists, pharmacists and other health professionals to do the jabs. Some states are drawing up rules whereby vaccines a health-care provider does not use after thawing are reallocated. Some other states in which health-care providers are not getting through all the vaccine allocated to them, including Florida and Texas, have started offering shots to everyone over 65, leading to a chaotic scramble for vaccination appointments at pharmacies and hospitals.
It is in Britain, though, that a sense of urgency has driven the most radical change from established procedure. A more infectious variant of covid-19 which was first identified in September has led to an unprecedented increase in cases and driven a new vaccination strategy. Following the advice of experts on the country’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the government’s chief medical officers have advised it to prioritise delivering first doses of vaccine over providing the expected second doses to those who have already received one. Second doses will still be supplied, but later.
Second doses increase the level of protection offered by the first dose and should extend that protection’s duration—both good for the person involved. Nevertheless, in the short term first doses on their own do more for the unvaccinated than second doses do for the vaccinated. So for every 1,000 people not given a second dose, and thus deprived of a marginal improvement in protection, 1,000 people can be given the substantial initial protection offered by a first dose alone. Half as much vaccination for twice as many people should slow both the rate of new cases and the spread of the disease.
On the question of whether delaying the second dose puts long-term protection at risk, the JCVI points to evidence from the trials of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine that longer gaps do not do any such harm, and may even improve protection. There is no information of this kind for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. On the question of how well the initial protection lasts if it is not boosted, though, there is little evidence to go on. In the trials, almost everyone who got a first dose got a second dose after three to four weeks.
The British government plans to vaccinate all of its four top-priority groups—care-home staff and residents, front-line health- and social-care workers, everyone over 70 and those with conditions that make them highly vulnerable—with a first dose by mid-February. Second doses may then take as long as three months.
Most of the criticism of this move has come from overseas, which may reflect a wariness by British scientists to cut across the government’s public-health messaging at a crucial time. There is a valid concern that patients will have much more certainty about the protection they will receive if they are vaccinated in exactly the same manner that trial participants were. And many patients consented to their first dose on the expectation they would get a second shot. Another worry is that the presence of a fairly large population of only-partially immune patients might encourage the development of viral strains that can get around the sort of protection that the different vaccines offer.
A last hurrah
That has to be measured against the fact that, before any of the trial data were in, the lowest acceptable efficacy for candidate vaccines was put at just 50%. First dose efficacy—which the JCVI puts at 90% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 70% for the AstraZeneca-Oxford one—would have to drop off fairly steeply to offer lower protection than that.
The outcome will be watched carefully. In various places, including Germany and Quebec, there are discussions of doing something similar. If it works, it will speed up the protection offered to whole populations. If it does not work, though, it may risk damaging confidence in vaccination well beyond Britain—damage that the world can ill afford.

In France, where anti-vaccine feeling has long been strong, only 40% of the population tell pollsters they are willing to be vaccinated (hence the high level of concern over consent). In Brazil, where vaccination has generally been popular, the number of people saying that they do not wish to be vaccinated has reached 22%, up from 9% in August; 50% do not want to be vaccinated with the Chinese vaccine on to which Mr Bolsonaro has poured scorn.

In America, a national survey conducted in December found that 29% of people working in health-care settings were hesitant about taking a covid vaccine. “For the most part we are seeing good uptake with health-care workers”, says Ms Hannan. But there are pockets of resistance. In Ohio, anecdotal evidence suggests that more than half of workers in nursing homes have turned down the jabs; in some counties in California 40-50% of front-line workers have said no. Rates of refusal are particularly high among black and Latino workers.
It is this background of distrust which makes it so important to get vaccination roll-outs, and the public-information campaigns around them, right. Mistakes—such as, in the worst case, the use of a batch of vaccines that proves harmful, or the discovery of a side-effect to a vaccine that regulators missed—could derail efforts in many countries.
But if there are risks of fear and distrust spreading quickly from country to country, a connected world also offers benefits when it comes to fighting a pandemic. The high level of support for COVAX shows that rich nations have a new willingness to help ensure that high-risk populations across the world have access to vaccination. It seems likely that Joe Biden’s administration will sign up to COVAX—Donald Trump’s had no interest in such things—improving the situation further. If America comes to see value in competing with Russia and China for the soft power bestowed by providing vaccines beyond its borders that will be all to the good.
This is the first global-health emergency in which new treatments are being rolled out to poor countries at about the same time as in richer ones. That process will undoubtedly be fraught with inequity. It is still worth celebrating. It is not, perhaps, as profound a break with the past as the ability to develop a quiver full of brand new jabs in less than a year. But it is impressive, and heartening. ■

1659,"CALL IT “Zoom face-envy”. Because of the rise of video-conferencing during the pandemic, legions now spend hours staring at their own faces and, inevitably, comparing them with those of others. Poor lighting and the skewed angles of laptop cameras are rarely flattering. Nor is “lockdown face”, brought on by stress, or a dearth of sunlight and exercise. For Kim, a 57-year-old actress in New York City, Zoom seemed to add ten pounds and a “crepey” look to her skin. After seeing “way too much” of that, she got a facelift last summer. She is delighted with the result. Similarly, Michèle Le Tournelle, a 62-year-old retiree near Nantes in France, said the “horrible” confinement turned into “a revelation”: it spurred her to undergo a slimming procedure and a facelift with which she has been “very, very, very” pleased.
Many cosmetic surgeons had expected the pandemic to hammer business. Instead the industry is enjoying a Zoom-boom. The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery reckons that the pandemic has led to a 10% increase in cosmetic surgery countrywide. In France, despite limits on elective procedures during the pandemic, cosmetic surgeries are up by nearly 20%, estimates the French Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. For Ashton Collins, the boss of Save Face, a firm in Cardiff that refers people seeking minimally invasive cosmetic treatments to the 852 (and counting) practitioners it has accredited across Britain, business is “through the roof”. In Italy, Pier Andrea Cicogna of Studio Cicogna, a plastic-surgery clinic in Treviso, says his revenue has risen by nearly a third despite more than three months of closure.

Every day can be Christmas
Apart from face-envy, other forces are at play. In the age of teleworking, patients can recover inconspicuously at home as bruises and swelling fade. It helps that professionals, the biggest clients for pricey cosmetic surgery, are more likely to work from home than many others. In normal times finagling time off work is a big hurdle (which is why Christmas breaks have traditionally been the high season for cosmetic surgery). Recuperation is made easier by the widespread use of face-masks, which neatly hide away the signs of surgery to the nose, chin, cheeks and jawline, as well as the “resurfacing” of facial skin and lip-plumping.
Money not spent on clothes, evenings out and travel has financed much of this. Gains in the stockmarket have also helped, says Alan Matarasso, whose clinic in New York is “being stretched” by requests for surgery. Intriguingly, Dr Matarasso, a former president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, thinks a more ethereal force is also at work: by casting light on “the fragility of life”, the pandemic is imbuing people with greater desire to squeeze more out of whatever time they have left.
Covid-19 has highlighted our helplessness, concurs Richie Chan, the head of cosmetic surgery at an OT Healthcare clinic in Hong Kong, which has enjoyed a roughly 15% rise in procedures; as a result people have become keener to exert control over their bodies through elective surgery. Pierfrancesco Cirillo, head of the Italian Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery in Rome, points to previous increases around the world in minimally invasive procedures following the 9/11 attacks (about 6%) and the global financial crisis (10%). The pandemic, he says, has coincided with a record rise in cosmetic surgery of about 12% in Italy.
Surgeons marvel at another recent change: before the pandemic, one in ten of Studio Cicogna’s surgery patients were men. Now it’s one in five. Most operations are for eyelids, noses and “love handles” liposuction. For minimally invasive skin rejuvenation, the proportion of male clients has risen from roughly one in eight to nearly half. In Britain men now account for about 40% of skin rejuvenations, says Save Face.
Zoom gloom
By highlighting her defects when she made calls for her PR job, Zoom had become demoralising, recalls a 47-year-old single mum in Milan: “I felt uglier.” Being stuck at home without occasion to dress up didn’t help. “I really needed to do something to feel better,” she says. Eyelid surgery wiped “ten years off my face”, she reports; the operation was “psychologically therapeutic”.
Such satisfaction is common, but it is not universal. Some psychologists fear that the boom in beauty treatments is encouraging an obsessive-compulsive disorder sometimes called dysmorphia. Sufferers obsess over an imagined or exaggerated body flaw. This can be magnified by a morose mood and a lack of normal social interaction—not to mention more time spent comparing oneself to others. As a result, Dr Cirillo says, cosmetic surgeons must work harder to turn down those with a pathologically confused self-image.
A less acute but more common problem is that a growing share of those asking for surgery seek an unattainable appearance. Dr Cirillo worries about the emergence of a “sort of supermarket” for aesthetic surgery in which less-principled surgeons accept patients with unhealthy or unrealistic aspirations. As they cash in, surgeons would be wise to avoid would-be patients who show up with photos of an envied celebrity. Success is more likely with those who, less ambitiously, present pictures of their younger selves.",2
1660,"MOLECULAR BIOLOGY is not a popularity contest. But if it were, it would be a partisan one. The evolutionary biologists would pledge their allegiance en masse to DNA. The sequences contained in its regular coils knit together the stories of almost all life on the planet. Pharmacologists, being of a more practical bent, would instead vote for proteins. Proteins are not about sequence, but about shape; their complex, irregular outlines, and the ways that they can change, allow them to do almost all of the biological work that gets done in cells. And it is thanks to the way that particular drug molecules fit into those shapes that almost all drugs have their effects.
There would be only a small following for ribonucleic acid (RNA), widely seen as a helpmeet molecule. It could be argued that the production of RNA is DNA’s main purpose; it is certainly true that the production of proteins would be nowhere without it. But it is a backstage operator, not a star; hewing wood and drawing water, hard working but hardly glamorous, appreciated only by devotees.

Or at least that was the case until vaccines made of RNA started giving protection against covid-19 to millions of people around the world every day. Now Cinderella has gone to the ball. Not only are RNA vaccines being considered for all sorts of other diseases, some of which have yielded to no other approach; other pharmaceutical uses of RNA look set to come into their own, as well. The way molecular biology is applied to medicine seems to be in the throes of revolution.
Incarnation incarnate
The great unifying truth of molecular biology, uncovered during the intellectual revolution which followed the discovery of DNA’s double-helix structure, is the way in which the worlds of shape and sequence are linked. The shape of a protein depends on the intricate way in which the chain of amino acids of which it consists is folded up. That depends in turn on the order in which amino acids of different types are strung together on that chain. And the order of the amino acids is a crucial part of the genetic information stored in the DNA sequences of the cell’s genome.
The transfer of information from the staid archival form it takes in the genome to its active physical instantiation in the machineries of the cell depends on RNA, a molecule in which both sequence and shape play crucial roles. The gene sequence is first copied from DNA to RNA; that RNA transcript is then edited to form a molecule called a messenger RNA, or mRNA (see diagram).

The end of the mRNA molecule is formatted into a distinctive shape which is recognised by ribosomes, complex pieces of machinery composed of dozens of proteins draped around another set of RNA molecules. With the help of yet more RNA molecules—little ones called tRNAs which stick to the mRNA sequence three letters at a time—the ribosome translates the genetic message into the protein it refers to by creating a chain of amino acids as it moves along the message.
This is the mechanism exploited by the RNA vaccines developed by BioNTech, a German biotechnology company based in Mainz, and Moderna, an American one from Cambridge, Massachusetts, against SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes covid-19. The companies mass produce the RNA sequence describing the distinctive “spike” protein, which studs the outer membrane of the virus, formatted so as to look like a natural mRNA. These RNA molecules, wrapped in little fatty bubbles called liposomes are injected into patients, where the liposomes smuggle the mRNA into cells. Ribosomes pick up on the mRNA format and read the sequence, thus producing the spike protein. The immune system learns to recognise the spike which the vaccinated cells are producing and stores away the memory of how to do so. This allows it to mount a swift response if it later comes across the same protein on the surfaces of viral particles and infected cells.
This ability to get cells to churn out proteins for which their DNA contains no genes is, in itself, enough to open up swathes of new therapeutic territory. But it is not the whole story. Cells make vast amounts of RNA that does not describe proteins. Its ability to recognise specific genetic sequences makes it useful for all sorts of processes, including turning the translation of genes on and off. Its ability to fold itself into particular forms—hairpins, loops and the like—makes it good at interacting with proteins.
This alphabet soup of RNAs (see table) seems to function a bit like a computer’s operating system, mediating the relationship between the cell’s hardware and its software. Many of the details of how this works remain obscure. But some are understood well enough for a lot of brainpower and money to have been poured into attempts to hack the operating system for therapeutic purposes.

These abilities should enable drugmakers to head upstream from the proteins whose shapes they have long studied into the realms of sequence. Where previously they targeted proteins which were already present, now they can in principle target the processes which control which proteins get made in the first place, adding helpful new ones to the roster and crossing harmful old ones off. There are RNA-based drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, heart disease and numerous inherited disorders—as well as brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
Moreover, RNA’s mixture of sequence and shape means that in many of these areas the once-haphazard process of drug discovery, long dependent on matching the shape of small synthetic molecules to the crannies and crevices of the proteins they targeted, can itself be systematised. A sequence which recognises, or forms a part of, one gene can be switched out for a sequence tailored to another. When what an RNA drug does depends on its sequence, its target and action can be modified by the click of a mouse.
The medicine is the message
Both the firms with mRNA vaccines on sale had other vaccines in the pipeline before covid-19 struck. It is part of the appeal of the technology that they were able to turn on a sixpence and refocus their efforts on SARS-CoV-2 as soon as the sequence for its spike gene was released last January. Now they are both getting on with what they had planned beforehand. Moderna is looking at vaccines to fend off infection by cytomegalovirus (a herpes virus which causes neurological problems in newborns), three lung viruses which cause respiratory disease in young children and Zika, a mosquito-borne virus found mainly in the tropics. BioNTech is focusing more on developing vaccines, and other treatments, with which to treat a wide range of cancers.
Cancer cells tend to have peculiar constellations of proteins on their surfaces, including both normal ones that are overexpressed and, more intriguingly, mutant forms peculiar to the development of that tumour. Comparing the genes expressed in a patient’s healthy cells with those used by their tumour cells reveals which mutant proteins the cancers are producing; mRNAs for those proteins can then be incorporated into a vaccine.

Produced as a result of vaccination, the proteins can engender a vigorous immune response the cancer itself does not—part of being a successful tumour is deploying mechanisms that stop the immune system from coming to grips with you. According to Ozlem Tureci, BioNTech’s co-founder, the firm has 500 patients enrolled in clinical trials for cancer. Moderna is pursuing similar ideas.
BioNTech is also testing mRNA vaccines aimed at overexpressed but unmutated proteins. Moderna, meanwhile, is looking into vaccines that train the immune system to recognise proteins created by common mutations in KRAS, a gene implicated in about 20% of human cancers. CureVac, based in Tübingen, an mRNA firm which also has a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in trials, is conducting trials of a vaccine for non-small-cell lung cancer.
Vaccination is not the only way that mRNA injection might fight viruses and tumours. The technique could also be used to get cells to produce therapeutic proteins that are currently administered through injection or infusion: interleukins and antibodies. Designer antibodies are a massive faff to make in industrial quantities; getting patients’ cells to take on the manufacturing duties instead would be a great step forward if it proved practical.
There are many other sorts of proteins which can be stimulated to therapeutic effect. A project on which Moderna is collaborating with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical giant, delivers the mRNA for a protein which encourages the regrowth of blood vessels. The idea is that the therapy, now in phase 2 clinical trials, could stimulate the growth of new cardiac blood vessels after heart attacks.
Getting the body to produce a protein it needs just for a short while—an antibody, say, or a growth factor—is one thing. But what about a protein that it needs on an everyday basis, but lacks the gene for? Such genetic diseases have always been the most obvious targets for gene therapy—treatments which add a missing gene to a patient’s cells, or repair a broken one, thus allowing them to make a protein they have hitherto lacked. But at least some such conditions might instead be treated with mRNA. Inserting a gene might be more elegant—but getting it in the right place and regulated in the right way is challenging. If mRNA treatments get the job done, they might offer a nice alternative.
There are thus mRNA treatments being studied for phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder which requires sufferers to restrict their diets for their entire lives; glycogen-storage disease, which enlarges the liver and kidneys and stunts children’s growth; and propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, two illnesses in which the body cannot properly break down proteins and fats. All are conditions that gene therapists are looking at, too.
That BioNTech, Curevac, Moderna and some others now have all these projects on the go is largely down to the fact that they have spent many years developing the basics of their platforms. Many hurdles had to be crossed before they could get cells to accept and act on messages from beyond; the RNA had to be subtly toughened up so that it would not itself fall prey to the immune system or get dismantled inside cells; the right lipids had to be found for delivery, sometimes tailored to particular tissues like those of the liver or lymph nodes. The potential inherent in the idea meant that their work was not completely ignored; in 2018 Moderna’s IPO valued the company at $7.5bn, a record for the biotech sector. But biotechnology has a long history of proving biology to be messier and more contrary than those seeking to exploit its loopholes expect.
Stop making sense
Scepticism was also warranted, it seemed, by the fact that messing around with RNA had been through bursts of popularity before. One of the very oldest companies in the field, Ionis Pharmaceutials (known as Isis until that name was appropriated by a would-be caliphate) was founded in 1989. Its intention, then and now, was not to make use of mRNA, but to hobble it.
The sequence of an mRNA molecule carries the same information as can be found in the gene which served as its template; but thanks to the way RNA is made it carries it in a complementary way. Where the DNA has a letter called C for cytosine, the RNA will have G for guanine; where the RNA has a C the DNA will have a G, and so on. Complementary strands stick together; that is what keeps DNA molecules paired up in double helices. If you introduce an mRNA to a molecule with a complementary sequence the two will stick together, too, rendering the mRNA useless (see bottom deck of diagram above).
Again, getting the neat idea to work in ways that helped proved hard. It took Ionis a quarter century to start getting its “antisense” drugs to market on a regular basis. It now has three: nusinersen, approved in America in 2016 and Europe in 2017 for use against childhood spinal muscular atrophy, a muscle-wasting illness; inotersen, approved in 2018 for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR), which damages the peripheral nervous system; and volanesorsen, approved in Europe in 2019, which lowers levels of triglyceride fats in the blood of people with a metabolic error that makes them far too high.
Ionis currently has a further 37 antisense molecules in clinical trials for conditions including Huntington’s disease (a study being carried out in collaboration with Roche, a large Swiss pharma company); amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (in collaborations with Biogen, a specialist in treatments for neurological disease); beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder similar to sickle-cell anaemia; and cystic fibrosis.
The firm is also developing, in collaboration with Novartis, another Swiss company, a way of reducing levels of lipoprotein(a), a particularly damaging form of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Lipoprotein(a) levels are untreatable with existing medicines; Pelacarsen, as the drug is known, is in phase 3 clinical trials to see if it can change that.
Unlike molecules of mRNA, which can tolerate only a small amount of chemical tinkering before becoming ribosome-unfriendly, antisense molecules can be tweaked quite a bit, and thus made long-lasting. Ionis’s researchers have worked out how to stabilise them so that they will hang around inside cells for months. This is important because most of Ionis’s targets are chronic diseases that require continuous treatment. The fewer injections per year the better.
While biotech companies were beavering away at antisense molecules in the 1990s, researchers elsewhere discovered that nature had a similar technology of its own: gene silencing, a process guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The early 2000s saw a gene-silencing biotech boom led by Alnylam, founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2002, and Sirna Therapeutics, which got going in San Francisco the following year.
Established pharma companies, including Abbott, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche and Takeda, waded in, too, with Merck buying Sirna for more than $1bn in 2006. For almost a decade, attention and money were showered on the field. But though there were many promising leads, they failed to turn into drugs. By the early 2010s it seemed that the party was over.
Nonlinear, nonvisual and inclusive
Alnylam, though, kept dancing. In 2014 it bought what was left of Sirna from Merck for a knock-down price. It launched its first product, patisiran, a treatment for hATTR, in 2018. It now has two others, givosiran and lumasiran, which also address rare genetic disorders.
A fourth substance developed using its technology has broader appeal. This is inclisiran, developed to treat an inherited disorder that pushes the concentration of LDL cholesterol in the blood to dangerous levels; around 30m people worldwide suffer from it. A firm called the Medicines Company licensed Inclisiran from Alnylam to bring it to market. With approval looking likely (it was given in Europe late last year) Novartis bought the Medicines Company for $9.7bn in January 2020.
According to Akshay Vaishnaw, Alnylam’s head of R, the firm has another 14 siRNA drugs in clinical trials. These including potential treatments for haemophilia, hepatitis B and recurrent kidney stones. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, of Pasadena, California, has eight potential siRNA drugs in trials, including one directed at cystic fibrosis. Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, of Lexington, Massachusetts, has three.
These siRNAs work by straddling the worlds of shape and sequence. Their shape fits them into a group of proteins called an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). But a bit of the siRNA is left sticking out of this complex; this tail contains a sequence complementary to that of the RNA to be silenced. When siRNA and mRNA meet, the proteins in the RISC chop the messenger to pieces. (A conceptually similar mechanism for the RNA-guided protein-executed chopping up of genes found in bacteria is the basis of the CRISPR tools now revolutionising gene editing.)
In plants and invertebrates the natural function of the siRNA mechanism is clear: cutting up mRNAs associated with viruses. They do not seem to serve that function in vertebrates, and no one is quite sure what they do instead. But that does not stop them from looking like promising drugs.

So do another set of RNAs associated with RISCs: micro-RNAs, which use their complementary sequences not to destroy mRNAs but to regulate them. The human genome seems to contain about 2,600 of these miRNAs, and they are thought to be involved in regulating the rate at which about 60% of the genes describing proteins get transcribed. Several look like promising therapeutic targets.
Since the active bit of an miRNA is a single-stranded sequence-specific tail, the obvious way to target them is with antisense. Regulus Pharmaceuticals, a firm that started life as a collaboration between Ionis and Alnylam, is trying to develop antisense molecules aimed at miRNA-21 to treat two kidney-related genetic conditions in which that miRNA plays a role. When you start targeting miRNAs, though, things get positively baroque. Santaris Pharma, a Danish firm, has developed Miravirsen, an antisense suppressor for miRNA-122 which the hepatitis C virus uses for its own unhelpful ends. The drug has now been taken on by Roche.
The innovation continues. MiNA Therapeutics, a startup in London, is working on the potential of saRNAs, which activate genes which otherwise stay silent. Others are investigating systems for “self-amplifying” mRNA drugs. These mRNAs would inveigle a cell’s ribosomes into producing not just the protein that was meant to be delivered, but also a second protein, called RNA-replicase, which would make more of the mRNA, thus leading to even more protein being expressed. There is surely further cleverness to come.
Could be so exciting

Even if only a fraction of these possibilities pan out it looks certain that, in popularity contests to come as in stockmarkets today (see chart), more people will be plumping for RNA. Their support will be welcomed by the small band of biologists with an interest in the very earliest history of life that has long formed the discerning core of the molecule’s following. Life needs both a way of doing things in the now—catalysing the reactions on which its metabolism depends—and of passing information into the future. Of the molecules known today only RNA, in its shape-and-sequence versatility, can do both those things, dealing with the needs of the everyday at the same time as encoding instructions for its own reproduction in the form of a legible sequence. This suggests to many that early life spent some time in an “RNA world” before the division of labour allocated doing things to the proteins and storing data to DNA, reducing RNA to a supporting role in the world it had created.
The application of RNA has met many obstacles over past decades, and the fact that it has proved itself in vaccines does not mean it will not meet more in the future. But it does seem that medicine now has a way to target drugs not just at proteins, but at the processes that make them, and that opens up new realms of possibility. The next RNA world awaits. ■

1661,"IN ANCIENT HINDU lore a winged horse emerges from the milky churn of primeval oceans to become the trusted mount of Indra, king of the heavens. A later tradition says it was instead Mahabali, lord of the demons, who rode the fabulous stallion. Both versions picture a creature strikingly like Pegasus, the flying horse of Greek myth, except that the Indian model is fancier. It sports not one but seven heads.
Contemporary India’s most powerful men could have used those extra heads. Relying on Pegasus—not the mythical horse but a very modern brand of electronic spyware—they seem to have ridden recklessly into danger. A global investigation by a clutch of newspapers and NGOs, triggered by the leak of some 50,000 phone numbers in ten countries, casts the government of Narendra Modi in an ugly light as a presumed client of Pegasus’s Israeli creator, the NSO Group.

The evidence strongly suggests that Indian spooks may have slipped the eavesdropping software into the mobile phones of hundreds of unsuspecting fellow citizens. The problem is not just that the government may have broken Indian law to do so, or that it may have used the tool to pry on intimate private relations. Most disturbing, if true, is the choice of targets.
The leaked Pegasus file contains some 1,000 Indian numbers, around 150 of which have so far been identified. Only a handful belong to people who might conceivably endanger the state, such as activists in ethnic separatist groups. The list includes numbers used by some 40 journalists who share nothing but a critical stance towards Mr Modi’s government. Some belong to Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, and his personal friends. Others belong to a political consultant credited with state-level wins against Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), and to a former top election official who had recommended penalising Mr Modi for flouting rules during the 2019 general election, as well as to members of his family. Figures from inside the government may have been targeted, too, among them at least two BJP ministers, senior civil servants and a number of senior security officers.
In another democracy, such a scandal could topple a government. Richard Nixon was disgraced for transgressions that are puny compared with what Pegasus is capable of and may already have been used for. But in Mr Modi’s India things are not so simple.
For sure, the liberal commentariat has erupted in predictable outrage, decrying the alleged snooping as a further lurch into dictatorship. Congress wants Amit Shah, the home minister, to resign. United for a change, opposition MPs have disrupted the lower house of Parliament for more than a week with calls for a debate and an investigation of Pegasus. Petitions have been submitted to the Supreme Court demanding an inquiry. One opposition-ruled state, West Bengal, has opened one of its own.
But the government, snug in its parliamentary majority, has so far refused any debate. Mr Modi as usual remains aloof, leaving it to spokesmen to deny any link to Pegasus. BJP attack dogs dismiss the affair as a malicious hoax. Most of India’s press, beholden in one way or another to government influence, has obediently played the story down.
No wonder they stayed in line. Dainik Bhaskar is a media group with newspapers widely read in the Hindi-speaking heartlands where the BJP dominates and which have recently been critical of the government’s handling of covid-19. After they put the scandal on the front page, tax inspectors raided the company.
Perhaps, as so often in Mr Modi’s seven-year tenure, cries for accountability will be drowned in India’s turbulent public life. Attention has indeed already shifted to new dramas, such as a land dispute between two BJP-ruled states that erupted into shooting on July 26th, leaving five policemen dead. But it would be sad for India to miss this chance to patch some of the holes in its democracy.
India’s spooks have operated behind an unusually thick veil of secrecy since long before Mr Modi began to gather undue executive powers. The Intelligence Bureau, one of several security agencies, was created in 1887 to snuff out opposition to the British Raj. Its functions seem to have scarcely changed. It is cocooned from democratic oversight.
Alas, in the age of Mr Modi, to call for greater public scrutiny, if only by empowering a parliamentary committee to monitor intelligence officials, seems as fanciful as to dream of winged horses.",2
1662,"THE STOCKMARKET index of Germany’s bluest chips is getting a makeover. Any week now the DAX will gain ten new members, bringing the total to 40.

1663,"IDEALISTS SEE leadership as steering the ship of state in the right direction (Plato), or embracing the “ethic of responsibility” (Weber). Realists see it as the ability to seize the horse of history by the tail and lever yourself onto its back (Machiavelli), or to sell a coherent vision to a fickle public (Schumpeter). But whatever its nature, everyone can agree when it is absent.
As it has been from the Foreign Office during the past fortnight. Even as Afghanistan was falling to the Taliban, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, dawdled in Crete before cutting his holiday short. He delegated to a junior minister the job of calling his opposite number in Kabul to discuss the fate of Afghan interpreters working for British forces. His response to criticism in a television interview was risible: he had been focused on his job in Crete, he bristled, not paddle-boarding, because the “sea was closed”.

The permanent secretaries of the Foreign Office, Home Office and Ministry of Defence, as well as the prime minister, Boris Johnson, also initially refused to let a little thing like the fall of Kabul interrupt their holidays. And Mr Raab made some reasonable points during a combative appearance before the foreign-affairs select committee on September 1st. There was a limit to how much Britain could have done to improve the situation in Afghanistan, given America’s precipitous departure. Britain was not alone in underestimating the speed of the Taliban’s advance. As foreign secretary he had to keep his eye on lots of pots that threaten to boil over, not on Afghanistan alone.
Moreover, Mr Raab inherited a Foreign Office that had been broken by decades of cuts and marginalisation. “Embassies have been sold off; a diplomat’s career path has become arbitrary; the last Permanent Secretary prioritised diversity over diplomacy; and too much experienced advice has been ignored and subordinated to the whims and instructions of Downing Street,” lamented Sir Alan Duncan, who served a spell as a foreign-office minister, in a recent article. Brexit has left Britain’s diplomatic strategy in disarray, tearing up nearly five decades of patient work with the European Union and doubling down on the transatlantic relationship, at precisely the moment when America has decided to turn inward and towards the Pacific.
But leadership is about rising to challenges. A lesser man than Ernest Bevin, foreign secretary from 1945 to 1951, might have surrendered to pressure from within the Labour Party to side with the Soviet Union rather than America, or to shift opportunistically between the two. Moreover, Mr Raab helped create the difficulties that now beset his department. He was among the hardest of the Brexiteers, helping to bring down Theresa May, the previous prime minister, when she tried to compromise with the EU, and running for party leadership in 2019 as the champion of the ultras.
That Mr Raab’s Foreign Office is not a happy place is hardly surprising, given his ideological leanings. But the atmosphere has been worsened by his personality, variously described as “tightly wound”, “controlling” and “cold”. Some officials have taken to calling him “five i’s”, a double reference to the “five eyes” arrangement that sees Britain share intelligence with America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and what they see as his attributes: insular, imperious, idle, irascible and ignorant. He has handled this hostile environment by sidelining ambassadors and surrounding himself with special advisers. But the cost has been high. He has built no close relationships with his counterparts around the world, failing to talk to foreign ministers in Afghanistan, Pakistan and several of the surrounding states in the six months leading up to the fall of Kabul. Important decisions have been shaped by callow youths who have seldom strayed outside the Westminster village, rather than by seasoned diplomats.
Nor does Mr Raab supply much in the way of intellectual leadership. The son of a Jewish Czech refugee, he has a fine record on standing up to Russia and China. He pressed for residents of Hong Kong to be welcomed in Britain as China tightened its grip on the territory. But on many difficult choices facing Britain, he has been reticent—so much so that some other Brexiteers are losing patience. Instead of buccaneering about the place, as they fondly imagined Britain doing once freed from the EU, he has got lost in pettifogging process, they complain. He is a strange combination of ideologue and technocrat, a hard-line Brexiteer by conviction but a human-rights lawyer by training and experience. Somehow, this mixture has left space for neither vision nor panache.
His dismal performance over Afghanistan has provoked another round of Westminster snakes and ladders. Will the prime minister sack him in the next reshuffle, or at least move him sideways? Who would take his place? (Michael Gove, the cabinet-office minister, and Liz Truss, the trade secretary, are early front-runners.) And might the manifest failings of one member of his cabinet inspire the prime minister to take a hard look at the others? Why does it contain so many people who mess up everything they do, like Gavin Williamson, the education secretary? Why have so many of the most impressive Tory politicians languished on the backbenches, like Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the foreign-affairs select committee, or jumped ship, like Rory Stewart, a former soldier, diplomat and Conservative leadership candidate?
Holding on tight
When Mr Johnson took office, surrounding himself with Brexiteers was understandable, given the need to end his party’s 30-year civil war. But sensible Remainers have reconciled themselves to a future outside the EU, and the cost of packing the cabinet with mediocrities is rising by the day. The prime minister would strike no one as a follower of Plato or Weber. The realist school of leadership seems a better fit. But having seized the horse of history by the tail when he backed Brexit, he is in danger of failing because he has assembled incompetent horsemen, rather than crack cavalry. ■

1664,"TURKEY HAS deported Syrian refugees before. Some were sent back to their war-scorched homeland for failing to register with the authorities or for minor crimes. Some say they were tricked or forced into signing voluntary return forms. But none thought they would be thrown out for eating bananas. Until now.
In October the government said it would deport seven Syrians for sharing “provocative” videos on social media, which showed the young refugees staring into their phones and munching yellow fruit. This was in response to an interview with a Turkish man who had blamed Syrians for driving up rents and complained that they could afford bananas, which he could not.

The banana-eaters seemed to be mocking prejudice against refugees. But officials accused them of mocking the needy. And that was not the end of it. Turkish police arrested a Syrian journalist who had made light of the uproar in a video that showed him nervously buying bananas from a grocer, then hiding them under his sweater. (He was released on November 8th.)
Some 3.7m Syrians have made Turkey their home over the past decade. The Turkish welcome, once generous, has become grudging. As the lira plummets and inflation tests 20%, the refugees are becoming a target of frustration. With its poll numbers shrinking President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government appears keen to prove that it can act tough. Even over soft fruit.",2
1665,"AS NEWS CIRCULATED of a worrying new virus spreading in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the early days of 2020, experts worried that infections would quickly reach South-East Asia and overwhelm the region’s health-care systems. Thailand was one of the main destinations for Chinese tourists; the first case outside China was reported there on January 13th, 2020. The first known death from covid-19 outside China occurred in the Philippines. A Chinese tourist who had visited Indonesia from Wuhan tested positive on returning home, suggesting he took the virus on holiday with him.
Yet it was Iran and Italy that became the first global hotspots. America, the rest of Europe and Brazil were soon engulfed. India got walloped. All through 2020 and the early part of this year, South-East Asia remained relatively unscathed. By the start of June, the region of 668m people had reported fewer than 77,000 deaths from the disease. Britain, with a tenth as many people, had chalked up more than 128,000. South-East Asia, it seemed, had escaped the worst of the pandemic.

No longer. By the end of August the region had recorded some 217,000 deaths from covid-19, about 2.6 times its total just three months earlier. Yet the real figure is probably much higher: in the range of 520,000 to 1.6m, according to number-crunching by The Economist. What happened? And if the latest numbers understate deaths in so dramatic a fashion, was South-East Asia ever really an exception?

The short answer to the first question is that the highly infectious Delta variant happened. When it arrived in the region this year, it encountered a population that lacked immunity, was complacent after a covid-free year and was defended by public-health measures designed for the milder, original form of the virus. The outbreak in Cambodia, where the virus was virtually unknown until April, was set off by just two people. Vietnam recorded almost no cases for much of last year, and mostly single-digit numbers until April, before a surge that saw daily cases rise to over 13,000 by early September.
Tram (not her real name), a doctor at one of the country’s largest quarantine facilities, a 1,000-bed centre in Ho Chi Minh City, believes the much higher contagiousness of the Delta variant surprised Vietnamese authorities. Though Vietnam was prepared for an outbreak, she says, it relied on contact-tracing, which is of limited use once case numbers start rocketing. Delta moved too quickly for the authorities to contain it.
Another reason for the enormous rise in infections and deaths in South-East Asia over the past few months could be a change in strategy, says David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. As governments come to terms with the fact that the virus will become endemic—and that it is now running rampant within their borders—they are looking for ways to live with it. That means accepting a certain number of infections and deaths as the price of opening up. Thailand, for instance, has eased many restrictions on movement and commerce; other countries are doing the same.
At the same time, governments have shifted focus from elimination to vaccination. This has been slow to get going, but is gathering pace. By June 1st only Singapore and Cambodia had given more than 10% of over-11s one dose or more: now all but Myanmar have crossed 20%. In Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore, more than 60% of over-11s are fully vaccinated.
Had the virus hit the region harder than the official data suggest, even before the Delta wave? India’s official death toll from covid at the start of November stood at some 124,000, but The Economist’s calculations suggest the true number was something more like 820,000. That raised the question of whether South-East Asia, which like India is a big and diverse region with pockets of severe poverty and creaking health systems, was also failing to count its dead.
The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is no. With the exception of Indonesia, death counts in the region were indeed exceptionally low until June. Mr Heymann, who led the WHO’s response to SARS in 2003, says the region benefited from good policy. He credits South-East Asia with a swift response to the threat in the form of “good contact-tracing and good outbreak investigation”. Many countries in the region had suffered outbreaks of SARS and they had “taken preparedness to heart”, he says.
Other factors may have helped too, such as having relatively few imported cases, partly as a result of the swift shutting of borders and imposition of quarantines, and high levels of mask-wearing. The region also has a lower proportion of old people than the badly hit rich countries of the West. And the prevalence of comorbidities such as obesity, which heighten the risk of death from covid, is also lower.
Whatever natural assistance South-East Asian countries may have had, the policies they put in place to stop outbreaks have now either failed or been abandoned. In Ho Chi Minh City, Dr Tram says, the health-care system is overloaded. Whenever a new quarantine facility opens, it quickly fills up. She is voluntarily staying at the one where she works, because she is afraid that she will get infected at work and bring the disease back to her family. She has not been home for three months. Our model estimates that between 37,000 and 58,000 Vietnamese have died of covid-related causes in the past three months. The official tally pegs the number at 13,000.
The worst may be over for South-East Asia, at least for now. Case numbers are declining sharply in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. (They are still rising in the Philippines and are stable in Vietnam.) Yet more waves are inevitable unless vaccination efforts are speeded up. And the economic effects are likely to linger.
Long Delta
Even before the latest wave, businesses and workers across the region suffered from closures because of lockdown. Those reliant on tourism, which accounts for 12% of the region’s GDP, have been particularly hard hit. A UN report published at the end of June estimated that regional GDP could shrink by as much as 8.4% from the loss of tourism alone. Simon Purwa, who runs a travel agency in Bali, says that business is down by 90-95%. But, he says, “We are still lucky.” Many other agencies have fared worse. Some have had to shut down.
Three out of four households in Indonesia have seen their incomes fall compared with January 2020, according to a UNICEF report released in May. More than 12% of households with children say they are struggling to keep themselves fed, and 27% said they have had to pawn possessions to survive. In Malaysia the proportion of households below the national poverty line jumped from 5.6% to a projected 8.4% in 2020. That was before the current wave. Even as the disease recedes, its effects will long be felt in hunger, unemployment and lost opportunities.■

To estimate the number of lives lost to the covid-19 pandemic, The Economist has since April 2020 collected data on excess deaths: the gap between deaths observed during the pandemic and those expected in normal years. Using a new machine-learning model to estimate excess deaths where total mortality figures are unavailable, we are now able to provide daily updated estimates of excess deaths due to the pandemic for every country and the world. You can view these estimates, as well as details of our methodology, here.",2
1666,"DURING HIS final days Mohamed Monir, an Egyptian journalist, was so short of breath he could barely speak. In a video recorded in July last year, as his final hours approached, he begged for oxygen. He died in a hospital isolation unit after contracting covid-19 in prison while awaiting trial. He had been arrested the previous month after, among other things, writing an article lambasting the Egyptian government’s response to the pandemic. He was charged with spreading false news, misusing social media and joining a terrorist group.
Covid-19 has indeed unleashed a flood of misinformation. But it has also given governments such as Egypt’s an excuse to crack down on their critics using the pretext of restricting the spread of fake news. Between March and October last year 17 countries passed new laws against “online misinformation” or “fake information”, according to the International Press Institute (see map). Among those leading this charge are such guardians of free speech as Vladimir Putin, Viktor Orban and Rodrigo Duterte. Other authoritarians, such as Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, have followed since then. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, is keen to pass a law to stop the dissemination of fake news after the protests that roiled the city in 2019.

Governments have always regulated speech. And the spread of disinformation is indeed a serious and growing problem. If politicians are enacting laws against fake news to catch people spreading deliberate lies, “that’s one thing”, argues Marko Milanovic, an expert in international law at the University of Nottingham. If, however, they are putting in place broad, vague measures that are in fact intended to curb the freedom of the press and free speech more widely, “that’s a huge problem.”

Some governments have cited the pandemic as justification for new laws. Under legislation introduced in March 2020 in Russia, media outlets found guilty of deliberately spreading false information about matters of public safety, including covid-19, face fines of up to €117,000 ($140,000). Russia already imposed fines on people for spreading “false information” but the new regulations fall under the criminal code which means the punishments can also include time in jail. The editor of one website was fined 60,000 roubles ($810) for reporting that 1,000 graves had been dug for potential victims of covid-19. Tatyana Voltskaya, a freelance journalist, was fined 30,000 roubles in December for a radio report that included an interview with an anonymous health worker, who described the shortage of ventilators in Russian hospitals and other difficulties faced by doctors battling covid-19.
Other governments are reviving obsolete legislation, ostensibly to combat fake news related to covid-19. Their true aims, however, are to hamper independent journalism or “retaliate against those doing reporting that they don’t appreciate”, says Courtney Radsch of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based NGO. In March the Jordanian government used a “defence” law from 1992 that permits the declaration of a state of emergency in exceptional circumstances to do so as part of its efforts to stem the spread of covid-19. The law allows the government to monitor the content of newspapers and censor or shut down any outlet without giving any reason. On Christmas Eve Jamal Haddad, the Jordanian publisher of a news website, was detained after publishing an article asking why officials had received vaccinations against covid-19 when these were not yet available to ordinary citizens.
And some authorities are invoking laws that may not even exist. Hopewell Chin’ono, a journalist in Zimbabwe, was arrested in January for tweeting about police violence while enforcing lockdowns. The government says that “anyone who spreads false news will be charged in terms of Section 31 of the Criminal Code”, according to Doug Coltart, one of Mr Chin’ono’s lawyers. But the section of the law criminalising the dissemination of “falsehoods” had been struck down in 2014 by the Zimbabwean constitutional court.
Some of the new laws are temporary. But their creators appear in no hurry to lift them. Mr Orban imposed a state of emergency in Hungary in March last year. Among other measures it made the dissemination of “misinformation” punishable by up to five years in prison. The state of emergency ended in June, but Mr Orban’s government reimposed it in November as the country faced a second wave of covid-19 cases.
South Africa also introduced temporary legislation in March 2020, as part of a package of measures to limit the spread of covid-19. It stipulated that those publishing falsehoods about the disease could face fines or up to six months in prison. Only a handful of people have been arrested. Those who have been prosecuted were social-media users charged with promoting unscientific nonsense, such as a man who claimed that covid tests spread the disease. So far, journalists have been fairly relaxed about the restrictions, in part because the government listened to their concerns, reckons Izak Minnaar, a former broadcaster who works on disinformation issues as part of the country’s National Editors’ Forum. Fact-checking of contentious social-media posts is done by an independent body rather than one run by the government, for instance. But the law has set a precedent for tighter curbs on the press. “We cannot make it permanent,” says Siyavuya Mzantsi, editor of the Cape Times.
Even as free-speech campaigners in rich democracies offer support to those fighting censorship in poorer, less free places, their own governments are providing the would-be censors with cover, even inspiration. Germany’s Network Enforcement Law (NetzDG), passed in 2017, is meant to protect readers from fake news and hate speech by requiring social-media platforms to remove material deemed incendiary. More than a dozen countries, from Russia to Turkey, have copied this legislation as a way to suppress dissent online. Many of these countries expressly referred to the German law as justification for their repressive legislation. Turkey’s allows the government to remove online content and reduce the bandwidth of social-media sites so much that they become unusable. Jacob Mchangama and Joelle Fiss of Justitia, a Danish think-tank, have described the NetzDG as “the Digital Berlin Wall” because it has accidentally become a “prototype for global online censorship”. 
None so zealous
Converts to the cause of tackling fake news are often guilty of peddling the stuff themselves. Brazilian politicians are in the process of passing a law against fake news. But the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has downplayed the dangers of covid-19 and touted ineffective pills. Though he was infected in July last year, he says his background as an athlete helped him shrug it off. He is cool on the law because he worries it will affect his supporters, some of whom are also quick to spread misinformation. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, has prescribed saunas and hockey as cures for covid-19. In a survey of 1,406 journalists conducted by the International Centre for Journalists, a non-profit organisation in Washington, 46% said that elected officials were the source of misinformation relating to covid-19 that they had encountered. They also blamed government agencies and networks of trolls linked to various states.
These laws are making journalists’ jobs harder. In Hungary they have made reporting more arduous. Sources are less willing to talk. Atlatszo, an independent news site established in 2011, has three lawyers who do a legal check of articles to make sure that everything complies with the regulation. Mr Orban’s government has become more secretive. It is more reluctant to answer questions from independent media outlets. It has established a central “Operative Unit” to deal with journalists’ inquiries. As a result questions to local hospitals, schools and municipalities are now handled by national authorities. In Myanmar the “True News Information Team” exists largely to suppress reports about crimes committed by the army, which since February 1st has been in charge of the whole country.
In desperation some have gone into exile. Belarusian journalists have fled to Poland. Many Nicaraguan reporters have moved to Costa Rica. After Lucia Pineda, a Nicaraguan journalist, was arrested and held in prison for six months in 2019, she moved her news website, 100% Noticias, there. Gerall Chávez, another Nicaraguan hack, co-founded a website called Nicaragua Actual but works out of Costa Rica, too. He still worries that his work puts him in danger. Last summer he received death threats on Facebook, including a cartoon showing him being killed. His parents, who are still in Nicaragua, were sent the same animation on a USB stick.  
Others are censoring themselves. In countries that have had such laws on the books for a while, this is already apparent. Bangladesh’s Digital Security Act, passed in 2018, imposes hefty fines on journalists or individuals found guilty of “cyberterrorism”. It has created a culture of fear, one journalist explains, which silences reporters. The government does not need new laws to do so. “Our legal system, our judiciary is so fragile that…if the government wants to harass someone, they don’t need any piece of legislation,” he says.
Such repression is changing how journalists publish and where people seek their news. Some media outlets are moving onto new platforms, such as Telegram, an online-messaging service. In Belarus the government responded to big protests over a contested election in August by shutting down the internet and arresting scores of journalists. Between mid-August and mid-November subscriptions to the Telegram channel for Tut.by, a news website, grew by 28%.  In Hungary many publishers are controlled by the government. During the pandemic they have published nothing but articles praising the effectiveness of the state’s response, says Tamás Bodoky, the editor of Atlatszo. His site, by contrast, has reported on controversies concerning the government’s handling of the crisis. He reckons that explains the rise in its average monthly views from around 182,000 in 2019 to over 285,000 in 2020: “People were actively looking for articles about the pandemic which were not government propaganda.” No laws can stop them doing that. ■",2
1667,"THE END OF Britain’s 47-year experiment in Europe had a Scottish air to it. On January 29th last year the European Parliament ratified the Brexit divorce, after three years of negotiations which had exhausted Britons. On the square outside in Brussels a bagpiper played “Flower of Scotland”, a folk tune, and “Ode to Joy”, the European anthem. Aileen McLeod, a member of the parliament for the Scottish National Party (SNP), told other members that her country would soon be back: “In the meantime, I hope very much that you will leave a light on for Scotland.” After the vote was cast, many of the MEPs joined hands and sang “Auld Lang Syne”, a song of friendship by Robert Burns, Scotland’s national poet.
As prime minister, David Cameron oversaw two constitutional referendums with the potential to change the United Kingdom irrevocably. He expected to win both handily. In 2014 he had permitted Scots to vote on independence from the rest of Britain. They rejected it by 55% to 45%, and the following morning Mr Cameron declared the issue settled for a generation. In 2016, he was not so fortunate. In the referendum on membership of the European Union, Britons voted by 52% to 48% to leave.

Those two decisions are now inextricably entwined. Scots, more Europhile than the English, voted by 62% to 38% to remain in Europe. So Brexit has reopened the question of Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom, provoked demands for a new referendum, and reshaped the independence movement as an avowedly Europhile cause. For a growing number of Scots, independence has become the escape route from Brexit. Their movement—full of young, educated idealists, who are green, pro-migration and increasingly stirred by the politics of gender and race—looks like the opposite of the alliance of English traditionalists who supported Brexit.

The movement hopes soon to have its moment. Scotland will hold elections on May 6th for its devolved parliament in Edinburgh, which since 1999 has run education, health care and transport (foreign relations, defence and the economy are still run by Westminster). Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, will seek another term as first minister. An SNP government, she says, will have a mandate to hold a second vote on independence. If it won, that would lead to separation talks with London, and open the door to Scotland’s accession to the EU. Around 65% of Scots still want to rejoin the bloc.Polls show a small lead for separation (see chart 1).
But victory in a second referendum would bring Ms Sturgeon a similar challenge to the one which Britain faced in 2016, of extracting a nation from a political and economic union without unleashing chaos. The SNP’s top brass believe they can avoid such trauma and learn from British errors. The Brexiteers had wildly different ideas about what Brexit meant, made no preparations for negotiations, and refused to anticipate problems such as the border with Ireland. Nationalists, by contrast, are clear about Scotland’s destination as a new EU state, and the Scottish government is studying the EU accession process. In private, senior nationalists are a little more candid these days about the obstacles: the need for a trade border with England, a new currency and a legally complex transition period for the chilly years between leaving one union and joining the other.
Yet many of the technical and legal challenges would look similar to those brought about by Brexit: settling bills, splitting assets, fixing the right to work and study, and access to fishing waters. The union has stood since 1707, so Scotland is far more deeply stitched into the United Kingdom than Britain was into Europe. The hidden systems of daily life—tax collection, immigration controls, electricity distribution—must be unwoven. Unlike Brexit, Scottish negotiations would need to grapple with the fate of nuclear weapons, sovereign debts, and oil and gas reserves. Only once Scotland was a state could accession talks with Europe begin. Unionists warn that, rather than an escape from the turmoil of Brexit, Scotland would be choosing its own “Brexit on steroids”.
But we can still rise now
Unlike British rule in Ireland, for most of its life the union has rested on Scots’ consent, which they have been, for the most part, happy to grant. Scotland had a stake in Britain’s government, producing prime ministers and cabinet members. Empire and free trade with England made it wealthy and the union did not interfere with Scotland’s church, legal system and universities. Demands for a parliament grew in the 20th century, but calls for independence only came from a noisy fringe.
The pillars of consent were weakened under Margaret Thatcher. She was more willing to impose London rule on Scots in areas such as higher education and local government. The collapse of coal, steel and manufacturing that followed privatisation hit Scotland hard, drove up unemployment, and gave the SNP its “anti-Scottish” villain. In the 1980s, the idea that Westminster lacked consent and legitimacy in Scotland gained ground in the Labour Party. Tony Blair hoped the devolved parliament would forestall independence. The SNP hoped it would be a stepping stone.
The Labour Party dominated the new parliament but became detached and complacent, and the SNP displaced it as the force of the Scottish left. In 2011 it won a majority in the Scottish Parliament. In 2015 it swept Labour’s Scottish MPs out of Westminster, too. As the devolved parliament has thrived, so the political news Scots digest has become increasingly different from England’s. Scots migrate south less, so cultural ties weaken. Yet, given the choice in 2014, they still opted to stay.
There the story might have ended, were it not for Brexit. Mr Johnson has chosen a hard exit, ditching the EU’s single market and customs union. He has spurned membership of Erasmus, an exchange programme popular with Scottish students, and an easy migration regime. That has cracked the pillars of consent. Scotland has looked suddenly powerless: the views of its voters, their parliament and their MPs in Westminster have counted for little. Brexit cuts deep into the courts and universities, and will make it poorer, as fishermen and bankers encounter trade barriers to Europe where before there were none.
In 2014, with Britain still in Europe, an architect in Glasgow could vote against independence, for she could have it all, seeing herself as Scottish, British or European, and working as freely in Munich as in Manchester. Now she is being asked to choose which identity she prioritises, and in which single market she wants to work.
Unionists see the SNP’s Europhilia as opportunistic. The party had opposed Britain’s entry into the EU in 1973, reckoning Europe remote and undemocratic. But it changed as dictatorships fell and Europe’s purpose evolved from stopping old countries going to war to helping new ones find freedom and prosperity. Ms Sturgeon welcomed Europe’s embrace of former communist states in 2004 as evidence of the “sheer normality of independence in Europe for small nations”.
The bloc does the hard work of independence for young, small states: it provides a ready-made currency, a trade policy and market of 450m consumers, and heaps of funding for motorways and wind farms. The EU’s breadth and reach, say nationalists, means independence is not a leap in the dark like Brexit, but a defined destination for which they can prepare. “Our answer to absolutely everything is whatever is working for Ireland, we’ll do,” says one SNP bigwig.
Scotland would blend in fine, as a middling EU member by size and disposition. It has typically European interests—financial services and green energy—and European problems, too—poor demographics and urban decay. Ms Sturgeon sees it as part of an arc of Nordic social democracies (new parents are sent a box of baby things, a policy borrowed from Finland) and has won the sympathy of European leaders.
But Europe may be leaving a light on for a long time. The first step is getting a referendum. Polls suggest Ms Sturgeon will keep her job after May 6th, either with an outright majority or in a pro-independence coalition. A toxic feud with Alex Salmond, her predecessor, has led to his launching a rival pro-independence party, Alba, but it does not seem to have badly dented SNP support. Her main problem will be getting a British prime minister to approve a new poll. Britain has no equivalent to Article 50, the EU’s unilateral exit clause. Under British law, the union is the exclusive concern of the Westminster Parliament, and the last referendum was held with Mr Cameron’s permission. Ms Sturgeon would like Mr Johnson to follow his lead, arguing that a vote must be deemed legally sound in London and overseas to result in statehood. If he does not, Ms Sturgeon will seek to force his hand by pushing ahead with a referendum law in the Scottish Parliament and daring him to approve it or to challenge it in the Supreme Court.
Mr Johnson says he will refuse, and that a referendum is reckless while Scotland recovers from covid-19. An unauthorised plebiscite would be a significant change in SNP strategy, which he could simply ignore or legislate to ban. Nearly half of English voters would be pleased or indifferent about Scottish independence, according to YouGov, a pollster, but it matters to the Conservative and Unionist Party, as the Tories are properly known. Scottish independence would cause both allies and adversaries to rapidly downgrade Britain’s global role, and inflict emotional trauma. “It would feel like chopping off your own arm,” says one Scottish Tory.
Whereas Mr Cameron offered greater devolution, Mr Johnson’s strategy is to reinforce London’s power, to fly the Union flag and splash the cash. EU funds for bridges and roads used to be handed to the Scottish government, but in future the British government will apportion the cash directly. Such a strategy risks strengthening support for independence. A new referendum, under a future government, may simply become a matter of time.
Unionists will ask Scots to focus on the economics of independence, which are liable to be tougher than Brexit’s. Around 60% of Scotland’s exports go to the rest of Britain, and leaving will cut GDP over the long run by between 6.5% and 8.7%—two to three times more than the cost of Brexit—according to a paper from the London School of Economics. EU membership will do little to mitigate that, it argues, as joining the single market would mean stricter controls at the English border.
The currency is a central weakness. In 2014, the British Treasury rejected the SNP’s plan to use sterling. The SNP now says it would use it unofficially, as Panama uses the dollar, before adopting a Scottish currency “as soon as practicable”. Since the EU states must consider their exchange rates with the euro “a matter of common concern”, Scotland would need to have a new currency or agree to a short transition before joining, notes Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.
As a condition of membership, Scotland would promise to adopt the euro. The SNP argues this can be deferred indefinitely, as Sweden and Poland have done. Fewer than one in five Scots wants the euro, but the difficulties of creating a currency may make Frankfurt’s embrace more attractive. With a new Scottish currency, big exchange-rate risks would suddenly appear in cross-border contracts. Wages paid in it may shrink relative to mortgages agreed in sterling, a lesser risk with the more stable euro. Large banks would shift some of their activity overseas, fearing a Scottish central bank would struggle to act as a lender of last resort.

Scotland’s public finances would be squeezed, which would frustrate nationalists who want a more generous welfare state. Scotland raises less tax and spends more per person than Britain as a whole. The implied deficit (currently plugged by the central government) was 8.6% of GDP in 2019-20, compared with 2.6% for Britain as a whole (see chart 2). Tax revenues from oil and gas are volatile and fell from £10bn in 2008 to £650m last year. Scotland would be expected to meet the EU’s deficit criteria of 3% before or soon after joining. A paper commissioned by the SNP in 2018 proposed doing this within ten years by holding down public spending. While the British government can borrow at low interest rates, a new Scottish government would have to establish its own fiscal credibility, a task made harder by raising funds in a new currency.
The Remain camp relied on dry economics before the Brexit vote. Unionists face the same problem. Nationalists counter that trade patterns will shift and independence will give Edinburgh the levers to lift productivity. Goldman Sachs, a bank, has told clients that as well as big challenges, there are “potential economic upsides” to independence if Scotland can spur investment and improve skills. Polls suggest that, despite the gloomy predictions, Scots think Brexit more economically damaging than independence would be, and those most pessimistic about Brexit are the ones most enthusiastic about breaking away. After Brexit, Tories can hardly ask Scots to heed businesses’ concerns.

Unionists, with good cause, argue that the negotiations would be eerily familiar, too. Much of the content would resemble the 177 pages of legalese of the Brexit divorce treaty. That calculated Britain’s share of the EU’s financial liabilities, the rights of EU citizens in Britain, and tied up a long list of administrative loose ends, creating rules for personal data, nuclear fuel and legal disputes. Independence talks would cover a wider range, and be playing for higher stakes. The SNP wishes to eject Britain’s nuclear arsenal, which alarms American military planners. Britain’s £2.1trn national debt (98% of GDP) would need to be apportioned, as would its assets, including properties and oil and gas reserves.
The work would consume both governments. Brexit involved 25,000 civil servants (the Scottish government has just 5,000) and crowded out other issues for several years. The two parliaments would churn through a flurry of legislation to dissolve their relationship, create a new Scottish constitution and government, enact their divorce terms and remodel what was left of the rump British state.
And be the nation again
In the Brexit talks the EU had powerful leverage as the bigger party. As for Scotland, its deep integration with Britain would give Westminster the upper hand. The question is how far it would exploit it. “A brutal rupture would pretty much turn the lights out in Scotland,” says Philip Rycroft, a former British official who took part in informal preparations for a yes vote in 2014. He would urge ministers not to abuse that power, but an “antagonistic, zero-sum, Brexit negotiation mindset” could prevail, he warns.

Just as Europe feared a cascade of exit votes after Brexit, the fear of Wales and Northern Ireland also wanting to go their own way would drive a hard deal, says the Scottish Tory. “I see very few incentives to go kindly with them.”
Accession negotiations with Europe would be more cordial, but exacting. After five decades inside, Scotland should meet the EU’s core entry requirements—upholding democracy and the rule of law, and operating a robust market economy—relatively easily. It would need to bring its statute book back into line with Europe’s. A bigger task will be building new agencies to enforce rules in fields such as competition, data protection and customs.
Spain, which is fighting Catalan separatism, would be alarmed and wields a veto. Scotland would need nimble diplomacy, stressing that its exit was strictly in accord with Britain’s constitution.EU leaders would want to know that Scotland would not replace Britain as an awkward member, nor demand British-style opt-outs of major policies, says Fabian Zuleeg of the European Policy Centre. “But unless there were unreasonable demands, I can’t see that you wouldn’t get there in the end,” he says.
The whole process would strain Scotland’s parliament, just as Brexit split Westminster. Senior nationalists want to build a broad coalition for exit talks. They know it would be a gradual process. The Institute for Government, a think-tank, reckons leaving Britain and rejoining the EU would take most of a decade, but the nationalist rank and file want a fast and clean divorce.
Mr Cameron thought the threat of economic and administrative disruption could secure victory in referendums. But it is consent to a union that holds it together. Scottish independence, like Brexit, is a constitutional project, not an economic one. Fixing who governs you takes precedence over an easy life for supermarkets or civil servants. The British divorce from Europe has shown that a committed government, with the mandate of a referendum and an appetite for dislocation, can go a long way. The road back to Europe is long, but bagpipes may play again in Brussels. ■

From United Kingdom to Untied Kingdom (Apr 2021)
Northern Ireland’s unhappy centenary (Apr 2021)",2
1668,"BREXIT BATTLES are back. And not surprisingly the biggest is over Northern Ireland, the hardest issue in previous negotiations. It was supposedly solved in the withdrawal treaty of 2020 by the Northern Ireland protocol, which averts a hard border with the Republic of Ireland by keeping the North in the EU’s single market and customs union for goods, even though Great Britain is out of both. But that inevitably means border and customs controls between the two, in the Irish Sea. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) complains that 20% of EU border checks in the first quarter were in Northern Ireland, and wants the protocol scrapped. In July the British government proposed instead a radical revision that would dispense with almost all controls.
On October 13th the European Commission offered a compromise to keep the protocol but pare back checks, notably for chilled meats and medicines, and scrap those on products clearly destined for consumption in Northern Ireland. It claims this would end half today’s controls. Yet as in a game of chicken, Lord Frost, Boris Johnson’s EU negotiator, pre-empted this offer a day earlier by reiterating his demand for a complete rewrite of the protocol, placing much emphasis on British insistence, on grounds of sovereignty, on eliminating the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing it.

The protocol was central to the Brexit deal that Mr Johnson presented to voters in December 2019 as a triumph, because it got rid of the Northern Irish backstop negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May. That would have kept the whole of the United Kingdom in a customs union with the EU. Mr Johnson said his deal gave Northern Ireland the best of both worlds. But Lord Frost now says the protocol was accepted at a moment of negotiating weakness and has proved unsustainable. The suspicion in the EU is that the government acted in bad faith by agreeing to the protocol with no intention of applying it—a notion confirmed this week by Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s then chief of staff.
Flouting one treaty hardly makes it easier to win agreement to another. And it is also unlikely that the EU could accept the removal of the ECJ, which is essential to the single market’s legal order. Other countries might then seek similar treatment. It was Mr Johnson and Lord Frost who rejected alternatives: not only Mrs May’s backstop but also the Norwegian one of joining the EFTA court that mirrors the ECJ or a Swiss-style veterinary deal to avoid food checks. And despite the DUP’s campaign, business and most voters in Northern Ireland support an improved protocol if uncertainty over its future can be settled. There is no popular demand to scrap the ECJ’s role.
Now weeks of talks will start. Brussels is wary of a British habit of pocketing concessions only to ask for more. Trust is lacking all round. Lord Frost’s labelling of Britain’s EU membership as a “bad dream” rankles. So do his threats to invoke Article 16, which allows unilateral suspension of parts of the protocol if trade is badly disrupted. It is unclear how this would help either to increase certainty or to end the ECJ’s involvement. It might well trigger retaliation, including suspension of part or all of Britain’s trade deal with the EU. Unilaterally stopping controls on goods flowing to Northern Ireland might force a hard north-south border instead. And Mij Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, notes that, if this is rejected on political grounds, it would create pressure for customs controls between Ireland and the rest of the EU, which would be unacceptable to Dublin as well as the EU.
Better than risking a trade war would be to co-operate on simplifying checks under the existing protocol. Yet Mr Johnson and Lord Frost believe that bloody-mindedness towards the EU is the only way to win out. The evidence for this is thin: it was Britain, not the EU, that made the most concessions in the withdrawal treaty and trade agreement. Perhaps more worrying is the view that fights with the EU may bolster domestic support for Mr Johnson’s government, just as they may for the DUP in Northern Ireland, which faces a tough election battle against other unionist parties and Sinn Fein, the main nationalist one, next May. This winter may be frosty. ■

1669,"IN 2014 A GERMAN animal-rights group called SOKO Tierschutz planted a caretaker in the laboratory of Nikos Logothetis, a neuroscientist working at the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen. The infiltrator secretly filmed around 100 hours of lab work over six months, some of which was later broadcast on German television. The footage showed monkeys with metal plugs grafted into their skulls—ports which researchers used to probe and study their brains. One vomits on camera, apparently as a result of damage done to blood vessels in its brain while electrodes were inserted.
The impact was immediate and lasting. Around 800 people massed outside Dr Logothetis’s lab, demanding an end to his work with monkeys. He was called a monster and a murderer. He and his family received death threats. He faced charges (which were dismissed) of breaking German animal-welfare laws. So in 2020 he announced that his laboratory would move to China. He is building a new research facility in Shanghai, working with Mu-ming Poo of the Institute of Neuroscience, one of China’s leading brain researchers, who was on the team responsible for first cloning a genetically modified primate in 2018. Dr Logothetis is packing up his Tübingen lab.

Research on primates—mostly macaque monkeys—is increasingly unpopular in Europe and America. The EU has promised that it will reconsider rules about the use of monkeys in research every five years. It wants to end all animal research at an unspecified point in the future. American lawmakers are trying to pass the Humane and Existing Alternatives in Research and Testing Sciences Act. It would encourage scientists funded by the National Institutes of Health, the country’s largest funder of biomedical research, to move away from reliance on animals. In both Europe and America the number of monkeys in research has been flat or falling for the last five years.
And yet in East Asia, particularly China and Japan, the volume of research carried out on monkeys is growing. Most of this has been driven by creating and expanding domestic primate-research programmes. Leading institutions such as the Shanghai Institute of Neuroscience focus on breeding monkeys whose genomes have been modified in order to make their physiology more like humans’ and so more useful for studying human diseases.
This kind of genetic modification of research animals is common around the world in biomedical research, but is almost exclusively carried out on mice. No American or European laboratory maintains a line of genetically modified monkeys, but several Chinese and Japanese laboratories do. And since monkeys’ brains are far more like human ones than those of mice, transgenic monkeys will probably serve as a better model for studying neurological disease than transgenic mice. While such experiments remain beyond the pale in many countries, China and Japan are racing ahead.
Campaigners argue that no animal should be used for research because they cannot give informed consent. Julia Baines, who works on science policy at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an animal-rights group, suggests that all animals, including primates, can be replaced in biomedical research by a combination of in vitro studies (carried out in Petri dishes and test tubes without relying on living creatures), computer simulations and consensual human trials.
Others, such as researchers at the Centre for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University, advocate replacing animal experimentation where that seems possible and refining how it is used where it does not.
Monkeys make up just one in every 2,000 lab animals, according to Stefan Treue, a neuroscientist who works on them at the University of Göttingen in Germany. But they generate by far the most controversy. The social nature of their lives and their intelligence—which is why they are so useful for research—also help explain why such experiments are so troubling. Research which relies on them is simultaneously more valuable and more ethically fraught than research on other creatures. Neuroscientists in particular consider monkeys irreplaceable.
The brain is so poorly understood that looking at its activity in living creatures is the only way to fathom how it works, says Dr Treue. Dissecting dead brains produces only limited information. Brains only really make sense when active. Few humans would volunteer to have electrodes implanted in their brains. The consent of any who did would be suspect.
Allyson Bennett, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also argues for experiments on monkeys based on the value of pure science—research with no set goal. She cites Vittorio Erspamer, a physiologist working in Italy in the early 1930s. He was curious about the properties of chemicals found in the intestines of rabbits and frogs. In studying them he discovered serotonin.
Didn’t see that coming
Drugs that regulate the body’s production of serotonin nowadays treat various depressive disorders, improve the lives of millions and help prevent thousands of deaths. Erspamer, however, had no interest in depression or anxiety. It was decades before his discovery became the foundation for such treatments.
The list of medical advances which rest on animal experimentation is long, but Dr Bennett points to one in particular that could not have happened without monkeys: prosthetic limbs which “talk” to the brain, known as neural prosthetics. The brains of non-human primates are sufficiently similar to ours to allow for a prosthetic developed on monkeys to be used by humans. They are still rare, but prototypes have restored the power to interact with the physical world to people who have lost the use of their own limbs.
China is becoming the global centre for the kind of neuroscience that uses monkeys. And the stakes are getting higher. Neurological disorders are the world’s second-leading cause of death after heart disease. Conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s and dementia are becoming more burdensome as the world gets greyer. Meanwhile technology companies hope that an understanding of the brain can help them build cleverer software. Generals think advances in neuroscience can help them build better weapons.

The pandemic has bolstered China’s position. In February 2020 China’s government banned the export of all wild animals in an effort to tamp down the wildlife trade that is thought to be a vector for the zoonotic spillover of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19. Exceptions for research are subject to the government’s approval. Until recently the majority of monkeys used in America were imported from farms in China. But export controls have created shortages (see chart).
“China holding onto its primates fits into a long-term strategy it announced in 2015: the China 2025 policy,” says Kirk Leech of the European Animal Research Association. Understanding the brain was one of the key areas of scientific research for that policy. To achieve it, China needs more monkeys. Dr Treue says China has decided that research primates are a strategic resource. Exports are unlikely to revert to their previous levels.
This leaves Europe and America in a bind. The farms in China are well respected by the research community. Alternative suppliers from Vietnam and Cambodia operate in a way that is closer to grabbing wild monkeys out of their natural habitat. This is both more traumatic for the animal and less useful for research, as the health and age of such animals varies. Increasing the harms and reducing the usefulness of any research exacerbates the ethical dilemma of using monkeys.
Meanwhile, even as it keeps all of its farmed monkeys in its own country, Chinese neuroscience is expanding at such a pace that even domestic labs are experiencing shortages, according to Mr Leech. While researchers and campaigners in America and Europe battle over whether any sort of primate research is permissible, China and Japan are racing ahead.
The Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai is the largest buyer of the Neuropixel, a new brain probe. These are easier to install in animals’ brains than the kinds currently used. The institute bought 3,000 of the probes when they were released to install in macaque monkeys. This would have allowed it to gather neurological data on an unprecedented scale. The probe also offers a path to less invasive research than older, bigger electrodes, though the harm done by putting sensors into a brain will always be considerable.
Erika Sasaki at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals in Kawasaki near Tokyo has developed a line of genetically modified marmosets, a small monkey native to South America. She and her collaborators at the RIKEN Centre for Brain Science, also in Japan, are creating a 3D atlas of the marmoset brain to map both the higher cognitive functions unique to primates (humans included) and the neurodegenerative diseases that disrupt them.
Drifting apart
Diverging attitudes towards scientific research on monkeys have three consequences. America and Europe may find themselves outsourcing the creation of knowledge that relies on research methods they consider unethical. In future they may have to choose between relying on the fruits of that knowledge, such as treatments for neurological disorders, and rejecting them in principle. The UN’s World Health Organisation estimates that neurological disorders affect at least a billion people worldwide. Treatments for such conditions almost certainly involving some neuroscientific research on monkeys will become increasingly valuable.
Competition for control of the supply chains may sharpen. The pandemic has exposed the significance of Chinese supply chains for producing a range of medical equipment and supplies. If cutting-edge neuroscience becomes concentrated in China, new companies and medical treatments will emerge there too. Many governments are already wary of plugging Chinese-made networking equipment into their phone networks; they will probably be queasy about bunging vital Chinese-made probes into their citizens’ brains.
Probing the workings of the brain is a 21st-century equivalent to exploring the farthest reaches of the planet. The results will not only teach humans about their own minds but will also help them design artificial intelligence—a separate but connected field in which competition between countries has become fierce. If such scientific knowledge is largely produced in China and Japan, it will become ever harder for others to catch up, should they decide they wish to do so. ■",2
1670,"A ROCKSTAR’S WELCOME greeted Universal Music Group when it launched on Amsterdam’s Euronext exchange on September 21st in Europe’s largest listing of the year. Giddy investors all but threw their knickers at the newly public company, whose share price finished the day up by 36%, valuing the world’s biggest record label at €45bn ($53bn).
Not long ago Universal looked like a flop. In 2013, as digital piracy ravaged the music industry, SoftBank, a Japanese group, bid €7bn for the label. Vivendi, Universal’s French owner, was thought mad for turning down the offer. In fact the decision was inspired. A streaming boom has since lifted worldwide recorded-music revenues by half. Two-thirds of last year’s sales of $22bn went to the three “major” labels: Universal, Sony Music and Warner Music Group.

Investors’ rush owes in part to a dearth of alternative tickets to this hot market. Sony Music is locked inside a conglomerate. Warner went public last June, since when its value has risen by half (including a bump of 12% on September 21st, amid the Universal frenzy), but its catalogue is half the size of Universal’s. The listing of Universal gives investors the chance at last to get their hands on what JPMorgan Chase, a bank, dubbed a “must-own asset”.
Now, after their chart-topping run, the majors face the equivalent of a difficult second album. Streaming is nearing saturation-point in the rich world. Three in five American homes subscribe to a service like Spotify, up from one in five in 2016. DIY audio tools are helping unsigned artists take a small but growing share of the business. And regulators are asking whether labels are giving artists a fair share of streaming profits. On September 22nd Britain’s government requested a competition probe into the music industry.
Keeping the hits coming will therefore rely on conquering emerging markets, where revenues are lower (Spotify costs the equivalent of $4 per month in South Africa, less than half what Americans pay), and on licensing music to new forms of media. This year Universal has signed deals with TikTok and Snap, allowing the apps’ users to sample clips from Universal’s back catalogue in their videos. Future deals with gaming, streaming and other entertainment platforms are likely. “Fortnite”, an online game, and Roblox, which lets users make their own games, have already become popular virtual-concert venues. Next year ABBA, a troupe of septuagenarians on Universal’s books, will appear in a series of gigs in London as digital “ABBA-tars”. As the streaming boom slows, labels will need new ways of bringing in money, money, money. ■

1671,"GLASGOW, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine, Fiji, Colombia, Kenya and Mali will be the first countries to participate in an investment program announced on Thursday that will help developing countries transform their power grids to carry growing levels of renewable energy.
The Climate Investment Funds (CIF), created by the world's biggest economies in 2008 to help developing countries accelerate their shift to a low-carbon economy, said its new initiative would help those countries bridge a huge gap in investments needed to integrate renewable energy sources.
Experts estimate that global infrastructure investments will have to ramp up to $820 billion annually by 2030 to facilitate the decarbonization of power systems and help refit or replace existing infrastructure so it can integrate alternative energy.
""Power systems in many, many developing countries are not equipped today to take on that much renewable energy capacity,"" CIF chief Mafalda Duarte told Reuters at the COP26 climatesummit.
""Our grids won't be ready for a clean energy future unless we can unlock significantly more investment in fit-for-purpose energy systems,"" Duarte added.
Duarte said investors viewed this issue as a major barrier to investments in renewables. ""If you can't integrate them into the power systems, there's no point in generating all that power,"" she said.
Duarte said Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia and Turkey were priority countries for subsequent phases of the Renewable Energy Integration (REI) program.
The REI program will work through multilateral development banks to offer participating countries a toolbox of financial instruments and technical assistance.
Plans for REI were endorsed earlier this year by the Group of Seven advanced economies, and are supported by financial pledges from the Netherlands, Britain and Switzerland.
The new program will support grid flexibility measures on both the supply and demand sides by scaling up renewable-energy enabling technologies and enhancing the readiness of energy infrastructure for renewables.
It will also support innovative business models and improve power system and market design.",3
1672,"BEFORE THE pandemic, Celso Vigo walked for 90 minutes each day through the streets of Serrana, a town of 45,000 people surrounded by sugarcane fields in the state of São Paulo. But when covid-19 hit, the 75-year-old retired bank clerk, who played football “well into my 60s”, was reduced to doing loops around his house. It reminded him of how Brazil, too, was going in circles. After a second wave killed 87,000 people in April, cases and deaths remain high.
But Serrana was given a way out. Between February and April, all adults were offered jabs as part of a study by the Butantan Institute, which produces CoronaVac, a vaccine developed by Sinovac, a Chinese firm. More than 95% of serranenses got jabbed, despite Jair Bolsonaro, the president, claiming that it was unsafe. Preliminary results released on May 31st showed that symptomatic cases and deaths fell by 80% and 95%, respectively. Only two covid-19 patients remain hospitalised in the local clinic (both refused the vaccine). Mr Vigo is once again pounding the pavements.


Serrana is a tantalising glimpse of an alternative reality in Brazil—one in which Mr Bolsonaro did not squander his chances to mount an effective public-health campaign and, later, to buy vaccines. But the study also has global implications. In phase three trials, CoronaVac had efficacy rates as low as 50%, the minimum required by the WHO. The lower the efficacy, the higher the share of people who must be jabbed to slow contagion. The trial in Serrana sought to discover that share. The town was split into four cohorts, that got jabbed in successive weeks. Contagion dropped dramatically after three out of the four had received two doses of the vaccine, suggesting that herd immunity is attained at around 75%.
These results could boost vaccine uptake across Brazil, hopes Ethel Maciel, an epidemiologist. But 75% is a long way off. Only 11% of Brazilians are fully vaccinated, and the rate has slowed because of a shortage of ingredients for CoronaVac, which are imported from China. Chile, which has vaccinated 45% of its population, mostly with CoronaVac, is also suffering near-record cases.

But Serrana itself has become an oasis. On a recent morning, children ran round a fountain in the plaza. Across the street a fabric shop that caters to elderly women had a steady stream of customers. A gang of old men occupied their usual benches. They discussed Mr Bolsonaro’s decision to host the Copa América, a football tournament, even though a third wave seems imminent. “Stupid,” a 97-year-old said. Half of them scattered when an outsider showed up. “We’re still scared,” explained Florivaldo Leandro, a retired police officer. Serrana’s calm came at a cost, he said. “We lost friends, neighbours and relatives. Our conscientiousness was forced upon us.”

1673,"There's a sexy new show coming to Sin City.
And Channing Tatum paved the way for a male review unlike any other with the Finding Magic Mike HBO Max stripper reality show competition. 
In a new trailer for the seven-episode series, average Joes' who have 'lost their magic' compete for a chance to not only take the stage in the hottest male review in Las Vegas, but also earn a handsome cash prize.
'The hottest show in Vegas is giving ordinary guys a chance to work their magic,' a narrator said as the scene set over the sparkling city skyline.
From executive producers Channing Tatum and Steven Soderbergh, a group of men are challenged with the task of becoming the next best erotic dancer.
'We searched the country to find guys who feel like they've lost their magic,' a producer quipped in a confessional.
'This isn't just about taking your clothes off - you're coming to see a show.'
Men are put through boot-camp-like competitions and perform routines to throngs of men and women while vying for the ultimate prize. 
Competitors 'strip down both literally and figuratively as they rid themselves of emotional baggage and regain their mojo … but only one will be the Real Magic Mike.'
'Who is bringing the whole package?' flashes across the screen in bold blue lettering as dancers rip their clothes off.
'We're creating monsters,' another dancer chimed in. 
Magic Mike first debuted on the silver screen in June 2012 and was loosely based on Channing's experiences as an 18-year-old stripper in Tampa Bay, Florida.
The film's all-star cast included Matthew McConaughey, Riley Keough, Joe Manganiello, Alex Pettyfer and Olivia Munn. 
Its sequel, Magic Mike XXL, was released in 2015, and also featured Jada Pinkett Smith, Donald Glover, Andie MacDowell, Amber Heard and Elizabeth Banks. ",-2
1674,"LAGOS/LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote is in talks with some of the world's biggest oil traders to help finance his mega refinery project outside of Nigeria's commercial centre Lagos, sources with knowledge of the matter said, although his company denied the discussions.
The 650,000 barrel-per-day refinery, once complete, will be the continent's largest plant and redraw major trade flows of crude and fuel in the Atlantic basin.
Despite being Africa's biggest oil producer and exporter, the country depends almost entirely on fuel imports after allowing its significant refining capacity, 445,000 barrels-per-day, to become dilapidated over several decades.
Many past and current Nigerian officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, have announced plans to refurbish them, but political will has been lacking.
The Natural Resources Governance Institute, a non-profit policy think tank, has previously pointed to the moribund refineries as a key focus of oil corruption and waste in the country.
Hit by economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and soaring construction costs, Dangote needs a cash injection.
Nigeria's state oil firm NNPC has agreed to buy a 20% stake in the refinery for about $2.8 billion, but Dangote is looking for outside cash.  read more  NNPC's head Mele Kyari said a process was ongoing to raise $1 billion with Afreximbank to fund part of its stake purchase.
The billionaire has held talks as recently as a month ago with executives from the world's top two oil traders - Trafigura and Vitol, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Dangote's management denied the talks.
""The company is not in any talks with the aforementioned oil traders to seek a loan to finance our project,"" the management of Dangote Industries Ltd said in a statement.
Trafigura and Vitol declined to comment.
Two separate sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the option of raising another $500 million from a trade house or consortium was being explored.
The details of a potential loan from a trading firm have not been finalised but the trader could receive a long-term contract to supply crude and receive cargoes of refined products as repayment.
The refinery has been delayed by several years and the cost has ballooned to $19 billion from Dangote's earlier estimates of $12-14 billion. Construction was also delayed due to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers at the site and delays getting materials, two more sources said.
Many industry sources do not expect any products before the second half of next year.
Swiss traders like Vitol along with Nigerian firms, have cashed-in for years in gasoline-short Nigeria by supplying mega tenders and being part of lucrative crude-for-fuel swap deals for over a decade.
Getting a hold of Dangote's fuel will give the trader a stranglehold on a key set of new oil flows. Nigeria's new oil bill, approved last month after nearly 20 years of political wrangling, has added fuel-import licence requirements that experts fear will give Dangote an effective monopoly.  read more 
Under the new laws, the regulator will prioritize local refiners for import licences and volumes would be based on production capacity or market share.
While Nigeria will remain open in theory to international trading houses, a partnership with Dangote would be the only way to guarantee a foothold in Africa's biggest economy.",3
1675,"IT LOOKED LIKE the fall of Saigon in 1975 on fast-forward: an American-backed army melting away, enemy fighters strolling into the presidential palace, desperate crowds mobbing the airport. But the similarities between Afghanistan and South Vietnam were not only superficial. Both states, built to please their American sponsors, had been hollowed out by one of the oldest diseases of governance: corruption.
In Afghanistan, “from your birth certificate to your death certificate and whatever comes in between, somehow you have to bribe,” says Ahmad Shah Katawazai, a former Afghan diplomat. Officials and police routinely demand baksheesh (a “tip”). As the Taliban advanced, the pay-off required for a passport rose to thousands of dollars.

Worse, a government job is itself a valuable commodity. As Sarah Chayes, an expert on corruption, discovered while running an NGO in Afghanistan, officials often buy their posts and must extort kickbacks to recoup their investment. Mr Katawazai says it can cost $100,000 to become a district police chief. Officials’ main goal becomes extorting revenue to distribute to their families and patronage networks.
Afghanistan was partly run by such networks, even before 2001. But America strengthened them by paying off warlords, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). In 2009 ISAF, the coalition of NATO-led forces in the country, set up an anti-corruption unit called Shafafiyat (“transparency” in Pashto), with modest results. The government’s anti-corruption prosecutor mainly pursued political enemies. By the end the country was so corrupt that governors cut deals with jihadists. The army’s numbers were inflated by “ghost soldiers”, absentees listed on the payroll so that commanders could pocket their salaries.
Americans may remember the term “ghost soldiers” from the war in Vietnam, where corrupt senior officers used the same system. One South Vietnamese colonel used to order aimless artillery barrages in order to hawk the spent shell casings as scrap metal. As in Afghanistan, police and soldiers profited from the heroin trade. A report in 1978 on the fall of South Vietnam by RAND, a security think-tank, said South Vietnamese themselves believed that corruption was “largely responsible for the ultimate collapse”.
Why then, when it invaded Afghanistan decades later, did America fail to take corruption seriously? One answer is that political thinkers are only now doing so. Scholars such as Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist, see corruption as a throwback to pre-modern governments where power is based on personal ties rather than institutions. In this way South Vietnam and Afghanistan resemble mafias or the feudal states of medieval Europe. States like these lack the cohesion needed to beat a disciplined insurgency such as the Vietnamese communists or the Taliban.
Another problem, says Mark Pyman of CurbingCorruption, a watchdog, is that corruption is too knotty a problem for military officers focused on their nine-month rotations. For their part, aid agencies too often judge success by how much money they disburse. In both South Vietnam and Afghanistan a vast influx of American dollars caused a surge in inflation, wiping out public-sector salaries. (Afghanistan, with a GDP of about $20bn per year in 2020, received $145bn in American aid in 2001-21. Inflation averaged 17.5% in 2003-8.) Public servants had to demand kickbacks to support themselves.
Hence anti-corruption experts recommend that aid should be frugal and focused on achievements. That is easier said than done. If America does not learn that dollars cannot build a real government, it will end up creating more fake ones. ■",2
1676,"VIRGINIA’S SCHOOLS don’t teach critical race theory, but Glenn Youngkin’s old school does. The hypothesis that America is structurally racist, which the victorious Republican candidate for governor falsely claimed was being fed to Virginia’s children, emerged at Harvard in the 1980s and has been taught there ever since. Toni Morrison, a novelist of black America whose book “Beloved” Mr Youngkin’s campaign attacked, also had ties to his alma mater. Yet it is a safe bet that the private-equity baron won’t discourage his four children from following him there.
A visitor from Mars might find Mr Youngkin’s populist scare-tactics at odds with his record of elite institutions (Rice, Harvard, McKinsey, the Carlyle Group) and immense wealth. The Martian should then be challenged to find an up-and-coming Republican with a much humbler résumé. Populist leaders, from Peron to Orban, are more often elite figures than working-class heroes; and so it is in the Republican Party. The anti-elitism fervour that has captured the right is largely a creation of rich Ivy Leaguers.

Donald Trump, a billionaire alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania, won in 2016 with help from Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner (both of Harvard). His media cheerleaders included Ann Coulter (Cornell), Kayleigh McEnany (Oxford and Harvard), Tucker Carlson (Trinity College), Steve Hilton (Oxford) and Laura Ingraham (Dartmouth College). His chief imitators include Ron DeSantis (Yale and Harvard), Ted Cruz (Princeton and Harvard), Josh Hawley (Stanford and Yale) and Tom Cotton, Mike Pompeo and Elise Stefanik (all Harvard). A working-class movement this is not.
To some extent it reflects Ivy Leaguers’ dominance of politics and the media generally. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the first presidential duo not to have attended an elite institution for 36 years. And the closure of local newsrooms has seen the Ivies emerge as the main source of journalistic talent. A recent study of 150 interns at leading newspapers found that 65% studied at the country’s most selective universities. Yet, in a way, that makes the hollowness of the MAGA crowd’s populist credentials even more striking. American politics is not witnessing a revolt against the elite so much as a power struggle within it.
To distinguish themselves from their opponents the populists often turn on the institutions that launched them both. As a precocious teenage columnist, Mr Hawley slammed the Ivies for being “elitist” while he was still attending (an expensive private) high school. Such attacks recall a long conservative tradition.
William F. Buckley, father of the conservative movement, made his name by lambasting his former teachers in “God and Man at Yale”. Combining erudition with a willingness to shock, he was kicking the post-New Deal liberal consensus of the early 1950s. The young fogey-ish columns Mr Cotton wrote for the Harvard Crimson in the 1990s, decrying feminism and the “cult of ‘diversity’”, share some of that spirit. “My first end was not to persuade but rather to offend your sensibilities,” read his valedictory piece.
Some Ivy League populists also recall the slightly awkward insiderishness of Buckley, a nouveau-riche Catholic. Mr Trump still seems to consider himself an interloper from Queens. Mr Cotton is a son of Arkansas farmers; Mr Hilton a scholarship boy who attached himself to the British Tories’ most entitled faction. When such figures rail against their former teachers and classmates, some wounded part of them really means it. “It’s much easier to hate people you’ve been around than people you don’t know,” observes Yascha Mounk, a Harvard-educated scholar of populism.
Yet Buckley’s irreverent conservatism was not rooted in resentment but ideas, and firmly within the democratic tradition. He mocked his teachers to assert the superiority of classical liberalism over their progressivism. He did not rubbish the very idea of expertise, as Trump populists do. Their anti-elitism is intellectually unmoored, unrestrained and, as in Mr Youngkin’s populist turn, largely manufactured. It lumps together real gripes—including Buckley’s still-valid critique of the academy—with an ever expanding list of imagined ones: against the FBI, the Senate parliamentarian, voting machines and other shadowy forces deemed to be denying conservatives power. It aims to stir resentment, not solve problems; to weaken institutions, not improve them.
At the heart of this development was a realisation in the 1990s that outrage sells. High-achieving conservatives had previously found refuge in think-tanks, Wall Street and the law. Henceforth they began gravitating to the conservative news-entertainment industry, where owning the libs became a blood sport. The fact that Ms Coulter, Mr Bannon, Ms Ingraham and Ms McEnany left law and finance for the media illustrates the trend. Mr Trump’s success lay in turning that entertainment business—hitherto a slightly discreditable sideshow—into the Republican main act. Inevitably, the handful of conservatives who have resisted him, such as Bill Kristol and David Frum in the media and Liz Cheney and Ben Sasse on the Hill, also tend to be products of elite institutions. But his Ivy League enablers are far more numerous and influential. He could not have remade the right as thoroughly as he has done without them.
Under new management
Conservatives long argued that campus liberalism produces ambitious narcissists, not public servants. It is ironic that the best evidence for that (see the competitively unprincipled Mr Hawley and Ms Stefanik) is on the right. There are still many civic-minded swots on the centre-left: such as Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg, of Yale, Harvard and Oxford. The conservative critique rests on a misplaced assumption that the Ivies still shape the political culture in both parties. In fact Trump populism is less an elite project than a business venture with elite management. Mr Youngkin, an experienced manager with flexible views and a modest flair for culture warring, looks like a solid recruit.■

1677,"A LLEN JOSEPH was listening to a meditation recording when he felt his house in Paillant moving from side to side. “It was as if I were surfing a huge wave,” he says. Mr Joseph’s town (see map), home to about 20,000 people, was close to the epicentre of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2. It struck Haiti on the morning of August 14th. A tropical storm followed just days later, complicating rescue efforts as it brought floods and landslides. So far more than 2,000 people are confirmed dead—a number that is bound to rise. Thousands more are injured, missing or homeless.

Haiti, a Caribbean country of 11m people, has been plagued by political turmoil, poverty and natural disasters for years. But they have come in quick succession of late. The earthquake struck just over a month after the assassination of Jovenel Moïse, the president, on July 7th, which has created a political vacuum. Even before that, the country was unstable. Gangs had proliferated and the economy had been shrinking for the past two years.

The country still bears the scars from past natural disasters, too. A quake in 2010 devastated Port-au-Prince, the crowded capital, killing 220,000 people. In 2016 the strongest hurricane in five decades hit.
Now Haiti will once again rely on the largesse of foreign donors. But aid is a mixed blessing. Although it has done much good, it has also weakened the government, since it flows largely through private networks. Worse, in the past decade UN peacekeepers accidentally introduced cholera, which has killed around 10,000 people according to official statistics. They have also been accused of sexually abusing Haitian girls.
The government will struggle, as usual, to cope with the latest disaster. Thousands of people are huddled in parks, without shelter, food or water. Several medical facilities, already scarce in the worst-affected area, have been destroyed. As gangs control roads that connect Port-au-Prince with the rest of the country, aid supplies must be airlifted, which slows their distribution. Happily UN officials say they may have struck a deal for safe passage by land.
As the state deals with the earthquake’s aftermath, progress may stall in the investigation into Mr Moïse’s murder. Not that there has been much. Despite multiple arrests, including those of Colombian mercenaries accused of carrying out the operation, few think the authorities are close to finding the real culprits.
Before the quake, elections for a new president and legislature due in September had already been pushed back until November. They may be delayed further. Haiti desperately needs a legitimate government. Mr Moïse had ruled by decree since January 2020, having dismissed all but ten lawmakers from Parliament. Rebuilding the country, controlling gangs and curbing the pandemic are top of the agenda for any new leader. (Just 371 Haitians have been fully vaccinated against covid-19.) Many are voting with their feet: Haitians have fled the country in droves in the past two years. The exodus is likely to grow. ■

1678,"“WE ARE BUILDING the energy company of the future…like Tesla did,” declares Seifi Ghasemi, chairman of Air Products. Comparing yourself to the electric-car darling may seem Napoleonic for a purveyor of industrial gases. But Mr Ghasemi, who has thought about one gas in particular, hydrogen, for 30 years, insists the comparison is apt.
He is not alone. Hydrogen is expected to play a big role in greening hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement and steel, as well as in long-term energy storage. Today’s smallish and, because almost all the stuff is made from fossil fuels in a carbon-intensive way, dirtyish hydrogen business is forecast to grow into a much cleaner trillion-dollar industry in a few decades. Governments are spending tens of billions of dollars a year to kickstart a clean-hydrogen revolution. A posse of hydrogen-curious firms are keen for a piece of the action.

Maheep Mandloi of Credit Suisse, a bank, sees the natural-gas industry as a template for the development of hydrogen, which is already used in refining. The rise of liquefied natural gas took the sort of capital and expertise that only the integrated global energy giants had. Small wonder big oil is taking an interest. In September Chevron, an American oil titan, unveiled a $10bn strategy for “new energy” that bets big on low-carbon hydrogen.

The other supermajors—BP, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalEnergies—have also announced investments in hydrogen clusters and technologies. Ahmad al-Khowaiter, chief technology officer of Saudi Aramco, says that the state-controlled oil colossus intends to be the world leader in fossil-derived low-carbon hydrogen in the 2030s. The kingdom’s hope is also to maintain its energy superpowerdom as oil’s prospects fade by exporting hydrogen made using its world-class solar and wind resources.
Aaron Denman of Bain, a consultancy, calls such bets a quest for “growth engine number two” in case the firms’ core fossil-fuel business falters. The same rationale may underlie the hydrogen efforts of other sectors with a spotty environmental record. On October 11th Andrew Forrest, a mining tycoon and Australia’s richest man, who controls Fortescue Metals Group, unveiled plans to build the world’s biggest factory for electrolyser machines, needed to produce green hydrogen from water.
Not all H2 prospectors come from grubby industries trying to burnish their image in an ever more climate-conscious world. Given the much wider range of potential applications for hydrogen, various other sectors could strike gaseous gold. Mr Ghasemi, for one, is confident that his company will beat the commodities giants, which he sees as complacent. “They think hydrocarbons are here for ever and don’t think anybody can disrupt them.”
Air Products is trying to prove them wrong. It is developing several hydrogen megaprojects around the world, including a $5bn initiative to produce renewable hydrogen in Saudi Arabia for export. James West of Evercore, an investment bank, reckons industrial-gas firms could become the first supermajors of the hydrogen era. Big oil won’t take that lying down. ■

Amazon is reportedly in talks to buy  MGM, the studio behind the James Bond franchise, for $9bn. MGM is one of the few big Hollywood film-makers not to have been swallowed up by a media conglomerate.
Also joining the rush among media companies to consolidate,  TF1 and  M6, two French broadcasters, announced their intention to merge. The pair say that the deal will protect the independence of French content against the likes of Disney and Netflix. Regulators will be concerned by the 70% share of advertising on French TV that they would control.
The International Energy Agency surprised many with its “road-map” to net zero emissions by 2050. To reach that goal, the IEA’s report said that no new oil or gas projects should be approved, and that the power generated by solar and wind should increase fourfold by 2030. Underlining the challenge, for solar that would be the equivalent of installing the world’s largest solar park nearly every day.
Almost 89% of shareholders in Shell backed the management’s plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company has come under pressure from green activists who say this does not go far enough and from other investors who say Shell’s strategy lacks the focus of American giants, who remain centred on oil and gas. A separate resolution submitted by Follow This, a Dutch green investor group, was supported by 30% of shareholders, passing a threshold under British company law which means Shell must now consult with them.

Japan’s economy shrank by 1.3% in the first quarter over the previous three months. The declaration of a second state of emergency, which urged people to stay at home, was mostly to blame. In a sign that a recovery may be under way, exports in April grew by 38% year on year. That was the fastest pace in a decade, even if it is a comparison with trade in the depths of the pandemic.
Britain’s annual inflation rate leapt to 1.5% in April from 0.7% in March. The increase reflects a jump in consumer prices when shops re-opened in April and higher oil prices, which pushed up the cost of energy. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said he was carefully watching the data and if inflation persistently rose above the bank’s 2% target he would take action, “no question about that”.
China told its banks and payment companies not to conduct transactions involving cryptocurrencies and warned investors against speculating in them, because they are disrupting the “normal economic and financial order”. The price of bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies plunged in response. China’s central bank is well advanced in developing its own digital currency.
Light at the end of the tunnel
Eurostar secured a bail-out from investors, mostly in loan guarantees. The rescue package was led by SNCF, the French state railway group, which is Eurostar’s majority shareholder. The British government refused to take part; it sold its 40% stake in the company in 2015. Eurostar hopes to increase the number of trains it runs between London and the continent as travel restrictions ease.
Britain’s railways, meanwhile, are to face the biggest set of reforms since privatisation in the mid-1990s. The government published a plan that would bring rail infrastructure, timetables and ticket prices back under state control, but still contract train operations to private companies. The hope is that this will lead to clearer lines of communication between the government and the private sector.
Indonesia’s two biggest startups, Gojek and Tokopedia, said they would merge, creating a platform that spans ride-hailing, digital payments and e-commerce. The combined company, GoTo, will reportedly seek to float on stockmarkets later this year, in a dual listing which could see it valued at up to $40bn.
Working 55 hours or more a week is “a serious health hazard” according to the World Health Organisation, in a first global analysis of the effects of working long hours. Working at least 55 hours is associated with higher risks of stroke and heart disease, compared with working 35-40 hours. The disease burden is significant in men, people living in East and South-East Asia, and middle-aged or older workers.",2

IN JANUARY BRUSSELS was an optimistic place. The European Union (EU) had survived a decade that included the near collapse of the bloc’s currency, a refugee crisis and its second-largest economy, Britain, voting to leave. For the first time in years, officials had time to think of the future rather than clear up the messes of the past. Then 120,000 people died.
Sweeping lockdowns confined citizens to their homes, in Paris and Warsaw alike. A bloc that prided itself on removing borders—“the scars of history” in the words of Josep Borrell, the European Commission’s foreign-policy chief—reintroduced them in chaos. Commuters were stranded at Poland’s borders with both Lithuania and Germany, some of them for days.

The bloc’s GDP is expected to drop by 7.4% this year, compared with a 4.3% fall in 2009, the worst year of the financial crisis. Investors betting on the collapse of the euro have started to drive up Italy’s borrowing costs. European politicians have attacked each other with a ferocity not seen since the euro crisis, when the bloc’s future was last in doubt. After Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch finance minister, suggested some countries had themselves to blame for their financial troubles, Antonio Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, issued a fierce response. “This speech is disgusting,” he said. “Disgusting.”
The whole world is struggling with covid-19. But in the EU, the pandemic has triggered a concatenation of crises. What started as a health crisis became an economic crisis, then a political crisis, then a financial crisis, says Pepijn Bergsen of Chatham House, a think-tank. Now it risks becoming a constitutional one, after Germany’s constitutional court challenged the legal supremacy of the European Court of Justice earlier this month.
In its current form, the EU amplifies crises rather than solving them. Sticking with the current system is untenable. Altering it will be difficult. Fundamentally different expectations of the EU divide Europeans. At the heart of these disagreements is an inability to find an answer to a decades-old question: what is the EU actually for?
There’s something evolving
It began as a peace project. On May 9th 1950, five years after the second world war ended in Europe, Robert Schuman, then France’s foreign minister, unveiled a scheme to make war between his country and West Germany “not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible”. His method? Combining the coal- and steel-production capabilities of the two countries, along with any other willing European nations, and putting them under the control of an independent authority. Two years later the European Coal and Steel Community, the forebear of the EU, was born.
Prosperity soon followed, with European co-operation framed as a path to riches thanks to free movement of goods, workers, capital and services in the original club of six countries (as well as France and West Germany it included Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). The small club first expanded to its north, with Ireland, Denmark and Britain joining. Then in the 1980s the young democracies in southern Europe, such as Spain, Portugal and Greece were included. By the mid-2000s, much of eastern Europe had signed up, too.
Building up the bloc was a piecemeal process, as Schuman had envisaged, arguing that “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.” Slowly and quietly, bureaucrats in Brussels and judges in European courts disassembled barriers to trade and harmonised regulations. In 1992 the single market programme, backed by Margaret Thatcher, the generally Eurosceptic British prime minister, made trade even easier. It took two constitutional earthquakes for European voters to notice that the foundations of their governments had shifted: the introduction of the euro and the expansion of the bloc to include former communist countries in eastern Europe.
These changes had visible effects. A mass movement of people from central and eastern Europe to richer countries in the west made clear that freedom of movement was not just a nebulous concept, but one which affected people’s daily lives; mostly for good but, in the perception of some, for ill. In 2010 the euro-zone crisis was a potent reminder that the fate of the currency in a Belgian’s wallet was in part determined by the actions of governments in Athens, Rome and Madrid. European voters became painfully aware of the EU’s price, and that led to increasingly anxious questions about its purpose.
The world keeps revolving
Today a common goal is hard to find. The challenges that the EU now faces—on fiscal policy, foreign policy, defence and migration—cut to the heart of sovereignty. Dreams of the EU as a superpower require a strategic unity not easy to find among a 27-member bloc that stretches from Lisbon to Tallinn. Even attempts to turn the EU into an advocate of liberal democratic values fail to inspire everyone. In the past, disagreements on direction could be settled by standing still. Now, the forces that held the EU together risk pulling it apart.
Take the single market. According to the European Commission, allowing the free movement of labour, capital, services and workers adds between 8% and 9% to the EU’s collective GDP. Because all companies in the EU can access each other’s markets, the bloc has strict rules on how much help a government can give to domestic companies. When covid-19 hit, the commission loosened them, allowing governments to hand out cash to industries they feared might go under. Such aid, in the form of guarantees or wage supplements, has amounted to €1.9trn ($2trn) so far. German guarantees for German businesses account for just over half of this figure.
Once a reasonably level playing field, the single market is now lopsided. In the downturn to come, Spain and Italy will endure deeper recessions than Germany, leaving them even less financial muscle to help domestic businesses. Both the Spanish and Italian economies will contract by more than 9% this year, predicts the European Commission. By contrast, Germany’s GDP will fall by 6.5%. Not for the first time in the bloc’s history, the burden falls heaviest on those least able to bear it.
To rebalance the EU’s economy, an alliance of countries led by Spain suggested grants totalling €1.5trn, paid for with debt backed collectively by the EU as a whole. It would be in the self-interest of all EU countries, argues Luis Garicano, a liberal Spanish MEP. Collapsing southern European economies would wreck the cozy economic settlement that has been so beneficial to the likes of Germany and the Netherlands. The euro has enabled Germany to run huge trade surpluses without being hindered by an appreciating currency. Fiscal transfers from north to south would be a small price to pay. Without such a comprehensive recovery fund, the single market risks entrenching inequality rather than spreading wealth.
However this plan was staunchly opposed by small, rich, mostly northern countries, several of which have also had slightly fewer covid-related deaths than others (see map). The Netherlands, Demark and Sweden all pooh-poohed the idea. The Dutch government offered a one-off grant of €1bn, about a tenth of a percent of the sum demanded by the Spanish government, as a gesture of goodwill.

The German government, meanwhile, will stretch only to modest grants, arguing that any EU recovery fund should consist mainly of loans. In the middle, the European Commission is tasked with devising a scheme that keeps both sides happy. It will propose a mixture of grants and loans to indebted countries, paid for out of the EU’s budget. Countries will spend much of the year haggling over it.
The argument over how to respond to the economic crisis reveals another faultline that has long run through the EU: a shared currency but no shared spending policy. This was originally a feature of the euro’s design, not a bug, argues Jan Techau of the German Marshall Fund, a think-tank. The euro’s creators “wanted this tension to be there”, he says. Given the obvious problems of running a currency without a unified budget or transfers between richer and poorer members, fiscal union—considered a step too far when the euro was introduced—would eventually have to follow. What the euro’s designers did not envisage was that Europe’s leaders would balk, repeatedly, at that deeper integration, thus endangering the currency’s survival.
They say the next big thing is here
Economic integration has failed to provide the EU with a compelling common purpose. Other, less tangible goals have taken on greater importance. A Europe based on shared values looms large in the imagination of Europhiles. Today Eurocrats are more likely to discuss ways of protecting and promoting the “European way of life” than the merits of close economic ties.
This view taps into a long memory of the EU as a civilising force. “Spain is the problem, Europe is the solution,” declared José Ortega y Gasset, a Spanish writer, in 1910. If his phrase has become a cliché of his country’s political life it is because after the end of the long dictatorship of Francisco Franco in 1975, most Spaniards wanted their country to become a normal European democracy. It is a view shared in Germany. “German problems can only be solved under a European roof,” declared Konrad Adenauer, West Germany’s first chancellor, in 1962.
However, this view is not universal. Memories of authoritarian regimes may linger in the politics of most EU states. Yet no such memory concentrates minds in, say, Sweden, meaning that supranational shackles can be seen as an affront to sovereignty rather than a necessary constraint on the state.
Shared values matter to a continent coming to terms with its past. They also matter for a continent that increasingly tries to influence the world, portraying itself as a global power. Ivan Krastev, a political scientist and the bloc’s most impish critic, sees two paths for the EU. Either it becomes more of a “mission”, going forth and evangelising European values globally, or it becomes a “monastery” and preaches only to Europeans within its precincts.
The idea of a European mission has its fair share of supporters. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, said it would be a more “geopolitical” body under her leadership. Enrico Letta, a former prime minister of Italy and now the head of the Jacques Delors Institute, a think-tank, argues that the EU should aim to become a third superpower between America and China.
I’ve seen it before, and I’ll see it again
Indeed, the EU already has immense regulatory clout. It sets global standards on everything from privacy to processing chemicals to environmental rules. Rather than use different standards across the globe, businesses obey the EU’s (usually more stringent) regulations to save costs, a phenomenon known as “the Brussels effect”. Translating this into more tangible forms of power is difficult. Superpowers require strategic unity, which may be hard to build in a club that has very different views on Russia, to give just one example.
If the EU rolls back its global ambitions and goes down the second route suggested by Mr Krastev—becoming a monastery—it will have to deal with a war among the monks. Any claim that the EU is united in its support for liberal democratic norms is disproven by the fact that Poland and Hungary have steadily eroded the rule of law—and yet they remain members of the club. Poland’s government has tried to nobble its supreme court. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, has subverted or sidelined most of his country’s checks and balances over the past decade, and seized on the pandemic as an excuse to rule by decree indefinitely. Meanwhile, cronies of his ruling party are gorging on aid from Brussels.

Even previously unchallenged parts of the EU’s dogma, such as its legal order, look more shaky. In May Germany’s constitutional court ruled that the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg was acting beyond its authority in the way it ruled on the European Central Bank’s bond-buying in 2018. In effect, the German court declared that since the EU is not a federal state, national courts can decide whether the ECJ has gone beyond its remit. The ECJ disagreed, leaving the two courts jostling for supremacy. The European Commission is examining whether to launch sanctions against Berlin for breaking the EU’s treaties. (The ECJ would have the final say.) A bizarre situation looms in which the German government is criticised for the actions of its independent court.
These warring judges have also called into question the future of actions taken by the ECB to stem the financial effects of the covid-19 crisis. A €750bn bond-buying programme launched in March by the ECB saw the central bank hoover up debt from Italy and Spain, in a bid to dampen the effects of the pandemic. As a result, Italy and Spain can easily borrow on the open market. This contrasts sharply with the start of the euro crisis, when the euro zone’s future seemed to hang in the balance every time Italy held a bond auction.
However, the ECB has created moral hazard. Bold action by the central bank has led to political complacency among the EU’s northern states. It has thus relieved pressure on Europe’s leaders to take tricky decisions, such as whether they should provide southern Europe with enough fiscal power to get out of the crisis. Germany and the Netherlands once railed against the ECB’s largesse; now they are among its beneficiaries, delaying difficult choices in the knowledge that the bank will continue to keep the bloc afloat. For a project that seems to move decisively only when in peril, this is a problem.
The result is that a constitutional reckoning has never seemed more necessary, yet it has never felt less likely. Hard questions proliferate: whether or not the EU will pursue deeper integration, what role the bloc will play in global politics, and so on. Even dilemmas unimaginable a decade ago, such as whether the EU is only for liberal democracies, need to be cleared up.

Although Britain’s chaotic departure was not exactly a tempting advertisement for the joys of leaving the bloc, it is still likely that big changes to the EU’s rules would lead to a slew of tricky plebiscites. Eurocrats have painful memories of past referendums. A fully fledged “constitution” was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005. Indeed deeper ties in Europe have always been controversial. In 1992 French voters agreed by just 51% to adopt the Maastricht treaty, which led to the monetary union.
Bold federal steps would help. But a sturdier constitution would result in even more fractious politics. If pushed, German officials will insist that they have no fundamental objection to a mutualisation of debt. At the same time they insist it would have to be accompanied by a corresponding centralisation of fiscal power over how national governments spend, which is likely to upset many European governments. For countries in southern Europe, fiscal union is seen as freedom; for Germany it is seen as tighter control.
Just little bits of history repeating
Either way resentment is brewing, particularly in southern Europe. Italians have been among the most communitaire of Europeans. In a survey for the commission in 2000, just before the euro became legal tender, only 9% were against EU membership, compared with an EU average of 14%.  But by May 7th almost 44% were ready to quit. “Italians feel betrayed,” says Gianluca Borrelli of Termometro Politico, the institute that conducted the latest poll. Apocalyptic rhetoric flows from southern Europe’s leaders. Portugal’s prime minister, Mr Costa, declared: “Either the EU does what needs to be done or it will end.”
A more complacent view exists in the EU’s northern capitals, particularly in Berlin. When it comes to common debt, a feeling exists that Spain, Italy and France—which has supported the two southern countries throughout—are trying it on, using the crisis to mask opportunism. “How do you distinguish between genuine necessity and political opportunity?” asks one ambassador from a northern European country. In this view a compromise will be found; yet another chapter in the EU’s long history of muddling through.
According to an old joke, economists have predicted nine of the past five recessions. Those predicting the demise of the EU may look similarly foolish. The bloc, its currency and its institutions are so central to much of European political life that unpicking them all would require a level of wanton destruction that not even the EU’s harshest critics have advocated. However after a decade of crises survivor bias afflicts the EU’s supporters and fresh thinking is urgently needed. An uncomfortable journey is justified if the destination is worthwhile. But without a clear answer to the question of what Europe stands for, the next decade or so will resemble a rather pointless ride. ■

1681,"WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. delegation will meet with senior Taliban representatives in Doha on Saturday and Sunday in their first face-to-face meeting at a senior level since Washington pulled its troops from Afghanistan and the hardline group took over the country, two senior administration officials told Reuters.
The high-level U.S. delegation will include officials from the State Department, USAID and the U.S. intelligence community, will press the Taliban to ensure continued safe passage for U.S. citizens and others out of Afghanistan and to release kidnapped U.S. citizen Mark Frerichs, the officials said.
Another top priority will be to hold the Taliban to its commitment that it will not allow Afghanistan to again become a hotbed for al Qaeda or other extremists while pressing the group to improve access for humanitarian aid as the country faces the prospect of a ""really severe and probably impossible to prevent"" economic contraction, U.S. officials said.
U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, who has for years spearheaded U.S. dialogue with the Taliban and been a key figure in peace talks with the group, will not be part of the delegation.
The U.S. team will include the State Department's Deputy Special Representative Tom West as well as top USAID humanitarian official Sarah Charles. On The Taliban side, cabinet officials will be attending, officials said.
""This meeting is a continuation of the pragmatic engagements with the Taliban that we've had ongoing on matters of vital national interest,"" said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
""This meeting is not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy. We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions. They need to establish a sustained track record,"" the official said.
The United States' two decades-long occupation of Afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift in August which saw more than 124,000 civilians including Americans, Afghans and others being evacuated as the Taliban took over. But thousands of other U.S.-allied Afghans at risk of Taliban persecution were left behind.
Washington and other Western countries are grappling with difficult choices as a severe humanitarian crisis looms large over Afghanistan. They are trying to formulate how to engage with the Taliban without granting it the legitimacy it seeks while ensuring humanitarian aid flows into the country.
Many Afghans have started selling their possessions to pay for ever-scarcer food.
The departure of U.S.-led forces and many international donors robbed the country of grants that financed 75% of public spending, according to the World Bank.
While there was an improvement for humanitarian actors get access to some areas that they haven't been in a decade, problems still persisted, the U.S. official said, adding that the U.S. delegation would press Taliban to improve.
""Right now, we are facing some real access issues....There are a lot of challenges in ensuring that female aid workers are provided unimpeded access to all areas,"" the official said and added that Washington needed to see an improvement by the Taliban on this front ""if we are to contemplate even more robust humanitarian assistance.""
PRESSURE ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS
While the Taliban has promised to be more inclusive than when it led the country from 1996 to 2001, the United States has repeatedly said it will judge the new Taliban government based on its deeds not its words.
The Taliban drew from its inner high echelons to fill top posts in Afghanistan's new provisional government announced last month, including an associate of the Islamist militant group's founder as premier and a wanted man on a U.S. terrorism list as interior minister. There were no outsiders and no women in the cabinet.
The European Union foreign policy chief said on Sunday its behavior up to now was ""not very encouraging.""
""We will certainly press the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans including women and girls and to form an inclusive government with broad support,"" the U.S. official said.
He added that there were discrepancies between the Taliban's promises of continued safe passage and implementation.
""As a practical matter, their implementation of their commitments have been uneven. It is true that sometimes we receive assurances from certain levels but then follow through on those assurances has truly been uneven,"" the official said.
The United States has directly facilitated the departure of 105 U.S. citizens and 95 lawful permanent residents out of Afghanistan since Aug. 31, when U.S. withdrawal was completed, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday.
He declined to provide a precise figure for those remaining, but said the agency was in contact with ""dozens of Americans in Afghanistan who wish to leave"" but that the number was dynamic and constantly changing.",3
1682,"GPT-3 IS QUITE a beast. The Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3, to give its full name, is a language model developed by OpenAI, a part-commercial, part not-for-profit artificial-intelligence (AI) laboratory in San Francisco. GPT-3 was trained on an unprecedented mass of text to teach it the probability that a given word will follow preceding words. When fed a short text “prompt”, it cranks out astonishingly coherent prose written in a similar style.
Access to GPT-3 is restricted. For one thing, says Jack Clark, former head of policy at the organisation, it might otherwise be used to mass produce fake news or flood social media with “trolling and griefing” messages. But OpenAI also knows that GPT-3 is commercially valuable. Last year the laboratory started letting vetted firms buy its output for approved uses. These include producing answers to typed questions about products, and powering the speech of fictional characters in virtual worlds. But perhaps most important, GPT-3 can also be used to write computer code.

Several firms are already using GPT-3 and its predecessor GPT-2 to add AI to the software that their programmers use to write code. Much of what these programmers type out has already been written elsewhere at some point in the past. This means that by feeding oodles of pre-existing code into such packages, they can be trained to predict the lines a programmer needs next. As a programmer types, potential “code completions” of one or a few lines pop up on the screen.
Predict and provide
One company that has created such an AI-completion feature is Tabnine, of Tel Aviv. Tabnine used GPT-2 to feed so much code to its programming software, also named Tabnine, that this software gained a sort of “world knowledge”, says Eran Yahav, the firm’s top technologist. Dr Yahav describes this as “a pretty good notion of how the world behaves”, at least when it comes to programming-speak. Tabnine software may detect that a user has begun to type code to handle, say, purchase orders. It will then suggest code to display product names and prices, as well as code to create fields to be filled with quantities, payment and delivery data. It works even though Tabnine has never been specifically instructed to do that.
Some coding sequences are rare. In these cases, Tabnine lengthens its pop-up list of suggested completions to increase the likelihood of offering a useful one. By clicking on one that is appropriate, the programmer teaches Tabnine to perform better. Tabnine’s professional version seems “almost intelligent” in its ability to understand a programmer’s intent, according to Dror Weiss, the firm’s boss.
Tabnine is not alone. On June 17th Microsoft, an American software giant, released a new version of an AI-completion feature which it embeds in coding software called Visual Studio. The original version, released in 2018 and named IntelliCode, was trained on a few thousand online repositories in which code for programming projects is stored. Microsoft trained its upgraded system on more than half a million such repositories. Amanda Silver, one of the executives in charge of Visual Studio, says these extra heaps of training fodder allow the new version to glean intent better from hints in code that a programmer has already written.
The purpose of all this, of course, is to save time. Kite, a firm in San Francisco, claims its AI-completion products cut the number of keystrokes required for some tasks by nearly half. Overall efficiency gains, however, are lower. Vitaly Khudobakhshov, head of AI products at the St Petersburg office of JetBrains, a Czech developer of programming software, sees time savings of 10% to 20%. In the view of Sharif Shameem, the boss of Debuild, a firm in San Francisco that uses GPT-3 to help build websites, the technology also reduces “cognitive overhead”. Selecting from multiple choices is less taxing than devising solutions from scratch.
Bugs and the system
Nor are those who write code the only beneficiaries. Developers spend nearly as much time searching for bugs in what they have written as they do writing it in the first place. A machine-learning model being built by Brendan Dolan-Gavitt of New York University may speed up the debugging process.
To train it, Dr Dolan-Gavitt is collecting code labelled as buggy by GitHub, a Microsoft subsidiary that hosts the biggest collection of non-proprietary “open source” code in the world. By one estimate, GitHub holds at least a billion snippets of code identified as harbouring a bug. Dr Dolan-Gavitt’s model, provisionally called GPT-CSRC, will devour that code this summer.
Another bug-spotting model is in development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Shashank Srikant, a PhD student working on the project, says the goal is to train the model to recognise not just inadvertent bugs, but also maliciously inserted vulnerabilities. Rogue employees are sometimes behind trickery of this sort, which is intended to do things like secretly gain access to passwords. The practice is most common, however, in open-source programming projects to which anyone can contribute. Human reviewers typically struggle to spot these “vulnerability injections”, as they are sometimes known.
The reason, Mr Srikant says, is that, in a bid to slip their handiwork past reviewers, devious coders often use deceptive but purely cosmetic names for things like the variables handled by a program. The team at MIT is therefore training its model to flag discrepancies between snippets’ labels and their actual functionality. The difficulty is that good examples of such mischief are much rarer than ordinary errors.
There is, however, an additional sign that a vulnerability injection may be lurking. Malicious coders often conceal these by writing superfluous code intended to throw off reviewers, so Mr Srikant is also feeding MIT’s model with examples of this type of potentially telltale code, which he describes as “dangling” and “dead”.
The clear destination of all this activity is the creation of software programmers which can, like the human variety, take an idea and turn it into code. An inkling of things to come is provided by a website created by Dr Dolan-Gavitt. Named “This Code Does Not Exist”, it asks programmers to determine if sections of code dozens of lines long were written by a human or a model based on GPT-2 that he has built. Of more than 329,200 assessments made, less than 51% have been correct. That is only a shade better than random.
Machines, it turns out, are now able to write even longish sequences of functioning code. As John Carmack, a noted American computer engineer, has tweeted, pondering this development “does generate a slight shiver”. Unsurprisingly, a number of firms see an opportunity.
One is a Parisian firm called SourceAI. It is designing software into which users type, in natural language, a request for code—such as something that will work out the value of numbers in a mathematical formula called the Fibonacci sequence. By tapping into GPT-3, SourceAI’s eponymous software churns out the desired lines of code in a range of programming languages.
Debuild is testing the same idea. It is trying to create software that lets non-programmers describe, in plain English, a program they want to create, and will then write it. A request for, say, a barbershop app that lets patrons choose a barber and an appointment slot can already produce more or less just that. Mr Shameem says the goal is to sweep away the minutiae of code-typing, so that people can focus on what they want done, not how to instruct computers to do it.
For its part, Microsoft is also using GPT-3 to power what it calls “no code/low code” programming. Charles Lamanna, who leads the work, envisages a bright future of cheaper software created by untrained “citizen developers”. Some folk fear an alternative, darker outcome. Might AIs eventually write whatever code they fancy running? No such runaway feedback loop is around the corner. But that mainstay of science fiction does now appear a little less far-fetched. ■

1683," (CNN)Dr. Umair Shah remembers the last mass vaccination campaign the US waged.  It was in 2009, when the H1N1 ""swine"" flu broke out in April, right at the end of the regular flu season. ""That was very challenging,"" Shah, who heads the Harris County, Texas, health department, told CNN. ""There were a lot of moving pieces. It took several weeks to months to not just organize but to implement and to do safely and effectively. And that was a mild pandemic."" This is not a mild pandemic. And while vaccine manufacturers, public health experts and the federal government are all confident one or more of the coronavirus vaccines being tested now will be shown to work safely by the end of the year, the US and the world will still be a long way from ending the pandemic. ""I feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this calendar year, as we get into early 2021,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, who, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is helping lead the medical battle against the virus, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual,"" Fauci added. ""Having"" a vaccine does not mean having a vaccine approved, distributed and into the arms of more than 300 million Americans.First, any vaccine must either be approved or authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. That's a process that under normal circumstances can take months or years. While the FDA has promised a speedier process for a Covid-19 vaccine, it must still go through a committee known as the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBAC. The FDA will almost certainly allow a shortcut process known as emergency use authorization, or EUA, but the agency has said it will require an ""EUA-plus"" that adds at least some layers of scrutiny. ""It's unlikely that a Covid-19 vaccine will receive full approval and broad distribution right away. Instead, the FDA will probably authorize vaccines for use in targeted groups of people at high risk from Covid and most likely to benefit from the vaccine,"" Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, both former FDA commissioners, wrote in a commentary in the Wall Street Journal Monday. ""All this means that at least initially, Covid vaccines won't provide the sort of herd immunity that can help extinguish an epidemic.""  That will take time -- likely well into next year, even if a vaccine were to be authorized in January, most experts who spoke to CNN predicted. ""People can't be lulled into a false sense of security by knowing the vaccine is coming,"" Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, told CNN. Although manufacturers are already making vaccine doses, it takes time. And the US will likely need more than 600 million doses of vaccine -- enough for everyone to get two doses of the vaccine. A new vaccine, and a plan for getting it out""Let's say ... at the end of the year, there will be millions and tens of millions of doses available,"" Fauci said in the CNN interview Friday.   ""It won't be until we get into 2021 that you'll have hundreds of millions of doses, and just the logistics constraints in vaccinating large numbers of people -- it's going to take months to get enough people vaccinated to have an umbrella of immunity over the community."" The US just is not ready for a mass vaccination campaign like the one needed to bring coronavirus under control, public health experts agreed. ""I don't think it's going to be seamless,"" said Plescia. The biggest mass vaccination program the US undertakes every year is the annual influenza vaccine. Only about half of Americans get a flu vaccine, and manufacturers make and distribute fewer than 150 million doses of it. Yet it takes a full year from start to finish to formulate, make and distribute flu vaccines every influenza season.  ""We start planning for flu vaccines in January or February,"" Michael Einhorn, the president of Dealmed, an independent medical supply distributor covering New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Flu vaccines generally become available in August -- seven to eight months later. And that's with a vaccine made using familiar technology, and dispensed in ways that people are familiar with -- in pediatricians' offices, at pharmacies, in grocery stores and at clinics.  ""You have a playbook for influenza,"" Shah said. ""This is not the same."" Any coronavirus vaccines will involve new technology and a whole new process for distribution, administration and then for payment. And while anyone can walk into, say, a pharmacy, get a flu shot and leave without ever thinking about it again, coronavirus vaccines will involve a whole lot more trouble and paperwork. People will probably need at least two doses about a month apart. Someone will have to track and follow up on that. ""We have to be able to see who has been vaccinated and who has not been,"" Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, told a public hearing about vaccine distribution organized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Paperwork and red tape ""To have two doses means that you provide the initial dose and we will need to bring the person back for a second dose a month later,"" Dr. Jinlene Chan, acting deputy secretary of public health for the state of Maryland, told CNN. And it's very likely that vaccines made by several different companies will be in use by next year. ""We have to make sure that we give the person the same vaccine for their second dose that they got for their first dose,"" Chan said. No vaccination program can start until there are plans in place to manage this. Plus, the coronavirus vaccine or vaccines will still be experimental, so every person who gets one will need to be tracked to make sure there are no adverse reactions. There is no plan yet for any of this. ""We have gotten very little information on how this is going to roll out,"" said Harris County's Shah. ""That makes it even more difficult to plan.""  One big potential stumbling block is what's known as the cold chain. The two vaccines furthest along in development both must be kept frozen. Moderna's vaccine must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius), while Pfizer's must be kept at -94 F (-70 C). While -4 isn't much colder than the optimal home freezer's setting of 0 degrees F, -94 is more of a challenge. ""Throughout -- from every single point the vaccine has to traverse -- we have to maintain it at that temperature. Otherwise, there is a risk of some degradation and the vaccine possibly becoming less effective,"" Chan said. ""We need to make sure that there is some capability to store it appropriately until it is ready to use."" Otherwise, a thawed batch could mean hundreds or even thousands of people get a dud vaccine. This can be a challenge, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a vaccine expert at Emory University. ""We simply don't have freezers that can reach minus 70 degrees in most clinics,"" he told the National Academies meeting. To reach enough people, any mass vaccination effort will have to go beyond clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. ""You are going to have to get out to communities. You are going to have to get out to places of work,"" Del Rio said. That makes keeping the vaccines cold enough more of a challenge. Plescia said Pfizer has a plan to help keep its vaccine cold. ""Pfizer is going to have special boxes they ship the vaccines in, packed with dry ice,"" he said. ""Once you get the box, it'll keep the stuff at negative 80 degrees for 10 days."" But it's not clear, Plescia said, if the boxes could be opened and a few doses of vaccine taken out safely. ""Even if these boxes work very well, it is still going to add a whole level of challenge,"" he said. Taking the mass out of mass vaccinationPast mass vaccination efforts have been just that -- mass. But coronavirus is a respiratory disease, and the last thing anyone should be doing is lining people up or packing them into, say, school gyms to get vaccinated, Chan noted. ""With mass vaccination clinics, it involves bringing large groups of people into a site and vaccinating as many people as possible,"" Chan said. ""How do we do that in a way that reduces the risk of transmitting the very disease that we trying to vaccinate against?""  Illinois' Ezike said some of the experience with test sites may help. ""We had these strike teams,"" she said. ""We have been able to convert a lot of different sites into sites where people can drive up. Can you do a vaccination through the [car] window?"" she asked.  But to accommodate that, cities and states will have to get busy soon. ""We are going to need additional providers,"" she told the NASEM meeting. ""We need mass vaccination clinics and sites. So we really want to recruit lots and lots of essential partners,"" she added -- especially for the communities that are hardest hit by the pandemic, including meat-packing facilities and remote rural areas. That means changes in policies and legislation -- another potentially time-consuming process. Medical practice is legislated by states, not by the federal government. ""We know that we'll need some expanded scope of practice for different professional groups,"" she said. For instance, states may want to enable dentists, dental hygienists and even medical school students and veterinarians to vaccinate people. And that requires some other levels of legislation so that providers can get paid for their time. Changes to health insurance laws may be necessary, including billing codes that provide for a system under which people get vaccinated for no charge. Because rollout will not be immediate, people will be vaccinated in groups. The National Academies is considering this, as is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). They, along with private advocacy groups, have already released their own draft blueprints that in general put health care workers, first responders and the most vulnerable at the front of the line. But that's another layer of management for governments to take on. Many states have old and unwieldy systems for managing all of this, and Ezike said the needed upgrades may take time. Immunity takes time Adding to the timeline is simple biology. The Pfizer and Modern vaccines, at least, will have to be given in two doses, a month apart. After that, it takes about two weeks for immunity to build. That makes for six weeks from the time someone first gets vaccinated to when they can feel safe from infection.  On top of all of this, many Americans are fearful of vaccines -- especially a new one and especially a new vaccine rolled out in a time of intense politicization of the process. ""There's general vaccination mistrust and then there's government mistrust,"" Ezike noted. The current atmosphere over mask use has not helped, added Harris County's Shah. ""We have made it a political fight,"" he said. ""When you make it political in nature, not driven by health and medical considerations, ultimately people will take sides."" Unless a majority of the population gets vaccinated, the virus will continue its spread. Most estimates suggest that 60% to 70% of the population must be immune to provide enough herd immunity to interrupt the spread of the virus. Polls indicate that only about half of Americans feel confident right now about being vaccinated.  And if vaccines are less than fully effective, that may mean even more of the population needs to be vaccinated to have an effect on spread. Then there are the unknowns. ""Testing has not been seamless at all. There are going to be some glitches,"" Plescia said. ""I think there is a good chance there is going to be a vaccine that works and gets us out of this, but it is hard to believe that it is going to go really smoothly, given all the things that could happen."" Shah is ready for unpleasant surprises. ""This is a super slick virus that has broken every rule in the book,"" he said.",0
1684,"The profits of a small family furniture business in Nottingham rocketed by an astonishing 4,700 per cent after disgraced former Health Secretary Matt Hancock helped it land a £29m government contract for PPE at the height of the pandemic, MailOnline has learned.
Monarch Acoustics Ltd, owned and run by husband-and-wife team Stuart and Sophie Hopkin, was given the £28.8m contract to supply surgical gowns after being referred to the fast-track 'VIP lane' by Mr Hancock in May 2020. 
The effect on the company's finances were dramatic, according to its accounts.
Turnover leapt from £9.8m in 2019 to £38m in 2020, and pre-tax profits ballooned from just £267,000 to a hefty £12.6m over the same period.
At the end of the 2019 financial year the firm, which has only 80 employees, had just £41,000 in the bank, yet a year later that figure had grown to a cool £10.2 million.
The exclusive list of suppliers was set up by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic to fast track supplies of PPE.
It enabled ministers, MPs, Lords and top government officials to recommend firms that could help secure PPE for healthcare workers when the UK was struggling to get hold of equipment in 2020.
Firms recommended via this route were considered by the cross-government PPE team to 'be more credible or needed to be treated with more urgency', according to the National Audit Office (NAO).
The companies were not subject to the usual checks due to the urgency of the situation.
A total of 47 firms were awarded contracts worth a total of £4.7bn by the VIP lane, and companies on the list had a 10 times greater success rate of securing contracts.
Monarch Acoustics managing director Mr Hopkin, 39 and his wife are pictured on her Facebook account larking around with their three boys in a variety of fancy dress outfits including as giraffes and lions.
Mrs Hopkin, 35, also posted a photo of herself while pregnant above an NHS rainbow symbol and another with two of her children, all wearing 'All in this together' rainbow tee-shirts with the government message #Stayathome Protect your community against COVID-19' banner beneath.
Boris Johnson's government has faced accusations of cronyism after it emerged that some firms were given access to a High Priority Lane which fast-tracked their bids for personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts.
The government had refused to reveal details of the priority access scheme – but four Tory MPs and three peers have now been named as 'referrers' in a list of 47 firms that won PPE contracts through the VIP lane.
The list of lucrative PPE deals provided by the Good Law Project and published by Politico website shows that former health secretary Mr Hancock helped in the process of securing work for four separate firms, including Monarch.
Until the pandemic, Monarch – also known as Monarch Educational Furniture - does not appear to have any experience of PPE, judging from its website or Mr Hopkin's LinkedIn profile. 
He states: 'Monarch Education Furniture is a family run business with over 25 years' experience in manufacturing good quality furniture. We believe that customer service is the number one priority at all times and we strive to exceed our customers' expectations of quality, value and personal service.'
On the company website, they say: 'For over 30 years we've been carving out a unique spot in the education furniture industry, with warm customer service and fantastic lead times that you won't find anywhere else.
'In our 96,000 square foot purpose-built factory in Nottingham, we manufacture a wide range of stock units and undertake bespoke projects to meet the complex needs of the education, healthcare, and public sector markets.'
The healthcare side of the business appears to refer to the manufacture and sale of furniture used in hospitals, including, according to the website: 'furniture for nurse's stations, wards, bedside, clinic and medicine storage, waiting rooms, surgeries and IT.'
Nowhere on the website is PPE mentioned, but in the 2020 accounts lodged with Companies House, it is noted: 'During the year the company had the opportunity to diversify, due to the Covid pandemic, which involved several different contracts utilising current suppliers. This is the reason for the significant increase in turnover as shown above.'
The Hopkins, who make up two of the three directors of Monarch Acoustics, live in a large modern detached house in the middle of a leafy village about a 20-minute drive from the centre of Nottingham that they bought for £1.1million in cash without the requirement for a mortgage in March.
Mrs Hopkin, who is listed as company secretary of the firm, also ran a photography business called Sophie Marie Photography (SMP) at one stage.
An online listing on Yellowplace states: 'SMP Offers fun photo shoots, based in Nottingham. Specialising in maternity, newborn, baby and children's photography.' 
The third director of Monarch, 60-year-old Gary Frost, lives in Leicestershire, according to Companies House.
In 2016, Monarch Acoustics announced a move to 'new state-of-the-art' production facilities, opening a factory and warehouse near Nottingham airport.
But the new building was entirely devoted to educational furniture, according to a press release they issued.
'Monarch Education Furniture is a family run company that has been manufacturing furniture for schools for 30 years,' said the release.
'Our company has grown considerably over the last 10 years and in 2014 we had our busiest trading year.
'As market leaders in educational storage furniture we have developed our manufacturing techniques using state of the art machinery and innovative fixings.
'We operate a very strict quality control process in our factory and only dispatch furniture that we are proud of. We take pride in our craftsmanship and offer a high level of quality.'
Stuart Hopkin and Mr Hancock failed to respond to questions from MailOnline.
A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: 'These insinuations of wrongdoing are completely false. During a national emergency we were grateful for all efforts to get hold of PPE. All offers were treated in line with standard process. Matt had nothing to do with the awarding of this or any other PPE contract.
'When Matt was approached with this credible offer he passed it on to government officials. This was right and proper and what anyone would do in the circumstances.
'Inferring any wrongdoing is completely false. This work saved lives.'
They added the the firm's credentials were 'credible' because, 'they were already supplying the US. Due diligence was done on this and all contracts by officials.'  
A former chairman of the Conservative Party was also named among several Tories who helped almost 50 firms win PPE contracts worth millions during the lockdown.
Lord Feldman, a former tennis partner of ex-PM David Cameron, referred three businesses to ministers before they were given untendered contracts using the 'VIP fast lane'.
Mr Hancock, who quit in the summer after having a lockdown-breaching affair with an aide, referred three apart from Monarch, while the list of 47 businesses amassed by the Good Law Project also showed referrals by ex-No10 air Dominic Cummings, as well as senior ministers including Michael Gove.
The companies were able afterwards to access lucrative contracts for PPE equipment using a much-criticised system set up to speed through supply of vital material as the NHS struggled to cope.
There is no suggestion that the politicians played a role in awarding contracts to businesses they referred onwards to the procurement process.
Lord Feldman has denied any wrong-doing, insisting he was just passing 'credible offers on to officials' from Maxima Markets, SG Recruitment and Skinnydip.
They were later awarded contracts worth £65million between them. Good Law Project director Jolyon Maugham told MailOnline: 'The scale of public money that flowed into the pockets of those able to lean on Ministers for VIP lane treatment is just breathtaking.
'The VIP lane funnelled vast sums of public money into the pockets of those with Tory links.
'It also made it harder to buy the PPE the NHS needed. Civil servants were besieged by crappy suppliers with political connections - and that made it much harder to buy the right stuff.'
A government spokesperson said: 'At the height of the pandemic there was a desperate need for PPE to protect health and social care staff and the government rightly took swift and decisive action to secure it.
'Ministers were not involved in awarding contracts.'",-2
1685,"ON THE MACEDONIAN shore of Lake Ohrid in July, a choir was practising Abba’s “Dancing Queen”, forever “looking out for a place to go”. In a hotel next door, the leaders of the six western Balkan countries that want to join the EU were also singing familiar tunes. It has been 18 years since the EU pledged to let them in once they fulfil its criteria. The process is alive, says Edi Rama, Albania’s prime minister, but “moving—not so much”.
Two years ago France and the Netherlands temporarily stalled accession for all of the so-called Western Balkan Six: Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia. Now Bulgaria is blocking talks for North Macedonia and Albania. It demands Macedonian concessions on interpretations of history and language that have nothing to do with the EU‘s requirements. Albania is collateral damage because its negotiations are paired with its neighbour’s.

“We have perfected patience,” says Nikola Dimitrov, deputy prime minister of North Macedonia. For 27 years his country was dogged by a row with Greece, which objected to its former name of Macedonia. Mr Dimitrov helped negotiate a deal to change the name to North Macedonia. Now, by failing to stand up to Bulgaria, EU leaders are reneging. As for Kosovo, the EU made a number of demands in exchange for allowing its citizens visa-free travel. The Kosovars delivered in 2018; the EU‘s member states have not.

Miroslav Lajcak, the EU’s special representative, admits the bloc’s image has been “damaged” but notes that 68% of the Western Balkan Six’s trade is with the EU, which is also giving the region €9bn ($10bn) in aid over the next seven years. Others see grounds for gloom. One reason EU-moderated talks between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo are deadlocked, says a diplomatic source, is that the bloc becomes “powerless in the dialogue” if it breaks its promises. Among EU member states, many suspect that champions of enlargement, like Hungary, want to bring in autocratic Serbia to expand their “illiberal bloc”.
Outside powers are encroaching on the region. On July 10th Serbia’s free-trade agreement with the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union came into force. That is incompatible with EU membership. In the meantime plans abound for what the Six should do next. Last year they agreed to form a common regional market. On July 29th Serbia, North Macedonia and Albania signed an agreement to implement some of its provisions, but Kosovo, Bosnia and Montenegro will not sign that deal.
Mr Rama chides his colleagues to stop using growing Russian, Chinese and Turkish investments in the region as a tool to put pressure on the EU (or as he put it, “If you don’t take me, there are some bitches that will”). He thinks that, rather than letting the EU’s paralysis slow the six down, they should get on with their own regional integration. But Kristof Bender of the European Stability Initiative, a think-tank in Berlin, is sceptical: “You want to be in a common market with larger, richer economies, not a few neighbours who are as poor and underdeveloped as you are.” ■",2
1686,"CHINA’S LEADERS are trying to reinvent how great powers operate in the Middle East. They have busied themselves in recent years signing trade deals and co-operation agreements with regional powers that are, most of the time, rivals or foes of each other. China talks of its warm ties with Israel and Palestine, and has invited both to send envoys to Beijing for peace talks. In the Middle East, a region where trust is hard to find, China is hailed as a reliable supplier of covid-19 vaccines and surveillance technology to Arabs and non-Arabs alike. The world’s largest oil importer, China is an irreplaceable trade partner both for Iran, the would-be leader of the Shia world, and for Saudi Arabia, its Sunni nemesis. More than once, Chinese warships have conducted separate exercises with the Iranian and Saudi navies, a few weeks apart.
Chinese leaders sound sure that their country’s distinctive approach to geopolitics—one that stresses interests over values, and assumes that most foreigners can be bought for a price—will help them avoid the quagmires into which other outsiders in the Middle East have so often stumbled, from America to the colonial powers of old Europe. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, while visiting six Middle Eastern countries in late March, deplored “the bad consequences inflicted on the region by external interference”. In Iran Mr Wang signed a 25-year co-operation agreement. Its details remain murky, but the deal is thought to involve the exchange of cheap Iranian oil for help building telecommunications networks, hospitals, underground railways and, it is rumoured, ports on some of the world’s most strategic waterways.

Chinese leaders make a virtue of their commercial focus. Addressing the Arab League in 2016, President Xi Jinping said that China sought no spheres of influence or geopolitical proxies in the region. Instead, he described a vision of progress built around economic growth, declaring that: “Turmoil in the Middle East stems from the lack of development.” Even the hardest problems, such as Iran’s loathing for America and Israel, are presented as puzzles that prosperity may solve. Notably, China insists that its promised investments in Iran will help rather than hinder efforts to prod the Iranian regime back into compliance with the nuclear accord (known as the JCPOA) that was brokered by the Obama administration and other powers in 2015. It was abandoned three years later by America’s then-president, Donald Trump, who scorned the Obama-era approach of rewarding Iran for suspending nuclear-weapons research, and put his faith in harsh economic sanctions.
Yin Gang is a veteran scholar of the Middle East at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank. He sets out why the administration of President Joe Biden should believe that China opposes Iran’s nuclear ambitions, even as it seeks to expand Sino-Iranian trade. China has selfish reasons for fearing an Iranian bomb, starting with the dangers of a regional arms race, says Mr Yin, a candid sort. “If there’s a Persian bomb, there must be an Arab bomb and a Turkish bomb,” he says. Though that may not directly threaten China, “If a nuclear war breaks out in the region, how would China do business with it?”
China’s belief is that even the harshest economic sanctions do not stop countries from developing nuclear warheads, Mr Yin declares over tea in Beijing. He cites North Korea as a prime example. China’s logic is that Iran will have more reasons to behave if America lifts sanctions and allows Chinese, European and other companies to resume legal trade with Iranian partners. That is why China calls on America to do so, and on Iran to resume compliance with the JCPOA’s nuclear curbs. The unblushing self-interest behind those Chinese arguments is actually reason to think them sincere. And the Biden administration appears inclined to heed them, for now. After a high-level meeting in March in Alaska between American and Chinese diplomatic chiefs, Iran’s nuclear programme appeared on a shortlist of areas for potential co-operation. Asked about Chinese plans to expand trade with Iran, a State Department spokesman called opposition to Iranian nukes one of a few “narrow areas of tactical alignment” between his country and China.
Foreign diplomats in Beijing note that China does, in fact, pursue political goals in the Middle East, such as by pressing Iran and Arab nations to endorse repression of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, a region of western China. Mr Yin offers a cynical riposte. Uyghurs are a Turkic people, and Arabs and Iranians distrust Turks, he says, so “Xinjiang is not a political issue for them.” Still, he admits, many Chinese scholars worry about the balancing act that their country is trying to pull off. The Middle East is a place of opportunity but also “a trap, a swamp”, he says.
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Some Chinese experts talk of America leaving a vacuum in the Middle East. Danny Russel, America’s assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in 2013-17, agrees that China senses a demand for a Chinese presence in the Middle East, amid talk of American unreliability. Chinese companies have been told to go out and sell advanced technologies that will carry their country’s values and technical standards around the world, notably via the Belt and Road Initiative. But ambitious deals come with political risks. “The larger your footprint, the more valuable your investments, the more vulnerable you are,” suggests Mr Russel, who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a research outfit.
Even as America pulls back from the Middle East, its presence hovers over Chinese calculations there. China’s most lucrative trade partners are Gulf Arab countries that cannot simply ignore America, their traditional security provider. America may yet ask old allies to take sides, for instance if China wants to build ports in the Middle East with dual commercial and military uses, or co-operate there over sensitive technologies. Amoral commercialism has helped China avoid many pitfalls in the region. Even so, its ambitions may yet run into the sands. ■",2
1687,"A BATCH OF new houses across California is selling unusually fast. In the past two months, 82 have been snapped up, and the waiting list is 1,000 long. That demand should, though, soon be satisfied—for, while it can take weeks to put up a conventional bricks-and-mortar dwelling, Palari Homes and Mighty Buildings, the collaborators behind these houses, are able to erect one in less than 24 hours. They can do it so rapidly because their products are assembled from components prefabricated in a factory. This is not, in itself, a new idea. But the components involved are made in an unusual way: they are printed.
Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been around since the early 1980s, but is now gathering steam. It is already employed to make things ranging from orthopaedic implants to components for aircraft. The details vary according to the products and processes involved, but the underlying principle is the same. A layer of material is laid down and somehow fixed in place. Then another is put on top of it. Then another. Then another. By varying the shape, and sometimes the composition of each layer, objects can be crafted that would be difficult or impossible to produce with conventional techniques. On top of this, unlike conventional manufacturing processes, no material is wasted.

Just press “print”
In the case of Palari Homes and Mighty Buildings, the printers are rather larger than those required for artificial knees and wing tips, and the materials somewhat cruder. But the principle is the same. Nozzles extrude a paste (in this case a composite) which is then cured and hardened by ultraviolet light. That allows Mighty Buildings to print parts such as eaves and ceilings without the need for supporting moulds—as well as simpler things like walls. These are then put together on site and attached to a permanent foundation by Palari Homes’ construction workers.
Not only does 3D-printing allow greater versatility and faster construction, it also promises lower cost and in a more environmentally friendly approach than is possible at present. That may make it a useful answer to two challenges now facing the world: a shortage of housing and climate change. About 1.6bn people—more than 20% of Earth’s population—lack adequate accommodation. And the construction industry is responsible for 11% of the world’s man-made carbon-dioxide emissions. Yet the industry’s carbon footprint shows no signs of shrinking.
Automation brings huge cost savings. Mighty Buildings says computerising 80% of its printing process means the firm needs only 5% of the labour that would otherwise be involved. It has also doubled the speed of production. This is welcome news, the construction industry having struggled for years to improve its productivity. Over the past two decades this has grown at only a third of the rate of productivity in the world economy as a whole, according to McKinsey, a consultancy. Digitalisation has been slower than in nearly any other trade. The industry is also plagued, in many places, by shortages of skilled labour. And that is expected to get worse. In America, for example, around 40% of those employed in construction are expected to retire within a decade.
The environmental benefits come in several ways, but an important one is that there is less need to move lots of heavy stuff about. Palari Homes, for instance, estimates that prefabricating its products reduces the number of lorry journeys involved in building a house sufficiently to slash two tonnes off the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per home.
Palari Homes and Mighty Buildings are not, moreover, alone in their endeavours. Similar projects are being started up all over the place. The vast majority print structures using concrete. 14Trees, a joint venture between Holcim—the world’s biggest cement-maker—and CDC Group, a British-government development-finance outfit, operates in Malawi. It says it is able to print a house there in just 12 hours, with a price tag of less than $10,000. Besides being cheap and quick, 14Trees says this process is green as well. Holcim claims that by depositing the precise amount of cement required and thereby reducing waste, 3D printing generates only 30% as much carbon dioxide as using burnt-clay brick, a common technique in Malawi.
In Mexico, meanwhile, a charity for the homeless called New Story has created a partnership with ICON, a 3D-printing firm, to erect ten houses with floor areas of 46 square metres. Each was printed in around 24 hours (though these hours were spread over several days), with the final features assembled by Échale, another local charity. And in Europe the keys to the continent’s first 3D-printed home, in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands (pictured above), were handed over to its tenants on July 30th.
Layer cakes
The house in question, the first of five detached, two-bedroom dwellings in a project co-ordinated by Eindhoven’s municipal government and the city’s University of Technology, is a collaboration between several firms. The Dutch arm of Saint-Gobain, a French building-materials company, developed the concrete mortar needed. Van Wijnen, a construction firm, built the thing, while Witteveen+Bos, a consultancy, was responsible for the engineering. It is being rented out by its owner, Vesteda, a Dutch residential-property investor.
Making the cement involved in projects like this is not, however, a green process. It turns calcium carbonate in the form of limestone into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, and is reckoned responsible for about 8% of anthropogenic emissions of that gas. A group at Texas A University, led by Sarbajit Banerjee, has therefore developed a way to dispense with it.
Dr Banerjee’s new building material was inspired by a project he masterminded some years ago to construct supply roads to remote parts of the Canadian province of Alberta using stuff immediately to hand. The road metal he devised combined local soil with a mulch of wood fibres, and was held together by liquid or water-soluble silicates that then hardened and acted as cement. To build houses he uses whatever clay and rock debris is lying around under the topsoil near the construction site, crushes it into a powder and blends it with silicates. The result can then be squeezed through a nozzle, after which it rapidly consolidates and gains strength, so as to hold its shape and bear the weight of the next layer. The process is thus doubly green. It eliminates both cement and the need to transport to the site, often over long distances, the sand and aggregates used in conventional concrete.
Concrete benefits
There are limitations to 3D-printed homes. For a start, construction codes need to be tweaked to accommodate them. To this end UL, one of America’s largest certifying agencies, has collaborated with Mighty Buildings to develop the first 3D-printing standard. The guidelines will be included in the new International Residential Code, which is in use in, or has been adopted by, all American states save Wisconsin. While this is a welcome boost to a fledgling industry, most governments have yet to come up with country-specific standards. There are also questions about the quality and finish of homes built by 3D printers.
Even so, the direction of travel looks promising. Last year, plans for a 3D-printed apartment building were approved in Germany. This three-floored structure, assembled by Peri, a German construction company, from parts made using printers developed by Cobod, a Danish firm, will contain five flats. Use of the technology is also expanding in the Middle East and Asia. Dubai’s government wants a quarter of new buildings in the country to be 3D-printed by 2030, and is dedicating a district on the outskirts of its eponymous capital to host 3D-printing companies and their warehouses. Saudi Arabia wants to use 3D printing to build 1.5m houses over the next decade. And India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs wants to use 3D printing to address the country’s housing shortages.
If successful, building by 3D printing is likely to spread beyond housing. Opportunities also exist in warehousing, offices and other commercial buildings. And beyond earthly structures, NASA, America’s space agency, is exploring the use of 3D printing to build landing pads, accommodation and roads on Mars and the Moon. There is no soil on those two celestial bodies, just shattered rock called regolith. Dr Banerjee’s group, which is working with NASA, says its approach to 3D printing functions just as well with this material. “We would ultimately like to have property on Mars and the Moon but we’re not going to be able to take concrete up there with us,” says Dr Banerjee. “We’re going to have to work with regolith.” ■

1689,"WHEN SATYA NADELLA became the third boss of Microsoft in 2014 one photograph captured the moment. It shows him flanked by Bill Gates, the co-founder and chairman, and Steve Ballmer, Mr Gates’s successor as chief executive. The two white tech tycoons strike a confident pose in casual dress. Mr Nadella, an Indian-American, skulks in a suit, smiling awkwardly.
He had a reason for that awkward smile. The company was in a ditch. While it hunkered down at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, Apple invented the iPhone, and Google and Facebook rose from Silicon Valley. Its share price barely budged for years. When he took over, says Mr Nadella, outsiders questioned if Microsoft will “make it to the other side”.

It did—with aplomb. Mr Nadella dethroned the Windows operating system as its core product. He brought Microsoft’s software and services to other operating systems, including “open source” Linux, as well as Google’s and Apple’s. Most important, he put Microsoft’s cloud-computing arm, Azure, launched in 2010, at the heart of the business. The result has been double-digit revenue growth and a market capitalisation of $1.6trn. Only Apple and Saudi Aramco, an oil colossus, are more valuable.
Microsoft succeeded in its reinvention where other tech firms seeking a second life, such as IBM and Oracle, have not. But nothing lasts for ever in the fast-changing world of technology. The old personal-computer (PC) business has slowed. The firm’s products are not always the best or most popular. Azure is considered by many experts to be technologically behind the market leader, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which the e-commerce giant launched four years earlier. Many users prefer to make video calls on Zoom and chat on Slack rather than use Microsoft’s Teams. This year Microsoft failed to buy TikTok, which might have boosted its consumer-facing business that includes the Xbox games console and (less interestingly for TikTokers) LinkedIn, a careers network; the popular Chinese-owned short-video app inked a nebulous technology partnership with Oracle instead. And Microsoft has to square up not just to Amazon but to younger tech giants such as Alphabet (Google’s parent) and China’s Alibaba and Tencent.
The pressure to succeed is immense. The firm’s shares have more than quintupled in value since Mr Nadella took over (see chart 1). They now trade at 37 times earnings, a higher multiple than those of Alphabet, Apple or Facebook (though far below Amazon’s ratio of 123). The company is priced for perfection, says Mark Moerdler of Bernstein, a research firm. And for further expansion.

Mr Nadella acknowledges the challenge. “This is not some linear transition,” he says. “When the first hockey stick plateaus the question is: have you got the other things?” In an effort to live up to the hype he is dusting off old weapons—bundling and licensing—the aggressive use of which got Microsoft in trouble with antitrust authorities from the late 1990s and earned it the moniker “evil empire”. An insider since 1992, he remembers those days, when the firm narrowly avoided a forced break-up. Can it continue to grow while steering clear of the old pitfalls?
Until 2014 Microsoft had five different business areas. Most of the profit came from three of them: Windows, its Office software (spreadsheets, word-processing, PowerPoint and the like) and programs to run the servers used in data centres and corporate networks. Entertainment and devices, including the Xbox, made a bit of money. Online services such as the Bing search engine and MSN web portal did not.
Mr Nadella reconfigured this structure. Today Microsoft’s 20 or so businesses fall into three big buckets: cloud, productivity software and business processes, and personal computing. Each contains one of the lucrative stalwarts—servers, Office and Windows—alongside lots of others such as Surface PCs and digital whiteboards, or Dynamics business software. Many of the businesses revolve around Azure, which has grown into the internal computing backbone for Microsoft’s applications, as well as a product to sell to customers. Forays into futuristic quantum computing or virtual and augmented reality stand on their own, while boosting Azure’s capabilities. So do artificial-intelligence (AI) algorithms, trained on data from Bing, LinkedIn and other places.
If any of those whizzy bets succeed at scale, they would sharpen Microsoft’s innovative edge, which looks blunter than either Amazon’s or Alphabet’s. Even if they do not, Microsoft may succeed by commercialising products rather than inventing new ones. As insiders quip, the firm is never first to market and often not second, but “man, we will make all the money”.
That has certainly been true of Office. Excel was not the first spreadsheet (remember Lotus 1-2-3?). But it is deemed by many software engineers to be the most consequential program ever written, in part because it has been so widely adopted. Around 1.2bn workers use Office or Office365, a web-based version served up through Azure. Here, too, Microsoft lagged behind Google’s G-suite software, which, among other things, enabled multiple users to work on one document at the same time. Googlers make digs at what they see as Microsoft’s offline, “save as” mentality.
Still, managers prise Office—and especially Excel—from desk-jockeys at their peril. As a result, Microsoft controls 87.6% of the market for such software, to Google’s 11.5%, according to Gartner, a research firm. To boost Teams, Microsoft has started bundling it with Office365 free of charge; by April Teams had 75m daily users. Unfair, rivals say; in July Slack launched an antitrust suit against Microsoft. It calls Teams a copycat product aimed at killing it—just as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer vanquished Netscape, a rival web browser, which led to its battle with trustbusters.
Critically, Microsoft has been a superfast follower in the cloud. In Mr Nadella’s book about the firm’s transformation, “Hit Refresh”, he described how, by the time he took over, AWS had built a vast cloud business with no competition. “Amazon was leading a revolution and we had not even mustered our troops,” he wrote.
The stakes are huge. Over time most of the world’s companies are expected to move computing to the cloud. The share of IT spending going to the cloud is approaching 10%. But that already amounts to an annual market of $240bn. Given expected annual growth rates of nearly 20% it could reach $1trn before long.

In the cloud Azure faces two big rivals—AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)—and two others—Oracle and Alibaba Cloud. Its market share has risen steadily, to 18% (see chart 2). Again, Microsoft’s rapport with firms’ IT departments has served it well. It still dominates parts of business software and nearly four in five personal computers run on Windows, as do 72% of all servers. It can offer corporate clients a single price that bundles Azure with Office and other software. That way Azure can end up costing only a fifth as much as AWS, Microsoft claims (AWS disputes this). And it is easier to use than Amazon’s offering, whose advanced features overwhelm even some IT professionals.
It is also easier to swallow for many clients than Amazon products. When Microsoft pitched for business, recalls a former executive, Azure would lose the technical evaluation but win out of customers’ fear that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s insatiable boss, might use their money and data to invade their turf. Suspicion of Mr Bezos may explain why AWS lost a $10bn Pentagon cloud contract to Microsoft, despite being tipped to win. Amazon believes Microsoft benefited from Donald Trump’s feud with Mr Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper the president does not like. Amazon has legally challenged the award, unsuccessfully so far.

Azure aims to match or overtake AWS in the cloud. Yet in Gartner’s closely followed ranking of cloud providers Azure comes in well behind AWS and has lately slipped down (see chart 3). The way Microsoft has built its global cloud infrastructure, covering more geographical ground than AWS but more thinly, may make it less reliable. Gartner cites insufficient redundant capacity to deal with data centres knocked out by bad weather or other problems. Even without disruptions, capacity has proved problematic. As demand has surged in the pandemic, with millions of remote workers switching to the cloud, Azure has at times been unable to keep up. Microsoft Teams suffered a blackout in March. That month Microsoft put in place temporary resource limits on new Azure subscriptions. AWS has not needed to.
Azure blues
Microsoft cannot afford to get Azure wrong. It is what drives its share price. Azure is estimated to make up only a tenth of Microsoft’s $53bn in annual operating profit. But every quarter Wall Street fixates on how fast the cloud is growing, notes Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Recently analysts have been disappointed to see growth slow, from 59% year on year in the first three months of 2020, to 47% from April to June. (It is some comfort that AWS’s growth has also slowed in recent quarters.)
Azure is sure to get a fillip from new licensing rules, just as Teams has from bundling. Up to now Microsoft let customers use its software on dedicated servers run by AWS or any cloud provider under a practice called “bring your own licence” (BYOL). That freedom enabled easy switching; of all cloud-based Windows software, 57% runs on AWS, nearly twice as much as on Azure.
Last summer Microsoft did away with BYOL and introduced restrictions for customers wishing to put its software on certain big clouds. If a client wanted to run desktop and server programs on those clouds after October 1st, it would have to buy a new subscription, rather than a one-off licence. Not to offend antitrust rules Microsoft put Azure on its list alongside AWS, GCP and Alibaba Cloud. But it separately offered customers a better deal to move to Azure, offsetting the extra cost.
Amazon said Microsoft was trying to restrict what clouds companies can use. Several neutral observers concur. “Microsoft is taking its arsenal of Windows Server, a massive installed software base, and using it punitively against competitors,” says Raj Bala, Gartner’s main cloud-infrastructure expert and author of its cloud ranking. It is the antithesis of Mr Nadella’s more open strategy, adds Wes Miller of Directions on Microsoft, a research firm. After all, he had eased Office’s move to non-Windows devices such as Apple’s iPad. “Satya wants to make people think he’s different, but he’s old-school Microsoft, just with a little softer exterior,” sums up an executive at a rival.
Microsoft is the only big cloud provider which also sells lots of programs that clouds host. “Is there a piece of software that Amazon or Google has built that runs on Azure? Zero,” Mr Nadella says. That also gives Azure a big advantage to exploit. Mr Nadella does not intend to repeat the mistake of letting Windows workloads all migrate to Amazon’s cloud, as happened early on. “We were stupid, not realising what was happening,” he says. “We will absolutely monetise our intellectual property on their clouds.”

Since the licensing changes went into effect Gartner has received several hundred inquiries about them. An executive from a Fortune 500 health-care company that had picked AWS as its cloud provider says that the new rules meant an extra annual cost of $100m, forcing the firm to slow down its transition to the cloud. “They are writing licence terms to get customers to believe their only choice is Azure,” complains a vice-president of a medium-sized firm in Wisconsin that felt forced to switch from AWS. “There is no law against it but it removes choice,” he adds. An IT chief at another midwestern firm likens the new rules to a long lease on a car where “the lessor says you can only use Chevron gas, not BP or Exxon”. Two of the three customers are set on writing Microsoft software out of their stacks over time.
Avoiding defenestration
That points to a risk for the tech giant. By tugging reluctant customers onto Azure too aggressively Microsoft may put a lot of them off Windows—or, possibly, provoke mass flouting of rules, daring the software giant to enforce them. Takeshi Numoto, chief marketing officer of Microsoft’s commerical business, says the feedback Microsoft is receiving on cloud choice after the new rules is positive, adding that “We want to hear from all customers if there are ways we can improve our partnership and support of their businesses.”
How closely is Microsoft flirting with the kind of behaviour that got it in trouble in the late 1990s? After its bruising antitrust battle it is likely to proceed cautiously. If Europe proves sympathetic to Slack, the messaging firm could bring a similar case in America. If that happens, Microsoft may offer concessions to make it go away.
Mr Nadella resists the idea that Microsoft is overstepping the mark. “Look at the number of enterprise SAAS [software-as-a-service] and infrastructure firms,” he says—hardly suggestive of “a monopoly company collecting monopoly rent”.
In its defence Microsoft can certainly argue that Azure has brought competition to cloud computing, which AWS might otherwise have cornered. Tellingly, Mr Nadella was spared the indignity of testifying in front of a congressional antitrust subcommittee, which recently grilled his opposite numbers at Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook. A congressional report on big tech’s digital dominance did not finger Microsoft. America’s trustbusters have gone after Google instead (see article). Google denies wrongdoing.
Microsoft’s rebuffed $25bn-30bn bid for TikTok could have been a boon to competition. Had it succeeded, Microsoft would have challenged Google and Facebook in digital advertising in short order. TikTok’s reams of data on its teenage users would have fuelled Microsoft’s AI, which competes against algorithms being developed by all its big tech rivals in America and China. The purchase of ZeniMax Media, a games developer, for $7.5bn to bolster its flourishing cloud-gaming platform does not make up for the failed bid.
Google’s antitrust troubles could offer consolation. The case may shake up internet search, helping Bing. It is a tiddler despite having a quality of search results that is not all that different from Google’s. In a hint that Microsoft might want to revive its search engine, this month it was rebranded as “Microsoft Bing”.
Mr Nadella is confident about future growth, his early awkwardness long since replaced by a justified and resolute assuredness. “We’re lucky enough to be in the tech business, and IT spending is going from 5% of GDP to 10% over the next ten years,” he says. But competition for those IT dollars is white-hot. Microsoft’s response—leaning heavily on customers not to defect—may work in the short run. But as the pace of change in the technology industry accelerates, thanks to abundant brainpower and oodles of capital, customers may put innovation ahead of loyalty to long-standing providers. One successful reinvention is unlikely to be enough. ■
Clarification (October 23rd 2020): Microsoft's claim that Azure can cost a fifth as much as AWS is disputed by AWS",2
1690,"MINISTERS NEVER like seeing their decisions overturned. But in a rules-based system, they must usually live with it. Yet Britain’s government has concluded that such reversals happen too often—and wants to change the rules to curb one purported cause, an obstructive judiciary. This raises constitutional concerns.
Exhibit one is a bill now going through Parliament that seeks to curb judicial reviews, in which senior judges consider the legality or otherwise of a public body’s actions. They have certainly become more common in recent decades. Ministers from both parties have at times sought to limit their scope or even stop them altogether, partly to save money. The draft bill is actually quite mild. But it includes an ouster clause that would prevent judicial review of controversial immigration cases.

David Davis, a former Conservative minister, opposes the bill for this reason. He fears that the ouster clause may become a model for obstructing review of employment-tribunal or social-security decisions. Yet some prefer to broaden the bill instead. Richard Ekins, an Oxford academic who runs the judicial-power project at Policy Exchange, a think-tank, says excessive judicial review has led unaccountable judges into areas that should be decided by politicians accountable to Parliament.
Some ministers agree. Dominic Raab, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, has criticised some judicial-review decisions, notably relating to Brexit. He wishes to stop the powers of Parliament being whittled away by what he characterises as “judicial legislation”. To this end, he wants an unspecified mechanism to allow Parliament swiftly to “correct” what ministers deem to be wrong judgments. Mark Elliott, a Cambridge academic specialising in public law, finds this idea deeply troubling, especially if it is done through secondary legislation or applied retrospectively.
Yet it is favoured by Suella Braverman, the attorney-general. In a recent speech she said judicial review was being used “as a political tool by those who have already lost the arguments”, and that litigation must not be the continuation of politics by other means. She took aim at court rulings in two Brexit cases: one that the process for leaving the EU could only be started through primary legislation, the other nullifying a prorogation of Parliament.
It seems bizarre that law officers normally expected to defend the judiciary should attack it instead. It is also misleading of critics to claim that the judges in these two cases were trying to frustrate the Brexit referendum (the Daily Mail headlined its report on one “Enemies of the People”). In fact the judgments sought to bolster the role of Parliament, supposedly a big goal of Brexiteers.
A similar confusion besets another of Mr Raab’s targets: foreign judges. He wants not just to end any role for the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, but to overhaul the Human Rights Act, which obliges domestic judges to take account of rulings by the separate European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. But the ECHR’s role derives from the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Britain is a signatory (indeed, British lawyers wrote most of the treaty). To withdraw would make Britain one of only two significant European countries outside its jurisdiction (the other is Belarus).
David Gauke, a former Tory lord chancellor, points out that gutting the Human Rights Act could, perversely, see more cases going direct to Strasbourg. It would also send an unhelpful signal about the importance of international law. Britain has long been a firm supporter of the concept. Any reversal would be especially unfortunate at a time when countries such as Poland and Hungary are under attack for undermining judicial independence.
This anti-judicial agenda seems at odds with the separation of powers. Britain has never been purist about this (Lord Mackay, another former Tory lord chancellor, used to say he was its antithesis, as a judge serving in the cabinet and also a member of the legislature). But the British constitution broadly accepts that the legislature, executive and judiciary should be separate.
If there is a problem, it is surely an overweening executive. Parliamentary scrutiny of government can be feeble. A good example, as it happens, was the Brexit trade deal, which saw a treaty of over 1,000 pages rushed through with minimal debate (Tory MPs have only just woken up to the implications for Northern Ireland of measures they enthusiastically voted for). Undermining international law and intimidating judges will hardly improve checks on the executive. Some 45 years ago Lord Hailsham, yet another former Tory lord chancellor, talked of the risks of “elective dictatorship”. He had in mind a Labour government, but his words may apply more to a Conservative one.■",2
1691,"MANY PRESIDENTS assume office in the grip of a crisis. Joe Biden faces at least four. Covid-19 is a public-health disaster: the disease has killed over 400,000 in America and continues to rage while a disorganised vaccination drive sputters. The virus has wreaked economic devastation: 10m fewer Americans are employed than before the pandemic; two-thirds of children cannot attend school in person; one in eight adults are skipping meals. Bitter divisions over racial justice fester. And a partisan rancour has poisoned Americans’ faith in their democracy.
Mr Biden acknowledged this in his inaugural address on January 20th. He spoke to an America that feels perhaps more deeply divided than at any time since Abraham Lincoln delivered his second in 1865, when the Confederate rebellion was in its death throes. “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right...let us strive on to finish the work we are in: to bind up the nation’s wounds,” urged Lincoln. Two weeks after an insurrectionist mob hoisted the Confederate battle flag in the Capitol—something Confederate soldiers had not done during the civil war—Mr Biden called for a moment of national healing. “Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.”

During his campaign Mr Biden vowed to restore America’s soul. That is a daunting task. After Donald Trump’s supporters vandalised the Capitol, an impeachment trial for the former president looms. At least 25,000 members of the armed forces were stationed in Washington, DC—more than are currently deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq combined—to secure the peaceful transition of power. For the first time in 150 years the outgoing president skipped the ceremony. More than 80% of Mr Trump’s supporters believe his damaging lie that the election was stolen.

And yet Mr Biden looks well suited to the work at hand. He assumes the presidency after nearly half a century in government. He is a conciliatory elder statesman who may serve only one term, not a culture warrior hellbent on securing re-election. His cadre of experienced appointees (see graphic) will immediately wield the tools of the administrative state to undo much of the damage of the Trump era. Harsh immigration policies will be lifted. The drive to weaken environmental protections will be reversed. European allies jittery about America’s commitment to mutual defence and combating climate change will be reassured.

More lasting change will require legislation. Both chambers of Congress are under Democratic control, albeit by the narrowest of margins. The Democrats hold the House of Representatives by just four seats. They will retain control of the Senate—which is split equally between the two parties—thanks only to the deciding vote of Kamala Harris, the vice-president.
Marshalling enough support to pass serious reforms will be possible, but will require bipartisan negotiations and a ruthless mastery of the Senate last demonstrated by Lyndon Johnson. Any lone dissident Democratic senator, of left-leaning or conservative convictions, or a sufficiently large bloc of Democrats in the House (a squad of six, say) will be able to scuttle Mr Biden’s proposals in the face of unified Republican opposition. The filibuster, a procedure which allows an obstreperous minority to block most laws unless 60 of the 100 senators vote otherwise, will almost certainly remain in place.
As a result, those on the left of the new president’s party are destined to be disappointed. During the Democratic primary Mr Biden rejected their most contentious proposals, including Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and defunding the police. Other sweeping ideas such as packing the Supreme Court with new justices or ditching the electoral college look impossible.
And yet Mr Biden’s opposition to his party’s most radical ideas has obscured the fact that he hopes to govern well to the left of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. His New Deal-esque agenda will retain populist economic ideas, such as minimum-wage increases, industrial policy and substantial government spending.
The early days of the administration will be dominated by legislation to contain covid-19 and further cushioning its economic fallout. The logic is clear. The proposals to “build back better”, as the new president’s team calls it, will address America’s most urgent crises. They may also attract Republican votes and should conserve Mr Biden’s political capital for more fraught matters later on. That does not mean that they will be modest.
Ready, steady, Joe!
The first order of business, which Mr Biden outlined in a speech on January 14th, will be another covid-19 relief bill, costing $1.9trn. It would provide $160bn to pay for a national vaccine programme, expanded testing and contact-tracers. It would shovel more cash to Americans via cheques of $1,400 per person, increases in unemployment benefits and a temporarily enhanced child tax credit (a policy which would, almost on its own, halve poverty among children). Republicans may balk at the cost—their worries about the deficit and debt are noticeably more acute under Democratic presidents—or some of its provisions, such as increasing the national minimum wage to $15 an hour. But the proposal cannot be accused, as some of Mr Obama’s were, of pre-emptive compromise.

Mr Biden’s economic team has dubbed this bill a “rescue” measure. Hard on its heels will come a “recovery” bill, the details of which are yet to be unveiled. If the first foray into policymaking is any indication, it too will probably be a juggernaut. The recovery bill will propose massive infrastructure spending, perhaps the $2trn pledged in the campaign. It would also be the primary vehicle for some of Mr Biden’s most ambitious climate-change pledges. Mr Biden has promised to ensure universal broadband access, spend $400bn on energy and climate research and create 10m new clean-energy jobs on the way to decarbonising the electricity sector by 2035 and the economy as a whole by 2050. The trillions proposed will also channel Mr Biden’s neo-Rooseveltian instincts: he nostalgically aims for a domestic manufacturing renaissance powered by unionised workers.
These are opening, maximalist positions. They give a sense of the scale of Mr Biden’s ambitions to exploit the crises he faces—and the fractious state of Republicans fighting over the legacy of Trumpism—to remake the American economy. They hint at his strategy for placating the left-wing gadflies of his party (who are also grudgingly thrilled at the diversity of his otherwise conventionally centrist appointees). Mr Biden seems to have grasped that unified control of government is a necessary but not sufficient condition for passing major legislation. Mr Clinton in 1993, Mr Obama in 2009 and Mr Trump in 2017 all came to Washington with the gift of an agreeable Congress. They squandered much of their political capital on trying to push through health-care legislation. Only Mr Obama succeeded.
One cliché of American politics is that such legislative overreach produces the swing back to the opposition party typically seen during a president’s first mid-term elections. The last five presidents have lost on average 31 seats in the House of Representatives during these elections (and two in the Senate). For Mr Biden, that would spell the loss of both chambers, probably dooming the chances of any serious lawmaking for the final two years of his term.
Democrats have learned from the drubbing Mr Obama received in 2010. The issues that provoke deep partisan divisions and sap political capital—such as sweeping reforms of the immigration system—may be introduced for debate in Congress but any serious action will probably have to wait.
Can they work this out?
Even with such caution and concerted whipping from party leaders, Mr Biden will have to work hard. He has two routes to success. The first would be to attract enough Republican support—ten senators under the current configuration—to neuter the threat of a filibuster. Some who remember the obstinacy of Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate under Mr Obama, think it is foolish to expect any differently of him or his caucus. But Mr Biden and his allies maintain a starry-eyed optimism for bipartisan dealmaking. “If the Republicans will recognise this as a watershed moment for them, their party and our country, I think there’s nothing we can’t do together,” says Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware.
Mr Trump’s debasement of his party might be the deciding factor. A few moderate Republican senators most disaffected with Trumpism—such as Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney—could band with conservative Democrats to become the crucial negotiating bloc for all major legislation.

The alternative is reconciliation, a special procedure for passing an annual budget which cannot be filibustered and so could squeeze through with Democratic votes alone. But it has its limits. The rules for such bills are fiendishly complicated. Most importantly policy changes must be principally—not incidentally—budgetary, and cannot add to the deficit over the long run (usually ten years). Those restrictions create fiscal cliffs and lead to huge swings in future tax and spending. They also demand kludgey redrafting to ensure that they are mainly budgetary, says Molly Reynolds of the Brookings Institution.
Much of Mr Biden’s agenda—the parts related to taxation and spending—could be passed through reconciliation. The covid-relief cheques, the clean-energy investment plan, enhanced unemployment insurance and child tax credits look achievable. So does the promised repeal of many of Mr Trump’s tax cuts. But other ambitious ideas may fall victim to internecine Democratic squabbles, including a carbon tax, lowering the Medicare eligibility age, expanding subsidies for child care, and some student-loan forgiveness.
Reconciliation is less useful for ideas that are principally regulatory—such as a national minimum-wage rise or an ambitious clean-energy standard. It could not be used for other priorities of the left, such as immigration reform or new voting- and civil-rights legislation. In theory reconciliation can be used only for the annual budget. But since Republicans did not pass a budget resolution for the current fiscal year, the Biden administration will have two opportunities in quick succession to employ the procedure. One could be devoted to the rescue package and the other to the recovery package. If both become law, they could be the start of an unusually successful presidency—unmarred by the gridlock and frustration of the Obama era.
Mr Biden departs from Mr Obama’s cerebral approach to legislating but he shares his view of the expansive powers of the administrative state. Within hours of his inauguration he signed a slew of executive orders signalling the end of the Trump era. The ban on travel from certain Muslim countries was rescinded. America will swiftly rejoin the Paris climate accord and World Health Organisation. The administration will organise a global climate-change summit. The drawn-out process of reversing Mr Trump’s deregulations on emissions will begin, though these will probably be tied up in the courts for years.
Federal regulators will perk up. Under the former president, the Environmental Protection Agency was slow to enforce rules. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was effectively neutered. Both will pursue their mandates with new vigour. The broad powers already afforded to the Department of Justice to investigate police departments and civil-rights violations could provide a solid start to the current rather nebulous racial-justice agenda.
Getting his house in order
These domestic concerns will almost certainly dominate at least the first year of Mr Biden’s presidency. Though he has taken a keen interest in foreign policy throughout his long career, it will take a back seat—for now at least. “To be an effective global power, you have to be stable at home,” says Nicholas Burns, a professor of diplomacy at Harvard. Mr Biden will not be able to ignore the demands of the rest of the world entirely. Most pressing will be restoring relations with allies in NATO and elsewhere after a frosty four years. An arms-control treaty with Russia expiring in February will force hasty negotiations. Plans will have to be made to fulfil Mr Biden’s pledge to withdraw troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.
But the biggest foreign-policy matter to loom over the Biden administration will be managing great-power competition with China. “It worries me that we’ve got these two giant superpowers moving as if by remote control towards conflict,” says Angus King, an independent senator from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats. Mr King believes that a stable, bipartisan consensus on the subject is within reach. “This is a place where President Trump’s instincts were correct. His implementation was wrong. The fact that China needed to be confronted, I think, was absolutely correct.” Indeed, there is no indication when or even if Mr Biden would lift the tariffs put in place on Chinese goods. Unlike Mr Trump’s fixation on bilateral trade deficits, these will instead be justified on grounds of human-rights abuse, theft of intellectual property and climate change.

The spectre of Mr Trump will linger. The new administration may have to get through his impeachment trial—which would be the first to be held after a president has left office. Mr Biden, who has tried to stay above the partisan fray on the efforts, worries that a Senate engrossed in evidence against his predecessor for alleged high crimes will dally in confirming his nominees and debating his covid-relief package. Others disagree. “I happen to think we can do two things at once,” says Mr King, the senator from Maine. “We can have, for example, hearings on nominations in the mornings and the trial in the afternoon. I don’t think the trial is going to take as long as the prior one did. In fact, the jury in this case were all witnesses.”
Whether or not Mr Trump is convicted, the damage done by his presidency is deep. Nearly 70% of American voters think members of the other party are “a threat to the United States and its people”; 50% conclude that they are “downright evil”. Such feelings predate Mr Trump and indeed created the conditions for his ascent. His innovation was to emphasise white grievance and add a dangerous strain of disbelief in the legitimacy of elections. Having shattered norms like the belief in democracy and the non-violent transition of power, Mr Trump cannot be counted on to adhere to the lesser professional courtesy of refraining from criticising his successor. He did not shy away from inflaming racial animus or culture wars while in office. It would be naive to expect more dignity having left it, as he eyes a comeback in 2024.
In his first inaugural address, as the Union fractured, Lincoln appealed to “the better angels” of Americans’ nature. His pleas could not prevent the worst conflict in American history. There are echoes of other moments of crisis in this transition—the recession presidencies of Franklin Roosevelt and Mr Obama; the pandemic ignored by Woodrow Wilson; the racial strife under Dwight Eisenhower and Johnson. For a president to navigate any one of these crises would be gruelling. To navigate them all at once will be a formidable job. Yet that is Mr Biden’s charge. ■

1692,"Along with a tendency to be argumentative, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) feature strongly in my family tree.
My father had both, which undoubtedly contributed to his early death at 74, while my mother's family are prone to strokes, which again are closely linked to raised blood sugar levels and raised blood pressure. 
So I assume that I carry some pretty dodgy genes, and that's why I keep a blood sugar testing kit and a blood pressure monitor at home and keep a close eye on both.
Around half of British adults have hypertension, while a third have raised blood sugar, and most don't know they have it because they haven't been tested. 
But although these two conditions are treated as if separate, there's increasing evidence they're actually closely intertwined. 
And the bad news is that if you have both, it quadruples your risk of a heart attack or stroke, as well as increasing your risk of dementia.
The good news is that if you treat one, there's a high chance you'll also improve the other — for reasons we don't understand, lowering your blood pressure cuts your risk of type 2 diabetes.
This was confirmed in a study in The Lancet this week, which showed that bringing down someone's blood pressure, with medication or lifestyle changes, will not only have a big effect on reducing their risk of heart attack and stroke, but also their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
The study, which involved more than 145,000 people, showed that even a very modest drop in blood pressure cut your chances of type 2 diabetes by 11 per cent. But there was a sting in the tail: not all blood pressure drugs had a positive impact.
While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor II blockers lowered the diabetes risk, thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers increased it by 20 and 48 per cent respectively — possibly because the different drugs work in very different ways.
So what can you do if you want to reduce your blood pressure without relying on medication? 
Losing weight is a simple but powerful tool; cutting back on salt and becoming more active can also help. My other suggestions include:
TRY SINGING 
I enjoy belting out songs while I am driving or in the shower — and fortunately, research shows that singing is a good way to reduce the stress hormone, cortisol, which in turn should reduce your blood pressure and blood sugar levels (cortisol boosts your blood sugar levels by converting protein into glucose).   
And it can work pretty instantaneously: I remember, some years ago, seeing a middle-aged patient who was in hospital for an operation, but her blood pressure was so high that the surgeons were anxious about operating. 
She began singing quietly to herself, and within 20 minutes her blood pressure had fallen enough for the operation to proceed.
TAKE A HOT BATH 
A daily immersion in hot water can help lower blood pressure —the heat makes your blood vessels expand, reducing the work the heart has to do to make blood pump around your body, 
This was confirmed in a Japanese study published last year, based on data from 30,000 people over 20 years.
Researchers found the people who had a hot bath most days had a 28 per cent lower risk of heart disease and a 26 per cent lower risk of stroke than those who bathed less than twice a week.
EATING DARK CHOCOLATE 
Eating dark chocolate (more than 75 per cent cocoa) can reduce blood pressure almost immediately — this is because it contains significant amounts of flavanols, compounds that can, among other things, cause your arteries to relax and expand.
A few years ago, I took part in an experiment where researchers used an ultrasound to measure the stiffness of my arteries before and after eating a couple of squares of dark chocolate. 
To my surprise, there was clear improvement after the chocolate, accompanied by a drop in my blood pressure. Sadly you don't get the same effect with milk chocolate.
VISIT THE ZOO - IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PET!  
I love my family dog, Tari, a King Charles spaniel, but having looked into the health benefits of having a dog, I feel she is also remarkable value for money. 
For starters, she encourages me to go for daily walks, which is good for my blood pressure. 
A study of residents in a new housing estate in Perth, Western Australia, found people who owned dogs walked 30 minutes more a week, and had lower blood pressure, than those who didn't.
If you don't have a pet, then visiting a zoo can also be beneficial. 
In a 2010 study, researchers in Japan found that after a day at the zoo, not only did the study participants walk, on average, 6,000 steps more than normal but they also experienced significant drops in their blood pressure. 
Exercise makes your heart stronger, so it can pump blood with less effort, which reduces the force on your arteries and therefore blood pressure.
PRACTISE BREATHING 
WE think we know how to breathe — after all, we'd be dead if not — but there are clear benefits from practising slow, deep breaths.
This activates our parasympathetic nervous system (which controls our stress response) and in turn reduces heart rate and dilates our blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.
One of the simplest types of breathing exercise, which I do for a few minutes most days, is called four-two-four. 
This involves breathing in through the nose to a count of four, holding it for two seconds, then breathing out through the mouth to a count of four. Very calming.
You can catnap with your dog  
I was very surprised recently when a leading sleep researcher told me she shares her bed with two dogs.
I've always assumed that dogs in the bedroom, let alone on the bed, are a disaster for sleep. 
Our dog, Tari, isn't even allowed upstairs, though I know she sneaks up when she thinks we're not around.
There's not much research on the impact of sharing your bed with a dog. But a key study in 2017 by the Mayo Clinic in the U.S., which looked at sleep efficiency — the amount of time we spend actually asleep — found it was around 80 per cent when there was a dog on the bed, and 83 per cent when it's in the room (85 per cent or more sleep efficiency is considered excellent).
This meant the dog's owners lost around 14 minutes of sleep a night (though the dogs themselves slept just as soundly on the bed or in the room).
But while sharing with your dog may not be overly disruptive to your sleep, once a dog becomes used to it, it will howl if excluded. 
And, like humans, they get more restless as they get older.
WATCH OUT FOR VEGAN JUNK FOOD  
My wife, Clare, and I have been looking at how to cut our carbon footprint. As well as keeping our house chilly, for instance, we're thinking about going more vegan.
There's plenty of evidence that meat and dairy production makes a big contribution to the release of atmosphere-warming gases, and clearly lots of others feel the same, with the number of Brits eating and drinking only plant-based foods nearly doubling in a decade.
Two things are currently holding me back. The first is that I love dairy and struggle with plant-based milks. 
But also I'm not entirely sold on all of the alleged health benefits.
Yes, if you cook your meals from scratch, make sure you're getting enough protein and supplement with the necessary vitamins, then a vegan diet can be really healthy. 
The trouble is that food manufacturers are now rushing out all sorts of vegan-based ultra-processed foods, such as vegan sausage rolls, that are unlikely to be healthier than meat alternatives.
For instance, a survey by Action On Salt in 2018 found that some meat-free burgers contained 15 per cent more salt than the meat ones.
And a recent study in the Journal of Nutrition, involving 21,000 people, found that the vegans were eating the most junk food, with 39 per cent of their diet made up of ultra-processed foods, compared to 33 per cent for meat eaters.
So I might give it a go in Veganuary (trying to eat only vegan in January) but I'll certainly need to get in more recipe books and start practising firsT.",-2
1693,"IN THE NEGOTIATIONS which led up to the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Saudi Arabia spent a great deal of time attempting to insert the term “environmentally safe and sound” in front of references to “energy sources” and “energy supplies”. Given that the oil Saudi Arabia exports in greater quantities than any other country is now understood to be anything but environmentally safe, this seems bizarre. At the time, though, the aim was obvious to all concerned: the phrase was a way to keep nuclear power off the Rio agenda.
The oil shocks of the 1970s had led to many countries increasing their nuclear efforts. In the ten years to 1992 the amount of nuclear energy consumed worldwide had increased by 130%. What was more, some talked of using nuclear plants to produce not just electricity, but also hydrogen which could then form the basis of synthetic fuels. The Saudis may or may not have had real concerns about the environment. But they knew a competitor when they saw one.

Their scheming proved unnecessary. In contrast to the oil shocks, the threat of global warming has not served the nuclear cause well. After peaking in 2006, the amount of nuclear energy consumed in 2019 was just 18% higher than it had been in 1992. As a share of global primary energy, it had fallen from 6.1% to 4.3%.
Because nuclear power is expensive in ways that show up in profits, whereas damage to the climate is not priced into burning fossil fuels, this would be unsurprising even if it were popular with environmentalists—which, by and large, it is not. But it is still too bad. The paradigm-shifting drop in the cost of renewable electricity in the past decade is central to the decarbonisation pathway the world is fitfully following. But a clean-energy system requires redundancy and reliability in its electricity grids that are hard to achieve with renewables alone. It will probably also require lots of hydrogen for, say, powering aircraft and making steel and chemicals, which reactors could provide.
Nuclear power has its drawbacks, as do all energy sources. But when well-regulated it is reliable and, despite its reputation, extremely safe. That is why it is foolish to close down perfectly good nuclear power stations such as Diablo Canyon, in California, because of little more than prejudice. It is why some countries, most notably China, are building out their nuclear fleets. It helps explain why others—including, as it happens, Saudi Arabia—are getting into the game for the first time. And it is why approaches to reducing nuclear energy’s cost penalty are at last coming into their own.
France, which has found its newest generation of huge reactors impossible to build on time and within budget, and consequently also hard to export, has new plans for small, modular reactors (SMRs) that might do better on both counts. Rolls-Royce, a British engineering company, is touting a similar approach. On November 4th an American company, NuScale, signed a deal to sell six such reactors to Romania at the COP26 in Glasgow. Russia already has a floating SMR power station.
Such designs can in principle be produced in factories and shipped where they are required, keeping their costs down. These advantages have been extolled for decades without being realised, so caution is in order. But today’s efforts are broader-based and have real impetus. They need regulatory approaches which, while not lax, permit their makers to learn as they build. That will allow competing designs to prove themselves against each other, making nuclear power, once again, a source of innovation—and adding to the world’s capacity to ditch unsafe and unsound fossil energy. ■

1694,"DROPDOWN MENUS can be telling. Buy a subscription to the Times, a conservative paper, and under the “Titles” option it offers you a duly conservative selection: “Mr”, “Mrs”, “Miss”, “Ms” and “other”. The left-leaning Guardian offers no titles at all. Debrett’s is different. It offers not merely “Mr” and “Mrs” but also “Lord”, “Lady”, “Sir”, “Hon.”, “Capt.”, “Col.” and “Rev.” Signing up is less like online shopping than assuming a part in a Jane Austen adaptation.
Dropdowns are needed because the publication has just gone digital. This is in many ways disappointing. Debrett’s Peerage  Baronetage, a snob’s guide to Britain’s aristocracy, feels as though it ought to be written on vellum and served by butlers, rather than hosted on internet servers. Austen’s “Persuasion” opens with Sir Walter Elliot thumbing the Baronetage’s much-loved pages. Nancy Mitford mocked its chronicles of “ancestors with P.G. Wodehouse names” and “Walter Scott fates”. In Evelyn Waugh’s “Brideshead Revisited”, when Sebastian Flyte is asked about his family, he says crisply: “There are lots of us. Look them up in Debrett.”

Its tissue-fine pages used to whisper discreetly of a forgotten world, one of silver spoons and iron conventions that covered the correct way to address a duke (“Your Grace”); a duke’s daughter (“Your Ladyship”) and “Divorced Ladies” (however you like). But as times change, so must formats. When the queen has a Twitter account (@RoyalFamily) and 4.6m followers, it was perhaps inevitable that Debrett’s would move online.
It has also branched out, not quite selling the family silver but allowing the lower classes to gaze on it, like an aristocrat opening the country seat for afternoon teas. It offers advice on etiquette, including table manners (“it is vulgar to bite into bread”); Zoom (“never eat on-screen”); and social kissing (“under no circumstances should there be a suggestion of saliva”).
Keeping it perfectly up to date is, says Wendy Bosberry-Scott, its editor, all but impossible, since “people are born, get married and die every day”. Here, being digital is an advantage. One year a particularly important duke died the day it went to press: Debrett’s had to call the printer and replace the page. “It cost a fortune.”
The entire database, dating back to 1769, is now searchable: 2,000 hereditary titles, more than 700 life peers and around 150,000 assorted relatives—or, as Debrett’s calls them, “collateral” (aristocrats, like accidents, cause fallout). Even including collateral, it covers little more than 0.2% of the British population. It is an influential 0.2%, including many prominent politicians, among them David Cameron, the former prime minister whose rash decision to hold a referendum unexpectedly took Britain out of the European Union (motto: “Prudently and Constantly”).
But Britain, though still class-ridden, is less dominated by titled toffs today. In the 1860s, three-quarters of MPs were from patrician backgrounds; now they are exceptions, not the rule. This is good for Britain, but bad for Debrett’s. Walk into a library in 1900 and you would have found shelves of such volumes: Debrett’s, “Burke’s Peerage” and “Kelly’s Handbook”: class bound in red cloth. Now Kelly’s has gone; Burke’s was last printed in 2003; and the most recent print edition of Debrett’s, in 2019, had a run of just 700. It was almost certainly the last. As few know better, things are born, and die, every day. ■",2
1695,"The opponents of Binyamin Netanyahu reached an agreement that would end his 12-year stretch as prime minister of Israel. Under the deal, Naftali Bennett, the leader of a nationalist party, would become prime minister, serving for two years before handing over to Yair Lapid, a centrist and secularist. The Knesset still must pass a vote of confidence in the new coalition, which includes an Arab-Israeli party. That leaves time for Mr Netanyahu to try to pick off its right-wing supporters.

The African Union suspended Mali’s membership and threatened to impose sanctions if a civilian-led government is not restored. Last month Mali’s armed forces mounted a coup, the second in less than a year.
The Democratic Republic of Congo said that 32 of its MPs had died of covid-19. The reported total for the entire country of 80m is only 786 deaths. So either MPs are very unlucky or there is massive undercounting among less prominent folk, and a far worse pandemic than official numbers admit.
Iran’s largest navy vessel (in terms of tonnage) sank after catching fire in the Gulf of Oman during a training mission. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. The navy said it started in one of the ship’s systems.
A cargo ship carrying chemicals and plastic pellets sank off the coast of Sri Lanka, near Colombo. The X-Press Pearl had been on fire for two weeks. Its sinking will exacerbate an unfolding maritime disaster: hundreds of tonnes of fuel could escape from its tanks to add to the tonnes of plastic already finding their way onto local beaches.
China’s ruling Politburo said the country’s two-children-per-couple rule would be changed to a three-child one. The government, which once tried to force people to have fewer babies, now wants them to have more, to stop the population from ageing so fast. Parents who want a third child rejoiced, but the vast majority do not. Demographers predicted that the birth rate would not rise much.
Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s foreign minister, said his country would summon China’s ambassador, after 16 Chinese air-force planes were seen approaching Malaysia’s airspace over the South China Sea, where the countries’ territorial claims overlap. The foreign ministry described the incident as a “serious threat to national sovereignty”. Chinese officials described the flights as “routine”.
A Chinese blogger, Qiu Ziming, was sentenced to eight months in prison for “picking quarrels and causing trouble”. His offence related to his posts suggesting that China had under-reported the number of its soldiers killed in border clashes with India last year.
Democrats staged a walk-out in the Texas legislature, preventing Republicans from passing a bill that would tighten the state’s voting laws. Critics say the bill, which among other things bans 24-hour polling stations, is intended to suppress black and Hispanic votes.

Tens of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to voice their disapproval of Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the covid-19 crisis. Some waved signs demanding “Bolsonaro out”. It was the first big protest against the president since the start of the pandemic. Mr Bolsonaro’s approval ratings have plummeted; he is up for re-election next year.
Mr Bolsonaro agreed that covid-embattled Brazil could step in at the last minute and host the Copa América football tournament, which starts on June 13th. Surging infections in Argentina and protests in Colombia have caused both countries to withdraw as co-hosts. Critics fretted that cheering fans will turn the matches into superspreading events.
Russia’s upper house of parliament approved a law barring members of “terrorist” and “extremist” organisations from holding elective office. Vladimir Putin’s government routinely applies those labels to peaceful dissident groups, such as the supporters of Alexei Navalny, the main opposition leader, who is in prison on bogus charges.

Peru raised its death toll from the disease to 180,000 (from 69,300) to keep the figure in line with international counting of excess deaths.
Britain reported zero daily deaths from covid-19 for the first time since the start of the pandemic in March last year. The country’s vaccine roll-out has been a stellar success. More than 75% of adults have received at least one jab.
The World Health Organisation ( WHO) approved the Sinovac vaccine for emergency use, the second jab made in China to receive its blessing.
The WHO reclassified variants of the disease by letters of the Greek alphabet to avoid upsetting the countries where they were first spotted. The British variant becomes Alpha, the South African variant Beta, and so on. In a somewhat less sensitive move, the WHO elected Syria, a blood-drenched dictatorship, to a seat on its executive board.",2

The euro zone’s economy grew by 3.7% in the third quarter, year on year (America’s GDP expanded by 4.9% on the same basis). Annual inflation in the currency bloc soared to 4.1% in October, a 13-year high, driven by higher energy prices.
Hit by an energy crunch, European gas prices yo-yoed amid conflicting news from Russia, which supplies around two-fifths of the EU’s imported gas. Gazprom appeared to be following an order from Vladimir Putin to start storing gas for Europe, after it had replenished its stocks for Russia. But the state-owned company again declined to book the necessary pipeline capacity to transport the gas.
Microsoft overtook Apple to become America’s most valuable company, reaching a market capitalisation above $2.5trn, after Apple’s quarterly earnings disappointed investors. Tesla’s share price wobbled when Elon Musk said the company had not yet signed an agreement to sell 100,000 electric cars to Hertz.

Epstein took his own life in 2019 after he was charged with sex trafficking under-age girls.

Barclays noted that the investigation “makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein’s alleged crimes”.
Steely plan
America and the European Union resolved a trade spat over steel and aluminium. Donald Trump introduced tariffs on European steel in 2018 under the guise of protecting America’s national security; the Biden administration will now accept European imports under a quota system. In return the EU will not impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of American goods. Both sides are working on arrangements to produce sustainable steel in order to curb what Joe Biden described as “dirty steel” from China.

Facebook changed its name to Meta, a rebranding that highlights the company’s other social-media apps, Instagram and WhatsApp, and downplays the Facebook name. One of the new parent company’s first decisions was to cease facial recognition on Facebook’s photos and videos because of the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the technology, though it is to retain the algorithm behind it.
Dell completed its spin off of VMware into a separate software company, a business it acquired in its merger with EMC in 2016.

1697," (CNN)Suspended South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh has been indicted on more than two dozen new financial crimes by a state grand jury, which alleged schemes to ""defraud victims of and thereafter launder"" nearly $5 million in five different counties.South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson's office announced Friday a state grand jury issued five indictments with a total of 27 charges against Murdaugh.The indictments include four counts of Breach of Trust with Fraudulent Intent; seven counts of Obtaining Signature or Property by False Pretenses; seven counts of Money Laundering; eight counts of Computer Crimes; and one count of Forgery.The majority of the indictments center on cases and victims not previously known to the public, like a highway patrolman injured in the line of duty, from whom prosecutors allege Murdaugh stole settlement money for ""his own personal use, for expenses including but not limited to overdraft fees, cash, and checks written to associates.""""Altogether, Murdaugh is charged with respect to alleged schemes to defraud victims and thereafter launder $4,853,488.09,"" said the Attorney General's office in a release Friday.According to the indictments, state attorneys alleged Murdaugh defrauded and laundered $792,000 in Bamberg County, $125,000 in Orangeburg County, $70,000 in Colleton County, $383,056.14 in Allendale County and $3,483,431.95 in Beaufort County. The multi-million-dollar sum in Beaufort County is related to the previously reported wrongful death settlement with the family of the Murdaugh family's housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield. Murdaugh is currently being held without bond in a Columbia, S.C. jail on two earlier charges of obtaining property by false pretenses related to the Satterfield family wrongful death settlement. In a statement sent to CNN, the attorneys for the Satterfield family addressed the new indictments, saying, in part, ""The Satterfield family is grateful to law enforcement for their continued efforts in the investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Gloria Satterfield and the egregious breaches of trust and theft committed upon her sons. The additional indictments brought today in connection with the crimes committed against Gloria and her sons as well as apparently others are welcome, long overdue and were appropriately brought.""Attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Ritcher continued in the statement, ""Of course, Mr. Murdaugh is entitled to his presumption of innocence and to his rights under the criminal process.  For now, however, it seems the statewide grand jury was as unimpressed with his opioid defense and other explanations given as we have been.  As always, we are steadfastly in the Satterfield corner and committed to seeing these matters to the end.  Ultimately, we will entrust a judge or jury to let us know when the Satterfields have received their full cup of justice -- not Alex Murdaugh or his attorneys.""CNN has reached out to Murdaugh's attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, for comment but has not received a response.He is also facing several lawsuits in civil court, including one from his former firm.Murdaugh, a once prominent South Carolina attorney, was shot in the head on a roadway September 4, but survived. He later admitted to authorities he conspired with former client Curtis Smith to kill him as part of a fraud scheme so his only surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance payout.Murdaugh has since been charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false police report.The shooting followed the June deaths of Murdaugh's wife, Margaret, and son, Paul, who were fatally shot outside their home in Islandton, South Carolina.

1699,"THE GOLDEN mean in California’s one-party politics can be caricatured, only a little unfairly, as the art of sounding progressive while acting conservative. Take housing. Homeowners may recognise that housing affordability and homelessness are acute social problems. But the obvious remedy—more construction—seems unappealing, because it might hurt property values and spoil neighbourhoods. Thus the progressive-conservative position is to insist on building housing at below-market rates, which sounds compassionate but, in practice, means that little new housing actually gets built. This is why it is so encouraging that two days after Gavin Newsom handily defeated a Republican attempt to boot him from office, the governor signed two contentious measures, SB9 and SB10, aimed at increasing housing supply.
In the past decade median home values have surged 165% in both Los Angeles and San Francisco Counties to $830,000 and $1.85m, respectively. Median home prices nationwide increased by 64% to about $375,000. Before covid-19, San Francisco was the costliest city for renters; New York now barely claims the top spot. Californians make up 12% of America’s population, but 28% of its homeless.

The more controversial law of the two is SB9, which ends single-family zoning in the state. This means Californians will now be able to convert their houses into up to four units, depending on the size of their plot. California isn’t the first place to eliminate single-family zoning. Minneapolis and Oregon did so in 2019. As for SB10, that will make it easier for cities to build up to ten apartments on land currently set aside for single-family homes near busy public-transport corridors.
California has built fewer than 100,000 homes a year, on average, in the past decade. Permits issued for new construction plummeted in 2007 when the housing bubble burst, and have not yet returned to their previous level. Estimates for the number of homes the state needs to build just to keep up with population growth vary wildly. The state thinks it needs to build 1.8m homes by 2025; McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons it will need 3.5m. Ben Metcalf of the Terner Centre for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says the magic number is probably somewhere between the two.
If California so badly needs more housing, why is ending single-family zoning controversial? For a long time, making it in America meant having a house in the suburbs with the white picket fence, says Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, a think-tank. Single-family homes are also ubiquitous. As of 2019, they made up 61% of all housing units in the country. San Francisco is America’s second-densest city after New York. Yet 51% of residential land in the county is zoned for single-family homes (see map).

Although single-family homes are everywhere, they were not initially meant for everyone. Today the Bay Area is a laboratory for some of the country’s most progressive policies. Yet in 1916, Berkeley was among the first places to enact single-family zoning. Banning apartments and commercial buildings was a way to exclude poor Americans from desirable neighbourhoods. At best, the practice was snobbish. At worst, it helped segregate cities by class and race. After the Supreme Court struck down explicitly racial zoning ordinances in 1917, zoning by land-use became widespread. Metal gates still ring Berkeley’s upmarket Claremont neighbourhood today; it was one of the first places zoned for single-family homes.
The new laws will bring incremental change rather than revolution. An analysis from the Terner Centre found that SB9 could make new development possible on 5.4% of existing single-family lots. That may sound very little, but it would still create about 700,000 new units, 40% more than would otherwise have been developed. The units will also probably be built slowly, since the law depends on Californians voluntarily renovating their homes.
Even so, SB9 and SB10 have incensed the state’s vocal NIMBY constituency. NIMBYs and their YIMBY nemeses have become tribal factions in California politics. Groups seemingly removed from housing policy scream their opinions. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation runs a housing advocacy outfit that took out a full-page ad in the Sacramento Bee beseeching Mr Newsom not to sign the bills.
Among the staunchest opponents of SB9 are those who liken the law to a power grab by the state that takes planning decisions away from cities. Some local officials in southern California talk about Sacramento, the state capital, with a prickly disdain usually reserved for faraway Washington, DC. Bill Brand, the mayor of Redondo Beach, a small city south of Los Angeles, has proposed an amendment to California’s constitution that would reassert local control over land-use decisions.
Opponents also argue that the law will hasten gentrification by allowing firms to buy up single-family homes, renovate them and sell them at higher cost. A requirement for property owners to live in one of their redeveloped units for three years should help assuage fears of rampant speculation. Some gentrification will probably still happen as neighbourhoods change, says Mr Metcalf. But it would come from homeowners being enticed to sell, rather than tenants being forced out because they can no longer afford the rent.
The biggest criticism levelled at SB9 is that it does nothing to create affordable housing. The new duplexes will be cheaper than the single-family homes that predated them, but may still be too pricey. Yet market-rate housing is also badly needed. “You’re criticised for having too many affordability requirements, or not enough affordability requirements”, says Scott Wiener, a state senator and the perennial author of California housing bills. “No matter what you do, people are going to nitpick at the bill. Frankly that is one explanation for why we have a housing crisis.”
To turbo-charge homebuilding, California might take a lesson from improv comedy and adopt a “yes, and” approach to housing. Yes, end single-family zoning—and build affordable housing, streamline the permit process, help cities navigate tricky policy and crack down on municipalities that are not building. These laws alone “are not going to end the affordability crisis in California,” says Jason Elliott, Mr Newsom’s housing tsar. “No one is suggesting they are.” But it’s a start. ■",2
1700,"THAT VIKINGS crossed the Atlantic long before Christopher Columbus is well established. Their sagas told of expeditions to the coast of today’s Canada: to Helluland, which scholars have identified as Baffin Island or Labrador; Markland (Labrador or Newfoundland) and Vinland (Newfoundland or a territory farther south). In 1960 the remains of Norse buildings were found on Newfoundland.
But there was no evidence to prove that anyone outside northern Europe had heard of America until Columbus’s voyage in 1492. Until now. A paper for the academic journal Terrae Incognitae by Paolo Chiesa, a professor of Medieval Latin Literature at Milan University, reveals that an Italian monk referred to the continent in a book he wrote in the early 14th century. Setting aside the scholarly reserve that otherwise characterises his monograph, Mr Chiesa describes the mention of Markland (Latinised to Marckalada) as “astonishing”.

In 2015 Mr Chiesa traced to a private collection in New York the only known copy of the Cronica universalis, originally written by a Dominican, Galvano Fiamma, between around 1339 and 1345. The book once belonged to the library of the basilica of Sant’Ambrogio in Milan. In Napoleonic times, the monastery was suppressed and its contents scattered. The owner of the Cronica let Mr Chiesa photograph the entire book and, on his return to Milan, the professor gave the photographs to his graduate students to transcribe. Towards the end of the project one of the students, Giulia Greco, found a passage in which Galvano, after describing Iceland and Greenland, writes: “Farther westwards there is another land, named Marckalada, where giants live; in this land, there are buildings with such huge slabs of stone that nobody could build them, except huge giants. There are also green trees, animals and a great quantity of birds.”
Mr Chiesa says that giants were a standard embellishment of faraway places in Norse folklore and, indeed, Galvano cautioned that “no sailor was ever able to know anything for sure about this land or about its features.” The Dominican was scrupulous in citing his sources. Most were literary. But, unusually, he ascribed his description of Marckalada to the oral testimony of “sailors who frequent the seas of Denmark and Norway”.
Mr Chiesa believes their accounts were probably passed on to Galvano by seafarers in Genoa, the nearest port to Milan and the city in which the Dominican monk is most likely to have studied for his doctorate.
His thesis raises a new question: why does the eastern seaboard of America not feature on any known Genoese map of the period? But it could help explain why Columbus, a Genoese, was prepared to set off across what most contemporaries considered a landless void.■",2
1701,"MILAN/ROME, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Rome is drawing up an offer to try to convince Intel (INTC.O) to invest billions of euros in an advanced chipmaking plant in Italy, as Germany emerges as frontrunner to land an even bigger megafactory planned by the U.S. company, three sources said.
The plants would be part of a drive by the U.S. group to build cutting-edge manufacturing capacity in Europe to help avoid future supply shortages of the kind currently crippling the automotive industry in particular. 
Rome is already in talks with Intel about the potential investment, which according to preliminary estimates would be worth more than 4 billion euro ($4.7 billion), the sources who are involved in the discussions said.
One of them said the total could even reach around 8 billion euros, depending on Intel's plans.
They declined to be identified because the details are confidential.
Rome is ready to fund part of the overall investment with public money and offer favourable terms to Intel, including on labour and energy costs, the sources said.
The factory would create more than 1,000 direct jobs in Italy, they added.
""The government is preparing a very detailed offer with the aim of clinching a deal by the end of the year,"" one of the sources told Reuters.
""Discussions with Intel are at an advanced stage. There is no deal yet, but if the government works hard on this it has a good chance of bringing the plant to Italy.""
Potential sites include Turin's Mirafiori area, the Italian home of carmaker Stellantis (STLA.MI), and Catania in Sicily, where French-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.BN) already operates, the sources said.
Intel declined to comment on its plans.
The U.S. group's biggest project in Europe is a planned megafactory, where Dresden in Germany has emerged as a leading candidate site, the sources said. They are not directly involved in talks about the choice of site for the megafactory.
No final decision has been made for either site and plans could change in the coming weeks, the sources said.
FROM U.S. TO EU
The Italian factory would be an ""advanced packaging"" plant that uses new technologies to weave together full chips out of tiles produced by Intel and other chipmakers, the sources said.
Intel is using the technology to draw in new customers such as Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) cloud computing unit, but its only sites are in the United States.
France is also seen as contender for the megafactory, while Italy faces competition from Poland, where Intel also has a presence, for the packaging facility.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said last month the company would announce the locations of two major new EU chip fabrication plants by year-end as it looks to spend 80 billion euros over the next decade on the continent. 
CHIPS ARE DOWN
The plans come as the European Union aims to reduce its dependence on semiconductor supplies from the United States and China, and the chip supply crisis shows no signs of abating.
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after the work-from-home trend during the pandemic led to explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers.
The shortages have hit the automotive industry - a major pillar of the European economy - the hardest, as chipmakers have generally preferred consumer electronics customers because they buy more advanced, higher-margin chips.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said this week the EU needed to act ""now and decisively"" to increase output to meet its target of producing 20% of the world's semiconductor output by 2030.
""China and the U.S. are already investing tens of billions each in this sector,"" he said.
Still, building the megafactory and packaging plant will take years and is unlikely to help European automakers in the short term.
For that, Gelsinger has said Intel plans to reserve capacity at its chip factory in Ireland for automakers and help them shift to using its technology, but that too could take time.
GERMANY IN THE LEAD
Talks could speed up after a new government is formed in Germany, following September's federal elections.
The EU's biggest economy, with a large car industry, is in the lead to land the ""megafab"" plant, the sources said, though France remains in the running.
One of the sources said Italy also had ""cards to play"" to obtain a research centre, which is another part of the overall investment Intel is preparing for Europe.

1702,"THE STORY of the Trojan war, as told by Homer and related down the centuries, is one of intrigue and heroes. And, as is the way of characters from Greek mythology, the names of many of those involved have ended up attached to objects in the sky.
In the early 20th century astronomical photography showed that Jupiter, the solar system’s largest planet, was accompanied not only by its moons, but also by more distant acolytes. These were clusters of asteroids that followed the giant planet’s orbit precisely, but either led or trailed Jupiter itself by about 60° of arc.

 Those clusters are centred on places called Lagrange points L4 and L5, after the mathematician who predicted their existence. L4 and L5 are traps in space caused by the interaction of the gravitational fields of Jupiter and the sun. Once in one of them, an asteroid is generally stuck there. Given the division of these captured asteroids into two camps, it amused their early discoverers to call bodies discovered at L4, which leads Jupiter, after Greek heroes of the war, and those at L5, which trails that planet, after Trojans (though each camp also has a spy from the other in its midst).
The siege of Troy
Most known asteroids reside in a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Spectroscopic analysis of sunlight reflected from these, and comparisons with chunks of space rock that have fallen to Earth as meteorites, suggest that some are fragments of dwarf planets which subsequently collided with each other (a few such dwarfs, for example Ceres, remain intact), while the rest are conglomerations of material from the early solar nebula, often including pebbles of once-molten rock called chondrules. Many of the conglomerate-based asteroids are rich in carbon, which makes them dark and vaguely reddish in colour. In particular, their spectra resemble those of chondrule-bearing meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites.
Certain asteroids in the outer part of the main belt are, however, redder still—carbonaceous chondrites on steroids, as it were. These types are also abundant in a second, more distant set of asteroids and dwarf planets, the Kuiper belt, found beyond the orbit of Neptune, of which Pluto is the best-known member. The nuclei of active comets are often objects of this sort. And they constitute, too, the bulk of the members the Greek and Trojan camps.
The distant orbits of these asteroids mean that they do not seem to contribute to the mixture of meteorites that fall to Earth, so there is nothing to compare them with directly. Their colour, though, is suspected to be caused by complex organic molecules similar to terrestrial kerogen collecting on their surfaces. This material’s exact chemistry will reflect where in the solar system these asteroids formed, and thus cast light on how objects moved around in the system’s early days. That makes the Trojans (as the two groups are known collectively) of special interest to those who study the formation of planetary systems. So, on October 16th NASA, America’s space agency,  launched a probe to have a look at them.
Lucy, as this planetary-ancestor-investigating mission is dubbed, after a well-known specimen of Australopithecus, an early hominid, blasted off from Cape Canaveral, in Florida, and will now follow one of the most complex paths around the solar system yet devised by NASA’s orbital navigators. The diagram which shows Lucy’s journey, indicates how the craft will first pick up speed using two velocity-boosting fly-bys of Earth. It will then head for the Greek camp, passing, for a practice run at observation, by way of a convenient main-belt asteroid that the mission’s scientists have named Donaldjohanson, in honour of the discoverer of Lucy the Australopithecine. When it arrives at L4 in 2027, it will encounter five bodies: Eurybates and its tiny satellite Queta, Polymele, Leucus and Orus.
Having examined each of these, it will leave the Greek camp in 2028 and cross, via another velocity-boosting fly-by of Earth, to the Trojan camp at L5. Its final planned encounter, when it reaches L5 in 2033, is with Patroclus and Menoetius.
These were thought to be a single object until 2001, when an examination by the Gemini North telescope, in Hawaii, showed they were actually a pair of rocks, each about 100km across, in orbit around one another. Classicists will recognise Patroclus, the name used when the pair were believed to be one, as the Greek spy in the Trojan camp. It is now the name given to the larger of the two. Menoetius, hurriedly pressed into service to designate the smaller, was Patroclus’s father. (For the curious, the Trojan spy in the Greek camp is Hektor, which is not on Lucy’s itinerary.)
The most widely used classification of asteroids, invented by David Tholen of the University of Hawaii, now recognises 14 spectral types, each called by a letter of the alphabet. Main-belt asteroids are mostly types C (carbon-rich, as with carbonaceous chondrites), M (believed to be metallic, and derived from the cores of dwarf planets) and S (silicaceous, or stony, and either other types of conglomerate or fragments of the outer layers of dwarf planets). Some Trojans are also type C. But the deep-red ones are of rarer types known as D and P—the difference between them being the exact shapes of the curves of their spectra.
To look at its targets in detail (Polymele, Patroclus and Menoetius are type P; Orus and Leucus are type D; and Eurybates and Donaldjohanson are type C), Lucy is equipped with three instruments: a high-resolution camera, an optical and near-infrared spectrometer, and a thermal spectrometer. Together, these will be able to map the various asteroids the probe encounters, and analyse the chemical compositions of their surfaces.
That, in turn, will test the ideas of Harold Levison, the mission’s principle scientific investigator. Dr Levison, who works at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, helped create the Nice model of the solar system’s early days. This hypothesises that the largest planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, have moved around a lot since they formed.
The gravitational effects of all this movement would have scattered asteroids like leaves in a gale, ejecting many of them from the solar system altogether and moving others far from their places of origin. Dr Levison suspects the Trojan D and P asteroids to be such travellers, and that their surface chemistry will show they formed much farther from the sun than Jupiter’s current orbit. The Nice model suggests such distant asteroids would have been scattered, in particular, by the movement of Neptune, which began life closer to the sun than Uranus but is now farther from it, and that some would then have been ensnared by Lagrange’s gravitational traps. If the D and P types Lucy encounters did indeed form far from the sun, that would add weight to the Nice model.
Once Lucy has visited Patroclus and Menoetius its formal mission will be over. These days, however, space probes often have an afterlife beyond the period intended. The New Horizons mission to Pluto, for example, has gone on to observe a second Kuiper-belt object, Arrokoth, and Opportunity, an American Mars rover that had a design life of 90 Martian days, actually operated for 57 times that period. In Lucy’s case, the craft’s final orbit will take it on an endless loop from L5 to L4 and back again. Each loop will take six years. So, if the hardware holds up, there is sufficient fuel left for manoeuvring, and someone is willing to pay to keep the mission team together, other Trojans might yet receive a visit. ■

1703,"A 21-year-old killer is facing life behind bars after pleading guilty today to murdering a mother of two who he grabbed off the street as she was leaving a hospital appointment before strangling and beating her to death. 
Valentin Lazar, 21 - who was pictured in a mugshot released this afternoon - inflicted multiple injuries on 45-year-old Maria Rawlings before leaving her in undergrowth in Romford. Ms Rawlings was attacked after visiting accident and emergency following a fall.
Having left hospital without being seen, she got on a bus in Romford just after 11pm on May 3, where her path crossed with Lazar. The mother of two had only been on the bus for about 10 minutes when it terminated and she and the defendant got off.
Lazar was caught on CCTV as he guided his victim towards some shrubbery. After about 30 minutes, he emerged from the undergrowth alone carrying her handbag, the Old Bailey had heard.
Prosecutor Paul Jarvis had told a previous hearing that Ms Rawlings was targeted by Lazar because she was a vulnerable woman alone at night.
He said: 'He was probably carrying a knife.
'He led her into the bushes before violently attacking her and ultimately killing her before stealing some of her belongings and walking off.'
After the attack, Lazar boarded a bus towards Dagenham, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
Ms Rawlings' naked body was found concealed in undergrowth by a dog walker at about 2.30pm the next day in the Little Heath area.
She had suffered multiple injuries to her mouth, chest and knee as well as 13 fractured ribs but there were no signs of sexual assault.
A baseball cap with the defendant's DNA on it was left near to the body.
Following a media appeal, Lazar, who was living in rented accommodation in East Ham, was identified on social media.
On his arrest, officers found clothes matching those of the attacker with traces of blood on them.
On Friday, Ms Rawlings' two grown-up daughters sat in court as the defendant pleaded guilty to murder with the assistance of a Romanian interpreter.
The court was told that he admitted murder but denied he intended to kill Ms Rawlings or that he had a knife.
Remanding the defendant into custody, Judge Peter Rook QC said: 'You have pleaded guilty to murder in a case of the utmost seriousness.
'There is only one sentence the court can pass and that is one of life imprisonment. A judge will decide the minimum that you must serve.'
The case was adjourned until January 10 next year.
Emma Currie, from the CPS, said: 'Maria Rawlings was a vulnerable woman. She had attended A&E on the night of her murder, but tragically left before she was seen.
'The prosecution case included DNA and footprint evidence as well as CCTV footage which caught Lazar leaving with the handbag Ms Rawlings had been wearing earlier that evening.
'Valentin Lazar is a violent man who has shown little remorse for his actions.
'When initially arrested he even claimed to suffer from memory loss, saying 'I can't remember what happened yesterday'.
'Women should be free to travel through London without fearing violent attacks.
'The CPS is committed to bringing offenders to justice in respect of violence against women and girls. I hope this conviction provides some sense of justice for the family and friends of Ms Rawlings. Our thoughts remain with them at this time.'
The murder of Ms Rawlings comes amid heightened concern for the safety of lone women following a spate of predatory stranger attacks.",-2
1704,"EMILY CLARK’S boys did not return to class in September, when schools in England opened to all pupils for the first time since the spring. Her three school-aged sons had begun learning remotely a few weeks before everyone else did in Britain’s first lockdown in March 2020. Doctors said that her five-year-old—who had a kidney transplant when he was a toddler—might be at increased risk from covid-19. But health worries were not the main reason why six months later Ms Clark chose formally to withdraw her children from school and start educating them herself. She says that they have been happier since they stopped having to spend their days in classrooms and that, with her as their teacher, they are learning more quickly.
Helping their children learn remotely during the pandemic has driven many parents to distraction. A few have found it easier and more rewarding to take complete control of their children’s lessons. Research published in November by the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, a group that represents local officials, found the number of home-educated children in England had increased by 40% to about 75,000 in the year to October 2020. That represents a little under 1% of school-aged children but it is double the number who were home educated four years before. In America, where some schools have not opened their buildings since March, the numbers are higher. A survey published in October by the Pew Research Centre found that around 7% of American parents were formally home-schooling their children, up from around 3% in the spring.

The ranks of home educators were swelling long before the disruption of covid-19. For decades the greatest number in America have been conservative Christians who fear that schools may corrupt their offspring. But since 2007 the share of parents who say that providing religious or moral instruction is the “most important” reason for them to home-school has fallen, according to a survey by the Department of Education. More parents now cite concerns about drugs and other nasty influences in schools. Those who live near bad schools and who cannot afford private ones sometimes decide home-schooling is a better option. Black families and those from other minorities have additional worries about racism in the public-school (that is, state-school) system, says Cheryl Fields-Smith of the University of Georgia.
Around the world “accidental” home-schoolers are now more common, argues Rebecca English, who studies home education at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. These parents say that they have withdrawn their children as a last resort because their local schools cannot accommodate disabilities or emotional problems. Today’s parents have a lower tolerance for schools failing to deal with issues, such as bullying, that previous generations of children were sometimes expected to endure. In many places the expansion of special educational services has not kept pace with demand, leading to long waits for the evaluations that are required before children can benefit from them.
Supervising remote learning during the pandemic has helped some parents recognise that their children are trailing a long way behind their classmates, says Juliet English of Headhub, an organisation that lobbies for home educators in Britain. Others have discovered that the work schools are setting is much easier than they think their children can handle, reckons Paula Lago, an Argentine who runs a website offering advice to home educators in Latin America. Parents of the youngest schoolchildren have not enjoyed seeing them forced to learn from screens.
Wendy Charles-Warner of Education Otherwise, which supports home-schoolers in Britain, thinks a small number of the parents who have recently started home educating there have done so because they are afraid of sending their children back to class during the pandemic (after the last lockdown, British schools, unlike those in America, stopped offering a virtual-learning option when their premises reopened). But she thinks the large majority have taken the decision after seeing their children thrive at home. Eric Wearne of Kennesaw State University thinks that a lot of America’s new home-schoolers will send their children back to classrooms once the threat of infection subsides. But he thinks the experience of learning from home during the pandemic—whether parents followed a school-provided curriculum or ploughed their own furrow—will make them more willing to consider home-schooling if their children face problems at school in the future.
Other changes in the wake of covid-19 could encourage this. Job losses are creating more stay-at-home parents. Many employers will probably continue to allow their staff to work more flexibly. In America prolonged school closures have popularised strategies that home educators have long used to improve learning and spread the burden of teaching. Many home-schooling parents form co-operatives. They share the cost of, say, extra maths tuition, and their kids play together.
A lasting rise in the number of home educators will revive old worries. Reliable research into outcomes for home-schooled children is sparse. One of the better studies, based on surveys in America in 2011 and 2014, found that adults who had been home-schooled were less likely than public-school students to have completed a four-year degree. Some parents are seeking to shelter their children from concepts such as Darwinism. Regulators in Britain worry that parents are using home education as a cover to send their children to unlicensed schools with fiercely religious curriculums. Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, set up an “unregistered schools task force” in 2016. Since then it has opened investigations into 740 schools and concluded that about 100 of them were breaking the law in some way. In December its head said that the proliferation of these “unsafe and unsuitable” settings was one of her biggest concerns.
Another fear is that a wider acceptance of home-schooling will undermine efforts to improve schools. Head teachers in Britain have sometimes been accused of trying to persuade parents that they should home educate disruptive, disabled or underperforming children, whether or not that is the best option for them. This seems particularly common for children approaching important exams taken at the age of 16, the results of which are used to hold school leaders to account.
The fiercest debates relate to abuse. The death in 2011 of Dylan Seabridge, an eight-year-old who succumbed to scurvy, caused outrage in Britain. His parents had never enrolled him in school. Grim cases in America include that of Adrian Jones, a “home-schooled” seven-year-old starved and murdered by his father and stepmother in 2015, whose body was fed to pigs. Such examples usually reflect multiple failures in the systems that are supposed to keep children safe. Frequent contact with teachers provides more opportunity to spot abuse or malnutrition. Parents sometimes take their children out of school soon after discovering that authorities are worried about their welfare. A study in 2018 of six school districts in Connecticut showed that more than one-third of families who had withdrawn children from school in the previous three years had been the subject of at least one prior report for suspected child-neglect or abuse.
Many countries regulate home education strictly. It is outlawed in Germany. Inspectors check up on home educators in France. Last year Emmanuel Macron, the French president, proposed tougher rules on home education as part of a broader set of measures to combat religious extremism. In Brazil, by contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro wants to make home education easier. Alexandre Moreira, a Brazilian lawyer and home-schooling parent, thinks long school closures there have made it more likely that Congress will pass a draft bill explicitly legalising the practice.

In Britain the rules are fairly relaxed. Parents are required to ensure their children receive a full-time education “suitable” to their age, though what that should involve is undefined. In some circumstances the government can order a child back to school. But for the most part local officials who liaise with home educators have little power or time. In 2019 the government said it was thinking of requiring home educators to register with local authorities, for fear that some youngsters had become invisible to social services.
There’s no place like home
Home education is legal in all American states. In New York home educators must spend time teaching a list of mandated subjects, and their children must sit standardised tests. In some other parts of the country home-schooling parents must have basic qualifications, such as a high-school diploma. But Elizabeth Bartholet, a professor at Harvard Law School, argues that even strict-sounding regulations are poorly enforced and rife with exemptions.
As well as reviving arguments about regulation, the pandemic may fuel new debates about how much support home-schoolers should get from governments. June McDonald runs PLACE, an organisation funded by Bedford borough council in England that helps local home-schooling parents prepare their children for big national exams. It operates a library and classroom out of an old dental surgery. It also grants home-schooled children after-hours access to the art studio and science laboratories of a local state school. But such projects are rare.
Michael McShane of EdChoice, a think-tank, notes that authorities in Arizona and Florida now offer “education savings accounts” that allow some home-schooling parents—particularly those whose children have special needs—to spend public money on services such as tutoring. Rachel Coleman of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, a research and advocacy group, would like to see every American school district nominate an administrator to work with local home educators. She thinks all home-schooled children should be offered the option of attending school part-time (at present, laws in a few states forbid that). These ideas are welcomed by many home educators but resisted by a vocal portion of them, who worry that gifts from government will inevitably lead to more regulation.
Back in England Ms Clark says she and her husband plan to keep their children at home until they are old enough for secondary school. At that point, she thinks, they will be better off returning to classrooms. The job got a bit more complicated in January, when she had a new baby. But Ms Clark feels up to the task. Since nursing her child through a transplant, other challenges have seemed light. ■

1705,"Only once in its history has America handed over a nuclear submarine propulsion plant, the crown jewels of military technology, to another country. That was 63 years ago when America helped the Royal Navy to go nuclear. Now it will take that dramatic step again. A new trilateral defence pact, AUKUS, announced on September 15th, will involve far-reaching defence co-operation between America, Australia and Britain. The group’s first initiative, and its most important, will be American and British assistance to Australia in building a fleet of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. The precise form of assistance will be worked out over the next 18 months; it may involve Britain actually supplying the technology, with America’s blessing and support.
“This technology is extremely sensitive,” acknowledged an American official, speaking anonymously on September 15th. “This is, frankly, an exception to our policy in many respects...We view this as a one-off.” Nuclear-powered subs are sensitive not just because of their range, speed and stealthiness. It is also because they are powered with the same stuff—usually, uranium enriched so that it has a higher proportion of the most fissile isotope, U-235—that is used in bombs. 
The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) forbids signatories who don’t already have a bomb from making one. It also says they must put sensitive nuclear material, like enriched uranium, under international safeguards, monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a watchdog. But the rules have a submarine-shaped loophole. States are allowed to remove nuclear material from safeguards if they are for “a non-proscribed military activity”, such as submarine propulsion. No non-nuclear-armed state has ever tested that loophole—until now. 
Australia is unlikely to produce enriched uranium itself; unlike every other state which has operated a nuclear-powered sub, it has neither nuclear weapons nor any nuclear power stations. It is more likely to acquire reactor fuel from another country. Once that fuel is in a working reactor, it becomes too radioactive to use for a bomb. But depending on how AUKUS is implemented, it might still have fissile material hanging around before then.
Worse still, both America and Britain use highly enriched uranium (HEU), essentially weapons-grade, in their subs. It is possible to operate a sub with low-enriched uranium (LEU)—both France and China do so—but it has drawbacks, such as larger reactors and more frequent refuelling. 
Most non-proliferation advocates are not terribly worried about Australia building a nuke (it once sought one, but ended that pursuit in the 1970s). They are more concerned that the spread of nuclear-submarine technology and fuel for propulsion reactors sets a dangerous precedent that will be exploited by others. Countries that do want nuclear weapons, or simply want to keep the option open, might see submarines as a convenient excuse for making or acquiring bomb-usable HEU, out of sight of pesky inspectors.
Iran, whose nuclear programme is the subject of an increasingly tense dispute with the West, has toyed with the idea in the past. South Korea, which faces a North Korean nuclear threat, and where opinion polls show plurality support for building nuclear weapons, has explored nuclear subs off and on since the early 1990s. Brazil is actually building one, the Álvaro Alberto, as part of a partnership with France. “With the new AUKUS decision, we can now expect the proliferation of very sensitive military nuclear technology in the coming years, with literally tons of new nuclear materials under loose or no international safeguards,” warns Sébastien Philippe of Princeton University, writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a research group.
Others believe that these concerns are overwrought. “It would be a matter of real non-proliferation concern if we are planning to produce our own fissile material but we are not,” writes Gareth Evans, a former Australian foreign minister, “and I have no doubt that complete safeguards discipline will be maintained.” Mr Evans dismisses the possibility that the move will encourage “problematic behaviour” by others. Ian Stewart, based in Washington, DC, as director of the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, says that Australian subs could be fuelled in Britain, with that fuel placed under permanent IAEA seal and subject to periodic inspection in a way that would meet both military requirements and the demands of safeguarding. 
Even so, nuclear norms are being tested and stretched. Notably, the past 16 years have seen two revolutionary agreements that prioritised geopolitics—namely, balancing against China’s rise—over non-proliferation sensitivities. The first was America’s civil nuclear deal with India in 2005, which came only eight years after India, an NPT holdout, had tested nuclear weapons. AUKUS treads a similar path. After the cold war, much attention was paid to non-proliferation, observes David Santoro of the Pacific Forum, a think-tank. “Now power politics is back in force. Non-proliferation still matters but isn’t the sole consideration anymore”. ■",2
1706,"IN MARCH, President Joe Biden asked his spooks how the covid-19 pandemic had started. Contradicting claims made last year by Donald Trump, who said the intelligence services had shown him very strong evidence on the matter, they told him that they did not know. So on May 26th he asked them again, publicly this time, admonishing them to try harder and to report back in 90 days.
This is a direct rebuke to China’s secretive government. When experts convened by the World Health Organisation (WHO) travelled to Wuhan, the city where covid-19 was first identified, in January and February this year their hosts refused to share crucial data. A senior Biden administration official said recently that he found those efforts to “undermine serious investigations” into the pandemic’s beginnings particularly troubling, and that they left “many more questions than answers”.

At the crux of this distrust is the possibility that SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes covid-19, may have emerged accidentally from research on animal coronaviruses conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or another nearby lab. In early 2020 this idea, sometimes conflated with the idea that the virus had been developed as a biological weapon, was publicly dismissed by eminent scientists. In February 2020 a number of them used the pages of the Lancet, a medical journal, “to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that covid-19 does not have a natural origin”. Most in the media followed their line. By far the most plausible account of covid-19’s origins, they reported, was “zoonotic spillover”—that is, a virus jumping unaided from animals to humans, as is taken to have been the case for SARS, a disease caused by a different coronavirus, in 2002. Lab-leak theories were widely dismissed as conspiracy-mongering.

In the past few months, though, discussion of lab-leakery has gained currency among politicians and policy elites and in the mainstream media, as well as in influential blog posts by science reporters. This is in part because of the departures of Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state, who promoted the theory with gusto. To be able to consider the possibility without giving them succour will have made it easier for some.
But the resurgence is not a purely political phenomenon. On May 13th Science, a journal, published a letter from a group of senior scientists who had not previously weighed in on the matter arguing that “theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable”. In this they were taking the same position as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s boss, who refused to rule out the possibility of a laboratory origin after the WHO mission in January and February was stonewalled, and has since called for further inquiry.
This is not going down well in China. On May 21st, at a Global Health Summit convened by the EU and G20, Xi Jinping, China’s president, urged world leaders to “firmly reject any attempt to politicise” the covid-19 pandemic. On May 25th China’s representative at the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, said the country considered the inquiry into the origins complete and that the focus should shift to other countries, strongly suggesting that it would not accommodate further investigation.
High on the assembly’s agenda were responses to the current pandemic and the prevention of future ones. Felicity Harvey, chair of an oversight committee for the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said that new virus threats must in future be handled with more transparency, better data-sharing and an ability to give informal early warnings to the world. Earlier in May a WHO panel of experts recommended that countries be placed under a greater obligation to report new outbreaks and that the WHO’s authority to seek out and share relevant information with the world be strengthened.
It would be surprising if China (and, indeed, some other countries) were to accept all these ideas. Its leadership has consistently fought to deny international bodies the right to stick their noses into the affairs of sovereign countries, and it does not always welcome the WHO’s attentions. In 2018 it declined requests from American officials, made under WHO guidelines, for lab samples of the H7N9 strain of avian flu.

China has instead recently indicated it will reform its own public-health system. On May 13th the authorities announced a reorganisation of the national public-health bureaucracy under a new entity, the National Administration of Disease Prevention and Control. A priority in the shake-up is to improve top-down control, so that lower-level officials have more incentive to report new public-health threats up the chain of command.
Chinese authorities tried to deal with a similar issue after the SARS outbreak of the 2000s, in part to tackle the problem that national health officials were outranked by provincial authorities who had covered up the early spread of that coronavirus in southern China. They made the monitoring of new threats more systematic, raised their game with the WHO and even co-operated with America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the model for China’s own CDC—the Wuhan office of which is now being mentioned in the context of a possible laboratory origin.

There is as yet no evidence in the public domain that a laboratory leak actually took place; just evidence that the possibility is real. Mr Biden’s request suggests anything the secret world can currently add to that is pretty weak stuff. His statement says that, at present, two “elements” within the intelligence community lean towards the zoonotic explanation, one prefers the laboratory origin, and no one has high confidence in any of these assessments. Without help from China, a harder look will not necessarily change this. But it is still worth taking, even given the risk of a confrontational response which will make the enhanced transparency and co-operation talked about at the World Health Assembly unlikely to blossom any time soon. ■

1707,"ON AUGUST 29th 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in southern Louisiana. As it travelled north, it overwhelmed the levee system designed to protect New Orleans. By August 30th, 80% of the city was underwater. More than 1,800 people died in what became the costliest natural disaster in American history. The Army Corps of Engineers, which designed the old network of floodwalls, called it “a system in name only”.
Precisely 16 years later, another fearsome storm, Hurricane Ida, gathered strength in the Gulf of Mexico’s warm waters. The quickly-formed storm cohered south of Cuba and had hardly acquired a name before she was threatening Louisiana’s coastline. A huge patch of unusually warm water provided fuel for Ida to intensify into a category-four storm (the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale goes from one to five, with anything above three considered “major”; after making landfall Ida was  downgraded to a tropical storm). Many feared that history was about to repeat itself. The preliminary good news is that it did not: the improved levee system built after Katrina to protect New Orleans and its environs, just nearing completion, appears to have held. But there was plenty of bad news, too.

Louisiana has more covid cases per 100,000 people than almost any other state. Its hospitals are jammed almost to capacity, making it all but impossible to move patients from the southern part of the state to other facilities farther inland. Consequently, hospitals directly in Ida’s path were not evacuated, though dozens of nursing homes were. At the time of writing, the consequences of those grim choices—moving older, vulnerable people around, and leaving the hospitalised in place—remain unclear. But the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported that hours into the storm, in Thibodaux, near to where Ida made landfall, one hospital’s intensive-care unit lost generator power, forcing doctors to manually ventilate patients as they were moved around within the building.

The hospital was not alone: the hardest hit parts of the city of New Orleans could be without power for weeks. In Kenner, a large suburb, officials told residents that they could be without water for five days and power for three weeks. The city’s sewer board warned, meanwhile, that the outage could affect a “very significant” number of its 84 pumping stations.
The worst impact may be felt by those outside of the levee system. New Orleans is flanked by vulnerable coastal communities already in danger of being wiped off the map by rising sea levels, and Ida looks to be hastening that job. The most endangered areas include Grand Isle, a popular barrier island two hours south of New Orleans, and Isle de Jean Charles, an eroding islet in Terrebonne Parish that has long been occupied by Native Americans. LaPlace, west of New Orleans along the Mississippi river, was swamped by floodwaters; rescue crews tried through the night to reach stranded residents. The most severely hit place may be Port Fourchon, near Grand Isle, where most ships that supply the Gulf of Mexico’s productive oil platforms and rigs dock.
Storms have long battered Louisiana, but climate change is likely to be making things worse. That is not because storms are growing more frequent. Whether climate change increases the frequency, as opposed to the intensity, of storms is not clear. At least one database of hurricanes that have affected America since 1900 shows no long-term increase in the frequency of storms that have made landfall. Some models suggest that the number of hurricanes in the north Atlantic could even decrease between now and the end of the century. That is less reassuring than it sounds.
Hurricanes draw their energy from heat in the oceans beneath them. Most of the heat gained by the planet as a result of climate change is stored in the oceans; it stands to reason that tropical cyclones (which are called hurricanes in the Atlantic ocean and typhoons in the Pacific) should become more intense as the climate warms. Data bear this out: the latest review carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deemed it “likely” that the share of storms classed between categories three and five has increased over the past 40 years. This trend is projected to increase as the planet warms.
That may prove particularly difficult for southern Louisiana. The earthen levees that protect New Orleans deprive the surrounding wetlands of necessary sediment. And man-made canals from a century of oil and gas exploration have made what remains of the coast even more vulnerable. Ida may not have been as destructive as Katrina was 16 years ago, but it is nonetheless a harbinger of a grim future.",2
1708,"IT IS STANDARD practice for the party that wins the White House to lose the Virginia governor’s race the following year. But it is rare for the margin of victory to swing by 13 percentage points. Republicans accomplished that feat in Virginia on Tuesday night when Glenn Youngkin, a businessman and political newcomer, beat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, gathering roughly 51% of the vote to Mr McAuliffe’s 48%. It was the first time Republicans have won the state’s governorship since 2009.
A number of factors led Virginia’s voters to Mr Youngkin, a former chief executive of the Carlyle Group, a private-equity firm. The most obvious was the Democrats’ unpopularity nationally. Joe Biden’s job approval at this stage in his presidency is worse than that of any of his predecessors save Donald Trump. According to The Economist’s polling with YouGov, the share of Americans who disapprove of Mr Biden is six percentage points higher than the share who approve of him: a net rating of minus six.

Mr Biden, and by proxy Mr McAuliffe, is especially unpopular among political independents, who vote in droves in the suburban and exurban counties of Virginia that ring Washington, DC. Though blue overall, these counties—particularly Loudoun and Fairfax, home to Mr Youngkin—swung hardest against the Democrats.
Our analysis of precinct-level returns from the governor’s race suggests the Democrats lost roughly five points of vote share where they are traditionally strongest, and about the same amount where Republicans tend to dominate. But the Democrats lost nearly ten points in the marginal counties that decide Virginia elections. There, many voters switched from backing Mr Biden last November to supporting Mr Youngkin.
Low turnout hurt Mr McAuliffe, too. Relative to the last election, the number of votes cast this year was lowest in the most Democratic counties. In the reddest areas of the state, turnout was about 60% of the level it was a year ago, whereas in the bluest places it struggled to hit 50%. This suggests Mr Youngkin’s victory came not only because he won over a surprising number of soft Democrats and independents, but also because the Democratic base did not show up.
Mr McAuliffe clearly knew of his troubles within his party weeks ago, and his campaign tried desperately to energise the dawdlers. His last-minute statewide Get Out The Vote tour featured appearances by Mr Biden, Barack Obama and the Dave Matthews Band, an inexplicably popular soft-rock outfit from Charlottesville—home to the University of Virginia, in the centre of the state.
Each candidate’s approach relied on elements of his party’s national message. Mr McAuliffe tried to yoke Mr Youngkin to Donald Trump, while Mr Youngkin warned Virginia parents that his opponent would indoctrinate their children with leftist dogma about race and gender. In the end it is hard to say exactly what mattered the most. Precinct-level results reveal only so much about how people felt about the candidates. One exit poll from CNN showed 51% of voters thought parents should have “a lot” of say over what is taught in schools, and of those voters 76% favoured Mr Youngkin. But 50% also thought the economy was going poorly, and nearly the same proportion of those voters went for Mr Youngkin.
The Virginia result is likely to confirm Republicans in their dismal conviction that waging culture war is the way to win. For their part, Democrats now confront urgent questions about how to increase turnout among their supporters in the cities and persuade independents and soft partisans in less dense areas. Those demographic trends tend not to change quickly, and may be harbingers of losses for the Democrats in the mid-term elections next year.",2
1709," (CNN)Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who killed two people and shot another during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was acquitted Friday of first-degree intentional homicide and four other felony charges. Rittenhouse, wearing a dark jacket with a burgundy tie and shirt, stood behind the defense table as each not guilty verdict was read. He tried to hold back tears, then sobbed and appeared to collapse forward on the table, where his attorney embraced him. In a video promoting a Tucker Carlson Originals special on the case, Rittenhouse tells someone as he is apparently driven away from the courthouse: ""The jury reached the correct verdict. Self-defense is not illegal. And I believe they came to the correct verdict and I'm glad that everything went well. ""It's been a rough journey, but we made it through it. We made it through the hard part.""Carlson's crew has been embedded with the teen throughout the trial and the Fox News host will interview Rittenhouse on his Monday show. The documentary will air in December on the Fox Nation streaming service, Fox News said.Rittenhouse's mother gasped after the final verdict was read, her head falling into her hands. The panel of five men and seven women deliberated more than 25 hours over the past four days in a closely-watched case that polarized an already divided nation. The verdict cannot be appealed.These are the five charges the jury consideredGov. Tony Evers, in a statement, called for peace on the streets and said the trial has ""reopened wounds that have not yet fully healed.""During their deliberations, jurors requested to rewatch much of the video evidence of the shootings. In the end, they agreed with Rittenhouse's testimony that he feared for his life and acted in self-defense. Verdict sheets filed with the Kenosha County Clerk of the Circuit Court showed the presiding juror in the case signed the not guilty verdicts to the five charges on different dates. Three verdict sheets were dated Wednesday and Thursday.  The most severe charge Rittenhouse faced was a first-degree intentional homicide charge for the fatal shooting of Anthony Huber: count 4. Juror 54 signed the verdict sheet for that count Wednesday.The two sheets signed Friday involved the fatal shooting of Joseph Rosenbaum and the charge of reckless endangerment of a man who was near Rittenhouse during the shooting.Judge praises jurySince the shootings on August 25, 2020, the case pitted Americans who saw Rittenhouse as an armed teen vigilante against those who viewed him as a citizen taking up arms to protect businesses from looters and rioters.The judge praised the jurors, saying he ""couldn't have asked for a better jury."" Some jurors appeared fatigued as the verdicts were read -- their hands on their chins or rubbing their eyes, according to a pool reporter. Others seemed ill-at-ease, arms folded across their chests. Things we've learned from the trial that challenge assumptions about the caseWhat's next for RittenhouseRittenhouse attorney Mark Richards said outside court that his client was on his way home and ""wants to get on with his life."" ""He has a huge sense of relief,"" Richards told reporters. ""He wishes none of this would have ever happened. But, as he said when he testified, he did not start this and we're thankful in more ways than one that the jury finally got to hear the true story.""Richards said the decision to put Rittenhouse on the stand ""wasn't a close call."" ""In Wisconsin, if you don't put a client on the stand, you're going to lose. Period,"" Richards added. The attorney said Rittenhouse has had 24-hour security and does not expect to continue to live in the area.""I think eventually some anonymity will come,"" Richards said. David Hancock, a spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, told CNN affiliate WBBM the ""goal is to ensure Kyle's safety as he moves on as an 18-year-old young man in college studying to be a nurse.""Here's what we know about the three men Rittenhouse shotProsecutor 'disappointed' with verdict After the verdict, lead prosecutor Thomas Binger told the court, ""The jury has represented our community in this trial and has spoken.""Binger, in a statement, said, ""While we are disappointed with the verdict, it must be respected... We ask that members of our community continue to express their opinions and feelings about this verdict in a civil and peaceful manner.""Huber's family said in a statement ""there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son."" ""It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,"" the statement said of the verdict.""We hope that decent people will join us in forcefully rejecting that message and demanding more of our laws, our officials, and our justice system.""Huber's girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, was not surprised by the verdict. ""We know that this system is a failure,"" she said.Rosenbaum's fiancée, Kariann Swart, said, ""In this case, the victims' lives don't matter.""Kimberley Motley and Milo Schwab, attorneys for Gaige Grosskreutz and Rosenbaum's estate, said they will continue to seek justice.""While today's verdict may mean justice delayed, it will not mean justice denied,"" they said in a statement. ""We are committed to uncovering the truth of that night and holding those responsible to account.""Prosecution faced uphill battle  The high-profile verdict generated mixed reactions, from the White House to the streets of Wisconsin. President Joe Biden, in a statement, said the verdict ""will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included"" but added people ""must acknowledge that the jury has spoken."" On a cold, sunny afternoon, mostly peaceful crowds gathered outside the courthouse. Protests were planned in several US cities Friday and Saturday, according to social media posts.  ""We want the nation to know the nation that you live in now isn't the ... United States that we used to live in,"" said Justin Blake, uncle of Jacob Blake, whose shooting by police last summer sparked the protests where Rittenhouse showed up with his gun. The prosecution faced an uphill challenge from the start because Wisconsin law requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Rittenhouse did not act in self-defense. But there are limits to a self-defense claim. ""The defendant may intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if the defendant reasonably believed that the force used was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself,"" the jury instructions explain.One of the videos the jury asked to rewatch -- a drone video showing Rittenhouse shooting Rosenbaum -- was at the heart of a defense request for a mistrial in the case.The deliberations came after a two-week trial highlighted by emotional and compelling testimony from Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old at the center of debates around self-defense, gun ownership and Black Lives Matter demonstrations. On the stand, he told jurors -- and the viewing public -- he acted in self-defense.""I didn't do anything wrong. I defended myself,"" he testified.Rittenhouse was charged with five felonies: first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety. Jurors also considered lesser offenses for two of the five counts. If convicted on the most serious charge, Rittenhouse faced a mandatory sentence of life in prison.Schroeder dismissed a misdemeanor weapons possession charge and a non-criminal curfew violation prior to deliberations.The charges stem from the chaotic unrest last year in the wake of the Kenosha police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man. After instances of rioting and fiery destruction, Rittenhouse, 17 at the time, took a medical kit and an AR-15-style rifle and joined up with a group of other armed people in Kenosha on August 25. There, Rittenhouse fatally shot Rosenbaum -- who was chasing the teenager and threw a bag at him -- and then tried to flee. A crowd of people pursued the teenager, and Rittenhouse shot at an unidentified man who kicked him; fatally shot Huber, who had hit him with a skateboard; and wounded Grosskreutz, who was armed with a pistol. What happened in the trialProsecutors called 22 witnesses over the course of six days as they sought to show Rittenhouse acted recklessly that night and provoked Rosenbaum by pointing the rifle at him, setting off the ensuing series of events.""That is what provokes this entire incident,"" Binger said in closing arguments. ""When the defendant provokes this incident, he loses the right to self-defense. You cannot claim self-defense against a danger you create.""The prosecution portrayed the three other people who confronted the teen as ""heroes"" trying to stop what they believed to be an active shooting. Binger also questioned the teenager's decision to take a gun into the city in the first place, calling him a ""chaos tourist.""On the stand, Rittenhouse testified he was defending himself when he shot four times at Rosenbaum, who he said had threatened him earlier, chased him, thrown a bag at him and lunged for his gun. Rittenhouse also referred to the three other people he shot at as part of a ""mob"" chasing him.He became emotional and broke down into tears during his testimony as he began to recount the initial shooting, leading to a break in the case. In closing arguments, defense attorney Richards said Rittenhouse feared for his life when he opened fire.""Every person who was shot was attacking Kyle. One with a skateboard, one with his hands, and one with his feet, one with a gun,"" Richards said. ""Hands and feet can cause great bodily harm.""The trial featured more than a dozen videos from the night that showed what happened before, during and after the shootings. Most of the facts of what happened that night were not up for debate -- rather, at the heart of the trial was the analysis of Rittenhouse's actions and whether they can be considered ""reasonable.""",0
1710,"LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Five members of the U.S. House Judiciary committee wrote to Amazon.com Inc's chief executive Sunday, and accused the company's top executives, including founder Jeff Bezos, of either misleading Congress or possibly lying to it about Amazon's business practices.
The letter also states that the committee is considering  ""whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate.""
Addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, the letter followed a Reuters investigation last week that showed that the company had conducted a systematic campaign of copying products and rigging search results in India to boost sales of its own brands - practices Amazon has denied engaging in. Jassy, a longtime Amazon executive, succeeded Bezos in July.
The letter states that ""credible reporting"" in the Reuters story and recent articles in several other news outlets ""directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon's top executives – including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos.""
""At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon's representatives misled the Committee. At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law,"" the letter states.
In response, an Amazon spokesperson issued a statement that said: ""Amazon and its executives did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question.""
It added: ""As we have previously stated, we have an internal policy, which goes beyond that of any other retailer's policy that we're aware of, that prohibits the use of individual seller data to develop Amazon private label products. We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action.""
Since 2019, the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating competition in digital markets, including how Amazon uses proprietary seller data from its platform, and whether the company unfairly favors its own products.
In sworn testimony before the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee last year, Bezos said the company prohibits its employees from using data on individual sellers to benefit its own private-label product lines. In another hearing in 2019, Nate Sutton, Amazon's associate general counsel, testified that the company does not use such data to create its own branded products or alter its search results to benefit them.
Asked during the 2019 congressional hearing whether Amazon alters algorithms to direct consumers to its own goods, Sutton replied: ""The algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy regardless of the seller.""
The lawmakers' letter gives Jassy ""a final opportunity"" to provide evidence to corroborate the company's prior testimony and statements. It also notes that ""it is criminally illegal to knowingly and willfully make statements that are materially false, conceal a material fact, or otherwise provide false documentation in response to a congressional investigation.""
It gives the CEO until Nov. 1 to provide a sworn response to clarify ""how Amazon uses non-public individual seller data to develop and market its own line of products"" and how Amazon's search rankings favor those products.
It also requests copies of all documents mentioned in the Oct. 13 Reuters investigation.
""We strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity to correct the record and provide the Committee with sworn, truthful, and accurate responses to this request as we consider whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate,"" the letter states.
The Reuters probe was based on thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents – including emails, strategy papers and business plans. They showed that, at least in India, Amazon had a formal, clandestine policy of manipulating search results to favor Amazon's own products, as well as copying other sellers' goods – and that at least two senior company executives had reviewed it.
In response to the Reuters report, Amazon said, ""We believe these claims are factually incorrect and unsubstantiated."" The company did not elaborate. The company said the way it displays search results doesn't favor private-brand products.
The lawmakers' letter also cites other recent stories in the Markup, the Wall Street Journal and the Capitol Forum about Amazon's private-brand products and use of seller data.
The letter's sharp wording ratchets up the rhetoric between Washington and Big Tech. Companies including Amazon, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google have been under growing scrutiny in Washington, Europe and other parts of the world, fueled by concerns among regulators, lawmakers and consumer groups that the firms have too much power and are engaging in unfair practices that hurt other businesses.
The lawmakers' letter was signed by a bipartisan group, and included the judiciary committee's chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler, and four members of the antitrust subcommittee – its chair, Democrat David Cicilline, vice chair Pramila Jayapal and Republicans Ken Buck and Matt Gaetz.
On Wednesday, following publication of the Reuters investigation, U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent critic of Amazon, called for breaking up the company. In India, a group representing millions of brick-and-mortar retailers urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to take action against Amazon.",3
1711,"SINCE APRIL 28TH protesters have defied an 8pm curfew, and the risk of catching covid-19, to take to the streets of Bogotá, Colombia’s capital. They have burned buses and police stations and looted banks and shops. Protesters also blocked all the main roads leading to Cali, the country’s third-largest city, for several days, resulting in empty shelves in grocery shops and a shortage of medicine in hospitals. At least 24 people died and more than 800 civilians and police officers have been injured. On May 1st Iván Duque, the president, sent in the army to quell the violence.
The protests were triggered by a tax-reform bill the government sent to Congress on April 15th. On May 2nd Mr Duque withdrew the unpopular bill. The next day the finance minister, Alberto Carrasquilla, resigned. But resentment against the president, whose approval rating is 33%, means that the unrest is likely to continue.


Mr Duque’s reform was sorely needed. Because of the pandemic, Colombia’s deficit has tripled to nearly 8% of GDP. The reform would have removed many VAT exemptions and lowered the threshold for starting to pay income tax. (Income-tax revenues in Colombia are among the lowest as a share of GDP in the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries.) Pensions would have been taxed, too. Spending on social programmes would have increased, potentially benefiting 19m people. Mr Carrasquilla claims the bill could have reduced the share of Colombians who are extremely poor (earning less than 145,000 pesos a month, or $38) by six percentage points.
Most Colombians, however, saw it as unfair. One of the longest lockdowns in the world has emptied wallets and sapped morale. Last year 2.8m people fell into extreme poverty. More than 500,000 businesses have closed. Even though the tax increases would hit the wealthiest hardest, 80% of people, when surveyed, opposed the bill.
The bill was not the protesters’ only grievance. Colombians are frustrated, particularly with Mr Duque. The president promised to make the country safer. But violence is getting worse. Colombia is exporting record amounts of cocaine and illegal armed groups are growing stronger. Since 2016, the year a peace deal was signed with the FARC, the country’s biggest rebel army, other armed groups have driven a growing number of rural people from their homes and murdered hundreds of local leaders. Colombians also blame the government for mishandling the pandemic.
Indeed after Mr Duque withdrew the reform, the protests became far more violent. The government has been chided for its excessive use of force. An armoured vehicle was filmed in Bogotá firing live ammunition in a residential neighbourhood. The ombudsman is investigating the disappearance of around 40 people.
On May 4th Mr Duque said he would set up a “forum for national dialogue”, where the government will meet protesters and other civil groups. As The Economist went to press, it seemed that some of the protesters would meet with the government on May 10th. But as their list of demands has grown longer—to include withdrawing a health-reform bill, introducing a guaranteed minimum income and an end to the forced eradication of coca crops, among other grievances—so too has the likelihood that they will not leave the streets.
All this will make Mr Duque weaker. Unlike his predecessors, he does not have a stable majority coalition in Congress. Even his mentor, Álvaro Uribe, a former president, has distanced himself from Mr Duque; he was one of the first to speak out against the bill.
Gustavo Petro, a left-winger, is gaining momentum in the polls. He lost against Mr Duque in the presidential elections of 2018, but is planning to run again next year. He has proposed that the central bank print more money to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, and has praised the late Hugo Chávez, the despotic socialist who set Venezuela on the path to ruin. Instead of a bold tax reform, Mr Duque’s legacy may instead turn out to be ensuring that Colombia gets its first socialist president. ■

1712,"STARING GLUMLY at his paddy field in the depths of rural Sri Lanka, B. R. Weeraratne sighs. The regular incursions of greedy elephants have been bad enough. But the government’s outright ban on agrochemicals will, he fears, slash his yields of nadu and samba, two of the most popular varieties of rice. Though the 56-year-old likes the idea of organic farming in principle, he thinks “the soil, the plants and the farmers all need time to learn it.” It should be phased in. Otherwise farmers like him may be flung into destitution.
But Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka’s president, is adamant. The former army officer was elected in 2019 largely on his reputation for ruthless dynamism. In 2009, as secretary of defence under his brother Mahinda, then the president, he brutally ended a long civil war against Tamil rebels. As urban-development secretary he “beautified” cities by kicking thousands of people out of slums. As president he has taken a military approach to tackling covid-19 by bringing in the army alongside medical staff. More than 70% of over-11s have been double-jabbed.

Mr Rajapaksa’s military approach to turning Sri Lanka into the world’s first fully organic producer of food overnight looks less encouraging. For sure, his manifesto (“Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”) did promise a revolution in fertiliser use. But it was to have taken ten years. So it was a shock to Mr Weeraratne when a total ban was announced earlier this year. No more agrochemical imports are to be allowed after stocks run out. The Planters’ Association predicts a drop in tea production and export revenue by around 25% in the next six months and thereafter by nearly a half. Sri Lanka is the world’s fourth-largest grower of tea, exporting $1.24bn of the stuff last year, or 1.5% of GDP.
More than 90% of Sri Lanka’s farmers use chemical fertiliser and 85% of them expect crop losses in the coming season, according to Verité Research, a local think-tank; nearly two-thirds broadly back Mr Rajapaksa’s policy but 80% of those say they need at least a year to adjust.
Meanwhile people still need to eat. Inflation is hovering near 6% and food prices are up more than 11%. Rising global commodity prices, declining foreign reserves and ceilings on domestic retail prices have been causing shortages of essentials such as sugar and milk powder. On August 31st the president declared a state of emergency and appointed an army officer to regulate the market, among other things by confiscating stockpiles.
As foodstuffs began to run out, on September 29th he lifted the ceiling on the price of rice, which promptly jumped 17-32%, depending on the variety. Price controls on milk powder, sugar, wheat flour and domestic cooking gas were lifted on October 8th. The government has also, at last, allowed some more imports. Yet its preferred solution for shrinking a trade deficit that has grown to 42% of GDP has been to curb imports, such as fertiliser.
Foreign reserves, at just $2.6bn or enough for six weeks of imports, are shrinking. Between now and July the government must pay $7bn to service its foreign debts. With short-term liabilities so far outweighing reserves, notes Deshal de Mel, an economist at Verité, and Sri Lanka’s credit rating cut to junk by the main agencies, borrowing in global capital markets is all but impossible. Basil Rajapaksa, the finance minister (another brother of the president), admits the situation is bleak. Covid, he says, has contributed to a loss of $8.6bn in revenue. Earnings from tourism, usually $3bn-4bn a year, have collapsed. Remittances from Sri Lankans abroad have fallen 35% compared with a year ago.
Most independent economists reckon that an IMF-backed restructuring programme is the least bad way out. But the government would find it hard to accept conditions that undermine the country’s much-vaunted sovereignty—and above all would squeeze voters such as Mr Weeraratne, who are already disenchanted. Like the country’s crops, the Rajapaksas are, to put it mildly, in need of a pick-me-up.■",2
1713,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. To see them visit our hub
WHEN AMERICA has a shock, African-Americans suffer first and most. After the financial crisis, black unemployment soared to 20%. The meagre progress to narrow the wealth gap over the previous 50 years was erased. When covid-19 struck, African-Americans died at twice the rate of Asian-Americans. The causes are a mix of history, culture and policy. Even if racism were to vanish, African-Americans would be worst hit by future disasters.
Attempts to fix persistent disadvantage can be caught by debate over whether the remedies should be race-neutral. The Obama administration pursued policies that were race-neutral but especially benefited African-Americans. To many activists this pragmatism seemed cowardly, though calls for more boldness did not seem so bright when Donald Trump won the 2016 election. Yet the Trump administration showed the value of race-neutral policies. A tight labour market and big government spending as part of the first covid-19 stimulus lifted some 10m Americans out of poverty between June 2019 and June 2020, despite much of the economy being partially closed. Though Mr Trump was never accused of fretting about urban poverty, this helped African-Americans disproportionately, because they are disproportionately poor.

Likewise, the Biden administration’s expansion of a child tax credit in its first covid-19 stimulus seems race-neutral. But it could cut child poverty among African-Americans by two-thirds, because there are so many poor black children. Before he was assassinated Martin Luther King hoped to transform the civil-rights movement into a campaign to reduce poverty. He said, “It is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself up by his own bootstraps.” A tight labour market provides a lot of boots, which is why activists follow the Federal Reserve closely.
Alongside measures to reduce poverty, something more targeted is needed. The best chance of slowing the inheritance of disadvantage from one generation to the next is for people to move out of neighbourhoods where poverty and violence are endemic. For classical liberals, this poses a philosophical and political dilemma. Liberals favour policies that maximise individual choices, but such choices often result in more segregated schools and districts. Attempts to remedy this by building public housing in better neighbourhoods, or busing black children to better schools, have set off a backlash among white Americans. In America’s federal system they also retain disproportionate power, thanks to rural bias in the Senate and the electoral college.
What if people in areas of concentrated, multi-generational poverty were helped to move out? That happened in the 1970s when Chicago was sued for building public housing in black neighbourhoods. The city had to put more public housing in white areas, creating a natural experiment 20 years later. Among families who stayed put, 20% of children dropped out of high school and 21% went to college. Among those helped to move to a better area, 5% dropped out of high school and 54% had been to college.

The Clinton administration seized on this for housing schemes in Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles and New York as part of a project called Moving to Opportunity. When Raj Chetty, then of Stanford, and Nathaniel Hendren and Larry Katz of Harvard, looked at the results in 2016 they found that, by their mid-20s, those who moved as children had incomes 30% higher than those who stayed. This policy has since been tried in Seattle, with promising outcomes. The cost comes in the form of a couple of thousand dollars a year of higher rent, at public expense, and $2,500 in assistance with the moves.
That is a lot of money, but Americans could pay for 6m such moves a year merely by giving up tax relief on the interest they pay on their mortgages. “There is this idea that we need ten times the Marshall Plan for everything, but these interventions are quite cheap,” says Stephanie DeLuca of Johns Hopkins University, who worked on the Seattle experiment. Allowing apartments to be built in neighbourhoods zoned for single-family houses, making them more affordable for poorer families, costs nothing.
A widespread acknowledgment of racism has created an expectation that the country will move forward. But since Americans have wrestled for more than 200 years with the effects of their government’s colour line, scepticism about the likelihood of progress is justified. America has been here before, in the middle of the 20th century, when most people assumed that the end of legal inequality between white and black Americans would be followed by a reduction in the economic sort. When such hopes are not met, they can soon curdle into pessimism and violent protest.
Moving forward
Part of the reaction to George Floyd’s death can be explained by the shock of white Americans, more politically conscious after the first black president, finding that police were still killing so many unarmed black men. Yet disbelief will not accomplish much on its own. Reducing poverty, restraining police forces and chipping away at residential segregation could. And the chances of its happening will rise if, rather than making politics about all the ways that people with different skin tones compete with each other, politicians, activists, academics and students emphasised what Americans have in common. That does not mean erasing race. As Ralph Ellison wrote, “whatever else the true American is, he is also somehow black.” But it does mean keeping a focus on poverty.
This is not just a matter of idealism. For a multiracial democracy like America, the instinct of groups to favour themselves can be destabilising. There is a well-established correlation between how homogenous a nation is in racial or ethnic terms and how much its citizens trust each other. America has grown more diverse since the 1960s, when immigration laws that explicitly favoured white Europeans were scrapped. Over the same period, Americans’ trust in one another has declined. These two developments seem likely to be related.
Breaking the link, and narrowing racial disparities, is a task for the next 30 years. In his book “The Omni-Americans”, Albert Murray wrote “American culture, even in its most rigidly segregated precincts, is patently and irrevocably composite…the so-called black and so-called white people of the United States resemble nobody else in the world so much as they resemble each other.” This is not a bad slogan for anti-racists to adopt.■

1714,"“MAN, NIGERIA has been a ride,” laughs Mawuli Gavor, a 32-year-old star in Nollywood, Nigeria’s booming film business. Mr Gavor does not fit the stereotype of an African migrant, struggling to cross the Mediterranean in a leaky boat. Born and raised in Ghana, he was working as an accountant when an admirer suggested he try for a modelling job. Soon, he was in Nigeria, making a fortune in films.
Many Africans are taking similar journeys, though most are less glamorous. In a market in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, Ibrahim Bary, a 25-year-old from Guinea, sells cows’ livers hanging from hooks. Work is easier to find in Senegal than back home.He makes around $4.50 a day and plans to send four days’ pay home to his family in Guinea this month. He previously worked as a taxi driver in Ivory Coast. “I will stay a while, earn some money, and then go home,” he says.

In the decade to 2020 the number of sub-Saharans living abroad jumped from about 20m to 28m. This causes conniptions in Europe, where many voters fear a flood of immigrants. Europe is indeed attractive to Africans. Average incomes are 11 times higher and, though African migrants often do menial jobs, they earn on average three times what they did back home.

But it has become very hard for Africans to move to Europe unless they have rare skills, such as treating sick people or scoring goals (though ageing Europe will soon be short of ordinary workers, too). New permits for sub-Saharan Africans to work there plummeted from 33,000 in 2008 to about half that number in 2018. European governments have lavished cash on border controls and done deals with north African countries to stop migrant boats from setting sail. They sometimes do this brutally. Arrivals have plummeted (see chart 1). A migrant who heads for Europe without permission must pay a fat sum to smugglers and faces a high risk of failure or even death.
Sub-Saharans with get-up-and-go have long been migrating closer to home. Only 18% of those living abroad are in Europe. About 70% are in other African countries (see map). Between 2010 and 2020 the UN says the number of sub-Saharan migrants within Africa rose by more than 40% to 19m (a figure many experts call an underestimate). The Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University analysed a survey by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) of 88,000 people on popular migration routes in west Africa. It found 90% planned to stay in Africa.

Africans are likely to become more mobile. Today, the continent has fewer migrants as a share of population (2%) than the world average (3.5%). Moving costs money: a migrant needs enough to cover at least a bus fare and a few nights’ accommodation while looking for a job. Many Africans cannot yet afford that, but one day they will be able to. Global research suggests that as poor countries grow richer, more of their people tend to emigrate, until average incomes reach around $10,000 a year. Income per head in sub-Saharan Africa is currently $3,800, so there is a lot of room for growth.
The population is increasing, too, at 2.7% per year, more than double the speed in South Asia. More people need not mean a higher rate of migration, but it obviously increases the absolute number of potential migrants. Estimates vary a lot, but there could be twice as many Africans by 2050, and many will be young men, the group most likely to move.
Climate change has not yet spurred large population movements, but it may do so. Large swathes of Africa will become harder to live in. A study in Burkina Faso finds that, because droughts make people poorer, they can reduce cross-border migration. Still, the World Bank says that by 2050 over 50m people in sub-Saharan Africa might move within their own countries because of climate. The authors do not focus on international migration but note that many parts of sub-Saharan Africa that are expected to be climate-migration hotspots are close to borders.
Some Africans are forced to flee their homes. There are 6m refugees on the continent who have crossed a border (and 18.5m displaced within their own countries). However, in most countries migrants are motivated largely by a desire to make a better living. Less than 1% of those in the Stanford analysis said conflict was their main reason for moving.
Migration presents an opportunity for Africa. Migrants’ skills and hard work boost productivity. The taxes they pay fund public services. They send billions home in remittances. And when they return, as many do, they bring back new ideas and valuable contacts. The question for African governments is whether they will make it easier for Africans to move around, or throw up more barriers. There are some signs that they are choosing the former.
Standing at the crossroads
African governments can co-operate, as they showed with a continent-wide free-trade agreement that became operational this year. The African Union, a body that is much looser than the European Union but has ambitions to promote more integration, has put forward a protocol that would allow free movement across Africa. So far, however, few governments have ratified it.
Some still see migrants as a problem (much as European governments do). Barriers to movement are still high. Border guards often hassle migrants, delay them and demand pay-offs. Qualifications from one African country are often not recognised in others, leaving nurses selling fruit in markets. Few states consider migrants in their urban planning. And sending money home is absurdly expensive: to transfer $200 costs about $16, more than in any other region.
Nonetheless, there are reasons to think some of these barriers will fall. Africa has a long history of mobility. Before colonisation, nomads crossed what are now international borders, trade caravans strode the Sahara, and many Africans migrated during the dry season before returning with the rains.When colonies became independent, some of their leaders, such as Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, pushed a pan-Africanist vision of a borderless continent. His ideals were neither universally shared nor consistently upheld by Nkrumah himself. In 1957 his government passed a deportation act and expelled Nigerians who were helping the Ghanaian opposition. Between 1958 and 1996 there were 23 mass expulsions of migrants by 16 African countries.
Still, the pan-African ideal helped create the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a group of former British, French and Portuguese colonies. In 1979 the bloc came to an agreement on visa-free movement and promised that, within 15 years, all its citizens would have the right to work and start a business in any member state. That right still exists, at least on paper. Mr Bary, the Guinean butcher in Senegal, did not need a visa. He just went. It has made “a huge difference”, agrees Mr Gavor, the film star. “If we had more of these unions that actually worked, just imagine the things we could do.”
The right to visa-free travel is mostly respected in all 15 ECOWAS states, but the right to do business is not. “Almost all member states are in violation,” says Franz Celestin of the IOM. Some states still try to reserve industries for locals.
Other regional blocs also allow a measure of free movement. The six countries of the East African Community (EAC) mostly offer visa-free entry to each other’s citizens. Half have eliminated fees for work permits, too. Regional blocs in southern and central Africa are trying to follow suit, but are further behind.
In South Africa many politicians are quick to blame migrants for problems at home. In 2019 mobs of armed men looted and torched shops owned by migrants. At least 18 foreigners were killed, says Human Rights Watch, an NGO.“There is xenophobia every day in South Africa,” says Timothy Sangweeni (not his real name), a Zimbabwean who moved in 2008. At police stations and clinics if “officials hear your voice and see your skin colour they are rude and unhelpful and tell you that you don’t belong,” he says. But, he concedes, “You are allowed to access services.”He first came without papers, but now has a permit, lives in a better neighbourhood, and is married to a South African.
Others are fed up. Aganze Bulonza, a waiter in KwaZulu-Natal, says he wants to go back to Congo. “Even though it is not stable, it’s better than being in a place where you are not wanted.”
An old gripe
The complaint that immigrants take jobs from locals, or drag down wages, is especially loud in South Africa, where wages are high by African standards and unemployment is rife. Yet the evidence is mixed. Migrants sometimes compete with locals for jobs, but they also spend money, which creates other jobs. Costanza Biavaschi of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and co-authors find that, at the local level, male migration reduces employment for native South Africans, but not their income (at the national level, it has a negative effect on South Africans’ total income, but not on employment rates). But a World Bank study, which includes female workers, finds that at the provincial level immigration increases both native employment and wages. And the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, finds new immigrants boost employment and wages of South Africans at the regional level.
In most measurable ways, migration benefits locals. In Africa, it increases manufacturing in both sending and receiving countries, finds the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It reckons that a 1% increase in the number of migrants to a country is associated with a 0.2-0.4% increase in manufacturing output, possibly because they bring skills and ideas. The better educated the migrants, the bigger the impact.
In Ivory Coast migrants contribute about 19% of GDP despite only being 10% of the population. Migrants are more productive than natives because they are more likely to be of working age. And they often bring complementary skills. Some are hired to fill niches; some move to places where their skills are in demand.
Many also have contacts with their home countries that boost trade.Since 2014, Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda have allowed movement across their borders with just an identity card. Within two years this had increased cross-border trade by 50%, says the Rwanda Development Board, a state agency. Free movement is “essential” for Africa’s new free-trade agreement to succeed, says Paul Akiwumi of UNCTAD.
In Rwanda migrants pay on average three times more tax than locals. An OECD study of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Rwanda and South Africa found that migrants contribute much more in taxes than the cost of the extra public services they use.
The biggest winners from migration are migrants themselves. If they did not think moving would make them better off, they would not go. For obvious reasons, they are more likely to want to move to countries where they can earn more, such as South Africa. Wages there are five times higher than in Zimbabwe or Mozambique, which is one reason why 700,000 Zimbabweans and 350,000 Mozambicans live there. Some 1.4m migrants from Burkina Faso are in Ivory Coast, where income per head ($5,500) is twice as high.
Cosme, a 37-year-old chef in Lagos, had been looking for work for three years in Benin before coming to Nigeria. He found a job in a restaurant in a posh part of town. In Benin “there are no job opportunities like that,” he explains. Today he laments Nigeria’s high inflation but still advises friends to come. He now has a small nest-egg and sends $120 a month to his family.
Such remittances are vital. The World Bank estimates that in 2019 almost $50bn flowed into sub-Saharan Africa, easily topping the $31bn of foreign direct investment that year. About 40% of remittances are from other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, up from 29% in 2012—a larger share than comes from Europe (see chart 2). Those sent within Africa tend to reduce poverty more, says Dilip Ratha of the World Bank, because intra-African migrants have poorer families than do migrants who cross oceans.

Migrants who return provide another boost. Catia Batista of the Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon finds that those returning to Mozambique are 25 percentage points more likely to own a business than those who have not been abroad, even controlling for the possibility that more talented people may travel abroad.Ms Batista also found that people in Mozambique who live in the same village as families with a member who has gone abroad are almost 15 percentage points more likely to vote in elections.
Migration also spreads good ideas. Scientists and engineers who have worked abroad bring back cutting-edge techniques. They bring other things, too. “Any kind of African restaurant you want in Abidjan, you can find,” boasts Issiaka Konaté of the Ministry of African Integration and Diaspora in Ivory Coast. “It’s like London.”
Some African leaders have begun to push for freer movement. Benin, the Gambia and the Seychelles offer visa-free travel for all Africans. At least 34 countries have signed on to a plan to create a single air-transport market that would allow airlines to open up more direct routes. In 2018 the African Union drew up a “free-movement protocol”, which would allow visa-free entry across the continent and subsequently the right to work and to establish a business. By February this year, 33 African states had signed up, but just four had ratified it. Some fear it could bring insecurity or loss of sovereignty, though the protocol could bring some of the vast untaxed informal sector out of the shadows.
African leaders may find promoting migration more popular than they expect. In South Africa, one of the least welcoming places, 29% of people say they would dislike having foreigners as neighbours. Yet in Ivory Coast, just 4% hold that view. Of the 20 most accepting countries in the world for migrants, nine are in sub-Saharan Africa, says Gallup, a pollster. In west Africa 60% of people would like migrant flows to stay the same or increase. In Africa as a whole more people would like to increase or maintain immigration than reduce it.

One obstacle, says Mohammed Abdiker of the IOM, is that migration policy in Africa often reflects European priorities. “A lot of European money” tries to persuade African governments to halt migrant flows north, says Loren Landau of the University of Oxford. This “legitimises a whole lot of really nasty things that can be done to migrants” within Africa, he says. “It also works against any kind of sensible discussion about what countries could be doing.”
The EU funds and advises countries to add more border security and conduct more frequent checks. European-funded anti-migration campaigns tell Africans harrowing stories of death and disaster; that if they move to Europe they will end up begging, and “everyone will hate you for it,” says Mr Landau. All this can stigmatise migration within Africa, increase the chances of police harassment, and make regional migration harder.
Give me your unskilled masses
Some countries, such as Ivory Coast, are trying to include migrants in their planning. “We must say it clearly: migration is an opportunity for Ivory Coast,” says Alcide Djédjé, the minister for African integration. “Ivory Coast applies the ECOWAS free-movement protocol better than anyone,” he boasts. Migrants have the same access to health care and education at the same cost, he adds. Indeed, surveys find they are more likely to go to health centres than locals (though, struggling to pay costs, they are less likely to use local schools).
Migration policy is hard to get right. African governments could start by punishing police who abuse migrants. West African governments should uphold the deal they made long ago: that any ECOWAS citizen can work and open a business in any ECOWAS country. Other regional groups could do likewise. And African governments should ratify the continent-wide free movement protocol, which is a remarkable step on the path to a more integrated and prosperous continent.
All this would make life easier for migrants, most of whom just want to earn a living. Peter Adoa (not his real name), a Ugandan, learnt Swahili on arriving in Kenya seven years ago, got a work permit, opened a nail salon and is engaged to a Kenyan.Yet he is constantly harassed by the police. Recently he was forced to pay $90 to a cop who was threatening him. Not even that can deter him. “That experience fatigues me, but nothing else does,” he smiles. “Everything else is great.” ■",2
1715,"THE END of the summer feels too early to be thinking about Christmas, but retailers have little choice. The typical British household spends around a third more than usual in December, and stocking up for the most important trading weeks of the year usually begins around now. This year, however, rather than preparing for the coming rush, retailers are struggling to keep shelves full.

According to survey data from the Confederation of British Industry, a lobby group, retailers’ and manufacturers’ inventories have plunged in recent months (see chart). It has been asking members about stock levels for decades and has never recorded answers so low. In spring and early summer, shortages of construction materials and computer chips hampered builders and carmakers. In recent weeks the impact has become more visible on high streets. McDonald’s, a burger chain, stopped serving milkshakes. Wetherspoons, a chain of pubs, is short of some brands of beer. Nando’s, a chicken restaurant, temporarily closed around 50 branches because it cannot get the birds.
The main reason is straightforward. With pandemic restrictions almost entirely lifted and the economy reopened, demand has recovered faster than supply, leading to shortages and higher prices. Consumer-price inflation, which was running at under 1% annually at the start of the year, hit 2.1% in July. The Bank of England expects annual inflation to rise to around 4% over the coming months.
But that is not the whole story. Some of the squeeze is caused by problems outside Britain’s borders, for example the computer-chip shortage. And the pandemic is far from over: government estimates suggest that new infections are running at over 200,000 a week. Employers are having to do without both the infected and many of those who came near them. According to the most recent data available, in the week ending August 18th over 300,000 close contacts of people who tested positive were told to stay home.

The main additional factor, however, is Brexit. Britain’s transitional membership of the European Single Market and Customs Union ended on December 31st 2020. The end of the frictionless border with Britain’s main trading partner means further problems for supply-chain managers. Although the government has chosen to suspend most border checks until October, new rules on collecting value-added tax have convinced many smaller European businesses to sell less to Britain. Sanitary and phytosanitary rules, due to be imposed on imports this autumn, will make food supply chains more fragile. Employers in sectors such as food processing and hospitality, which relied heavily on European workers, say that many left the country last year. Some may not return.
Disentangling the effects of Brexit and the pandemic is tricky. Take, for example, the shortage of heavy-goods vehicle (HGV) drivers. It has become severe enough that the government has extended the maximum time allowed behind the wheel. Drivers may stretch the daily maximum of nine hours to 11 hours twice a week between now and October. Around 40% of Britain’s shortfall of drivers, estimated at around 100,000, can be blamed on the suspension of driving tests at the height of the pandemic, and HGV drivers are in short supply across the continent. But Britain is suffering particularly acutely.
As well as suppressing demand and disrupting supply, the pandemic has also twisted Britain’s economy into a new shape. Over the past 18 months, consumer habits have undergone a dramatic shift. Between the end of 2019 and March 2021, their spending on services fell by around a fifth, while spending on goods mostly held up. The typical Briton went to the pub hardly at all and used Amazon a lot more. Such shifts have reshaped high streets. The Centre for Retail Research, a think-tank, calculates that almost 18,000 shops have closed since the end of 2019, and over 215,000 retail jobs have been lost. According to the Office for National Statistics, the share of retail sales made online has jumped from under 20% before the pandemic to approaching 30%, even as shops have reopened. Retailers think that shopping habits formed during the pandemic may well outlive it.
Many workers have responded to changing consumption patterns by following the money. Bosses in the hospitality sector have found themselves short of staff, probably because some former waiters and the like are now driving delivery vans or stacking supermarket shelves. Data from Indeed, an online recruitment firm, show a marked drop in interest from potential applicants in working in certain sectors. Clicks per online job advert for vacancies in food preparation and service roles have fallen by over 50% since February. In an effort to lure workers back to such jobs, employers are starting to raise pay. The median wage rate for hospitality jobs posted on Indeed rose by 3.7% between February and July, compared with an increase of 0.8% across all roles.
Some of these bottlenecks should ease over the coming 12 months. Global supply chains will be adjusted and strengthened, and the labour market will adapt to new spending patterns. The rules on when to isolate after coming in contact with a case of covid-19 were eased in mid-August. And higher wages will eventually draw workers back into hospitality, and encourage them to train as HGV drivers. But all this will take time, and as Brexit bites, trade with the EU will continue to become more difficult. The recovery from the pandemic will be far from smooth. ■

1716,"Detectives are hunting two men accused of hitting a 34-year-old man in the face with a metal whipped cream dispenser in a racially motivated attack. 
Scotland Yard said they would like to talk to Connor Donoghue and Jack Marks following the incident on Brick Lane, Shoreditch, at approximately 3.30am on July 25. 
The victim, who is a 34-year-old man, was hit in the face by the metal object by three men. 
The victim suffered serious facial injuries which required reconstructive surgery.
According to a spokesperson: 'Due to the language used by the suspects, the incident is being treated as a racially motivated hate crime.'
Detective Constable Caelen Matthewson-Davies of the Central East Command, who is investigating the incident, said: 'This was an unnecessary and needless use of force on an innocent man and we need the public’s help.
'If you know these men, or have any information that may help with our investigation, please do the right thing and get in touch.
'I thank the victim for his support throughout the investigation during what must have been an awful time.
'He is also seriously emotionally traumatised and has been having panic attacks.'
Anyone with information on the attack is asked to contact the police on 101 or tweet @METCC quoting CAD 4370/26Aug.

1717,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",3
1718,"LAST YEAR Zotye, a carmaker, used it to tackle weak sales, and Wuliangye, a distiller, to improve the quality of its baijiu; it helped Zheshang Bank to digitise its operations and catalysed the development of energy-saving technologies at China National Nuclear Power. “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” is, on the basis of these companies’ annual reports, quite the business-practice panacea.
The time when private Chinese companies downplayed their links to the Communist Party is gone. By The Economist’s count, nearly 400 of the 3,900 companies listed on stock exchanges in mainland China paid homage to the Communist Party and its leader in their annual reports this year. References by both state-owned firms and their private-sector peers to Mr Xi’s guidance have increased more than 20-fold since 2017 (see chart 1).

The trend reflects China’s new reality. The Communist Party has greater control over all aspects of life, and Mr Xi has greater control over the party. This does not just mean it is a good idea for companies to butter him up. It means that he is in a position to reshape the economy within which they prosper or fail. What is he doing with it?

Nothing good, say critics at home and abroad. He has brought reforms that liberalised the economy to a halt and has smothered market forces, returning to a top-heavy state-dominated growth model which looks distinctly creaky. Private companies have rushed to set up party committees with an increasing say over strategy. Their once-swashbuckling bosses have adopted lower profiles. The title of a recent book by Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute, an American think-tank, sums up the worries: “The State Strikes Back”.
Those observations are right. The conclusion is misleadingly wrong, encouraging a complacent and dangerous underestimate of China’s potential trajectory. Mr Xi is not simply inflating the state at the expense of the private sector. Rather, he is presiding over what he hopes will be the creation of a more muscular form of state capitalism. The idea is for state-owned companies to get more market discipline and private enterprises to get more party discipline, the better to achieve China’s great collective mission. It is a project full of internal contradictions. But progress is already evident in some areas.
Mr Xi announced his agenda in 2013, vowing that China would “let the market play the decisive role in allocating resources”, while reinforcing “the leading role of the state-owned sector”. When domestic stocks crashed in 2015 the government’s focus shifted to recapitalising its banks, tightening controls on cross-border cash transfers and taming the wildest corners of its financial system. But the party now thinks it has won this “battle against financial risks” and is getting Mr Xi’s agenda back on track in a new, bolder form.
Ever more tense relations with America have persuaded the party that China must be able to get ahead on its own. At the same time, China’s success in stalling its coronavirus epidemic and restarting its economy has reinforced its belief in what Mr Xi calls China’s “institutional advantages”—the idea that, as a strong one-party state, China can pool its economic and social resources to meet critical objectives.
Mr Xi’s push can be broken down into two big segments. The first is to establish clearer boundaries for the fizz and ferment of the Chinese marketplace: a stronger legal system for businesses; simplified rules for day-to-day activities; a financial system better at allocating funds. The second is to make more adroit use of the government’s grip on the economy’s main levers: to make state firms more efficient; and to team them up with private firms in new industrial-policy initiatives.
Entrepreneurs still have considerable latitude, so long as they stay in their lane and move in government-endorsed directions. And they still have powerful incentives. “To get rich is glorious”, a quip attributed to Deng Xiaoping that became a mantra for China in its go-go years, still applies. But only so long as your pursuit of riches also benefits the state.
Many foreign executives and diplomats have little time for the idea that there is real pro-market reform going on; they talk of promise fatigue. Repeated pledges to level the playing field on which Chinese and foreign firms meet have amounted to naught. State firms benefit from reams of subsidies and preferential rules, often opaque. Foreign companies have scant presence in key sectors such as finance and energy.
You may now go bankrupt
They are all well-founded complaints. But they ignore the fact that when Mr Xi talks about market reform, it is order, not fairness, that he is after. He wants to define more clearly how businesses and people can work, and within what limits.
Start with the legal system. It is a tool of oppression, as its extension into Hong Kong is making clearer than ever. Mr Xi has been relentless in targeting anyone standing up for human rights. Yet he has also overseen a partial professionalisation of the judicial system and given courts more authority on non-political matters. The economy is simply too complex, and corruption too prevalent, to rely on local officials to adjudicate disputes as they used to.
These changes to the courts have coincided with an explosion in cases. Administrative lawsuits, which typically involve people suing the government, have more than doubled since 2012, the year that Mr Xi became China’s paramount leader (see chart 2). Bankruptcy filings are up ten-fold. Last year Chinese courts accepted more than 480,000 intellectual property cases, nearly five times as many as they did in 2012, with some going to a new national court devoted to the area. Foreign plaintiffs won 89% of all patent infringement cases, according to Rouse, a consultancy.

Local officials have until now always had the option of simply ignoring court rulings: the head of a medical-services company complains that he was blamed for a health scandal in a small inland city caused by a firm that had stolen his company’s name and continued to use it three years after a court ruled against it. It is partly to patch up such holes that the government is developing its “social credit” system. The courts can place people on so-called credit blacklists, in effect recruiting automated agents of the state to enforce their judgments. For example, if a court finds that a debtor owes money, its ruling, via the blacklist system, can stop them from buying a plane ticket or getting a loan. As of the end of 2018, some 290,000 business executives were on the blacklist.
It is easy to imagine the system taking a truly dystopian turn if its reach were to become more all-embracing, with access to everything in society made conditional on a history that extends beyond creditworthiness through social-media activity into political reliability. But many in China support it for now. “It’s a price that must be paid to cultivate a healthy business environment,” says Yan Yiming, a lawyer who focuses on corporate malfeasance.
As the law gets more reliable, administration gets simpler. The World Bank has found that the average time taken to start a business, which was 23 days as recently as 2017, is now just nine days—a little faster than Japan, a little slower than America. Construction permits previously took 247 days; now they take 111. Digitisation has made filing taxes much more straightforward. When a business issues an invoice a copy goes directly to the tax authorities. Indeed, some fear that it is all-too-convenient: back doors in the government-mandated software could give hackers access to a company’s computer network.
The last major focus of Mr Xi’s market-orderliness reforms has been the financial system. For those who think that banking regulation is dry paperwork, his reassertion of government control over banks, brokerages and investment firms has been bracingly hands-on, featuring tactics such as the abduction of Xiao Jianhua, a once-mighty financier, from a luxury hotel in Hong Kong in 2017. Several other tycoons have also disappeared, only to re-emerge either chastened or on trial. The message to bankers has been chilling: fall into line with the new order, or else.
The reform is not purely ad hominem. There is real structural change. Between 2008 and 2016, China’s debt-to-GDP ratio rose by roughly ten percentage points a year; from 2017 to 2019, the annual increase averaged just four percentage points. This year debt will soar as a result of Covid-19. But officials insist that this is a one-off. They are already tapering monetary stimulus as growth rebounds.
A taste for Moonshots
The leverage on which the system is based also looks safer. In the 2010s Chinese banks threw themselves into the lucrative business of repackaging assets into opaque investment products: from 2010 until the end of 2017, banks’ claims on other financial institutions rose 20-fold as they layered credit on top of credit. Over the past two years new rules have forced banks to retrench. The shadow-banking sector, a motley universe of thinly regulated lending and investment companies, has begun to shrink.
The bond market, by contrast, has boomed, going from 50% of GDP in 2012 to more than 100% today, and amended rules have made it somewhat easier for companies to raise capital by issuing shares. In many ways, China’s financial system seems ever more reassuringly normal.
In other ways, though, it is what it was. Banks know that the government almost always bails out state firms, whereas private firms are left to their own devices; they are adept at contriving not to hear official calls for them to help small, struggling firms. Instead they direct most of their lending to state-owned firms—a rational choice in a still distorted market. This points to the other side of Mr Xi’s agenda: remaking China Inc.
Since January 2019 a small Chinese rover has been wandering around on the far side of the Moon, sending back crystal-clear panoramic images of a realm no other nation has reached. But for the economy the image that mattered most was Mr Xi’s meeting with hundreds of the scientists and bureaucrats responsible in the Great Hall of the People—an event at which he hailed their success as emblematic of a “new type of whole-nation system”.
Both China’s boosters and its self-declared victims have long promoted a highly idealised view of its industrial policy. Mandarins decide what the country needs and apply a mixture of cheap capital, well-specified research priorities, intellectual-property theft, protectionism and force majeure to get it done.
In truth, Chinese industrial policy has rarely, if ever, been remotely that coherent. It has promoted industrialisation of more or less any type. Cities compete with each other to attract enterprises. Companies pile into whatever seems ripe for a boom. As a detailed study by Carsten Holz of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has shown, these investment patterns have borne little relationship to stated industrial policy, which has often been catching up with the facts on the ground. Sometimes this pans out. There are fast trains and safe-looking nuclear power plants. But decades of official emphasis on semiconductors and internal-combustion-powered cars have failed to lift China to the premier league in either. Huge growth in sectors such as solar power and shipbuilding was bought with wasteful investment which produced overcapacity, huge losses and brutal consolidations.
Cheap land and capital, excellent infrastructure, inexpensive labour and, for years, an undervalued currency allowed stellar progress regardless of rickety strategy. But times have changed. The population is ageing, the debt burden has risen and the environmental effects of all-industrialisation-is-good-industrialisation have been recognised. China needs new tools with which to create new wealth. Mr Xi’s new type of whole-nation system is intended to make real the focused and foundational industrial policy of myth.
In this respect “Made in China 2025”, a new industrial strategy announced in 2015, has proved crucial—though not in the way originally intended. Covering more or less all of manufacturing industry, it is anything but focused. “Basically, every department in the industry ministry came up with pet projects. But there was no real action strategy,” says Yu Yongding, an economist involved in developing some of China’s five-year plans. However its ambition, coupled with China’s industrial-policy mystique and habitual spying, prompted America to react. And that has provided Mr Xi with the criteria by which to select its true priorities.
What China needs are the things which America might hurt it by withholding: the term kabozi jishu, “stranglehold technology”, is much in vogue. Rather than targeting whole sectors, planners talk of prioritising the mastery of jet turbines, precision photolithography for semiconductors, high-speed bearings for machine-tools and a handful of other key technologies.
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are seen as necessary to this process because, though many have some private shareholders, the government’s controlling stake allows it to dictate the firms’ actions. But that is not much of an advantage if they are not up to the job. At present SOEs consistently lag their private-sector peers in productivity. Their bosses, as political appointees, are wary of risks; and they are often burdened with state duties. During the response to covid-19 officials praised SOEs such as PetroChina, an oil major, for creating extra jobs.
Mixing it up
Mr Xi has made clear that he does not favour a fundamental overhaul for SOEs. There will be nothing like the wave of closures and privatisations implemented in the 1990s, a cull that carried a steep social price in unemployment but also helped to clear the way for buccaneering entrepreneurs. But it is a mistake to view the situation as static. The state is trying both to get more out of SOEs and to use them to get more out of the private sector.
Last year the government declared that net, not gross, profitability was to be a key measure of an SOE’s success, which could encourage them to be more hard-headed about operating costs. “What makes us somewhat optimistic is that they are talking more about shareholder value,” says a strategist with one of China’s biggest hedge funds. Some are clearly better run than others: shares in China Merchants Bank, for instance, trade at 1.5-times book value, compared with just 0.5-times for Bank of Communications.
Potentially more important—and certainly more misunderstood—is the government’s renewed push for “mixed ownership”. It wants more state firms to attract private-sector investors and private firms to find state-owned partners. Cross-pollination along these lines has happened before (notably, when major SOEs listed on stock exchanges in the early 2000s). But this time it will tie together a wider array of companies, notes Chen Long of Plenum, a research firm. In the past few years, state firms have pulled in more than 1trn yuan ($145bn) of private capital. And in the first half of 2020 nearly 50 private-sector enterprises listed in China attracted chunky investments from state firms.

This is not the only way that the boundaries between the private and state sectors are getting fuzzier. Private companies have always been required to have party committees, but for a long time many did not bother. For the biggest that is no longer an option. Wang Xiaochuan, CEO of Sogou, an internet-search firm, expressed the truths of the new alignment bluntly in 2018. “If you think clearly about this, you really can resonate with the state. You can receive massive support,” he said. Woe betide any company that tries to go its own way. “You’ll probably find that things are painful, more painful than in the past,” he said.
There is some evidence that these changes are having the kind of impact the government wants. Zhang Xiaoqian, an economist at Zhejiang University, has found that both SOEs and private firms increase their spending on research and development after being remade as mixed-ownership firms. State firms benefit from an injection of ideas and risk appetite. Private firms benefit from better state connections which make it easier to raise capital.
Take for example integrated circuits, an area perennially targeted by planners without huge success (see chart 3) and which is now of huge significance. The government is funnelling more than $100bn to SOEs, private firms and, most often, projects that bring the two together. There is a lot of waste. But there are signs of progress. In April Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC), a semiconductor company founded in 2016 with both public and private capital, announced that it could now make memory chips as technologically advanced as the best Samsung has to offer, boasting 128 distinct layers of circuitry.

Dan Wang of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm, says that YMTC’s chips are probably not actually as good as Samsung’s, but that the achievement nonetheless demonstrates China’s progress in both the design and production of chips. One remarkable element of the YMTC story is that it is based in Wuhan, ground-zero of the coronavirus pandemic. The government kept its factory open and supplied, ensuring that workers could clock in every day, even when the rest of the city was in total shutdown. It was the “new type of whole-nation system” in action.
Yet the basic tension in the SOE sector remains unresolved. Yes, the government has put more emphasis on profitability, but that does not mean decisions get made according to commercial logic. Indeed, under Mr Xi national duty—supporting China’s rise—is more important than ever. And stricter party control is confusing lines of responsibility. An executive with a major state-owned insurance firm says that its party committee now controls all senior personnel appointments and expresses “opinions” on all investments worth more than 20% of net-asset value. Opinion is a euphemism. “It is normally the final decision. No one would go against the party secretary,” he said. “But if something goes bad, the board will be responsible.”
In the private sector, for all the criticism outsiders have of Mr Xi’s increasing reach, it is salutary to note how well some of the biggest players have fared on his watch. China’s ten biggest non-state companies have added roughly $2trn to their market capitalisation since he became party chief. Mr Xi’s strengthening of court decisions and disciplining of the financial system helps incumbents to make acquisitions, to sue firms infringing on their patents and to get financing.
Contradicting history
This all helps underpin the gradual consolidation taking place across a range of industries—a process which demonstrates that there really are strong market forces at play in the economy, and that they are being channelled more effectively than in the past. In the property sector, for instance, the ten biggest developers now have a 34% market share, up from 20% five years ago, according to UBS, a bank.

But Mr Xi’s rule has not just been a time of consolidation. Many startups have grown up under him, including the company that created TikTok, the social-media app now at the centre of its own geopolitical storm; Pinduoduo, an e-commerce firm taking on China’s incumbent, Alibaba; and SenseTime, an AI company in the vanguard of facial-recognition technology.
The worry—for the economy as for those whom SenseTime’s wares may victimise—is what comes next. An insistence on forming party committees in private companies, even if they are mainly window-dressing for now, and on mixed-ownership initiatives, can but drag entrepreneurs more firmly into the grasp of the state. Can technological advances delivered by the whole-nation system in any way make up for the constraints, second-guessing and divergent incentives which inevitably come with it?
It has always been possible for major decisions—investments, lay-offs and branding—in big Chinese companies, state-owned or not, to be subject to government scrutiny. But that possibility is now more clearly communicated and more deeply felt. All companies, whoever owns them, exist for the glory of China.

A flag-bearer of the new model is a company like BYD, the world’s biggest maker of electric cars. At one level, it epitomises the can-do entrepreneurial spirit that has fuelled China’s growth. Wang Chuanfu, a chemist, left a poorly paid government job in the mid-1990s to strike out on his own, first developing phone batteries, then cars. Today, his company counts Warren Buffett as its biggest investor.
But BYD’s connection to the party is strong. Mr Wang is a party member. Though BYD has never discussed the workings of its party committee in formal disclosures to shareholders, state media report that it helps to guide the company’s decisions. And its business decisions are sometimes strikingly well aligned with government priorities. When America hit Huawei, China’s embattled telecommunications giant, with sanctions last year, BYD started making smartphones for it.
It is getting harder to distinguish between the state and private sectors. It is getting harder to distinguish between corporate and national interests. And for all its inefficiencies, contradictions and authoritarianism, not to mention its increasingly pious cult of personality, it is getting harder to claim that state capitalism will hobble China’s attempts to produce companies and master technologies that put it on the world economy’s leading edge. ■",2
1719,"IN YEMEN THEY set off fireworks; in Somalia they handed out sweets; in Syria they praised the Taliban for providing a “living example” of how to “bring down a criminal regime” through jihad. Around the world, jihadists were elated by the fall of Kabul. Through willpower, patience and cunning, a low-budget band of holy warriors has vanquished America and taken charge of a medium-size country. To Muslims who yearn to expel infidels and overthrow secular states, it was evidence that God approves. The ripple effects could be felt far and wide.
In the next few days President Joe Biden will have to sort out the mess he has created at Kabul airport, where throngs are clamouring to flee. It is a dangerous moment for his presidency. In the longer term the world must deal with the boost to jihadism from America’s humiliation. The chief risk is not that terrorists will use Afghanistan as a base from which to strike the West, as they did on September 11th 2001. Such attacks are harder now, since rich countries have better security. Besides, the Taliban are unlikely to tolerate big training camps for global-minded terrorists, as they crave recognition and aid.

Granted, some feel a duty of hospitality to foreign Sunni jihadists, and some will aid their militant cousins in Pakistan, making that nuclear-armed state even less stable. But outside Afghanistan, the main ripple effects will be psychological. The Taliban’s triumph will fire up jihadists in other countries, and spur recruits to join them. Some who live in rich countries will be inspired to commit acts of terrorism there. It does not take many such attacks to sow a sense of fear or roil domestic politics.
Even worse will be the effect in poorer, weaker states, where jihadists aspire not merely to kill but to control territory, or at least prevent the government from doing so. In places like Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Mali, Somalia and Mozambique, they already do. In several other parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, they threaten to. Many are asking: if our Afghan brothers can beat a superpower, surely we can beat our own wretched rulers?

Jihadists are not all the same. Many disagree about doctrine. Many hate and fight each other. Supporters of Islamic State deride the Taliban, absurdly, as American stooges. One of the first things the Taliban did in Kabul last week was to pull the leader of Islamic State in South Asia out of jail and kill him.
Most jihadist groups are motivated primarily by local grievances: a predatory government, an ethnic or sectarian divide, infidel intruders. Yet they also tap into a global narrative. On their phones they see daily evidence that the oppression they face at home is part of wider pattern of persecution of Muslims, from the gulag of Xinjiang to the hellscape of Gaza. When jihadists anywhere succeed, they feel pride—and a call to action.

Bad government creates an opening for jihadism. When a state is unjust, its citizens may imagine that one run by jihadists might be better. Even if they do not take up arms, they may quietly support those who do. Many rural Afghans decided that Taliban justice, though harsh, was quicker and less corrupt than government courts, and that Taliban checkpoints were less plunderous. This is one reason the Taliban’s final march to power met so little resistance. The other was psychological: they won because when America pulled out Afghans did not want to die fighting for a lost cause. Similar principles apply elsewhere. Jihadists in north-eastern Nigeria are hard to beat because locals detest the central government and army officers sell their own men’s weapons to the guerrillas and pocket the cash.
Once jihadists win power, however, they find that their ideology makes governing hard (see our Special report on the Arab world). Their desire to create a perfectly pious society, and ruthless intolerance of deviation from that ideal, make pragmatic compromise tricky. Islamic State’s rule over a big chunk of Iraq and Syria lasted only three years. Its habit of drowning people in cages alienated a potentially sympathetic Sunni population. So did its failure to foster economic activities other than looting and kidnapping. It scared outside powers and Shia Iraqis so much that they clubbed together to crush it.

The Taliban were also dreadful rulers when they last ran Afghanistan. Much depends on whether they have learned from their mistakes. If a group of jihadists could not only seize a country but also run it tolerably well, jihadists everywhere would see it as a beacon. Senior Taliban are at pains to seem pragmatic and insist they will respect human rights. But rocky times lie ahead. Taliban footsoldiers are already committing atrocities. Many urban Afghans, who have tasted the freedom to dress, work and study as they please, even if they are female, despise the new regime. Because reserves are frozen in America, it is short of cash. The Afghan economy has seized up; prices are soaring. The Taliban have yet to unveil good ideas for reviving it. Instead they bluster that skilled Afghans must not emigrate. Skilled Afghans may have other ideas.
One lesson of the Afghan fiasco is that what happens in far-off failing states matters not only to the people who live there, but also to the rest of the world. Calamity in Kabul today means bigger refugee flows, more jihadist attacks and a greater chance that other Islamist insurgencies will prevail. That could destabilise a large number of countries, endangering both locals and the foreigners who visit or do business there.
Another lesson is that a purely military approach to fighting jihadism does little to make the ground less fertile for it. The long-term solution is to build less awful, less exclusive states. If the old Afghan government had been less corrupt and less inept in dealing with tribal power-brokers, it might have proved more resilient. Likewise, if northern Mozambique, southern Thailand, Kashmir or the vast expanses of the Sahel were more benignly ruled, they might not be havens for jihadists.
Improving governance is hard, not least since many countries vulnerable to jihad are also racked by climate change. More frequent droughts add to discontent and stir conflicts over water and pasture. Donors can offer advice and cash, but ultimately it is up to locals to build institutions that work. Unless existing states provide basic services and something resembling justice, the jihadists’ siren song will always sound seductive. ■",2
1720,"THE #MeToo movement struggles in China. On November 2nd, Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star, publicly accused Zhang Gaoli, a former deputy prime minister who retired in 2018, of sexual assault. It is the most high-profile #MeToo allegation made in China since the campaign took off globally in 2018, and the first time a senior Communist Party official has been implicated. There has been no official response to Ms Peng’s post, but censors swiftly removed it from Chinese social-media sites and blocked online discussion of it and the #MeToo hashtag.
This is par for the course. The country’s media are not allowed to report #MeToo. But the grievances that fuelled the movement abroad have bubbled up in China. A growing number of women are suing powerful men for sexual assault. #MeToo has fuelled an “unprecedented interest” in women’s rights, says Lu Pin, a Chinese feminist who went into self-exile in America in 2015.
Whatever good feminist campaigns have done in China, they have often been bad for the campaigners. In 2012 a group of feminists protested against a shortage of public toilets for women by using men’s lavatories instead (see picture). State-security police responded by harassing and threatening them. But the government took up their cause. Cities started building more toilets for women. Last year, at the UN, China cited this as a big achievement of its efforts in the past five years to improve the lot of women. It did not mention the people who had pushed for such change.
Most of the toilet-reform activists have been forced to give up their campaigning. Some are subject to intense surveillance by the state. Several have become fitness fanatics, going to gyms to run and lift weights. “Many of us suffer from depression and anxiety,” says one. “Exercise is a way for us to prepare for whatever comes next, good or bad.”

Officials are making some effort to show they care. In 2019 China’s highest court added sexual harassment as grounds for filing a lawsuit. The Ministry of Education now works with universities and schools to curb it on campuses. An anti-sexual-harassment clause was included in China’s first civil code, which took effect this year. Darius Longarino of Yale Law School says the Communist Party often represses activists while trying to show that it is fixing the problems they raise.
But the party has used its control of the media and internet to turn #MeToo-related debate into something more suited to its own needs. Censors have suppressed use of the #MeToo hashtag and its Chinese equivalent, but have allowed selective discussion of a handful of cases that reflect badly on people or institutions that are in the party’s sights.
The entertainment industry and its celebrities are among the party’s targets. It fears that they are undermining moral rectitude in China by mimicking the worst excesses of Hollywood. In August police arrested Kris Wu, a pop star, after he was accused by a university student of pressing women to have sex with him. The government banned many online groups that drooled over him and other male celebrities. Some of these also happened to be forums for debate about women’s rights.
This year state media have also highlighted an alleged sexual crime involving a manager of Alibaba, a technology giant. The man was accused by a female employee of forcing her, while on a business trip, to drink until she blacked out, and then of raping her. The company fired the man, who then was cleared by police of any crime. The scandal happened to coincide with a sweeping regulatory clampdown on Alibaba and other large non-state tech companies, seemingly motivated in part by the party’s desire to curtail their enormous economic clout.
Despite its efforts to appear woke, the party is reluctant to up-end a patriarchal social order in which women are routinely treated as sex objects, subservient to men. The legal system still favours harassers. The burden of proof is very high for women who make accusations of sexual assault. An analysis of civil cases between 2018 and 2020 by scholars at Yale Law School found that more than 90% of those involving sexual harassment had been brought by alleged perpetrators against their accusers (for slandering them) or their employers (for disciplining them).
In September a court in Beijing rejected a woman’s petition for redress, which had become the country’s most famous case relating to sexual harassment. The plaintiff had accused a well-known television anchor of groping and forcibly kissing her when she was an intern. The judge said she had insufficient evidence. The plaintiff, known as Xianzi, plans to appeal. The verdict, she says, has made it “very easy for the public to assume I was lying”.
In contrast to the case involving Alibaba’s employee, journalists at state media were banned from reporting on Xianzi’s plea. In the week leading up to the verdict, anyone who posted information about the case had their social-media accounts frozen. Xianzi’s own such accounts were partially or fully blocked.
Such experiences are common among outspoken feminists in China. By shutting them out of social media, while tolerating the rantings of their critics, censors fan the flames of bigotry. Women who try to share their experiences of being sexually harassed in the office or being required to drink large quantities of alcohol at work banquets, are often “slut-shamed or labelled as anti-government or as hostile foreign forces”, says Xianzi.
Anti-feminist sentiment is fuelled by the party’s conservatism. Xi Jinping tries to project an aura of masculinity (his attacks on showbiz have also included a ban on effeminate men appearing on television). He is fawningly known in China as “Xi Dada”, literally meaning “Uncle Xi”. He promotes traditional Confucian values, which emphasise the role of women as obedient wives and mothers.
Online trolls who attack #MeToo use the same authoritarian, jingoistic language that the party delights in, notes Ms Lu, the feminist in America. They also engage in a kind of grassroots activism, with their numerous social-media accounts and independent websites that spice up the party’s message with extra dashes of anti-liberal vitriol. That is the only sort of advocacy allowed. ■",2

THE PLACE that is now known as George Floyd Square is these days blocked to cars, creating an effective memorial. Walk in from the Powderhorn Park end and you see posters giving advice about proper behaviour, rather like those signs outside a church advising that shorts and flash-photography are forbidden. A few doors down from the Cup Foods grocery store, the last place that Mr Floyd entered before he was murdered, an arts centre has been converted into a museum for all the protest signs that were waved on the street outside. Within the arts centre there is discussion of the importance of protest gardening. In a park nearby stand around 150 white plastic headstones, each of them marked with the name of an African-American killed by the police, their dates, a fist that was the emblem of the Black Panther party and the words “Rest in Power”. The combination of hippydom with symbols that are drawn from black radicalism gives the place something of the feel of the 1960s.
Powderhorn is nothing like such places as West Baltimore, Chicago’s South Side or East Cleveland, where neighbourhoods are full of abandoned houses, entrenched poverty, violence and heavy-handed policing. About half its residents are white, 30% Hispanic and 15% African-American, a patchwork that is as rare in Minneapolis as in other cities. Barbecue restaurants run by African-Americans coexist with places selling tacos and cafés in which everything is vegan, fair trade or both. This menu echoes the alliance of white liberals with African-Americans and Hispanics that keeps Democrats in power in almost all of America’s big cities. In Minneapolis the mayor, Jacob Frey, is young, Jewish and progressive, and the chief of police, Medaria Arradondo, is an African-American. This alliance can be uneasy—Nakima Levy Armstrong, a lawyer-professor turned activist, accuses the city council of being obsessed with “bike lanes and things white folks care about”. But it mostly holds together.

Minneapolis is an unlikely avatar of American racism. The city to which Mr Floyd moved from Houston was built by Scandinavian immigrants, who exploited the steep natural weir on the Mississippi river to create the milling capital of the world. These immigrants brought with them a distinctively Scandinavian form of capitalism. There is still an expectation that large companies will give away 5% of their pre-tax profits, and the chamber of commerce compiles a list of companies that have done so. “The list is long and you do not want to not be on it,” says David Mortenson, boss of Mortenson, a Fortune 500 construction company founded by his Swedish great-grandfather that is based in the city. One of these causes is refugee resettlement. Minnesota is home to large Hmong and Somali refugees from civil wars. Both groups are thriving: from time to time delegations of Swedes visit to try to work out why Somalis do so much better in Minneapolis than they do in Malmo.

Within this progressive utopia, though, are areas of concentrated poverty, where inhabitants are segregated by race and a boy is more likely as an adult to go to prison than to own a home or get married. Head north from Powderhorn Park towards downtown, where the old brick mills and warehouses on the Mississippi have been converted into attractive apartments and offices, and you find yourself in Phillips. Number-crunching by Raj Chetty and colleagues at Harvard University found that a black child born poor here 35 years ago would live today in a household where the average annual income is just $23,000 (£17,000). The number is a bit lower for boys, slightly higher for girls.
This poverty, passed from parent to child, is a feature of many big cities. Mr Floyd was raised in public housing in Houston, but seemed to find an exit via a sports scholarship to a community college in Florida. When that did not work out he bounced between part-time work, jail and struggles with drugs, finding hope through a religious awakening and moving to Minneapolis to start afresh. One of his jobs there was at a nightclub where Derek Chauvin worked off duty. Mr Floyd left one neighbourhood scarred by deep poverty only to land in another.
A pattern of deprivation
The persistence of deprivation in the same places, generation after generation, reflects how cities were settled. The South, where a majority of African-Americans still live, had formal segregation. Something similar was created in the north after the great migration of 6m black people, who moved from the bayous to the great lakes between 1916 and 1970 to flee Jim Crow and get better jobs. On arrival in Minneapolis, blacks who tried to make their homes in white areas were chased out by mobs and lawyers.
Even in the north, the threat of extreme violence was never far away. Although most of the 4,400-odd lynchings recorded by the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, took place in the South, this was a northern phenomenon too. In Duluth, a city in northern Minnesota, six African-American circus workers were accused in 1920 of raping a white woman. An examination by a physician found no evidence of this. Three were lynched anyway. A black-and-white photograph shows two men stripped to the waist and hanging by ropes from a pole, with a third man dead on the ground. They are surrounded by a large group of white men in suits and hats, some of them smiling. Duluth has had an awokening too: it put up a memorial to the victims last October.
Racial boundaries were often enforced by restrictive covenants on homes. The Mapping Prejudice project at the University of Minnesota has uncovered thousands of these, forming a ring around downtown Minneapolis. One clause in such a deed reads: “This property shall not be sold, mortgaged or leased to or occupied by any person or persons other than members of the Caucasian race.” These clauses reflected racial classifications common at the time. Some referred to Aryans, the category placed first by the Minnesota Eugenics Society run by Charles Fremont Dight, who believed the key to progress was a mix of socialism with state-sponsored sterilisation of the feeble-minded. He counted Adolf Hitler among his correspondents.
When the Federal Housing Administration, created as part of the New Deal, began to underwrite mortgages in the 1930s, these racial covenants helped determine where to lend—and where not to. Light-skinned borrowers received subsidised credit to buy or build new homes, dark-skinned ones did not. In 1948, in Shelley v Kraemer, the Supreme Court ruled that such covenants, which were common in most big cities, could not be enforced. But anyone who sold to a black family could still be sued for damaging the value of nearby properties.
This practice was only finally stopped by the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But after the act was passed, a large number of whites fled to the suburbs, sometimes along new federal highways that were either built right through black neighbourhoods or were actively planned to wall them in. Chicago constructed a 14-lane expressway that separated a predominantly black neighbourhood with lots of public housing from the rest of the city. In Montgomery, Alabama, the federal highway follows a snaking path that seems to make little sense—unless you know which parts of town were black and which white.

Despite this, the first half of the 20th century and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked big progress for African-Americans. In 1900 life expectancy for black Americans was just 33 years, against 48 for white ones. By 1960 the gap had narrowed to seven years. After that, progress stalled. One of the most counter-intuitive facts about economic progress for African-Americans is that most of it happened before the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s. Rates of black home-ownership in 2021 are lower than rates of white home-ownership were in 1870. In Minneapolis, three-quarters of white families own homes but only a quarter of black families do, the second widest gap in the country. A survey by Robert Putnam and Shaylyn Romney Garrett in their book “The Upswing” concluded that there was “essentially no relative economic progress” for black men after 1970.
This presents a paradox. All but the most determined pessimist would concede that racism has declined since Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968. So why have the life prospects of African-Americans, particularly men, stopped improving? The answer often given by campaigners is still racism, but transmuted into a new hidden and insidious form. This is true, yet it is more complicated than that word implies.
The great stalling
Shortly after African-Americans were guaranteed voting rights by Lyndon Johnson and a coalition of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, the great migration ended. Deindustrialisation swept through northern cities that would soon form the rustbelt. Racism did not do this: recession, shifting trade patterns, technological change and the appeal of non-unionised workforces in the South were more responsible. But, as the sociologist William Julius Wilson puts it, racist housing policies had put African-Americans in places where job losses were worst, and racist education policies had over generations left them with fewer skills to adjust and compete. Decades later the scarring is still visible. Only 60% of African-American men are employed, compared with 66% of white men and 73% of Hispanics.
At the same time two things happened to black neighbourhoods. The first was a crime spike, the causes of which are still disputed. African-American men were more likely to be both victims and perpetrators. For black men who dropped out of high school, a spell in prison became a normal stop on the road to middle age, damaging their prospects on release and making African-American families less stable. By the mid-2000s two in every 100 black men were behind bars (the share has since fallen). The spree of lawlessness began to wane in the 1990s, for reasons that were as mysterious as they were welcome. But crime remains higher in predominantly African-American spots: 40% of black Americans say they are afraid to walk around after dark, compared with 30% of whites. This is one reason why defunding the police is so unpopular in black neighbourhoods.
The second big change was that not only did many whites leave for the suburbs, but so did many middle-class African-Americans who could get out. Thus began also a reverse migration to the South. In northern cities where the population has shrunk, residential segregation is harder to undo because little new housing is now being built. Minneapolis, which in the 1970s built the majority of its public housing in the suburbs, now builds it in more deprived areas, concentrating poverty there. The city and state also paused a politically awkward effort to integrate schools. As a result, even as cities have grown more diverse and gentrified, at a neighbourhood level black-white residential segregation is still stuck in the 1970s.
Those left behind have not fared well. Black boys born 30 years ago in the area now known as George Floyd Square would go on to live in households with an average annual income of $17,000 a year in their 30s. One in ten would spend time in prison. This was the neighbourhood where Mr Floyd found himself outside Cup Foods that night in May 2020, with a police officer on top of him. But what brought Derek Chauvin there?■

1722,"THIS PHOTOGRAPH will surely shock those who think of tortoises as gentle consumers of lettuces. Though some aquatic testudines, such as terrapins, are well-known to have a taste for meat, terrestrial varieties of the group have a more herbivorous reputation. However, Justin Gerlach of Cambridge University and Anna Zora of the Fregate Island Foundation in the Seychelles, who are studying the giant tortoises of that island nation, have found an intriguing exception. As they write in Current Biology, and as the picture shows, they have seen one of the animals they are observing quite deliberately attack, kill and eat a noddy-tern chick.
Tortoises being slow-moving, the entire incident took seven minutes. But there was nothing accidental about it. The tortoise approached the chick with its jaws wide open and its tongue retracted. This is typical tortoise behaviour when they are being aggressive to one another, and contrasts with what they do when feeding on plants—namely sticking out their tongues out as they grab and chew leaves. Unable to fly, and apparently unwilling to flee the vicinity of its nest, the chick eventually became a protein-rich addition to the tortoise’s diet.",2
1723,"The Prime Minister has ordered a Whitehall review into the cross-Channel migrant crisis, it emerged last night.
Boris Johnson is said to be 'exasperated' by his Government's failure to reduce the number of migrants on small boats making the journey and wants ministers to 'redouble' efforts to 'fix' the crisis.
Former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been put in charge of the review, according to The Times.
It will seek to find solutions to the crisis and make sure all departments – not only the Home Office – are contributing.
The review follows a week of record migrant Channel crossings, with 1,000 reaching the British shores on Tuesday alone and around 24,000 making the journey this year. The figure is almost triple the number that arrived in 2020.
Mr Johnson's frustration comes after a series of promises made by Home Secretary Priti Patel to tackle the crisis.
They culminated this week with the suggestion that asylum seekers could be sent abroad for processing. Countries including Albania are being considered as possible destinations. 
Last night it emerged that Ms Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants which will see new restrictions imposed on asylum seekers, as well the construction of new purpose-built reception centres, according to The Daily Telegraph.
In Greece, migrants face regular checks on their movements which include curfews to stop them going off the radar.
Speaking of Mr Johnson's frustration that the migrant crisis has not yet been solved, a senior government source said the PM saw it as one of his biggest priorities and he was concerned that 'after two years there are still no viable solutions'.
Germany is becoming a hub for migrants attempting to reach Britain, it emerged last night.
Asylum seekers are massing in the country as a new staging post for Channel crossings masterminded by people-smuggling gangs.
Organised crime groups are also using German sites to store dinghies and other small boats used to attempt crossings, sources said.
Six out of ten migrants arrive in France only on the day they attempt their crossing, travelling there through Belgium and the Netherlands.
A UK government source described Germany as 'the established hub for criminal trafficking gangs' in Europe. 
It is also a key location in the criminals' supply chains, where boats, life jackets and other equipment is sourced for Channel crossings, they added.
'Boris is exasperated. He's told ministers to redouble efforts to fix this, no matter how difficult it is,' they said.
'If it looks bad now, it's going to look much worse in spring when it's warmer.'
In new plans being drawn up by the Home Office, migrants will have asylum claims thrown out if they abscond or misbehave.
The changes – which will require legislation – will be crucial in the operation of the new processing centres, which will house asylum seekers while their cases are scrutinised.
Migrants could also be issued with 'asylum apps' to track the progress of their applications on smartphones or computers in the centres.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has been impressed by the way Greece has digitised its asylum application process to track cases, sped up decisions and cut down on unnecessary paperwork.
Speaking to The Telegraph, Miss Patel said Greece had decided 'not to sit behind the EU block of competency'.
Ministers are also keen to avoid a repeat of riots at asylum centres.
'If they breach the rules, it will affect their asylum claim,' a source said.
'They would be told they have to be back in by a certain time, and so on. Terms would include preventing absconding.'
Some previously reported plans to tackle crossings have included the use of giant wave machines, nets to snare boat propellers and floating walls in the sea.
However, Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, told the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week that they were never considered'.
He added that the wave machine idea is 'bizarre'.
But the move to bring in Mr Barclay could be seen as an admission that the Home Secretary has not managed to tackle the issue.
It comes after Sir Keir Starmer accused Ms Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
The Labour leader said Ms Patel has not secured strong enough agreements with the French government to prevent migrants making the dangerous sea journey.
He said the Home Secretary repeatedly used 'strong language' to say how she would tackle the problem, but delivered 'absolutely nothing'.
October 15, 2019
Priti Patel vows to halve migrant crossings – then a tenth of the current level – by the end of the month and make them an 'infrequent phenomenon' by the spring of 2020.
'I am absolutely committed to doing everything in my power to stop these dangerous Channel crossings which are putting vulnerable lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Migrant numbers hit a record 1,185 in a day last week.
August 7, 2020
The Home Secretary backs sending Royal Navy patrols into the Channel.
'The number of illegal small boat crossings is appalling and unacceptably high.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Within hours, Ministry of Defence sources suggested the proposals were unworkable.
July 6, 2021
Miss Patel unveils powers for UK Border Force to turn back migrant boats and reduce asylum rights for people who arrive in Britain illegally.
'Access to the UK's asylum system should be based on need, not the ability to pay people smugglers.'
WHAT HAPPENED? The tactics have yet to be used amid opposition from France and even the UK Border Force over legal concerns.
July 20
She agrees to give France another £54million to tackle the crisis.
'The public are rightly angry that small boats are arriving on our shores, facilitated by appalling criminal gangs who profit from human misery and put lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? In October France accused the UK of withholding the money amid a row over whether Paris was doing enough to stop the boats. The first instalment of UK cash was later paid – but numbers coming over the Channel continue to rocket.
November 15
Miss Patel and French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, vow they will deliver on their pledge to prevent '100 per cent' of illegal crossings.
JOINT STATEMENT: 'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings... and make this deadly route unviable.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Days later the French embassy in London said 100 per cent 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
November 18
The Home Secretary launches an attack on the EU's open borders policy, blaming Brussels for the crisis.
'The real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – open borders. On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. They simply can't.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Free movement for people between member states in the so-called Schengen area is a fundamental EU principle and there is no prospect of it being changed. 
His attack came as Ms Patel blamed the EU's open borders – established by the Schengen Agreement – for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc.
Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was 'constantly pressing' the French on the issue, but that they were 'overwhelmed'.
'Let's not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – Schengen open borders,' she was quoted as saying.
It is thought at least 10 migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing.
It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British 'oscillate between partnership and provocation' when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: 'We need to further strengthen collaboration.'
Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensified recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where canisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants.
Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work 'extremely closely' with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe.
'We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings,' a No 10 spokesman said.
'This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions.'
Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britain's 'busted' asylum system.
Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a 'dysfunctional' system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in 2015.
Sir Keir said: 'My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted.
'This Government has been in power for 11 years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch.
'Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at.
'So if the asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.'
Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador to Britain flatly denied reports his country has been in discussions with the Government about hosting a processing centre for migrants who arrive in the UK.
Qirjako Qirko told LBC radio that there had been 'zero talks' between the two countries on the issue.
'It's absolutely fake news because as my prime minister stated yesterday – the foreign minister also tweeted yesterday – that doesn't exist, any negotiations between Albania and the UK regarding these processing centres,' he said.
'It will not be changed because my prime minister was crystal clear yesterday when he said that Albania… will never be a processing centre for illegal immigrants.'
Speaking on a trip this week, Ms Patel said offshore processing centres remained 'on the table' but refused to discuss specific negotiations. 
There have been suggestions that migrants could be sent and held abroad - such as in Albania - while their cases are looked at. 
'We keep everything on the table… and this is why the new Nationality and Borders Bill is just so important,' she said.
'I'm the only Home Secretary over a 20-year period that has taken on the challenge of reforming what is fundamentally a broken system of asylum and illegal migration.' She admitted for the first time that Britain was facing a 'mass migration crisis'.
And, after months of friction with the French government, Ms Patel appeared to change her tone when she said the flow of small boats needs to be treated as a 'Europe-wide problem'. 
She said France was 'overwhelmed' by asylum seekers heading for the UK.
And she blamed Brussels – which governs EU border policy – for failing to act. 'Let's not forget the real problem on illegal migration flows is [that] the EU has no border protections whatsoever,' she said.
'On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. Other countries have to do much more in terms of border protection.'
Seven out of ten migrants who attempt to cross the Channel have entered France through Belgium according to French officials, Miss Patel said.
She added: 'The EU's Schengen zone is free movement and open borders. They do not have border controls and border checks. 
'There is no united position across EU member states in terms of how to tackle this issue. It's an EU competency issue.'
Deploying highly-charged language, the Home Secretary went on: 'There is a mass migration crisis. I've said this from day one – from the minute I walked into the Home Office. For everyone who complains about this – and no-one is more angry and frustrated about this than myself, alongside the British taxpayers – there isn't a silver bullet.
'There's no point saying, 'Well, you could just push boats back'. It will not stop it. There are all sorts of issues with criminal gangs, smugglers, etc.' Ms Patel said of the French: 'I think it's fair to say they are overwhelmed. That is a fact.
'We are constantly pressing France on this and we're asking them to be honest with us about where the gaps are because they can't be everywhere. We have a very, very professional working relationship, but no one country can fix this on their own.'",-2
1724,"YOU COULD use a single word as a proxy. “Latinx” is a gender-neutral adjective which only 4% of American Hispanics say they prefer. Yet in 2018 the New York Times launched a column dedicated to “LatinX communities”. It has crept into White House press releases and a presidential speech. Google’s diversity reports use the even more inclusive “LatinX+”. A term once championed by esoteric academics has gone mainstream.
The espousal of new vocabulary is one sign of a social mobilisation that is affecting ever more areas of American life. It has penetrated politics and the press. Sometimes it spills out into the streets, in demonstrations calling for the abolition of police departments. It is starting to spread to schools. San Francisco’s education board, which for more than a year was unable to get children into classes, busied itself with stripping the names of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington from its schools, and ridding department names of acronyms such as VAPA (Visual and Performing Arts), on the ground that they are “a symptom of white supremacy”.

What links these developments is a loose constellation of ideas that is changing the way that mostly white, educated, left-leaning Americans view the world. This credo still lacks a definitive name: it is variously known as left-liberal identity politics, social-justice activism or, simply, wokeness. But it has a clear common thread: a belief that any disparities between racial groups are evidence of structural racism; that the norms of free speech, individualism and universalism which pretend to be progressive are really camouflage for this discrimination; and that injustice will persist until systems of language and privilege are dismantled.

These notions were incubated for years in the humanities departments of universities (elite ones in particular), without serious challenge. Moral panics about campus culture are hardly new, and the emergence of a new leftism in the early 2010s prompted little concern. Even as students began scouring the words of academics, administrators and fellow students for microaggressions, the oppressive slights embedded in everyday speech, and found them, complacency ruled. When invited speeches from people such as Christine Lagarde, then head of the International Monetary Fund, were cancelled after student activists accused her of complicity in “imperialist and patriarchal systems”, the response was a collective shrug.
The complacency was naive. America harboured a “Vegas campus delusion”, says Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an advocacy group. “What happens on campus will not stay on campus.” It has not. The influence of the new social-justice mindset is now being felt in the media, the Democratic Party and, most recently, businesses and schools.
How did this breakout happen? Three things helped prepare the ground: a disaffected student body, an academic theory that was malleable enough to be shaped into a handbook for political activism, and a pliant university administration.
First came a new generation of students keenly aware of unsolved social problems and willing to see old-fashioned precepts of academic freedom (such as open debate) as obstacles to progress. Various events—the financial crisis, the election of Donald Trump, the police killings of unarmed black men, especially that of George Floyd—fed frustration with traditional liberalism’s seeming inability to end long-run inequities. This hastened the adoption of an ideology that offered fresh answers.

In a book entitled “The Coddling of the American Mind”, Mr Lukianoff and a social psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, posit that overprotective parenting in the shadow of the war on terrorism and the great recession led to “safetyism”, a belief that safety, including emotional safety, trumps all other practical and moral concerns. Its bounds grew to require disinviting disfavoured campus speakers (see chart 1), protesting about disagreeable readings and regulating the speech of fellow students.
Many students latched onto a body of theory which yokes obscurantist texts to calls for social action (or “praxis”) that had been developing in the academy for decades. In 1965 Herbert Marcuse, a critical theorist, coined the phrase “repressive tolerance”, the notion that freedom of speech should be withdrawn from the political right in order to bring about progress, since the “cancellation of the liberal creed of free and equal discussion” might be necessary to end oppression. Another influence was Paulo Freire, a Brazilian educator whose “Pedagogy of the Oppressed” (published in English in 1970) advocated a liberatory pedagogy in the spirit of Mao’s Cultural Revolution in which “the oppressed unveil the world of oppression and through the praxis commit themselves to its transformation”.
The Great Awokening
Today the most prominent evangelists for what political scientists such as Zachary Goldberg call the Great Awokening are Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo. Both these scholar-activists have written bestselling books that sketch the expansive boundaries of systemic racism. Both minimise the role of intent, but in different ways. In Mr Kendi’s Manichaean worldview actions are either actively narrowing racial gaps, and are therefore anti-racist, or they are not, in which case they are racist. “Capitalism is essentially racist; racism is essentially capitalist,” he concludes.
Ms DiAngelo is concerned with the racism of everyday speech. For her, the intent of the oppressor is immaterial if an oppressed person deems the conduct to be offensive. How “white progressives cause more daily harm [to black people] than, say, white nationalists” is the subject of her latest book, “Nice Racism”. She sees liberal norms like individualism or the aspiration for colour-blind universalism as naive: “Liberalism doesn’t account for power, and the differential in power,” she says.
The embrace of this ideology by students and professors might have remained inconsequential had it not been for the part played by administrative staff. Since 2000, such staff in the University of California system has more than doubled, outpacing the increase in faculty and students. The growth in private universities has been even faster. Between 1975 and 2005 the ranks of administrators grew by 66% in public colleges but by 135% in private ones. As their headcount grew, so did their remit—ferreting out not just overt racism or sexual harassment but implicit bias too. The University of California, Los Angeles, now insists that faculty applying for tenure include a diversity statement.
In 2018 Samuel Abrams, a political scientist at Sarah Lawrence College, published data showing that these administrators are even more left-leaning than the professors: liberals outnumber conservatives by 12 to one. For writing about this, Mr Abrams faced a campaign by outraged students aiming to revoke his tenure. Campaigns by a vocal minority of activists have cast a pall on campus life, he says. “Large numbers of people hate this. They just don’t know what to do,” he laments. “They don’t want the mob coming to them.”
An upheaval in mass communication accelerated the trend. On Twitter, a determined minority can be amplified, and an uneasy centre-left can be cowed. “Weaponisation of social media became part of the game. But what I think nobody foresaw was that these tactics could so easily be imported to the New York Times or Penguin Random House or Google,” says Niall Ferguson, a historian at Stanford’s Hoover Institution. “The invasion…was just a case of the old problem: that liberals defer to progressives. And progressives defer to outright totalitarians.”
Mr Trump’s election added to centrists’ unease, leaving the poles to grow ever more extreme. “Anything but far-left progressivism was lumped in with Trump,” says one (Democratic) prosecutor in San Francisco. In the protest against Mr Trump’s handling of the Mexican border, for instance, the old Democratic line of enhanced border security and a path to citizenship for the long-term undocumented became passé. Progressives proved their sincerity by being in favour of abolishing immigration authorities entirely.
Having grown strong roots, social-justice consciousness has spread most readily to non-academic institutions largely peopled by those who have come through elite universities. As the students who have embraced this messy body of theory leave university, they enter into jobs and positions of influence. The question is whether, outside the ivory tower, the ideology will retain its intolerant and belligerent zeal, or whether it will mellow into a benign urge for society to be a little fairer.
Newspapers are a prime example. The digital revolution has devastated local newspapers and crowned new online-only champions. As newsrooms adapted by aping the upstarts, hacks who had risen through the ranks thanks to shoe-leather reporting were replaced by younger staffers stuffed with new ideas from elite universities. One prominent journalist argued for replacing “neutral objectivity” with “moral clarity”—making unflinching distinctions between right and wrong.
The urge to purge
Changes in newsrooms were also related to efforts to increase demographic diversity, on the assumption that this is the only authentic way to give voice to minorities. But the campus zeal for deplatforming voices deemed offensive and defenestrating those found guilty of violating the ethos has also been imported. (James Bennet, who resigned as editorial-page editor of the New York Times after one such row, now works for The Economist; he was not involved in this article.) Non-journalists on the staff of newspapers, including young engineers, can be even more activist in campaigning against colleagues judged to be producing content at odds with the new vision of social justice.
As with universities, this stridency met little rebuke from the heads of newsrooms. Lee Fang, a left-leaning journalist for “The Intercept”, an online publication specialising in “adversarial journalism”, was accused by a colleague of racism for posting an interview with an African-American supporter of Black Lives Matter who offered a personal criticism of the group. He was made to apologise.

The quiet cultural revolution has also affected the Democratic Party. A decade ago, around 40% of white liberals agreed that “racial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can’t get ahead these days”; today over 70% do (see chart 2). In 2013, according to Gallup, a pollster, 70% of Americans thought black-white race relations were going well; that has dropped to 42%. Among white conservatives and moderates, there has been little movement on such questions.

In the past decade a far greater share of white liberals than African-Americans came to believe that blacks should have “special favours” to get ahead (see chart 3). Ideas for promoting racial equity that once belonged to the Democrats’ left fringe have become mainstream. Cash reparations for African-Americans are supported by 49% of Democrats, for example, and 41% endorse reducing police funding.
Democratic politicians have responded. In 2008 Barack Obama criticised overheated sermons of his pastor, saying “they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country—a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America.” The pastor’s view is now ascendant among Democrats.
In 2016 Hillary Clinton started giving speeches on the need to end systemic racism. By 2020 this movement was the defining fault line of the presidential primary. Joe Biden, an avatar for Democratic consensus, won by taking positions far to the left of Mr Obama, including on matters of identity politics. That is why his administration speaks much more social-justice patois than Mr Obama’s ever did. And why it embraces reparations-adjacent policies like the creation of a $4bn fund to pay off the debts of only non-white farmers, and a proposal that 40% of benefits from climate-change investment go to previously disadvantaged communities.
Wokers of the world, unite!
This new political prominence makes the question of what happens to the ideology of social activism as it spreads beyond the ivory tower all the more important. Does it retain its purity and potency? Or does it become diluted?
The corporate world will be a big test. Businesses, particularly those in the knowledge economy, have been grappling with the challenge of how to respond to social-justice consciousness as young employees agitate for change and woke consumers threaten boycotts.
An increasingly common argument is that there is no trade-off between greater diversity and profits. “I’d like to get to a place where we thought that diverse representation was just as important as profitability, because we believed it was linked to so many things that were going to come back and drive value,” says Julie Coffman, the chief diversity officer of Bain  Company, a management consultancy. Others make an explicit business case. McKinsey, another consultancy, has released a stream of reports arguing that firms with greater ethnic and gender diversity have a greater chance of financial outperformance.
Since Floyd’s murder, American businesses have issued a dizzying number of equity-related missives and quotas for hiring and procurement. Facebook, a social-media giant, has promised to hire 30% more black people in leadership positions and has set a goal that “50% of our workforce be from underrepresented communities by the end of 2023”. Target, a retailer, has pledged to spend more than $2bn with black-owned businesses by the end of 2025. Walmart, another retail titan, has set up a Centre for Racial Equity and says it will give it $100m to “address the drivers of systemic racism”.
Importing the language of equity without university-style blow-ups can be difficult. “What you’re seeing is Gen Z or young millennials basically engaging in this collective war against the boomers and the Gen Xers who actually run the organisations,” says Antonio García Martínez, whom Apple fired in May after 2,000 employees circulated a petition questioning his hiring, citing passages they found to be misogynistic in an autobiography published five years ago. When Brian Armstrong, the boss of Coinbase, announced that workplace activism was to be discouraged, he was inundated with private messages of admiration from CEOs who felt that they could not do the same—and public criticism.
“Corporate wokeism I believe is the product of self-interest intermingled with the appearance of pursuing social justice,” says Vivek Ramaswamy, a former biotechnology executive and author of “Woke, Inc.”. He argues that Big Tech pursues corporate wokeism because appearing to embrace social justice suits such firms’ commercial interests—both in terms of recruitment and appeal to their customers. It performs allegiance to identity politics while simultaneously rejecting the left’s critique of capitalism. “A lot of Big Tech has agreed to bend to the progressive left,” he says, but “they effectively expect that the new left look the other way when it comes to leaving their monopoly power.”
Such hypocrisy is increasingly prevalent. The founder of Salesforce, a tech behemoth based in San Francisco, is known for championing social-justice causes like a surtax to fund homelessness services in the city. Yet the firm itself paid no federal taxes on $2.6bn in profits in 2020.
Wokeness’s next frontier, with the greatest potential to make a mark on the future, will be the classroom. In California’s recently approved ethnic-studies curriculum, which may become a high-school graduation requirement, one lesson plan aims to help students “dispel the model-minority myth” (the idea that to dwell on Asian-American success is wrong). Roughly one-sixth of the state’s proposed new maths instruction framework is devoted to social justice. It approvingly quotes from studies suggesting that word problems about boys and girls knitting scarves be accompanied by a debate about gender norms. Last month the governor of Oregon signed a bill eliminating high-school graduation requirements of proficiency in reading, writing and maths until 2024—justified as necessary to promote equity for non-white students.
Woker or weaker?
Such proposals hint at the difficulties of translating some of the theories embraced by the new left into policy. Because disparities are theorised to be the result of largely implicit discrimination, systems must be dismantled. This leads to odd conclusions: that racial test-score gaps in maths can be ameliorated by dialectic; and that not testing for the ability to read is a worthy substitute for teaching it. Material conditions that the old left cared about, such as persistent segregation in poor districts and schools, get little attention.
There are some signs of a backlash. Three members of San Francisco’s board of education, including its president, are under threat of a recall election. So is the city’s ultra-progressive district attorney. However, the underlying engine—the questionable ideas of some academics, and the generational change they are rendering—is not shutting off. America has not yet reached peak woke. ■

1725,"ONE SIDE-EFFECT of hosting an international climate conference is an outbreak of navel-gazing. As the UN extravaganza in Glasgow nears its end, many opinion polls and studies have appeared, which provide a superbly detailed view of how Britons think about climate change. They reveal a country committed to tackling global warming, but unfortunately drawn to the priciest ways of doing it.
Perhaps sensing that they ought to set a good example for their international guests, Britons have swung firmly behind the view that anthropogenic climate change is both real and alarming. One pollster, Ipsos MORI, finds that 81% believe that an environmental disaster looms unless habits change quickly. Old people’s opinions have changed most dramatically. A series of polls for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy reveal that 80% of over-64s are now concerned about climate change, up from 56% in 2012.

Britons have a lot on their minds these days, what with Brexit, covid-19 and inflation. That does not seem to matter. Whereas the financial crisis of 2007-08 was followed by a years-long recession in concern about climate change, the coronavirus pandemic suppressed interest only briefly (see chart). Lorraine Whitmarsh of the University of Bath suggested a decade ago that people have a “finite pool of worry” and that economic concerns had displaced environmental ones. She now thinks that climate change has become a core concern that cannot be pushed out of the pool.

What to do about it, though? Unsurprisingly, Britons are keen on climate mitigation policies in the abstract and less keen when they are presented with the probable costs of such policies. But if they must pay, they would rather do so, by a slight margin, through general taxation. Onward, a think-tank, reported on November 8th that 50% of people were prepared to pay higher taxes in order to reduce carbon emissions, whereas 46% would pay higher prices for goods. Low-earners were especially opposed to higher prices.
Politicians amplify this view. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, has for a decade campaigned successfully against any rise in fuel duty. That probably contributed to the fact that greenhouse-gas emissions from transport fell by just 2% between 2010 and 2019, even as emissions from all sources dropped by 26%. Mr Halfon is not a climate-change denier (“I believe in all of it,” he says). And he supports subsidies for electric vehicles. He merely opposes attempts to reduce demand by raising prices.
Britons are keener still on banning things. Another poll, in August, found that people would prefer policies that restrict the number of flights they can take and the quantity of meat they can eat to policies that increase the price of flying and the price of meat. Sir John Curtice, a psephologist at the University of Strathclyde, and others found that 44% support a ban on powerful vacuum cleaners. The proportion rose to 64% following an online discussion of the issue.
Economists usually favour market-based interventions such as carbon taxes, and disdain measures such as electric-car subsidies because of their inefficiency (some of the money goes to people who would have bought electric cars anyway). But ordinary Britons plainly disagree. Will Tanner of Onward suggests that is because they believe the cost of tackling global warming should be borne by society as a whole, and general taxation strikes them as a good way of achieving that. Blanket bans probably strike a nation inordinately fond of queuing as equitable, too.
This enthusiasm for inefficient ways of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions implies that Britain will end up spending far more than it needs to. That is frustrating. But the polls also suggest that Britons are in one sense ahead of their leaders. Adaptation to climate change has for years been the poor relation of mitigation. It is discussed less and often thought of as something that poorer countries need to do. Speaking at a session on adaptation in Glasgow on November 8th, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Britain’s trade secretary, touted a fund to assist Asian countries but said nothing about her own.
People seem to have noticed this, and are not happy. In late 2020 Ipsos MORI polled 30 rich and middle-income countries for the energy firm EDF. It found that just 30% of Britons believe that their government has taken measures to reduce the effects of climate change at home, such as building dams—the second-lowest proportion of any country after Italy. Politicians might call that judgment unfair. It would be better if they tried to change people’s minds through their actions.■

1726,"TO SEE HOW consumers have turned the shopping experience on its head, look not to humans but to pets, who hold the world to the highest standards of customer care. If any group has thrived during covid-19, it is the fur-coated crowd. According to Bernard Meunier of Purina PetCare, a brand with $15.4bn annual sales owned by Nestlé, the world’s largest food company, pet ownership has soared during the pandemic. So has the coddling of pets with expensive treats and all manner of pet-related googling, ranging from how to buy the perfect puppy to how to find CBD oil for arthritic retrievers (this correspondent’s fruitless quest in Britain).  
Purina exemplifies three ways in which the selling and manufacturing of products for pets is being transformed by digital engagement. The first is wholesale e-commerce; it sells pet food through sites such as Amazon or Chewy. In China more than half of pet food is sold online, compared with about a tenth elsewhere, Mr Meunier says. The second is selling direct to the consumer (or at least its owner), via subscriptions and other services. In 2018 Purina acquired a majority stake in Tails.com, a British firm that sells tailor-made dog food online. The close relationship between company and pet owner allows it to “personalise” the brand, as Mr Meunier puts it. And third, as its engagement with pet owners increases, Purina is exploring “the blurring of lines” between products and services. It has bought control of Wamiz, a pet-lovers’ website, and in 2019 took a minority stake in IVC Group, a European firm of vets.

Don’t expect Nestlé to personalise everything. Grocery shoppers remain mass consumers. The bulk of its products will fill supermarket shelves or online baskets for the foreseeable future, says Jordi Bosch, global head of sales at Nestlé. But the more options consumers have for where to shop, and the more information they have at their fingertips about what to buy, the more manufacturers need to adapt their products, whether they are Nespresso coffee pods or varied pack sizes of Nescafé.
Bacardi, a global spirits giant, shows how deeper connection with customers can bring new razzle-dazzle to brands, according to Mike Birch, its head of digital commerce. During lockdown, it hosted live-streamed whisky-tasting on Amazon, introduced espresso martini cocktail kits for at-home “mixologists”, and sought to tickle single-malt whisky influencers with an Aberfeldy Scotch dubbed “The Loch Down”.

As yet, few manufacturers in the West are milking their customer data for more than clever sales and marketing campaigns. But in China a new approach to production is emerging: “consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M).” There are several versions, but in essence, C2M makes use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) gathered by tech platforms to identify the latest shopping trends. Influenced by this, manufacturers then make specialised products directly for consumers, cutting out intermediaries. With more direct insights about customer demands, there is less need to create excess-inventory buffers, improving margins and reducing waste.
Pinduoduo (PDD) is one of the platforms that has pioneered the trend. David Liu, its vice-president of strategy, says that since it began C2M in 2018, it has worked with 1,500 manufacturers, making about 4,000 types of product and generating 460m accumulated orders from its 730m customers. One example is robot vacuum-cleaners. High-end versions sell for 3,000 yuan (about $500) making them affordable for many in China’s richest cities, but less so in poorer ones. So PDD worked with a manufacturer to produce a much cheaper version, proving via its data that demand existed, and allowing the manufacturer to use after-sales data to improve the product. Anecdotally, it reckons some fast-fashion firms and factories can shorten the time from conception to market to a few weeks.
PDD is also using agritech to help 12m farmers in its network cultivate products that customers want. For instance, it has launched what Mr Liu calls an “AI versus human strawberry-planting competition,” pitting teams of veteran strawberry farmers against teams backed by digital technology. The former produced slightly sweeter strawberries, but the latter did it more efficiently, Mr Liu says. A fringe benefit is that regulators look kindly on the digitalisation of agriculture, he adds.
Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce platform, also has a thriving C2M unit. Early in the pandemic, it noticed a sharp rise in demand for alcohol-based car-cleaning supplies to stop the spread of infections. It approached Odis, a company making car-cleaning products whose sales were cratering, and suggested it bring out portable sanitising sprays instead. It did so within three days, not the three months normally needed to create a new product. Customers were able to pre-order the spray even before manufacturing started. More than 200,000 were sold within 24 hours. ■",2
1727,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Google is making its largest-ever investment in Australia, after a clash with the government that saw the tech giant threaten to shut down search there earlier this year.CEO Sundar Pichai announced Monday that the company would devote 1 billion Australian dollars (about $736 million) to the country over the next five years.The funds will go, in part, toward launching the firm's first research hub in Australia, as well as helping develop the nation's cloud computing sector. Google (GOOGL) also plans to team up with an Australian government agency on scientific research, which will include projects on clean energy and protection of the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, the firm will partner with a local university on quantum computing.Google, which has been in Australia for two decades and now employs nearly 2,000 people locally, said that the new initiative is expected to help create new jobs and spur innovation.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison praised the move Tuesday, calling it ""a $1 billion vote of confidence"" in Australia's economic strategy. Morrison's government has previously outlined plans to turn Australia into ""a top digital economy by 2030,"" working to bolster its capabilities in artificial intelligence, among other areas.Speaking at a Google office in Sydney on Tuesday, Morrison emphasized that the plan ""doesn't mean we're trying to be the next Silicon Valley.""But he said that the company's program would help create more than 6,000 jobs and add about 6.7 billion Australian dollars ($4.9 billion) of value to the economy.""Our challenge, as we emerge from this pandemic in a very challenging world, is to secure Australia's economic recovery,"" Morrison added. ""That is the challenge we face as we move into 2022, and Australia's digital strategy is central to securing that recovery."" Turning the pageGoogle's bet on Australia appears to somewhat reset the complicated relationship it's had with the country's users and government in recent months. The company has in the past publicly tussled with regulators over legislation that requires both Google and Facebook (FB) to pay publishers for news content. For months, Google vehemently argued against the proposed law. At one point last year, it even used its homepage to warn Australians that the proposed law would harm their ability to search and lead to ""consequences"" for YouTube users. Regulators at the time accused the company of spreading ""misinformation.""Tensions came to a head in January, when the company threatened to pull its search engine in the country if the law moved forward.But as a vote on the bill approached, Google took a different tack. It tried to get ahead of the legislation by announcing partnerships with some of the country's largest newsrooms, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NWS) and Seven West Media.Meanwhile, the spotlight largely turned to Facebook, which abruptly banned news content in Australia in February over the proposed law. Facebook later restored access to those pages after Australia made some changes to the code. The law was ultimately passed in February, with Google's strategy cheered by media organizations and politicians alike.Morrison addressed some of the company's past issues on Tuesday, saying ""the fact that Google has decided to invest in the way that they have ... seals [our] partnership.""""We have already worked together with the tech sector on so many fronts, and there are so many more that we need to work on,"" he said.— Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.",0
1728,"EVOLUTION ENSURES that animals are well-adapted to their circumstances. Sometimes, as with predators and prey, those circumstances include the behaviour of other creatures. And, as a paper just published in Science describes, that includes the behaviour of human beings, which can force drastic changes on a species in an evolutionary eyeblink.
Shane Campbell-Staton, a biologist at Princeton University, studies how animals adapt to human creations like cities and pollution. His interest was piqued by a film about the tuskless female elephants of Gorongosa National Park, in Mozambique. Their lack of tusks was thought to be a consequence of another human creation—the Mozambican civil war, which lasted from 1977 to 1992 and was partly paid for by the killing of elephants for their ivory. Around 90% of the pachyderms living in Gorongosa are thought to have been killed. Biologists therefore wondered if rising tusklessness might be an adaptation to make elephants less attractive to human hunters.

It was a plausible theory, says Dr Campbell-Staton, but no one had actually tested it. Through a mix of old video footage and surveys, he and his colleagues concluded that around 18% of the female elephants in Gorongosa lacked tusks before the war. Three decades later, after it was over, that number had risen to 50%. Computer simulations suggested that the likelihood of such a rapid change happening by chance, even in a diminished population, was tiny.
Besides confirming the change, the researchers managed to unravel its genetic roots. Tusklessness is caused by a mutation in a gene on the elephantine X chromosome. (As with humans, two X chromosomes make a female, while an X and a Y make a male.) Unfortunately for males, the mutation is a package deal, coming with changes to nearby genes that interfere with embryonic development. Males who inherit the mutant gene die before birth. Females can avoid the lethal side-effects if one of their two X chromosomes contains a non-mutated gene—but they will still grow up without tusks.
Fortunately for the females, the specifics of how the mutant gene is inherited make it impossible for them to inherit two copies. Since mutant males die before being born, those which survive to reproductive age carry only non-mutated versions of the X chromosome, ensuring that their daughters will have at least one copy too.
At the moment, the continual reintroduction of non-mutant X chromosomes from males puts a limit on how far tusklessness can spread through the female population. But, given time and genetic recombination, says Dr Campbell-Staton, evolution might disentangle the mutation for tusklessness from the maladaptive mutations in its neighbouring genes, opening the door for males to shed their tusks, too. There are occasional rumours, he says, of tuskless male elephants in the wild, but—so far at least—no firm evidence.
Finding one now seems unlikely. With the war over, the evolutionary pressure from poaching has eased. Tusks have gone back to being useful tools, helping their owners strip bark from trees and dig for water. In recent years the prevalence of tuskless females has fallen, to around 33%. But the speed of the change is a reminder that wars can alter evolutionary history as well as the human sort. ■",2
1729,"AMERICA’S CLAIM to exceptionalism is undeniable when it comes to gun culture. Its residents own 46% of the world’s 860m civilian-held guns, according to Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based research outfit. There are 120.5 firearms per 100 American residents—more than twice the number of second-place Yemen, a country at war. In a Gallup poll 40% of gunslingingers said they owned weapons for hunting. But what explains support for less mainstream pro-gun views such as arming teachers and carrying weapons in public? A recent study by Christopher Ellison, Benjamin Dowd-Arrow, Amy Burdette and three other sociologists delves into an important but overlooked motivating factor that highlights the role of religion.
A survey of 1,572 American adults found that, apart from religious denomination or religious conservatism, belief in the devil, demons and hell is a strong predictor of eight pro-gun beliefs, including arming teachers, carrying concealed firearms and bearing high-capacity defensive weapons. A Catholic who believes in supernatural evil is more likely to hold pro-gun views than a Protestant who does not believe that Satan is corrupting souls, and vice versa.

The analysis, which controls for political ideology and other demographic factors, found that each step up on a four-point scale measuring the strength of belief in supernatural evil correlated with 32% more support for arming teachers, and a 38% rise in backing for carrying concealed weapons. The effect of belief in supernatural evil on support for the right to carry concealed guns was roughly the same as having conservative politics or not possessing a college degree, but smaller than the effect of gender.
“The conviction that there is a cosmic battle between ultimate good and ultimate evil being waged on earth as well as in the spiritual realm may make the world seem uncertain, risky and threatening,” the authors suggest, since “individuals may display their propensity for evil at any moment.” Gun restrictions are seen as threatening God-given rights to protect society against agents of evil, a belief the National Rifle Association plays up through its use of religious and civic-duty language in its adverts. Another study has shown that alt-right groups that support militias and profess strident pro-gun views draw on the language of biblical literalists, asserting that they are fighting a devilish government.
Uncertainty stemming from the covid-19 pandemic has added to the moral uncertainty associated with pro-gun beliefs. Background checks run by the FBI, the best national proxy for gun purchases, jumped 40% in 2020 compared with 2019. That is the biggest increase in the last 20 years, and purchases have continued to rise. A preliminary study of a poll of 2,700 American residents done by NORC, a research institute at the University of Chicago, found that Americans who bought a gun during the pandemic were (as has long been the case) mostly white, male, conservative and less educated. But the authors also found that those new gun owners had recently become more religious or become unemployed, and were more likely to be in their late teens, twenties, or thirties—rather than middle-aged.
The Supreme Court heard arguments on November 3rd regarding restrictions on New Yorkers’ ability to carry concealed weapons. It is one of the most important gun-rights cases since Justice Antonin Scalia’s landmark ruling in 2008 supporting the right to keep weapons at home for self-defence. Scalia, too, believed the Devil is a “real person”.

1730," (CNN)Right now, federal agencies are negotiating a possible settlement with migrant families that could provide compensation for separating children from their parents in 2018 under the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy. And conservatives are not having it.Since The Wall Street Journal reported last month that settlements with the families could reach $450,000 per person, and the total buyout could be $1 billion or more, Republican lawmakers have been in an uproar. On Fox News, former Vice President Mike Pence blasted such a plan as ""totally unacceptable,"" while Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama condemned the idea as ""abhorrent and borderline evil.""   Between 2017 and 2018, about 5,600 families were separated under the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of some of the families in 2019, alleging constitutional and civil rights violations. It is these negotiations that are ongoing.  Whatever the final amount, the victims of family separations deserve compensation. Both policy and historical precedent support paying a financial settlement to those affected by the horrific practice. It is the right thing to do for the migrant families who will suffer the consequences of the separations for the rest of their lives.  Certainly, the victims of family separations suffered immense trauma. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that such separations were ""child abuse,"" while Physicians for Human Rights called it ""torture."" Children were detained in punitive conditions, often thousands of miles from their parents. Some children, alone in government care or in foster homes, allegedly experienced physical and sexual abuse.   These outcomes were known to the administration. Trump even said the family separations were intended to serve as a deterrent for unauthorized migration. A former deputy director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement told a Senate committee that he warned officials about the devastating consequences of family separations, but the Trump administration went ahead with the policy anyway.  Providing these families with compensation would be a public acknowledgment that the US government harmed them. The money would enable families to access the health and psychological care that they and their children will need in the years ahead. It would serve as a warning to future administrations that such a policy should never be pursued again.  The government has provided reparations to certain groups in the past. In 1988, Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act, which paid out $20,000 to Japanese Americans interned in the camps during World War II. The government also paid out moneys to members of Alaska's Aleut community, who were forcibly relocated during the same war. Similar actions have occurred at the local level, too. In 1994, Florida approved over $2 million settlement for Black victims of a 1923 racial massacre, while, in 2016, Chicago paid more than $5 million to police torture victims.  One difference in these cases is that restitution was made decades after the harm was inflicted, meaning that some victims never lived to receive settlements. With family separation victims, the government can act now, when compensation can make the most difference in migrant families' lives.  President Joe Biden has sent mixed messages about settlements for migrant families. He called reports of the $450,000 proposal ""garbage"" and said, ""That's not going to happen."" A White House spokesperson later walked back his comments, saying the President would be ""perfectly comfortable"" with a settlement for a lower amount. But that shouldn't be Biden's decision to make. The settlements are being negotiated by the ACLU and the federal agencies. The President should respect their expertise and let the negotiations proceed without inserting himself into them.   Of course, conservative media has seized on this issue, claiming that the US is rewarding ""illegal immigrants"" for coming to this country without authorization. Yet any reparations for migrants would be due to the fact that the US government separated parents and children. These migrants were refugees and asylum-seekers, exercising their legal rights to humanitarian relief. And consider that no amount of money can undo the pain and suffering these families went through, or give parents back the time they lost with their children. If conservatives are outraged by such payouts of taxpayer money, they should be angry at the administration that committed these abuses, not its victims.   As Americans prepare to gather for the holidays, it is worth reflecting on the value of family, regardless of immigration status. Vulnerable parents and children were harmed by the previous administration, and the government now has the opportunity to make restitution. Migrants deserve economic compensation for the horror of family separations.   ",0
1731,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. knowledge-sharing website Quora Inc has kicked off preparations for an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2022, according to people familiar with the matter.
Quora has in recent days held talks to hire investment bankers and lawyers for a stock market debut in New York, the sources said. The Mountain View, California-based company was valued at around $2 billion in a private funding round in 2019, and hopes to be worth more than twice that in an IPO, one of the sources added.
The sources, who requested anonymity because the preparations are confidential, cautioned that the timing and size of the flotation are subject to market conditions and could change.
A Quora spokesperson said the company does not ""comment on rumors.""
Quora's listing plans come on the heels of a record-breaking year for IPOs. A number of big-name tech startups including Stripe, Instacart, Rappi and GoPuff are preparing to go public next year, sources have told Reuters.  read more

1732,"One of Ghislaine Maxwell's accusers had a hand in setting up Tom Parker Bowles in a newspaper cocaine sting in the 90s, it has been reported.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is expected to appear as a witness for the prosecution at Maxwell's trial which is due to start on November 29 and is set to be the trial of the century.
But, according to the Telegraph, it has now come to light that the woman was paid up to £40,000 to help a tabloid newspaper set up Mr Parker Bowles, son of the Duchess of Cornwall, as part of a well-publicized sting in 1999.
The newspaper reports that the incident may be brought up during Maxwell's trial as part of the defence's bid to undermine the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
In the sting, which took place in 1999, Mr Parker Bowles was secretly filmed offering to buy cocaine for the woman, who was used by the tabloid because she knew Mr Parker Bowles at the time. 
He also admitted using cocaine himself with 'someone he found last night' while working in France. 
Mr Parker Bowles, who was 24 at the time and working as a publicist, was caught in the sting while at the Cannes Film Festival and the incident was splashed over five pages of the News of the World. 
In contemporary reports, Parker Bowles was described as 'contrite' while it was said Prince Charles, who was then a patron of the drugs charity Phoenix House, was 'fairly cross' with the 24-year-old and scolded him for having been caught up in the sting. 
The Telegraph also adds that another witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has previously been arrested for possession of cocaine and use of drug paraphernalia.
Ghislaine, a British socialite and daughter of the late Robert Maxwell who is currently in a New York jail, is due to stand trial in the United States in just over a week.
Maxwell, 59, is charged with sex trafficking, with prosecutors claiming she helped pedophile Jeffrey Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately sexually abuse young girls.
She has pleaded not guilty, and the trial is expected to begin on November 29. 
Earlier this month, Maxwell spoke to The Mail on Sunday for the first time about her 'living hell' behind bars – claiming that she has been assaulted and abused by prison guards, purposely deprived of sleep and given rotting food to eat.
Maxwell, who had her $28million (£21M) bail application denied for the fourth time last week, also claimed negative media coverage while she has been in custody and the deliberate withholding of evidence have made it 'impossible' for her to receive a fair trial. ",-2

""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",3
1734,"A woman who suffered eight cardiac arrests while hospitalised with Covid after refusing the vaccine has now urged others to get the jab.
Gemma Roberts, 35, had to be revived eight times by medical staff at Warrington Hospital after her heart stopped multiple times. 
On August 11 of this year, she was rushed to hospital and placed on a ventilator after contracting coronavirus. 
The former Eddie Stobart employee told The Mirror that after initially being rushed to hospital, she pleaded with doctors not to let her die and that she rang her partner Sophie to tell her she was being put to sleep. 
She said: 'I wish I had the vaccine before, I think everyone should have it now.
'I was one of those people that was scared of having the jab. I heard it had killed people.
'I took a chance and I almost didn't pull through. Medical professionals saved my life, that's who I will listen to now.'
She added that she felt guilty for having put her family through such stress.
During her time in hospital, Gemma also contracted sepsis twice, which partner Sophie Holmes, 39, said caused a large rash to appear. 
Gemma initially tested positive for Covid-19 after taking a lateral flow test, followed by a PCR test.
She said she thought she was just hungover following a wedding party the weekend before because she had been feeling tired, sick and out of breath.
After her positive tests, she was told she would be taken to hospital so medical personnel could administer her with oxygen before letting her go again. 
Partner Sophie said that she was told two days after being admitted to hospital that she was going to be put to sleep - before she suffered cardiac arrest on August 14. 
She was brought back by medical staff before suffering a further two in the following days.
Then, on August 31 she suffered four cardiac arrests on a single day after having been on a ventilator for three weeks.
One more cardiac arrest followed, and she was eventually taken off of a ventilator at the beginning of October.
However, upon waking up, she discovered that she couldn't move her arms or legs.
She has since worked with physio staff to allow her to walk again with the use of a walking aid - and Sophie even proposed. ",-2
1735,"Editor’s note: On August 26th, shortly after this article was published, two explosions outside Kabul airport killed dozens, including both Afghan civilians and American troops. This followed warnings that a group affiliated to Islamic State might carry out bombings at the airport. Our report on the explosions and their implications for the evacuation from Afghanistan can be found here. In this article we look at how the jihadist threat could spread around the world.
WHEN A NEW American president takes office, the leaders of other countries compete to be the first to speak to him. When the Taliban took over Kabul, there was a similar rush to speak to Abdul Ghani Baradar, the public face of the Afghan militant group’s leadership. The winner was Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, the Islamist group which controls the Gaza Strip. The read-out of the call posted on Hamas’s website has Mr Haniyeh congratulating Mr Baradar on his victory against the “American occupation” of Afghanistan. It would, he said, be “a prelude to the demise of all occupation forces, foremost of which is the Israeli occupation of Palestine”. Mr Baradar responded in kind, wishing Hamas “victory and empowerment as a result of their resistance”.
Such diplomatic niceties were matched with an outpouring of celebration from other jihadists. In the Idlib province of Syria, occupied by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group thought to have ties to al-Qaeda, the organisation which launched the attacks of September 11th 2001, fighters held a parade and handed out baklava on street corners. Three days of celebration were announced in the districts of southern Somalia controlled by al-Shabab, another al-Qaeda affiliate (pictured, training, above). On social media jihadists from all over the world shared memes celebrating the Taliban’s victory, notably a pastiche of Joe Rosenthal’s famous picture of American marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.

America and its allies invaded Afghanistan on October 7th 2001. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, was living there under the protection of the Taliban, who were also providing his al-Qaeda followers with training facilities. America demanded that the Taliban hand him over; they refused. Within weeks anti-Taliban forces had driven them from Kabul with the help of American air power and ground forces.
Since then America has not suffered a terrorist attack on anywhere near the same scale. And as an organised, and organising, force, al-Qaeda is a shadow of what it was. Osama bin Laden is dead, killed in Pakistan, to which he had retreated, in 2011. The fear of a similar end, delivered by drone or special forces, forces his successors to live in hiding, thus hugely complicating their operations. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian who became al-Qaeda’s leader after bin Laden’s death, has not been seen in almost a year—either through fear of death or because he has actually died. Though affiliates like al-Shabab have celebrated the Taliban’s victory, al-Qaeda’s central organisation has not said a word.
But the violent jihadist Islamism it pioneered has not been defeated. Al-Qaeda affiliates and other jihadist groups are active in conflicts not just in Pakistan and the Middle East but across the African Sahel and in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Not all those who embrace the label truly see themselves as part of a global struggle; many are more focused on their “near enemies” than the “far enemy” of America and its Western allies. But struggles with near enemies still bring about suffering, destroy livelihoods and force people to leave their lands, becoming refugees. They breed instability.

The ability to mount outrages like that of September 11th has apparently been curtailed by better intelligence, pressure on finances and a drumbeat of raids and drone strikes. But jihadist doctrines continue to inspire attacks by loner jihadists in America and Europe, though currently not at the rate seen in the mid-2010s. And the fight against jihadism entails, or acts as a pretext for, all manner of human-rights abuses—most notably in western China, where it is used as justification for the systematic oppression of the Uyghur and other largely Muslim groups.
As jihadist ideology has been espoused ever more widely, Western countries have sent troops, advisers and money to more and more places. Counter-terrorism and “countering violent extremism” have become worldwide industries. In 2020 America had 7,000 active troops stationed in a dozen or so African countries, plus training missions in 40 more, with militant Islamism the predominant focus.
The Taliban’s return to power is undoubtedly the most trumpetable moment for jihadists since Islamic State (IS) took advantage of Sunni disaffection to create a “caliphate” in western Iraq and eastern Syria in 2014. That inspired terror attacks in Europe and Indonesia. This victory is in some ways a greater one. For the first time since the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in 1989, Islamists have taken a country from a superpower. “Everyone else is saying, wow, if those guys can do it, so can we,” says David Kilcullen, a former soldier and counter-terrorism expert at UNSW Canberra, the military academy of the Australian Defence Force. “They’re dazzled, amazed and impressed by what the Taliban have achieved,” says Mina Al-Lami, who follows media used by violent and non-violent Islamists alike for BBC Monitoring.

What that means in practice will depend on how things play out in Afghanistan, how well the morale boost is transformed into victory on the ground, and how the countries the jihadists are targeting respond.
It’s cold outside
Militant Islamism did not start with the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Its intellectual origins go back to the 1950s and 1960s, when radicals in Egypt began to develop a new ideology based on the rejection of socialism and capitalism and the secular, nationalist regimes in thrall to them. Sayyid Qutb, a leader of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, became the movement’s great theorist. In America, to which he had fled to escape the attention of the Egyptian secret police, he was radicalised by his disgust at the natives’ morals and sexual mores, which represented “the nadir of primitiveness”. His driving motivation was the idea that Muslims were being brutalised by the regimes in their own countries which aped the materialism of such irreligious others.
Qutb was executed by the Egyptian authorities in 1966; the Muslim Brotherhood which he had reshaped continued in various countries, often underground. But in the Soviet-occupied Afghanistan of the 1980s his ideas took on a new form, going beyond resistance to individual regimes to become a worldwide armed struggle sometimes known as Salafi jihadism.
The Soviet Union’s invasion in 1979 had prompted hundreds of fighters from across the Muslim world to head to Afghanistan to join the mujahideen, or “holy warriors”. Bin Laden, a young Saudi who had inherited a fortune from his father’s construction firm and who studied under Qutb’s younger brother Mohammed, was one. So was Aden Hashi Farah Aero, one of the founders of al-Shabab. Abdelmalek Droukdel, one of the founders of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a group that fights in Niger and Mali, was there too, as was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the founders of what became IS. In Afghanistan they saw the beginnings of a jihad that would eventually lead to a truer, purer existence in submission to God.
Their common origin and faith, and their shared espousal of a lofty goal and barbarous tactics, does not make the world’s jihadis a united front. The fighters in Iraq who founded IS did so because they thought al-Qaeda too soft: the Afghan branch of IS has been in a bitter war with the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan for years. It was one of the few Islamist groups not to express admiration after the fall of Kabul, instead denouncing the Taliban as, in effect, American lackeys. The group’s newsletter, al-Naba, sneered that “Supporting Islam does not pass through the hotels of Qatar nor the embassies of Russia, China and Iran”, referring to the Taliban’s political offices in Doha and its relations with infidel states. As The Economist went to press, there were warnings that an IS-affiliated group was planning an attack on Kabul airport.
The animosity is reciprocated. The only execution the Taliban have admitted to since taking over was of Abu Omar Khorasani, IS’s leader in South Asia. But IS is an outlier. Mr Kilcullen is not alone in fearing that the Taliban may again allow Afghanistan to become a base for other jihadis. In the deal negotiated with America in Doha in 2020 the Taliban promised to disavow al-Qaeda and its international mission. They never did so. According to a UN estimate there may be between 400 and 600 members of al-Qaeda in the country, many sheltered by the Taliban.
Sirajuddin Haqqani, the Taliban’s deputy leader, runs a particularly brutal semi-autonomous outfit called the Haqqani network which, among other things, used to serve as Mr al-Zawahiri’s connection to the Taliban. (If the al-Qaeda leader is still alive it may well still do so.) Members of the Haqqani branch of the Taliban have been prominent in patrolling Kabul since it fell to the militants.
Such connections do not mean that al-Qaeda will be able to swank about with impunity rebuilding its operations. The Taliban are unlikely to want anyone to start planning attacks on America or Europe, certainly not straight away. “For now al-Qaeda is lying low due to instructions from the Afghan Taliban,” says Asfandyar Mir of Stanford University. But the Afghan regime change could nonetheless spread jihad to targets closer by.

A particular concern is Pakistan. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a jihadist group commonly called the Pakistani Taliban, waged a savage war there from 2007 until around 2014, when they were for the most part pushed back into Afghanistan. Having licked its wounds and regrouped, the TTP, many members of which are affiliated to al-Qaeda, has recently been stepping up its activities, with 120 attacks in Pakistan last year and 26 last month. The return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan has already emboldened the TTP, and could well see it better supplied.
The Pakistani government has long backed the Taliban in various ways. It will welcome the weakening of Indian influence in Afghanistan heralded by their return to power. Militants it supports in Indian-administered Kashmir may well get a boost from Afghan fighters flowing back over the Hindu Kush. On Pakistani television on August 23rd the chairman of the party of Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, said that “the Taliban say they're with us and they will come and liberate Kashmir for us.” Though a renewed TTP poses a problem, Pakistan probably thinks it can be kept in check by diplomatic and economic pressure. Afghanistan depends on Pakistan for a lot of imported goods. That said, now that the Taliban are back in power, they may feel they need Pakistan less.
A direct flow of materiel or soldiers from Afghanistan to conflicts beyond South Asia seems less likely. The al-Qaeda affiliates in Africa and the Middle East may have been founded by men who fought in Afghanistan, but they have fewer direct links to the country today. Travelling to and from Afghanistan is harder than it was in the 1990s, says Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute, an American think-tank, and harder than it was to travel to Syria when IS was in its pomp.
Dunes and dooms
Even if it does not lead to direct support from the Taliban, though, America’s departure from Afghanistan will be a huge morale boost to jihadis. This may be especially true in conflicts where outsiders are involved on the government’s side. Keep on fighting, the lesson runs, and eventually the foreigners will give up and leave—even if they have been there for decades. And then you will win.
That may be right. In June Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, promised that French forces in the Sahel, the region defined by the southern edge of the Sahara desert, would not remain there “eternally”. The deployment of the country’s force there, a mission known as Operation Barkhane, began in 2013 after jihadists seized the northern half of Mali. The Sahel’s jihadis have kept the force, which now numbers 5,100, busy ever since.

America has been part of the same fight. It built a huge military base in Agadez in Niger, another of the “G5” countries in the Sahel facing jihadist insurgents. (The other three are Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania.) It also deployed around 800 fighters in its special forces to Somalia, where they carried out raids on al-Shabab and co-ordinated more than 200 drone strikes.
Last December Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of most American troops from Somalia. Drone strikes were also stopped, though in July they started up again, under tightened rules of engagement. European funding for African troops in Somalia has been cut; Ethiopia, which has occupied parts of Somalia since 2009, is pulling its soldiers out to fight its own civil war in Tigray. France has begun a process by which Barkhane will have be halved in size and focusing more on killing terrorists than on protecting towns and cities. “As Africans, we face our day of reckoning just as some sense the West is losing its will for the fight,” wrote Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria, in the Financial Times on August 15th.
The Western withdrawal is not from a position of success. What happened in Kabul could be re-enacted in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab has been using Taliban-like tactics for some time, says Samira Gaid, the director of the Hiraal Institute, a security think-tank in Mogadishu. They undermine the government and international forces with terrorist attacks, while running a shadow government, even in government-controlled areas, to pay their fighters.
Much like the Taliban, they thrive on providing residents with a modicum of security beyond the gift of a failing state. Their violence is not popular, says Hussein Sheikh Ali, also of Hiraal, but their efficiency is admired. “If there is a man with a checkpoint and he gives you his word, you get it; if there’s a judge in their court and he says something, it will be enforced.” By contrast, the internationally recognised Somali state is repeatedly ranked as the world’s most corrupt.
In the Sahel over 700 people have been massacred by al-Qaeda and IS so far this year. The latest attack, in a Malian village near the border with Niger on August 8th, killed 51. This somewhat undercuts the opinion of Marc Conruyt, the French general who commanded Barkhane until July, that “the Sahelian forces are [today] able to cope with the armed terrorist groups.”
Worse than the old boss
Since the militants tend to recruit among the Tuareg and Fulani minorities from the north of Mali, men from those groups are often crudely profiled by soldiers from the south of the country, where the militants are less pervasive. Ethnicity is not the only thing which can lead to an attack. So can wearing underpants (most Malians do not, so this is seen as evidence of having been in Libya). “People I know who have had fathers, brothers and sons killed then joined the militants,” says Corinne Dufka, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a charity based in New York.
The response to Islamist terrorism promoted by the West has often focused far too tightly on training security forces, says Michael Keating, a former British diplomat who has worked in both Somalia and Afghanistan and is now the director of the European Institute of Peace, a think-tank. It would be better to provide political space for them to operate in. “There’s this tremendous focus on training, comms, all of the technical stuff,” he says. But “actually if you’re going to build a sustainable institution, you’ve got to make sure that the institutions are extremely well grounded.”

In Somalia, where British and Turkish troops have been training the security forces, getting them to fight is not only a question of their technical abilities. It is a matter of building up local institutions worth fighting for. The same is true of the defence forces fighting in the G5 countries.
So what happens if the jihadists succeed? Few Islamist militants anywhere in the world have got as far as being able to govern much more than villages and rural districts. When they spread more widely, popular support is often vital. When IS took over the Iraqi city of Mosul they were initially welcomed by mostly-Sunni residents, who saw them as an alternative to the violence and corruption of the Shia-dominated Iraqi security services. Governments supported by America or Europe tend towards corruption as their officials look to make money from the spending being pumped in long-distance.
The new bosses provided services long neglected by the government, such as streamlined electricity bills and rubbish collection. And their installation saw a welcome fall in terrorist violence, since they had been responsible for much of that which had been going on before.
Nevertheless, they were also committed to a caliphate run along what they took to be the lines of the earliest Muslim civilisation. They quickly banned women from travelling outside alone, cracked down on vices such as smoking and drinking and started persecuting religious minorities. The level of popular dissatisfaction with those in power soon surpassed that which had originally seen them welcomed.
Money matters, too. While fighting, jihadists are able to extort revenue by taxing traffic on the roads and illicit industries; the Taliban have done well from opium production. In power they typically need more revenue and cannot raise it in the same ways without delegitimising themselves. In Syria and Iraq IS developed a lucrative taste for ransoming foreigners. In Mozambique the jihadists who took over Cabo Delgado in early August have subsequently relied on looting banks and running extortion rackets on businesses. This means that they can pay their fighters, procure arms and continue the struggle. But the money gathered by looting or hostage-taking dries up. Foreign currency ceases to flow. Things get desperate.
Some of the same fate may await the Taliban. Before Kabul fell, the teachers who worked in schools and the doctors in clinics in Taliban-occupied territories were still paid by the central government in Kabul—and in turn by foreign donors. Taxing the transport of, say, fuel only works if there is foreign currency to pay for it. Afghanistan’s reserves, which are largely held with the Federal Reserve in New York, are now frozen; it is not clear whether bilateral aid to the government will continue. There will still be ways to bleed the economy. But those giving the blood are liable to resent doing so.
Pen and sword
Jihad is not, in principle, the only way to get the strict Islamist states its followers desire. They could in theory be voted for. Governments with significant Islamist representation have had success in parts of Asia. But attempts to institute fully Islamist governments in the Arab world have proved strongly susceptible to backlash when their initial popularity wanes. The Muslim Brotherhood ruled Egypt for less than two years before a coup returned them to powerlessness, jail and worse. Last month, Tunisia’s president sounded the death-knell on Islamism’s participation in politics by dissolving the parliament in which an Islamist leader was speaker.
Tempting, then, to see the sword as mightier than the pen. Islamists who recall Egypt’s former Muslim Brotherhood leader, Muhammad Badie, appealing to his followers to face down tanks with peaceful activism say such ideas are now mocked and denounced online. “The Taliban is capturing the popular imagination. When you express your thoughts against this violence, many attack you. It’s a bit worrying,” says Osama Gaweesh, an Egyptian journalist exiled in London. With poverty soaring and politics constrained in many Middle Eastern states, frustrations crave an outlet. Some speak of a renewed faith in mass action, this time carrying guns modelled on the Taliban. “They’ve given up trusting bankrupt and elite Islamist parties and organisations,” says Naim Tilawi, a Jordanian Islamist who fought in Syria. “They want mass jihadism instead.” ■",2
1736,"THE FIGHT against covid-19 has been a propaganda boon for the Communist Party. China swiftly crushed the disease and allowed its economy to return to near normal, even as much of the rest of the world struggled to cope. State media have crowed. “The advantages of the leadership system of the Chinese Communist Party and the shortcomings of the capitalist party system have been shown up in clear contrast,” said an article by the party’s discipline-enforcement agency. Many Chinese, though initially critical of officials’ cover-up of the outbreak, seem to agree that the party has triumphed.
In the West, many wonder if China was partly responsible for the pandemic, by failing to respond sooner to early signs of a new coronavirus and by keeping news of it secret—or even by allowing the virus to escape from a laboratory in Wuhan. China’s censors tolerate no such speculation. State media report only on the party’s resolute response, the results of which are clear. The country has had few cases for months and most of these were attributable to imported infections.

China’s efforts have involved not just mobilising the obvious people like medical staff, community health workers, scientists and police. It has also made extensive use of the party’s network of branches to provide manpower and management expertise for a party-led operation on a scale rarely seen in the post-Mao era. In the early months village perimeters were guarded by temperature-checking volunteers in red armbands. They took their orders from members of village party committees who bustled about sporting party lapel-pins. In cities the party’s myriad grids proved crucial in controlling people’s movements.
Front-line responders who were not already party members have rushed to join: some 440,000 by late June last year. Yet less than 6% of these applicants had actually been admitted. For the party is highly selective when it comes to recruitment.
Indeed, it is one of the world’s hardest ruling parties to join. And to keep out closet liberals and other undesirables, Xi Jinping is making it even more so. In other countries few mainstream parties would turn away anyone willing to pay their membership dues. In the Chinese Communist Party these can amount to as much as 2% of income for the wealthiest members. But party officials were wary of last year’s flood of applications. They detected opportunism—a chance to get an application fast-tracked by helping the party at a time of need. “Fishing in troubled waters”, they called it. They warned party branches not to lower their guard. To qualify, officials insisted, applicants had to prove themselves in the toughest of covid-fighting roles, not to mention stand up to political scrutiny.

Mr Xi began putting the brakes on recruitment soon after he took over in 2012. In the following year the numbers of new members fell to 2.4m, the lowest in a decade. In 2019, the most recent year for which data are available, it was closer to 2.3m. Chinese officials are fearful of the party gradually becoming a “party for everyone”, as Nikita Khrushchev declared the Soviet Communist Party to be in 1961. Such deviancy, they say, was one reason why Soviet communism collapsed: it had lost its “class character”. A scholar quoted by Beijing Youth News, the organ of the capital’s Communist Youth League, has said that China’s party would be better with about 40m fewer members than today’s 92m.
Not too many workers, please
Yet the professed importance of class background may be misleading. The party is still keenest of all to recruit the educated elite. In 2000 only about one-fifth of members had degrees—about the same proportion as those who had not advanced beyond primary school. Now about half are graduates, helped by a big increase in university enrolment. Students make up about 30% of new entrants to the party. But many join largely for self-interested reasons. Membership is needed for good jobs in the civil service and state-owned industries, which offer greater security than private employment. So the party is raising the bar even for students. In 2019, 1.96m were party members, around 300,000 fewer than a decade earlier. They made up perhaps 5% of the total student body, down from nearly 8% in 2009.
Given the hoops that have to be jumped through, it is striking how many still bother to apply: about 844,000 students managed to join the party in 2019. As well as the practical benefits, there is also the cachet. “It’s like an Oxford dining club,” says Peter Mattis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). “You’re in on the secret, if you’re in. That is good for recruitment—and for creating fear.” It is also a badge of academic success: the party prefers students with the highest grades. In today’s party good degrees count for a lot. While working as a provincial governor, Mr Xi managed to squeeze in a PhD in Marxism (though doubts abound about the quality of this credential). Kjeld Erik Brodsgaard, an expert on the party at Copenhagen Business School, says that the Central Committee is “better educated than the Danish parliament”.
Induction begins with an application letter that needs the endorsement of two party members. Next comes an interview with an official from the party branch. Then the branch considers whether to proceed. If it does, the applicant becomes a “party-entry activist”. This phase can last a couple of years, during which the applicant must submit thought reports every three months, join political study sessions, do volunteer work and meet mentors from the branch who write evaluations. Then there are the background checks—a process that involves investigating the political reliability of family and friends and examining school records. An applicant in the West for a government job involving official secrets would require less rigorous vetting.
If all goes well, the applicant then has to swear an oath in front of the party flag, promising to guard party secrets, remain loyal and be “ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the party and the people”. This means being willing to do as Mr Xi orders, without question. The party is his machine. ■

1737,"ALAS, THE COP26 summit in Glasgow is shaping up to be a disappointment. The hope that emerging markets, which belch out much of the world’s greenhouse gases, would announce ambitious proposals is being dashed. The plans of China, India and Brazil all underwhelm. There is no sign this will be the COP that kills coal, as Britain, the host, wanted. World leaders have still not agreed to stop subsidising fossil fuels.
But one area where enthusiasm is growing is climate finance. Financial institutions representing nearly $9trn in assets pledged to uproot deforestation from their investment portfolios. The most striking announcement has come from the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a coalition co-chaired by Mark Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England. Its members, which include asset owners, asset managers, banks and insurers, hold about $130trn of assets. They will try to cut the emissions from their lending and investing to net zero by 2050. Can the financial industry really save the world?

In principle, it has a huge role to play. Shifting the economy from fossil fuels to clean sources of energy requires a vast reallocation of capital. By 2030, around $4trn of investment in clean energy will be needed each year, a tripling of current levels. Spending on fossil fuels must decline. In an ideal world the profit incentive of institutional investors would be aligned with reducing emissions, and these owners and financiers would control the global assets that create emissions. Asset owners would have both the motive and the means to reinvent the economy.

The reality of green investing falls short of this ideal. The first problem is coverage. The Economist estimates that listed firms which are not state-controlled account for only 14-32% of the world’s emissions. State-controlled companies, such as Coal India or Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, are a big part of the problem and they do not operate under the sway of institutional fund managers and private-sector bankers.
A second issue is measurement. There is as yet no way to accurately assess the carbon footprint of a portfolio without double counting. Emissions from a barrel of oil could appear in the carbon accounts of the firms that are drilling, refining and burning the stuff. Methodologies behind attributing emissions to financial flows are even sketchier. How should shareholders, lenders and insurers divvy up the emissions from a coal-fired power plant, for instance?
The third problem is incentives. Private financial firms aim to maximise risk-adjusted profits for their clients and owners. This is not well-aligned with cutting carbon. The easiest way to cut the carbon footprint of a diversified portfolio is to sell the part of it invested in dirty assets and put the proceeds in firms that never emitted much, such as, say, Facebook. Together, the five biggest American tech firms have a carbon intensity (emissions per unit of sales) of about 3% of the S average.
Heavily polluting firms or assets will often find new owners. If you can brush off the stigma, it can be profitable to hold assets that can legally generate untaxed externalities—in this case pollution. As shareholders urge oil majors to clean up, the oilfields they sell are being bought by private-equity firms and hedge funds, away from the public eye. Pledges alone do not alter the fact that firms have little reason to invest trillions in green technologies that still have mediocre risk-adjusted returns.
What should be done? Fine-tuning can help. Measurement should be improved. The EU is rolling out mandatory carbon reporting for businesses; America is considering it. Some accounting bodies want to standardise how climate measures are disclosed. Asset owners, such as pension funds, should hold on to their investments in polluting firms and use them to help bring about change. Institutional investors also need to build up their venture-capital arms to finance new technologies, such as green cement.
Pledges like GFANZ are good as far as they go, but the world needs a widespread price on carbon if finance is to work wonders. That would target all firms, not just those controlled by some institutional investors. The urge to avoid the tax would supercharge efforts to count emissions. Firms and governments would have an incentive to grapple with questions of who is polluting and who should pay. Crucially, a carbon price would align the profit incentive with the goal of reducing greenhouse gases. The job of the financial system would then be to amplify the signal sent by the price of carbon. That combination would be a powerful engine for changing how economies work. ■

1738,"THE PROFITS cranked out by American businesses make them look indestructible. Despite a pandemic and savage slump in 2020, the net income of large American firms for the third quarter of this year is expected to exceed $400bn. Yet as the earnings season gets into full swing three worries are circulating: supply-chain tangles, inflation and wages, and concerns that competition is intensifying in some industries.",2
1739,"CHARITABLE GIVING was expected to be walloped by the pandemic. The opposite happened. Fidelity Charitable, America’s largest administrator of grants on behalf of donors, handed out $9.1bn last year, up from $7.3bn in 2019. A study in 2020 of more than 250 American foundations showed that a majority were increasing grants for the year, by an average of 17%.
Amid this welcome rise, philanthropy is veering left. In July the MacArthur Foundation said that it would give $80m to “combat anti-Blackness, uplift Indigenous Peoples” and otherwise advance “ethnic justice”, including through reparations. In April the Ford Foundation announced $1bn in funding for social justice. The month before Goldman Sachs, a bank, trumpeted $100m in grants to curb bias against black women. The Mellon Foundation, traditionally a big arts and humanities supporter, announced last year a “major strategic evolution” to prioritise social justice. PolicyLink, an Oakland think-tank, tallies $1.5bn in grants awarded for racial equity in America last year: nearly half the total for the previous nine years.

Covid-19 has had a hand in this. Reports of higher mortality among black Americans have shocked many. Purse-strings have also been loosened by loud protests against killings of African-Americans—“I’ve doubled down after George Floyd’s murder,” says Don Howard, president of California’s James Irvine Foundation. The grant-maker is pulling an additional $20m out of its endowment to serve black Americans and is now “an anti-racist organisation”, says Mr Howard. The surge in giving is also due, progressive grant-makers quietly say, to Donald Trump’s time in the limelight.
Amid these heady times for liberal philanthropists, many are reaching higher. Racial equity is a big goal. This is commonly defined not as equal opportunity, but rather as equal outcomes. One outfit pushing for racial equity is Northern California Grantmakers, a San Francisco non-profit advising organisations that award $5bn in grants annually. Its CEO, Dwayne Marsh, says “equal access and equal resources” won’t be enough. This view has led many grant-makers, including the Ford and MacArthur foundations, to prefer where possible grant-seekers who are black or brown.
To make this easier, lists of fund-seeking bodies led by people of colour have been drawn up by charities like the San Francisco Foundation and Give Blck. The latter, based in Seattle, drops organisations that hire too many whites, says Christina Lewis, its co-founder, though some exceptions are made for groups that serve black Americans. Give Blck has received funding from Microsoft and the Ford Foundation.
The policy of favouring non-white grant-seekers became “much more explicit” following Mr Trump’s rise, says Richard Tate of the California Wellness Foundation’s Oakland office. Having white skin does not disqualify applicants, but colour plays a role in all decisions, says Mr Tate, who adds that this approach dovetails “with my identity as a biracial gay”. The foundation hands out $45m annually in grants for everything from parks to scholarships to medical school.
Giving in
Some outfits are more blunt. One is the Miami Foundation, which is partly funded by Facebook. Its strategy adviser, Charisse Grant, says applicants of colour are generally better at serving poor communities. If you choose whites, she says, “you’re not necessarily getting the best.” She sees growing political support for this view. The Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity, a publisher of grant-making guides based in Washington, DC, writes that mostly-white organisations should be subject to “far more rigorous” vetting than usual.
Such practices have boomed in the past two years. Most big foundations now require detailed reporting on ethnicity, says Debi Ghate of the Philanthropy Roundtable, a non-profit organisation in Washington, DC. She argues that the newfound focus on group identity can divert attention away from scrutinising the charity’s performance. Asking if diversity is always visible (as opposed to things that cannot be seen, like sexuality or religious orientation), she adds, is now “outside the guardrails…you will be called a racist.” The Philanthropy Roundtable, she says, is regularly contacted by charity professionals who say they lost their jobs “because I don’t fit the checklist”.
Despite such criticism, the tide is not turning. The California Wellness Foundation intends to reduce the proportion of whites who invest in its $1bn endowment. As for fundraising, more organisations say they now pay less attention to potential donors’ net worth, focusing instead on their race and gender. Ms Grant of the Miami Foundation calls this “democratising philanthropy”. Edgar Villanueva of the Decolonising Wealth Project, a New York grant-maker, says the extra selectivity also curbs “reputational laundering” by undesirable would-be donors with an eye on philanthropy’s “very selfish benefits”.
Other ambitious goals are cropping up. One relies on a creative argument promoted by Joanne Barkan, an editor of Dissent, a New York magazine. Charitable donations can reduce tax bills. Since this diverts money from public coffers, it’s “almost obscene”, she says, that grants are awarded without some state control. Ms Barkan seeks legally mandated racial and gender quotas for foundation boards.
A different approach to constraining charitable giving is making more headway. By one count, at least 16 states this year alone have mulled limiting donor anonymity (under guises including combating fraud). Such laws would encourage shaming on Twitter. However, activists should note that limiting anonymity will also cut donations to progressive outfits like the San Francisco Foundation, says Fred Blackwell, its CEO. Many people want to give without alerting the world’s fund-raisers, not to mention their adult heirs.
Where is this heading? Naomi Schaefer Riley, a philanthropy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank, reckons nowhere good. Ms Ghate gives the example of a charity doing work with ex-prisoners. Though the white woman running the charity, who had herself been to prison, was producing results, the charity’s funder shifted funding to other organisations led by people of colour. “This is no longer about the community: it’s a new issue of what the leadership looks like,” she says.■",2
1740,"ON JUNE 29TH 1950 the USS Valley Forge, flagship of America’s Seventh Fleet, passed through the Taiwan Strait. A battle group defended her flanks, America’s first naval jets sat in her hangar, and a new vision of American-dominated Asian security unfurled in her wake.
Only a few months before, America’s secretary of state, Dean Acheson, had declared that “The Asian peoples are on their own, and know it.” But on June 25th Stalinist North Korea launched an invasion of its southern neighbour, and a country confronting communism could no longer leave Asia alone. America would fight with South Korea. It was to join in that defence that the Valley Forge was steaming north from Subic Bay.

Her route had added purpose. Containing Asian communism meant more than fighting North Korea. It also required making sure that Mao Zedong—mainland China’s ruler since the previous year—did not take the island of Taiwan from the Nationalist regime led by Chiang Kai-shek, who had been forced to retreat there. On June 27th President Harry Truman announced a new Taiwan policy: America would defend the island from attack; the Nationalists must, for their part, cease air and sea operations against the mainland. “The Seventh Fleet will see that this is done,” the president declared, with nicely laconic menace. Hence the Valley Forge’s show of strength.
From that week on, to the relief of some and the frustration of others, Asian peoples were no longer on their own. The Korean war transformed the region into a theatre of ideological struggle just as fraught as divided cold-war Europe. For nearly three decades the Taiwan Strait saw ships of the Seventh Fleet acting as a tripwire between the two Chinas. There were early battles over outlying islands, including a crisis in 1958 in which Mao’s brinkmanship nearly started a nuclear war. But over time the rivals to the west and east of the strait settled into an uneasy half-peace, both adamant that they were the one true China, neither able to act on the conviction.
Over time Taiwan became the prosperous, pro-Western democracy of 24m people which it is today. While the mainland saw traditions and social codes destroyed by Maoist fanaticism, Taiwan has a rich religious and cultural life. It has come to enjoy raucous free speech and a marked liberal streak: it was the first Asian country to legalise gay marriage.
A generation ago, it could matter greatly whether someone’s grandparents had arrived from the mainland in 1949 or had deeper roots on the island. That has now changed, especially among the young. In 2020 a poll by the Pew Research Centre, a Washington-based research outfit, found that about two-thirds of adults on the island now identified as purely Taiwanese. About three in ten called themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese. Just 4% called themselves simply Chinese.
Leaders in Beijing differ; they consider them all Chinese. They tell their own people that most citizens of Taiwan agree, and that the historical necessity of national unification is being thwarted by secessionist troublemakers egged on by America.
Once, Taiwan was a point of compromise between the two powers. On January 1st 1979, the day that America recognised the People’s Republic of China, the economic reformers running the mainland changed their Taiwan policy from armed liberation to “peaceful reunification”, soon afterwards adding a promise of considerable autonomy: “one country, two systems”. But for the past 25 years that conciliatory offer has been accompanied by an unprecedented military build up.
In recent years China’s rhetoric towards Taiwan has sounded new notes of impatience. And the crushing abnegation of its promise to observe “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong over the past two years has deepened Taiwanese distrust. Last year the issue helped Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to be re-elected president.
In principle the DPP favours the creation of a Taiwan that is formally its own nation; but to declare independence in that way would trigger massive Chinese reprisals. To keep that crisis at bay, Ms Tsai, a moderate, cat-loving academic, relies on an artful diplomatic dodge: that she governs a country which, while proudly Taiwanese, uses the legal name of the Republic of China which it inherited from the Nationalists who arrived in 1949. China’s leaders detest her.
The passage of time poses a dilemma for China. Every year, China’s ability to coerce Taiwan economically and militarily grows greater. And every year it loses more hearts and minds on Taiwan. Should rulers in Beijing ever conclude that peaceful unification is a hopeless cause, Chinese law instructs them to use force.
Present fears
This dynamic alarms the heirs to Acheson. Though the accord of 1979 cast Taiwan into non-state limbo, the island’s security remained—as a matter of American law—a question of “grave concern”. When in 1996 China sought to intimidate the Taiwanese, about to vote in their first free presidential election, by means of missile tests, President Bill Clinton ordered the USS Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft-carrier, and her attendant battle group to the waters off Taiwan. The missile tests stopped.

American military commanders are increasingly open about their concerns that, in the context of Taiwan, the balance of military power between China and America has swung in China’s direction. A 25-year campaign of shipbuilding and weapons procurement, begun in direct response to the humiliation of 1996, has provided the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) a fleet of 360 ships, according to American naval intelligence, compared with America’s 297. On April 23rd state media hailed the symbolism of a ceremony in which China’s supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, commissioned three large warships on the same day: a destroyer, a helicopter-carrier and a ballistic-missile submarine. The second of these is ideal for airlifting troops to a mountainous island, the media noted with glee. The third is a way of deterring superpowers.

America still boasts more, better carriers and nuclear submarines. It has much more experience of far-flung operations, and it has allies, too. But America’s forces have global duties. China would be fighting close to home and thus enjoying the benefit of the PLA’s land-based aircraft and missiles. Lonnie Henley, who was until 2019 the chief Pentagon intelligence analyst for East Asia, sees the radars and missiles of the integrated air-defence system along China’s coast as the “centre of gravity” of any war over Taiwan (see map). Unless those defences are destroyed, American forces would be limited to long-range weapons or attacks by the stealthiest warplanes, Mr Henley told a congressional panel in February. But destroying those defences would mean one nuclear power launching direct attacks on the territory of another.

And the Chinese build-up continues apace. History is an imperfect guide, but offers precedents to ponder, says a senior American defence official. “The world has never seen a military expansion of this scale not associated with conflict.”
It is not just a matter of numbers. China has carefully focused its efforts on the ability to defeat American forces that might trouble it. It has missiles designed expressly for killing carriers, and others that would allow precision strikes on the American base on Guam. The defence official lists other fields in which China has worked to neutralise areas of American strength, whether that means investment in anti-submarine weapons and sensors or systems to jam or destroy the satellites on which American forces rely. Copying an American method, China has set up a training centre with a professional opposing force that mimics enemy (in this case American) doctrines and tactics.
Horrible imaginings
The head of Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil Davidson, told a Senate hearing in March that China’s fielding of new warships, planes and rockets, when considered alongside the regime’s unblushing readiness to crush dissent from Hong Kong to Tibet, makes him worry that China is accelerating its apparent ambitions to supplant America and its allies from their position atop what he called the rules-based international order—a phrase that China sees as code for Western hegemony. Pondering the specific risks of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the admiral told senators that “the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact in the next six years.”
Admiral John Aquilino, nominated to be Admiral Davidson’s successor as head of Indo-Pacific Command, told a confirmation hearing in March that work to shore up America’s ability to deter a Chinese attack on Taiwan is urgent. While he stopped short of endorsing his predecessor’s timeline of six years, he called the prospect of a Chinese use of force “much closer to us than most think”. Anxiety has been raised further by war games involving Taiwan scenarios, both secret and unclassified, that were won by officers, spooks or scholars playing the role of China.

The admirals’ worries mix judgments about China’s capabilities with hunches about its intent. Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund, a public-policy outfit, notes that their mission is to make plans, in this case to win a war over Taiwan. Once they realise that victory may elude them, or may only be possible at great cost, panic is understandable. That does not mean they are correctly assessing China’s incentives to act soon. Strikingly, some of the intelligence officers paid to analyse the world for admirals and generals are noticeably calmer. “The trends are not ideal from a Chinese perspective,” says Mr Henley. “But are they intolerable? I just don’t see them being in that grim a mindset.”
When the battle’s lost and won
A broader American angst is driven by the knowledge of what defeat would mean. Niall Ferguson, a historian, recently wrote that the fall of Taiwan to China would be seen around Asia as the end of American predominance and even as “America’s Suez”, a reference to the humbling of Britain when it overreached during the Suez crisis of 1956. Asked about this idea in early April Matt Pottinger, who was head of Asia policy in the Trump White House, agreed and added another reason for Asian allies to fear such a public loss of American credibility. When Britain stumbled at Suez, America had already taken its place as the leader of the Western world, Mr Pottinger told a Hoover Institution podcast. Today, he observed, “There's not another United States waiting in the wings.”
For all its newfound strength China faces daunting odds. A full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan, a mountainous island that lies across at least 130km of water, would be the most ambitious such venture since the second world war. America has spent years nagging its Taiwanese allies to capitalise on their natural insular advantages, for instance by buying lots of naval mines, drones and coastal-defence cruise missiles on mobile launchers to sink Chinese troop ships, rather than continuing to splurge on tanks and F-16 fighters. Randall Schriver, the assistant secretary of defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs in 2018-19, promoted efforts to help Taiwan disable Chinese radar and other sensors: “If we are able to just blind the PLA, that would be a huge contribution to the fight.”
If a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan were to fail, or military conflict to reach a stalemate, would it fight on? Outsiders offer no consensus. Mr Henley suggests that a failed invasion might evolve into a long-term blockade—a strategy to which Western defence planners are paying increasing attention. There is a much-heard view that once China starts fighting anything short of victory would mean regime-toppling humiliation. But Mr Schriver is sceptical. “This is part of Beijing’s win-without-fighting strategy. To make everyone believe that they climb the escalation ladder all the way to nukes if they have to.”
The risks and costs of war, even a successful one, bring home the point that capabilities in themselves are never the determining factor. Intentions matter too, and are far more opaque—especially when, as in China, they reside largely in the mind of one man. It is common to hear Western analysts state that Mr Xi has staked his legacy and legitimacy on Taiwan’s return. Hard evidence for this alarming belief is in short supply. The most cited is that, in a new-year speech in 2019, he linked union with Taiwan to the ambition that he has placed at the core of his leadership, namely the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”. He also repeated what he had said to a Taiwanese envoy in 2013: that cross-strait differences should not be passed from generation to generation.
Having abolished the term limit on his role as president in 2018, 67-year-old Mr Xi can hardly expect to be succeeded by another member of his generation. Following his own logic, it thus falls to him to make sure that the task is not passed on. In an October 2019 meeting in Beijing, Chinese scholars and military experts shared with Oriana Skylar Mastro of Stanford University their understanding that it is imperative for Taiwan to be recovered during Mr Xi’s time as leader.
Though some semi-official Chinese commentators already say that they see no hope for unification without some use of violence, there is no agreement among foreign governments as to whether that is the settled view of China’s rulers. China continues to try to shape Taiwanese opinion with a mix of sticks and carrots, which suggests that negotiation has not been abandoned. The biggest carrot, access to its vast markets, continues to be dangled in front of Taiwanese business interests. Ms Glaser notes that Mr Xi sounded a patient note in March when he visited Fujian, the coastal province nearest to Taiwan, urging officials to explore new paths of cross-strait integration and economic development.
To the sticking place
But China’s carrots and sticks can clash. To punish the Taiwanese for electing a DPP government China has reduced official and semi-official cross-strait contacts to “nearly zero”, says Andrew Nien-Dzu Yang, a former Taiwanese deputy defence minister, now at the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a think-tank in Taipei. That raises the danger of misunderstandings.
So does China’s increased military activity around the island. Psychological operations and “grey-zone” warfare have been intensifying. In 2020, according to Taiwan’s government, Chinese warplanes made 380 sorties into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), a buffer zone of international airspace where foreign planes face questioning by controllers and potential interception by Taiwanese fighters. Such a tempo of operations has not been seen since 1996. On April 5th the Chinese navy promised patrols by its aircraft-carriers around Taiwan on a regular basis. On April 12th 25 Chinese planes entered the ADIZ, a record for a single day.
This may be a test of the new Biden administration, says a senior Taiwanese diplomat, or a bid to create a “new normal” in which Chinese forces are routinely present in a zone formerly controlled by Taiwan. China knows that Taiwan will not fire first, so “the Chinese will continue to push,” the diplomat says. The constant incursions wear down Taiwanese defences, raise the chances of accidental collisions and would make it harder to spot a rush to real war. Beyond the constant drumbeat of military pressure, China is “trying to divide society, trying to sow the seeds of chaos,” says the diplomat. “They also conduct cyber-activities and disinformation campaigns.”
Wang Zaixi, a former deputy head of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, a semi-official Chinese body, advocates a “third way” between all-out war and political negotiations, one in which a massive display of firepower cows Taiwan into submission. In Chinese media interviews he has cited the (not wholly reassuring) precedent of Red Army troops surrounding Beijing in 1949 in such intimidating numbers that the city fell with rather few casualties, an approach he calls “using war to force peace”.
In some polls less than half of Taiwanese say they would fight in a war with China, or want relatives to do so (compulsory military service was sharply reduced in 2013, by a government keen on closer ties with China). If the island loses more than half of its defences in the first waves of an attack, the public’s will to fight might collapse, frets Mr Yang. A swift collapse would make America’s position yet harder. If American reinforcements arrive to find China’s troops already on the island, asks Ms Skylar Mastro, can they start firing if no Chinese unit has shot at Americans? “I think that would be a very hard call for a US president to make.”
If the Taiwanese appetite for a fight is unclear, so too is America’s. Taiwan’s government is painfully aware that preserving their friendly, successful democracy is not in itself a vital national interest for anyone else. Instead, Taiwanese officials stress the extraordinary importance of the island’s semiconductor industry to global supply chains. They also emphasise how grim and frightening the Asia-Pacific would feel if America ever broke its commitments and ducked a fight with China. Japan’s prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, recently went further than any recent predecessor, when he mentioned the importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait in a joint statement with Mr Biden. Japan fears Taiwan becoming a Chinese bastion just to its south, explains Michishita Narushige of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. But it also has much to lose if America is chased out of the Pacific: “If the fall of Taiwan means the disengagement of the US from this region, that would be a vital interest.”
Some in America want to make clear that maintaining its Asian role is central to America’s interests, too. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat close to Mr Biden, is co-sponsor of the Strategic Competition Act, a bill with strong bipartisan support that would deepen ties with Taiwan—whether by offering the island trade deals, weapons sales, expanded contacts with American officials or support in its attempts to take part in international forums—as one of several measures to push back against what he calls China’s growing global aggression. To explain the island’s importance to voters he talks of how dependent modern life is on the chips it makes. He also cites the importance of America being seen to keep its word and linking arms with allies to counter China, rather than trying to lead the world through “bluster”.
The seeds of time
It may sound a bit narcissistic for Americans to assume that China’s plans for Taiwan turn on how strong America looks to China. But Chinese experts and officials are sincerely convinced that America is delighted to be Taiwan’s security guarantor and thus gain a chance to meddle in China’s internal affairs. Without America to help, Taiwan will surrender in an instant, they argue, rather as Mr Yang fears. Their disdain for the idea that China might try to win over Taiwanese hearts and minds can be chilling. Unification will not be decided by Taiwan’s “playhouse politics” but by geopolitical power struggles, Zhu Feng of Nanjing University told an annual forum run by the Global Times, a jingoistic party newspaper.

Ni Lexiong, a Taiwan expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, says that bellicose commentaries in the state media must, in some limited sense, enjoy official sanction. Such commentators “would be too scared to write about such things without approval”, he says. But he scoffs at Westerners who worry that Chinese leaders may feel compelled by the nationalism which such screeds stoke in the public. The views of the masses will not decide what happens, he says: “The key is military power.”
There is much to be said for America’s decades-long policy of strategic ambiguity. Though some American scholars believe it would usefully deter China to hear the Biden administration say it would join any war over Taiwan, it could also provoke China to rash acts or embolden some future leader on Taiwan to declare independence. Logic also supports the Pentagon’s desire to spend the next ten years arming Taiwan, buying new weapons and thus increasing the uncertainty of Chinese commanders and their political masters.
The challenge of such an approach is to generate enough anxiety to stay China’s hand, but not so much that Mr Xi sees Taiwan slipping permanently from his grasp. For all the alarm in Washington, China does not feel like a country on a war footing, or particularly close to one. Several sources briefed on a recent meeting in Alaska between China’s top foreign-policy officials, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi, and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, report that the Chinese delivered shrill and inflexible talking points on Taiwan, but used no new language that showed unprecedented urgency.
China’s public stance involves much sabre-rattling, to be sure. Viewers of state television are never far from their next sight of an aircraft-carrier, or gleaming jets screaming through azure skies. But calls for sacrifice to prepare the public for full-on hostilities are missing. The party’s claims to legitimacy in this, its centenary year, are overwhelmingly domestic and based on order and material prosperity: they are buttressed by images of gorge-spanning bridges and high-speed trains, villagers raised from poverty and heroic doctors beating back covid-19 even as it rages around the outside world.
Nevertheless, China’s visible capabilities and veiled intent are grounds for alarm. Its scorn for Western opinion, as over Hong Kong, is a bad sign. War over Taiwan may not appear imminent in Beijing. But nor, shockingly, is it unthinkable.■
Correction (April 30th 2021): Due to an editing error this article originally said that the USS Nimitz, an aircraft carrier, sailed through the Taiwan Straits in 1996, halting Chinese missile tests. It actually transited the strait in December 1995 after a first set of Chinese missile tests. Further Chinese missiles were fired in March 1996, causing the Nimitz to return to the area, but not to the strait. The deterrent effect of the Nimitz’s show of force is a point of historical dispute

1741,"BAD FOR shop assistants, good for shoppers. That is the obvious inference from the upheaval in retailing that is leaving shopping malls and high streets, and millions of low-income jobs, surplus to requirements, yet panders to the consumer’s craving for convenience. It is, though, an oversimplification. Retail-related jobs will change but not disappear. And shoppers must make uncomfortable choices about privacy and the exploitation of data.
Start with jobs. In America and Europe, retailing is a huge employer, especially of women and young people. The National Retail Federation, an industry body, says retailers are the largest private-sector employers in America, engaging 32m. In the EU about one in six workers have retail or wholesale jobs. Even before covid-19, the rise of e-commerce, retail bankruptcies and shop closures were leading to job losses. Lockdowns during the pandemic exacerbated that. In America 2.4m retail jobs were shed in March and April 2020. By January just 2m had been recovered. Yet many lost jobs are offset by e-commerce-related employment as warehouse workers, couriers and grocery pickers. America’s Bureau of Labour Statistics says jobs in transport and warehousing grew by more than 500,000 in the seven months to December. Amazon alone added that number last year. The Progressive Policy Institute, a think-tank, says industries related to e-commerce created 900,000 more jobs between the end of 2007 and the start of 2020 than those lost at bricks-and-mortar stores.

The prospects of moving to sorting and packing jobs rather than shelf-stacking and folding ones will be little consolation for many. Warehouses may be stuck on the edge of cities, far from traditional shops and supermarkets. They offer less direct connection with the public. They may be more physically demanding and involve relentless, soul-sapping targets. Workers may need retraining. And worker organisations are rare. Amazon has resisted efforts by its American employees to unionise, though this month those at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, are voting on whether to become the first in America to join a union.

At least wages have risen. In America Amazon and others have pushed minimum pay to at least $15 an hour. Yet higher labour costs may tempt companies to replace workers with robots. A digitised retail industry raises demand for higher-skilled labour, but lowers it for entry-level workers. Jobs like delivery and grocery-picking may be outsourced to gig-economy workers, whose livelihoods depend precariously on customer ratings and reviews.
For the lucky minority still working in shops, the job may become more stimulating. That is because more tasks, from ringing up the till to showing the way to the nappy aisle, will be automated, leaving employees to offer more valuable services aimed at winning repeat customers. As Nilam Ganenthiran of Instacart says, workers whose jobs used to involve showing people where the pasta sauces are now advise on what types of pasta to make. Mark Pilkington, a former lingerie retailer whose book “Retail Recovery” will soon be published, says retail workers will need the skills of a stylist or an actor to advise shoppers what to wear and how to look fabulous, so that they return to the store. “A good stylist is cheaper than a good therapist,” he quips.
As automation increases, retailers will have to fight for tech talent. Eric Shea of Accenture, a consultancy, says the industry has had a “bad rap” and struggles to compete for employees with big-tech firms. So it needs to create “hubs” of digital experimentation away from the mothership. Instacart’s army of software engineers create tools to sell to supermarkets to automate their operations, so they do not have to build their own. The bifurcation between fast-paced warehousing jobs and creative customer-service ones is essential to make online shopping more efficient and in-store shopping more fun. Both aim at making customers feel they are truly king. No doubt the richer they are, the more regally they will be treated. Yet there is a bargain involved that shoppers are only just understanding. They pay by sharing data with retailers.
Data junkies
Data are the building-blocks of the retail renaissance. By one estimate, the volume of retail data globally is expected to rise from 33trn gigabytes in 2018 to 175trn by 2025. Until recently, stores made a hash of assimilating it. Even when they had an online presence, rivalry between physical and digital sides of the business meant information was not shared. Manufacturers had little information about customers, so no incentive to personalise. And retailers kept few tabs on what people did in their stores. As Mr Pilkington says, the irony is they would pay Facebook and Google to recruit customers online, yet let them walk free through their shops without collecting data on them. 
Loyalty cards were a step forward. Retail apps are the new way for retailers to connect with shoppers. These provide information on shoppers’ habits, either online or in-store. They inform decisions on what stock to carry. In some cases, they may alert manufacturers what goods to produce. Yet if shoppers feel their privacy is violated, they may react with outrage. Tools that can destroy trust if handled badly include location-tracking, facial and voice recognition, and voice-activated assistants who recommend products to buy in a biased way. Schemes common in China, such as community group-buy, may prove offputting in the West if shoppers are encouraged to persuade friends to join them in making purchases by social media. Data theft is a big problem.
A paper in the Journal of Retailing, an academic journal, by Kelly Martin of Colorado State University and others, suggests ways to enhance data privacy. It highlights the importance of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation and California’s Consumer Privacy Act, as well as China’s new privacy standard, the personal information security specification (though it says Chinese shoppers worry about the government keeping their data safe). It also says firms should guarantee privacy protection as a sales strategy.
Retailers fret that, as Facebook and Google deepen their involvement in commerce, questions about the use of personal data will grow. But it is hard to put the genie back in the bottle. This is a data-driven economy, and for the retail renaissance to flourish, shoppers must feel confident that personal information is in good hands. As Mr Shea of Accenture puts it, customers once pledged loyalty to the retailer. Now it is the other way round. ■",2
1742,"New York (CNN Business)Natalie Morales said farewell on Friday to her viewers and colleagues on ""Today"" after 22 years at NBC. Morales, who worked as an anchor for ""Today"" and correspondent for ""Dateline NBC,"" is leaving the network to join CBS as a host of its afternoon program, ""The Talk."" On Friday, ""Today"" shared a touching farewell segment in which Morales reflected on her career at the network.""Dear viewer, from the minute I stepped in front of the camera and into your living rooms I knew it was an honor to be a part of your morning tradition and sacred time,"" Morales said. ""With you, I've had a front row seat to moments that captured our hearts, moments I will forever cherish as I witnessed history.""Morales recalled her coverage of the rescue of 33 Chilean miners, two royal weddings, eight Olympics and survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing crossing the finish line at the following year's race.  ""I, too, was inspired to run and raise thousands for their cause thanks to your support,"" Morales said. ""So many extraordinary people touched our lives, trusting us with their awe inspiring journeys.""""Dear viewer, you and my 'Today' family have given me a place I will forever call home. Thank you for all those mornings and the lifetime of memories we now share. With all my love and gratitude, Natalie,"" she concluded. Morales sat with her ""Today"" co-hosts — Al Roker, Craig Melvin, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Carson Daly — for a sendoff toast.  ""For 22 years, no matter what you have done, Natalie, you are still the same person,"" Roker said. ""You are wonderful, warm. You have always been a good friend to everybody who's been here. You treat everybody equal. I adore you."" Morales' final story for ""Dateline NBC"" premieres Friday. ",0
1743," (CNN)Children and teens from minority groups are disproportionately hit by coronavirus, just as older adults are, according to the findings of a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children from ethnic and racial minorities, those with underlying health conditions and those between the ages of 18 and 20 are more likely to die, a CDC-led research team wrote in a study published Tuesday in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.  The report also showed just how unusual it is for children and young adults to die from coronavirus. Among the 190,000 deaths tallied in the country, only 0.08% -- or 121 -- were reported in those under 21. The most updated report from the CDC shows 377 children, teens and young adults aged up to 24 have died from coronavirus. The researchers asked 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands to submit information on coronavirus deaths in those under 21, between February 12 and July 31. Forty-seven jurisdictions responded. Among the approximately 6.5 million Covid-19 cases in the country, the researchers found a total of 391,814 cases of Covid-19 and MIS-C in those under 21. While people under 21 make up 26% of the US population, they make up only 8% of all reported cases.  Hispanics, Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives were disproportionately affected.  A total of 44% of the 121 who died were Hispanic children, 29% were Black children, 4% were American Indian/Alaska Natives and 4% were Asian or Pacific Islander. While these groups represent 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age range. Fourteen percent of the deaths were in white children. ""Infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, particularly those from racial and ethnic minority groups at higher risk, those with underlying medical conditions, and their caregivers, need clear, consistent, and developmentally, linguistically, and culturally appropriate COVID-19 prevention messages,"" the researchers wrote. While 25% of the deaths were in previously healthy children, 75% had at least one underlying health condition and 45% had two or more. The most frequently reported medical conditions were chronic lung disease, including asthma; obesity; neurologic and developmental conditions and cardiovascular conditions.  The breakdown among the different age groups varied substantially, with those in the younger age groups doing better than adolescents and young adults. Approximately 10% of the deaths were in infants under the age of 1, an additional 9% were in children between 1 and 4, with another 11% in the 5-9 range and 10% in the 10-13 range. But almost 20% of the deaths were seen in teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 and more than 40% were in 18 to 20 year-olds.  This matches up somewhat with earlier CDC statistics that found 0 to 4-year-olds are four times less likely to be hospitalized and nine times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds, and 5 to 17-year-olds are nine times less likely to be hospitalized and 16 times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds.  Boys fared worse than girls: males accounted for 63% of the deaths compared with 37% for females.  Even though children are reassuringly less likely to get severely ill and die, they can still get infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, according to numerous studies.  For example, in one study published last week in the MMWR, researchers analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care facilities in Salt Lake County from April to July. They found at least two children who had no symptoms not only caught the virus, but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One eight-month-old baby infected both parents.  ""The infected children exposed at these three facilities had mild to no symptoms. Two of three asymptomatic children likely transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to their parents and possibly to their teachers,"" the researchers from the Salt Lake County Health Department wrote in their report. Another study out of South Korea analyzed data on 91 asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic children diagnosed with Covid-19 between February 18 and March 31 at 22 centers throughout that country. It found that 22% of the children were asymptomatic. The study was published at the end of August in JAMA Pediatrics. ""This highlights the concept that infected children may be more likely to go unnoticed either with or without symptoms and continue on with their usual activities, which may contribute to viral circulation within their community,"" wrote two doctors from Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, in an accompanying editorial.  The CDC researchers of the current study said it is important to keep a close eye on children infected with Covid-19. ""Although infants, children, and adolescents are more likely to have milder COVID-19 illness than are adults, complications, including MIS-C and respiratory failure, do occur in these populations. Persons infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be followed closely so that clinical deterioration can be detected early,"" they wrote. ",0
1744,"THOUGH AMERICAN and Chinese tech platforms started the e-commerce gold rush, one Canadian company realised early on what money was to be made from selling shovels. That was Shopify, which supplies tools such as software, logistics and payments to allow firms to set up their own online stores rather than selling via giant platforms like Amazon. Its value, at $175bn, is only about a tenth that of Amazon. But in the past five years its share-price rise has outstripped that of “The Everything Store” more than tenfold.  
Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, is an evangelist for small retailers. Shopify’s more-than-1m merchants range from $1bn-plus brands like Allbirds to tiny startups that make their first sale on its platform every 52 seconds. Yet he believes that consumers will be the big winners from the transformation of retail, giving them more influence over how and what they buy. Not since John Wanamaker set up one of America’s earliest department stores in 1876, he says, has there been such a shift in favour of the customer.

Shopify may be the biggest e-commerce firm that most people have never heard of. Mr Finkelstein says it is “arming the rebels” by enabling independent retailers to survive and thrive via multiple sales channels, from Amazon to social media to bricks-and-mortar stores. Yet it is not the only fifth columnist. Across the world, regional platforms are competing fiercely to avoid American and Chinese dominance.
In Japan Amazon and Rakuten, a local e-commerce veteran, are in a battle for market leadership, but Softbank also plans to merge Yahoo Japan, an online shopping site in which it has a big stake, with Line, a messaging app, to make it a three-horse race. Amazon also has designs on South Korea via a partnership with 11street, owned by a local telecoms giant. But the market, led by Coupang, an online platform, is highly competitive. The South Korean affiliate of eBay, a big American platform, may be up for sale soon, making the contest fiercer still.
The Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have e-commerce stakes in South-East Asia via holdings in Lazada and Tokopedia, and Sea, respectively. In India, though the bulk of retailing still takes place in corner shops called kirana, e-commerce is a battle between Amazon, Flipkart (owned by Walmart) and JioMart, owned by Reliance, a conglomerate, with backing from Facebook, the American social-media giant. The Western firms are not just vying for a share of India’s vast retail market. They also want to learn how best to entice new smartphone users in emerging markets to shop online. That means more voice search, because of the plethora of local languages, as well as more video, says Leigh Hopkins, Walmart’s head of international strategy.
In Europe Amazon dominates, but marketplaces selling other people’s goods such as Berlin-based Zalando and Manchester-based Boohoo are mounting challenges. In Latin America Alibaba is the model, not Amazon. Buenos Aires-based Mercado Libre, the market leader in the region, does not sell its own products, unlike Amazon. Like Alibaba, it has a strong digital-payments arm. Yet Amazon is strong in Mexico, where it goes head to head with Mercado Libre, and competition between the two is growing in Brazil. Amazon is named after the country’s longest river. So far its business in Brazil does not live up to the name. But that is a rare exception.",2
1745,"ON THE FIRST day of his two-part inauguration on August 3rd, Ebrahim Raisi regretted that he could not kiss the hand of his mentor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, owing to covid-19 restrictions. But there was no doubting the bond between Mr Raisi, Iran’s new president, and Mr Khamenei, its supreme leader. Both men are hardline clerics who view the world, and the West in particular, with suspicion. “Trusting the West does not yield results,” said Mr Khamenei in the run-up to the ceremony.
Some in Iran may be pushing for confrontation. On July 29th, just days before the inauguration, a drone laden with explosives was flown into the MV Mercer Street, an oil tanker off the coast of Oman managed by an Israeli-owned firm. Two crew members, a Briton and a Romanian, were killed. America, Britain, Israel and Romania blamed Iran, which denied involvement. Saeed Khatibzadeh, an Iranian foreign-ministry spokesman, accused Israel of creating “instability, terror and violence” and warned that “whoever sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind”.

Then, on August 3rd, came another incident in nearby waters (see map). Gunmen boarded a bitumen tanker, the MV Asphalt Princess, and sailed it towards Iran before disembarking some 15 hours later, after the crew reportedly sabotaged the engines. The crew said the assailants were Iranians, according to recordings of communications between the ship and the Emirati coastguard heard by Argus Media, an energy-information firm. Iran denied involvement. The Asphalt Princess is owned by a firm in Dubai that had another vessel hijacked two years ago by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran’s most powerful military force.


Iran and its proxies have exchanged attacks with America, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in recent years. A shadow war between Iran and Israel has also been escalating. Several vessels have been attacked, with each side blaming the other. Israel has struck Iranian positions in Syria and is accused of attacking people and facilities in Iran, sometimes with cyber-weapons. An attack earlier this year on Iran’s main uranium-enrichment complex, in Natanz, using planted explosives, did significant damage.
If the IRGC is behind the attacks on shipping, it will come as no surprise. Its workings are murky, but it often seems to pursue a policy at odds with that of the weak elected government. Or at least, it did when Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who reached out to the West, was still president (he handed over to Mr Raisi after the maximum two consecutive terms). With hardliners now in control of the entire government, there should be less tension. “Under the new administration, Iran will be much more assertive,” says Mohammad Marandi, an academic who is close to the IRGC.
All of this complicates efforts to revive the nuclear deal signed in 2015 by Iran and six world powers. That agreement, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had Iran curb its nuclear programme and agree to rigorous inspections in return for the lifting of some international sanctions. But in 2018, during the presidency of Donald Trump, America abandoned the deal. In response, Iran began breaking parts of it.
President Joe Biden has promised to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance. In an address on August 3rd Mr Raisi said his government would take steps to lift the “tyrannical” sanctions imposed by America. But a sixth round of indirect negotiations to revive the JCPOA ended in June. There is no date set for the resumption of talks. Iran, meanwhile, has continued to expand its nuclear activity. It is enriching uranium beyond the levels required for civilian use and it has sharply curbed co-operation with inspectors.
Britain will raise the strike on the Mercer Street at the UN. “The UK is working with our international partners on a concerted response to this unacceptable attack,” said Dominic Raab, its foreign secretary. “Ultimately, we have got to restore deterrence,” said General Sir Nick Carter, its most senior military officer.
Still, America and Britain may want to limit any response in order to keep the JCPOA talks alive. Israel’s leaders, never fans of the nuclear deal, may prefer more forceful action. “This time the price is going up,” says Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence. ■

1746,"AFTER MONTHS of delay, what is one night more? On November 18th Democrats in America’s House of Representatives were preparing to pass the Build Back Better Act—an enormous climate and social-policy spending package that will define Joe Biden’s legacy—more than six months after it was proposed. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, decided to forestall the inevitable by staging a one-man, eight-and-a-half-hour stemwinder (a privilege only afforded to the two party leaders). A few hours after Mr McCarthy’s discursions on, among other things, the cost of a Tesla car, George Washington’s crossing of the Delaware River and the production method for baby carrots concluded, around 5am, Democrats dutifully passed the legislation on a party-line vote.
It is a step forward for Mr Biden, whose agenda appeared to be foundering as Democrats violently disagreed among themselves about what to do with their thin congressional majorities. The president’s approval rating has steadily declined as inflation has climbed (a problem that the White House now admits is real), amid a pandemic that the country has not quite managed to shake off. Defeat in the closely watched gubernatorial race in Virginia on November 2nd—where the president had won handily only the year before—seemed to augur a coming electoral wipeout.
But the president’s luck has turned—for now. On November 5th the House passed a bipartisan infrastructure deal that the Senate had already approved but was stuck in limbo because progressive Democrats wanted it to move in tandem with the social-spending bill. That measure will spend more than $400bn over the next decade on, among other things, roads, bridges, airports and removing lead from water pipes. Now, the House has also advanced the other piece of Mr Biden’s agenda. Its last and steepest challenge will come in the Senate, where Democrats remain divided and have no votes to spare in the face of united Republican opposition. Despite the procedural success, the actual contents of the president’s signature bill have been hastily cobbled together, with some portions drafted rather poorly. Few Americans actually understand what is in it, a messaging failure that suggests that even eventual passage would do little to sway public opinion about the president.
The House version incorporates some of the edits that Democratic senators, particularly Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema—moderates on whose votes the bill’s fate hinges—have been demanding. The recently released score by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the pending legislation would spend $1.7trn over the coming decade—a fraction of the sum the White House had originally pitched. The CBO also estimated that $367bn of that amount would be deficit-financed, which may prove a problem with moderates, though Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, argued that a provision that increases funding for the Internal Revenue Service would yield enough to balance the bill through stricter enforcement of tax laws. That will probably not be enough, though. The bill that eventually passes the Senate, if it does, will almost certainly be less ambitious than the House version.
The House version of Build Back Better spends most of its funds on various family benefits, though these are parcelled out among many initiatives. Around $273bn will go on subsidising demand for child care in a manner that seems likely to accelerate inflation. The bill would also establish a universal pre-kindergarten programme. Because of budgetary constraints, just four weeks of paid family and medical leave made it in—less than the 12 originally proposed. Even this is unlikely to pass, thanks to Mr Manchin’s concerted objections. The expanded child-tax credits that have successfully reduced child poverty in America (amazingly, a fact seldom trumpeted by the White House) would be maintained at their present levels for just one more year. Mr Manchin’s queries on this initiative may result in its being jettisoned entirely.
Although pared back, the climate-change mitigation provisions of the legislation, which would cost almost $500bn, would still be the most ambitious in American history. The heart of the president’s climate initiative, a programme to limit emissions from electricity generation, had already been cut out on the objections of Mr Manchin, from the coal-loving state of West Virginia. Instead, the majority of the spending will go to various tax credits for renewable energy. One of the few remaining punitive measures—a fee on emissions of methane, a very potent greenhouse gas—is also looking shaky because of Mr Manchin’s opposition. If enacted, these would probably significantly reduce the country’s overall emissions of greenhouse gases, though by less than Mr Biden promised when he was campaigning.
For the better part of a year now, Mr Biden has been stuck shaking and remaking a legislative cocktail. Its main ingredients—climate and family policies—look to be set, but its odd dashes of various accompaniments (such as the smattering of immigration reform) are unlikely to all remain in place. Time has not really improved the president’s recipe—if anything the results are becoming murkier with every new attempt. Many more revisions will be needed over the next few weeks. But at least the worst outcome, that of a shaker explosion, looks a good bit less likely.",2
1747,"WONKS SPENT months worried about the thousands of British workers sent home during the pandemic, who then lingered on the government’s furlough scheme. Were they simply being strung along by employers, to be discarded once it ended on September 30th? On November 16th the first batch of post-furlough labour-market data offered reassurance. The number of payrolled employees (that is, excluding the self-employed) grew by 0.6% in October compared with the previous month. The economy will need that dynamism as it adjusts to Brexit, covid-19, climate change—and more besides.

A big employment reshuffle is clearly under way in Britain, which is good news for growth if people move into roles they are better suited for. The share of workers switching jobs rose to a record high of 3.2% in the third quarter of the year (see chart). Encouragingly, this was mostly driven by people resigning rather than being dismissed. Fabrice Montagné and Abbas Khan of Barclays, a bank, note that this mobility was broad-based, having now spread beyond people with highly skilled jobs.

Other measures of dynamism are looking up, too. Joint research from the Centre for Economic Performance and the Resolution Foundation, two think-tanks, analyses the Decision Maker Panel, a survey of British companies. It suggests that financial officers expect the reallocation of workers from shrinking to growing companies (a measure of dynamism) to speed up in the coming year. A different business survey found that by July this year over 60% of companies had engaged in product innovation and nearly 70% had adopted new management practices. Since productivity increases when people and stuff are used more effectively, all this bodes well.
Britain’s productivity could certainly do with some added oomph. Before the crushing impact of covid-19 restrictions, it was languishing. Between 1995 and 2007 output per worker grew by around 2% a year, roughly matching the rate in the 25 richest members of the OECD. But during the next 12 years that figure for Britain was a dismal 0.4%, compared with an average of 0.9% among the rest.
Britain has long been known for outdated and ineffective management practices, so innovation here is a promising sign. As for labour dynamism, a back-of-the-envelope calculation from Juliana Oliveira-Cunha of the Centre for Economic Performance and her co-authors suggests that if just 4% of workers moved from the least productive companies to ones at the other end of the distribution, and those companies’ productivity remained unchanged, GDP could grow by a sizeable 6%. (They reject the commonly heard suggestion that improving Britain’s long tail of relatively unproductive firms would make a big difference, both by debunking the idea that this tail is indeed unusually long, or has grown in the past decade, and by pointing out that these firms are so unproductive that even large improvements would barely register at the level of the economy.)
As an explanation for Britain’s past productivity malaise, however, an insufficiently dynamic labour market cannot satisfy. Britain’s productivity has lagged behind that in other developed countries throughout recent decades, even as its companies created and destroyed jobs at a pretty steady rate relative to overall employment. Meanwhile, the rate of such creative destruction in France and America fell. Even as Britain’s productivity growth slowed between the 2000s and the 2010s, the researchers found that its economy actually became better at reallocating workers from less productive companies to more productive ones.
The researchers think that a surer path to a high-wage, high-productivity economy lies in raising investment. Between the public and private sectors, investment grew by less than1% in Britain over the five years to mid-2021, compared with an average of14% across France, Germany and America. Higher investment will be expensive in the short term, of course. But without it, sustained real wage increases are unlikely. For all the job-switching going on, underlying wage growth from July to September could be as low as 3.4% relative to the previous year. Meanwhile in October inflation reached 4.2%. Adapting to new challenges will require fixing the weaknesses in Britain’s economy, not merely playing to its strengths. ■",2
1748,"BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The German government has cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 2.6%, but lifted its estimate for next year to 4.1% as supply problems are delaying the recovery in Europe's largest economy, two sources familiar with the decision said on Tuesday.
The revised government forecast for gross domestic product growth compares with an April prediction for the economy to grow by 3.5% in 2021 and by 3.6% in 2022.
For 2023, the government now expects economic growth to normalise with an expansion rate of 1.6%, the two sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier will present the government's updated growth forecasts at a news conference on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Economy Ministry declined to comment on the updated figures.
The scarcity of semiconductors and other intermediate goods, caused by supply chain disruptions because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a rise in demand for chips in an increasingly digitalised world, is holding back German manufacturing output.
In addition to the supply problems with electronic components, companies are also struggling to meet high demand because of raw material shortages.
The widespread bottlenecks in production, coupled with unusually high demand, are leading to price increases and this is why the German government expects consumer price inflation to surge to 2.9% this year, one of the sources told Reuters.
But the government is sticking to its assessment that the price surge will be temporary, and sees inflation easing to 2.2% in 2022 and to 1.7% in 2023, the source said. The figures compare with consumer price inflation of 0.6% in 2020.
The mixed growth outlook for the economy comes after the Ifo institute said on Monday that business morale deteriorated for the fourth successive month in October and hit a six-month low.  read more 
It also chimes with the latest assessment of the central bank, which said on Monday economic growth is likely to slow sharply in the fourth quarter, with full-year growth now likely to be ""significantly"" below its 3.7% prediction made in June.",3
1749,"THE BALDING figure looks frail and harmless, sitting in the dock behind a Perspex screen in the German town of Koblenz, where the rivers Rhine and Moselle unite. But appearances can deceive. Anwar Raslan, 57, once a Syrian policeman, has been charged with torturing more than 4,000 people and murdering at least 58 between 2011 and 2012, when Syria’s dictator, Bashar al-Assad, set about crushing the initially peaceful demonstrations that shook his regime as the Arab spring took off.
Mr Raslan is on trial because, by his own lights, he made a mistake. Having fallen out with the regime, in 2012 he joined the exodus of Syrians who ended up in Germany, where he seemed to be settling down nicely with his family in a Berlin suburb, until one of his alleged victims, by a fluke, spotted his presence—and told a human-rights group. With the encouragement of NGOs, in particular the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), Germany’s judicial authorities applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, whereby human-rights violators of any nationality can be charged in any country, no matter where the crimes were committed. Mr Raslan was arrested in 2019. His trial began in Koblenz in April 2020 and may last for more than a year.

Scores of witnesses will be called before five German judges. Thousands of photographs collected by a Syrian military photographer may be shown. A gravedigger has described the condition of hundreds of bodies, often mutilated in the dungeons of the building where Mr Raslan is said to have worked, which were thrown into mass graves. A catalogue of torture is being spelt out in court, including electric shocks, the pulling out of fingernails, beatings with cables and whips, hanging upside down, dousing with cold water and rape—nothing was too cruel.
The idea of universal jurisdiction won global attention in 1998 when a murderous former president of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, mistakenly presuming diplomatic immunity, was arrested in Britain at the request of a Spanish judge—and was eventually sent home. Since then the practice has gathered pace. A new case opened on December 3rd in a court in Switzerland, where Alieu Kosiah, a Liberian former commander, is being tried for crimes such as mass murder and recruiting child soldiers, allegedly committed during a civil war more than 20 years ago in his home country.
The number of universal jurisdiction cases is rising. Máximo Langer, an Argentine expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, counts 815 such cases from 2008 to 2017, nearly as many as in the previous two decades put together. At least 16 countries have heard cases under universal jurisdiction; 71 cases have been completed, mostly with convictions. About 40% of the defendants have been African, a quarter from the Middle East, a fifth from Europe and 8% from Asia. Other regions may follow; Argentina is keen to use this powerful tool. Some countries allow universal-jurisdiction trials in absentia.
Spain and Belgium led the way in pursuing cases under universal jurisdiction. The Netherlands, the Nordics and Switzerland are prominent among countries where such cases are being tried. Germany is in the vanguard. According to Patrick Kroker of the ECCHR, which has helped at least a dozen plaintiffs in the Koblenz trial, 110 cases are now being investigated under universal jurisdiction in Germany, most of them to do with Iraq and Syria (concerning both the Assad regime and the slave-owning jihadists of Islamic State). The Koblenz case is the first where a member of the Syrian regime, albeit of middle rank, is facing justice in court.
Human-rights campaigners do not see universal jurisdiction as a rival system to the various international courts set up in the past two decades or so, culminating in the International Criminal Court (ICC). Rather, it is complementary. It is useful because the old system has holes in it. For example, the creation of UN-backed international courts and tribunals for Syria has been stymied by powerful countries (often China and Russia) which scorn the concept of individual rights and are bent on protecting their protégés. “The ICC has been blocked over Syria,” laments Fergal Gaynor, an Irish human-rights lawyer who is bidding to be the ICC’s next chief prosecutor. “So an expansive universal justice system has had to step in.”

The ICC, which started to operate in The Hague in 2002, remains the cornerstone of an ambitious new architecture of international justice. It is the sole permanent court where grand-scale offenders, including heads of governments and states, can face justice for serious crimes, the “core” ones being torture, crime of aggression, crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Two-thirds of the world’s countries—123 at last count, 33 of them African—have signed up to it. Its main message is that no leader should consider himself (rarely, so far, herself) to have impunity.
The ICC has stumbled largely because of geopolitics. It can function properly only if its signatories fulfil their obligations to arrest and send those indicted to The Hague. A clutch of important countries—the United States, China, Russia and India—have refused to sign up, citing encroachments on sovereignty. Cases can be referred to the ICC only by the UN Security Council or with the consent of the country where the crimes occurred. The council has referred only two cases, during brief moments when America, China and Russia decided not to block: Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s president, was indicted for alleged genocide in his country’s western region, Darfur; and Libya’s late dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, was indicted at the height of the Arab spring, when he was bombing civilians in the city of Benghazi.
Going down in Africa
The ICC has succeeded in convicting only a handful of big men, all of them African. Several African governments, at first keen on the court after the genocide in Rwanda, have concluded that it was anti-African, though all the African cases, bar Libya’s and Sudan’s, had been referred to the ICC by African governments themselves.
It was thanks to the mediation of a recently retired secretary-general of the UN, Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian, that in 2011 Kenya’s then government was persuaded to let the ICC indict two rivals, after a bloodily disputed election. It charged Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, who later became president and vice-president, with crimes against humanity, but later had to drop the charges. “The ICC was no match for Kenya’s government,” says Reed Brody, an American human-rights lawyer. “It controlled everything—the country, the witnesses, the evidence. No way could the people in The Hague win.” The ICC was humiliated.
The failure of states to arrest Sudan’s Mr Bashir as he swanned around Africa, even though they had signed up to the ICC, was another reminder of the court’s lack of authority: South Africa rolled out the red carpet for him. Another low point for it was when Laurent Gbagbo, a former president of Ivory Coast, whom it had charged with crimes against humanity, was acquitted eight years later.
Supporters of the ICC cite other tribunals backed by the UN that did bring justice to the many victims of atrocities during Yugoslavia’s break-up in the 1990s and during Rwanda’s genocide, which saw perhaps 500,000 people murdered, mostly with machetes, in 1994. Around 90 ex-Yugoslav and 61 Rwandan culprits were sentenced to prison, many for life. A final appeal by Ratko Mladic, the general who oversaw the massacre of 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, will be heard in 2021, closing a judicial process that has lasted a generation.
While the ICC has struggled, other “hybrid” courts have been more effective, embracing a medley of ad hoc judicial systems operating under a mix of home-grown and foreign judges. “The ICC will never be a solution for all human-rights violations,” says Serge Brammertz, a long-serving chief prosecutor for the Yugoslav tribunal. “I believe in an à la carte system: the ICC has an important but not the only role.”
Mix and match
That may be the best way to go. Mr Brody led a successful campaign to convict Hissène Habré, a mass-murdering former president of Chad who had fled into exile in Senegal, where he was tried and sentenced to life in 2016 by a special UN-backed African court. In that case, though justice was achieved in an ad hoc court, the legal process against Mr Habré was initiated under universal jurisdiction by Belgium, eventually cajoling a new government in Senegal, backed by the African Union, into setting up a special court. Mr Brody says that Mr Habré’s Chadian victims were inspired to seek justice by the Pinochet precedent.
Another recent case illustrates the enduring effectiveness of UN-backed tribunals. Félicien Kabuga owned a Rwandan radio station that helped orchestrate the genocide, urging neighbour to slaughter neighbour. He evaded arrest for 26 years; an informant who tried to lead police to him in Kenya in 2003 was found dead in a pool of blood. He was arrested near Paris last May, where he was living under a false identity, and sent to the ICC. He may be sent on to the Tanzanian city of Arusha, where a “special mechanism” has taken over from the Rwandan tribunal (it closed in 2015) to try the last of the génocidaires.
In the past decade or so other human-rights bodies have also set their sights on the worst offenders. The UN’s Human Rights Council (HRC), the nearest thing to a permanent global state-backed monitor, is often ridiculed because its 47-strong membership, chosen in regional groups, often on uncontested slates, always includes a clutch of egregious violators. As of January 1st it embraces the likes of Bahrain, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Russia and Somalia. The council keeps Israel permanently under special scrutiny—the sole country it constantly scolds.
Less toothless than it appears
The United States, an active and effective HRC member under Barack Obama, refused to take part under Donald Trump. Yet despite its faults the HRC is useful. Its system of Universal Periodic Review puts every country in the spotlight every four years. The commissions of inquiry it can order have often laid the groundwork for further investigations, sometimes by other bodies with more teeth. And many of its 50-plus “special rapporteurs” and “independent experts” have written trenchant exposés of torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions—along with more arcane topics such as the mistreatment of people with albinism and leprosy.
In 2005 the UN endorsed the principle of a “responsibility to protect” in cases of genocide or mass atrocities, justifying liberal military interventions. This has largely fallen into disuse. China and Russia are likely to veto any such proposal that comes before the UN Security Council.

However, governments that care about human rights have become savvier at getting around such obstacles. Although Mr Assad’s regime shows no sign of collapse, a vast body of damning evidence is being collected, which may one day be used in court against the regime’s chief villains. The Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), a Dutch-based NGO involved in the Koblenz case, is said to have collected 800,000 documents incriminating Mr Assad and his torturers.
Another way of circumventing the big human-rights blockers is to work through the UN General Assembly instead of the Security Council. A resolution presented in 2016 by tiny Liechtenstein led to the creation of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to investigate crimes in Syria since 2011. Not to be outdone, the almost as tiny Gambia pulled off a similar judicial coup, after the HRC had passed a resolution in 2018 to create an “Independent, Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar”. The Gambia got the backing of the 57-country Organisation of Islamic Co-operation to take Myanmar to the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ), the world’s highest court where states may contest each other, for its mistreatment of the Rohingyas, a Muslim minority. In September the Netherlands said it would hold Syria responsible, also at the ICJ, for gross violations under the UN’s Convention against Torture.
Is this panoply of tribunals, laws and reports, which name and shame countries and people, a true deterrent? “It’s impossible to prove a negative,” says Andrew Gilmour, former deputy head of the UN’s High Commission for Human Rights. “But yes, they do mind—they hate being shamed,” he says, citing the lengths to which countries such as China go to prevent scrutiny. “Anyone who says they don’t care—it’s nonsense,” says Prince Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the UN’s former high commissioner for human rights, who adds hopefully that “One day the ICC will become a powerful court.”
Moreover, there are signs that weaker countries that once kowtowed to China at forums such as the HRC are increasingly reluctant to do so. A row is brewing over the election of the council’s next agenda-setting president. China seems bent on stopping Fiji, which takes human rights seriously, from winning the post. Instead it is promoting a pliable candidate of its own, Bahrain. Five years ago China would easily have prevailed; now it is less cocksure.
Back on track
Whereas Mr Trump cared little for human rights, campaigners are confident that President Joe Biden will promote them. He is unlikely to sign up to the ICC, particularly as it may investigate America’s protégé Israel and perhaps, for alleged crimes in Afghanistan, America itself. But Mr Biden is likely to drop Mr Trump’s bizarre executive order to put sanctions on the ICC’s staff, including its chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, should they visit America. The United States may once again tacitly support the ICC, as it did before. Mr Biden may also seek to rejoin the HRC, where America under Mr Obama often led the way.
Human-rights campaigners say the enduring web of tribunals and the spread of universal jurisdiction are raising hopes. “Things are moving in an interesting direction,” says Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group, a think-tank in Geneva. “We need a range of tools,” he adds, hailing the EU and various states for enacting Magnitsky laws (named after a tax accountant murdered for exposing government chicanery in Russia) to prosecute individuals for human-rights violations or grand corruption. “It’s a very different climate,” says Mr Brody, who is seeking to have Yahya Jammeh, the Gambia’s former dictator, extradited from his exile in Equatorial Guinea to face charges of complicity in murder.
“A whole lot of things are happening that make international justice possible,” says Stephen Rapp, Mr Obama’s ambassador for war-crimes issues, who calls himself “a fan of universal jurisdiction and of hybrid courts”. Patience is in order. Mr Bashir, in detention since he was overthrown in 2019, may yet face justice, perhaps in a hybrid court in Sudan. Mr Raslan, the Syrian policeman on trial in Koblenz, may not be the sort of bigwig the ICC is intended to nail. But for torture victims in Syria, the trial is a welcome step. The evidence piling up, thanks to universal jurisdiction in Germany and elsewhere, suggests that Mr Assad may not enjoy impunity forever. ■",2
1750,"THANKS ESPECIALLY to ubiquitous camera-phones, today’s wars have been filmed more than any in history. Consider the growing archives of Mnemonic, a Berlin charity that preserves video that purports to document war crimes and other violations of human rights. If played nonstop, Mnemonic’s collection of video from Syria’s decade-long war would run until 2061. Mnemonic also holds seemingly bottomless archives of video from conflicts in Sudan and Yemen. Even greater amounts of potentially relevant additional footage await review online.
Outfits that, like Mnemonic, scan video for evidence of rights abuses note that the task is a slog. Some trim costs by recruiting volunteer reviewers. Not everyone, however, is cut out for the tedium and, especially, periodic dreadfulness involved. That is true even for paid staff. Karim Khan, who leads a United Nations team in Baghdad investigating Islamic State (IS) atrocities, says viewing the graphic cruelty causes enough “secondary trauma” for turnover to be high. The UN project, called UNITAD, is sifting through documentation that includes more than a year’s worth of video, most of it found online or on the phones and computers of captured or killed IS members.

Now, however, reviewing such video is becoming much easier. Technologists are developing a type of artificial-intelligence (AI) software that uses “machine vision” to rapidly scour video for imagery that suggests an abuse of human rights has been recorded. It’s early days, but the software is promising. A number of organisations, including Mnemonic and UNITAD, have begun to operate such programs.
This year UNITAD began to run one dubbed Zeteo. It performs well, says David Hasman, one of its operators. Zeteo can be instructed to find—and, if the image resolution is decent, typically does find—bits of video showing things like explosions, beheadings, firing into a crowd and grave-digging. Zeteo can also spot footage of a known person’s face, as well as scenes as precise as a woman walking in uniform, a boy holding a gun in twilight, and people sitting on a rug with an IS flag in view. Searches can encompass metadata that reveals when, where and on what devices clips were filmed.
Zeteo was developed for the UN, with input from its investigators, by Microsoft. The American software giant has built a few such programs as part of a project it calls AI for Humanitarian Action. The goal is to accelerate prosecutions, says Justin Spelhaug, Microsoft’s head of “technology for social impact”. Half a dozen organisations are now using specially developed Microsoft software to comb video for potential evidence of war crimes and the like. Microsoft provides the technology at little or no cost.
A recent achievement hints at how such capabilities can help. The Atlantic Council, an American think-tank that sees great promise in its tests of machine vision, sought to identify a man who had been photographed in Syria, his face blurred out, holding chopped-off heads. The outfit’s Digital Forensic Research Lab ingeniously studied how squiggly patterns in the man’s camouflage met at seams. After scouring the web for imagery of people in similar fatigues, the researchers found non-blurred images of a man wearing those very fatigues. The researchers have identified the man and his affiliation with the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary firm.
Developing software that spots certain objects or actions in video is often straightforward. It involves feeding algorithms for object recognition with masses of imagery of whatever is to be found. This means it is relatively easy to train software to recognise leaping cats or other things that abound online. But footage showing a violation of human rights is rarer. This makes it hard to assemble a collection of visual examples that is big and diverse enough to teach software to find similar fare. But there is a creative workaround.
Banned cluster munitions have been dropped on civilians in Syria, and Mnemonic wants to pull together video clips that show that the bombardment has been systematic. To help with that, a programmer in Berlin, Adam Harvey, is developing software called VFRAME. Training it requires at least 2,000 distinct images of each type of cluster munition, and five times as many would be better. Finding that would take ages. Mr Harvey therefore produces the imagery himself.
With funding from Germany’s government and other sources, Mr Harvey 3D-prints replicas of prohibited bomblets such as the AO-2.5RT, a Russian-made submunition dropped in Syria. He adds markings and, for some of the replicas, rust, scuffs and other damage. The replicas are then photographed, from many angles and in different lighting, amid rubble, rocks, leaves, mud and sand. For the realism of greater chromatic variation, a handful of old and new camera-phones, as well as multiple lens settings, are used.
The approach is paying off. In tests on portions of Mnemonic’s Syria and Yemen archives, VFRAME catches roughly 65% of clips that show one of the handful of types of cluster munitions modelled. Mr Harvey expects the detection rate to reach 80% by mid-June. VFRAME will then be unleashed on Mnemonic’s full archives. As for scanning the “firehose” of video posted on social media, Mnemonic’s Dia Kayyali says testing with VFRAME has begun.
Mnemonic sends video to legal bodies. So far, these have included a Belgian court, war-crimes investigation units in France, Germany and Sweden, and several UN legal teams. But Daanish Masood of the UN’s Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs also envisages a use for software that scours online video for violence and its aftermath as a source of operational intelligence, requiring less than legal certainty. He hopes VFRAME will eventually help UN peacekeepers track marauding armed groups.
Similar software seems to have already been put to another intelligence use. The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), an R body for America’s spooks, gave Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh $9m to develop machine-vision software called E-LAMP. How that software has been put to use by intelligence agencies is unknown, but it probably includes finding terrorist videos for training and propaganda. Alexander Hauptmann, one of E-LAMP’s creators at Carnegie Mellon, says the software had to be able to spot, among other things, cake-making and cellphone repair, likely proxies for mixing explosives and building detonators.
E-LAMP finds those activities, he says. Even so, such programs can be fiddly. E-LAMP was also given to a Washington, DC non-profit, the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre (SJAC), that seeks video evidence of war crimes. But SJAC stopped using the software after two years. It required too much processing power and maintenance, says its director, Mohammad Al Abdallah. Accuracy was patchy, too. SJAC’s queries for video of small missiles positioned for launch would typically also find electricity poles.
A new trick promises greater accuracy. SJAC is adopting a program called JusticeAI that seeks matches between a video’s audio and a sound library. JusticeAI recognises things such as a missile’s hiss, the popping of cluster munitions, a siren near gunfire and protest chants that turn to screams. Its users include Mnemonic and the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The software was developed by a Silicon Valley charity called Benetech with funding from America’s government. Microsoft contributed code and $300,000.
Heady stuff, to be sure. But efforts to archive as much video of abuses as possible, be it for prosecutors or historians, face an additional hurdle. Facebook, YouTube and other big online platforms also use such software as a more efficient way of spotting and removing unsavoury images that some regulators claim could inspire copycats. Compared to those companies, human-rights groups are mere “poor cousin” users of such technology, laments Sam Gregory of Witness, a Brooklyn charity that helps people film abuses.
It adds up to a paradox. The software advances that are now helping human-rights groups document atrocities are also making it easier for social-media platforms to suppress potential evidence. Mr Gregory argues for the creation of “evidence lockers”—repositories that would keep grisly video out of the public eye but available for authorised viewing. The proposal seems sensible. Momentum, however, has yet to build, even though the matter has become more urgent. On April 29th the European Parliament approved a rule that threatens online platforms with eye-watering fines for not removing, within an hour, content a member state deems terrorist. As a result, automated deletions are up.",2
1751,"THE CONSERVATIVES have undergone many transformations in their time: from the party of the landed squirearchy to that of the industrial bourgeoisie; from the post-war consensus to free-market radicalism. Now they are undergoing another. For 40 years, from the choice of Margaret Thatcher as its leader in 1975 to David Cameron stepping down as prime minister in 2016, Tories stood for small government. Today they are the party of big-government conservatism.
The budget provided a vivid illustration. By the mid-2020s public spending will be the highest, as a share of GDP, since the mid-1970s. By the same measure, taxation will be its highest since the early 1950s. But there is more to big-government conservatism than the size of the state. There is the philosophy of the state as well. And under Boris Johnson, the Conservatives have set themselves aims they think can be achieved only by big-state activism.

The most obvious is “levelling up”. The division between prosperous south and deprived north goes back centuries: read Elizabeth Gaskell’s “North and South”, published in 1854. And London’s economic pre-eminence is the result of natural agglomeration. Successful banks attract others, which attract accountants and lawyers, which attract restaurants and art galleries, and so on. Increasingly, the government seems to feel this cannot be countered without it intervening muscularly, for example by splashing out on infrastructure and backing economic clusters.
Levelling up also involves reining in the over-mighty “liberal elite”, from the BBC and academia to the legal system and civil service. Tories like to refer to this elite as the “blob” because its members all live in the same sorts of places (Islingtonia) and believe the same sorts of things (“diversity”, meaning varied ethnicities rather than viewpoints). The government thinks Brexit exposed a dangerous gulf between liberal elites and the masses who pay their salaries. And it worries that a “woke ratchet” is making that gulf wider, as members of the elite try to impress each other by embracing trans rights, critical race theory and cancel culture.
The result is a flurry of state activism, including an academic-freedom bill that is designed to prevent the no-platforming of speakers; a housing bill that gives locals a say over the appearance of new buildings; a judicial review and courts bill that it says will increase democratic oversight; a more confrontational stance towards the BBC and legal profession, and a policy of moving civil servants out of London and into the provinces.
Some of this is political hardball. The Conservative Party captured huge swathes of northern England in 2019, and is pouring resources into these new territories. It is increasingly the party of the working class and the elderly, so picking a fight with young and middle-aged trendies makes sense. But the embrace of state activism also means an evolution in conservative thinking—or perhaps, more accurately, a growing recognition of the difference between conservatism and classical liberalism.
Legend has it that Mrs Thatcher used to pull Friedrich Hayek’s “The Constitution of Liberty” from her handbag and declare: “This is what we believe.” Yet the book’s postscript is called “Why I am not a conservative”. Tories are returning to explicitly conservative thinkers such as Edmund Burke, who said government was a “contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right that these wants be provided for by this wisdom.” They are concluding not only that market-first policies do not always produce conservative solutions, but that unleashing market forces in academia and the legal profession coincided with a leftward move in both, as universities embraced critical theory in various guises and lawyers struck gold in human-rights law. Indeed, market forces can undermine a conservative society’s foundations. Big government is then not an aberration, as Thatcherites contend, but a tool to achieve conservative ends.
In a democracy, conservatism relies on equality of opportunity. The race of life, in which only some get prizes, is seen as illegitimate unless everybody gets a fair start. But in the past four decades the starting line has become more uneven, as the successful have hoarded resources for their children, and wealth has become more regionally concentrated. Seen in this light, conservatives are duty-bound to embrace vigorous state action in order to restore faith in the system.
Conservatism also depends on healthy communities, including the nation state. In her glory days, Thatcher saw no tension between market and nation. The orgy of patriotism that followed the Falklands war coincided with an orgy of money-making in the City. But the tensions have increased as Chinese competition has destroyed manufacturing jobs and Amazon has laid waste to bricks-and-mortar retailers. In 2019 the Conservatives’ election manifesto promised government action to spruce up town centres and improve bus services. Mr Johnson has presented labour shortages caused by tighter immigration rules since Britain left the European Union as a chance to increase wages and productivity.
Super-size me
Big-government conservatism is rife with problems and potential problems. The government may pursue narrow party advantage rather than tackle them: the choice of Nadine Dorries, a combatively philistine MP, as culture secretary is hardly encouraging. It may also override the few checks that restrain Britain’s over-mighty executive. The idea that “out-of-touch” lawyers need to be subject to democratic control would be more convincing if the government didn’t treat Parliament with such contempt. And Thatcher’s warning that socialist governments “always run out of other people’s money” applies equally to big-government conservatism. But whatever squalls or shipwrecks lie ahead, Mr Johnson’s Conservative Party is the party of government activism, rather than government restraint. ■",2
1752,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",3
1753,"Almost one in five Brits are not planning normal Christmas and New Year's celebrations amid lingering fears over the coronavirus crisis, according to a new poll. 
An exclusive survey conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for MailOnline found the majority of people - 81 per cent - do intend to go ahead with normal celebrations but 19 per cent said they do not. 
Meanwhile, the nation is split on whether the Government could impose new coronavirus rules which would disrupt festive gatherings. 
Some 48 per cent of people expect there will not be any coronavirus restrictions preventing normal Christmas gatherings this year. 
But almost a third - 31 per cent - expect that there will be such restrictions put in place while 20 per cent said they did not know.    
The poll findings come after Boris Johnson said earlier this week that he could not rule out a lockdown over the Christmas period. 
The Prime Minister said that while the data did not show, at the moment, that any additional measures were needed, he could not give a guarantee for the coming weeks and months.  
Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: 'Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to – non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions – get the boosters.'  
The PM warned there were 'storm clouds' gathering over parts of Europe with a 'new wave' of the virus sweeping across the continent. 
'We don't yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent,' he said.
'Those countries with lower vaccination rates have tended to see bigger surges in infection and in turn been forced to respond with harsher measures while those countries with higher vaccination rates have so far fared better.
'It shows us that if we want to control the epidemic here in the UK and if we want to avoid restrictions on our daily lives we must all get vaccinated as soon as we are eligible.'
The Government announced on Monday that adults aged over 40 will be invited to receive booster jabs in the coming weeks.
Mr Johnson added: 'It would be an utter tragedy if, after everything we have been through, people who had done the right thing by getting double vaccinated ended up becoming seriously ill or even losing their lives because they allowed their immunity to wane.'",-2
1754,"The charred remains of a 2,100-year-old Greek fortress have been unearthed in Israel and experts say the scene provides 'tangible evidence of the Hanukkah story.'
Hanukkah, an eight-day Jewish celebration, honors the rededication during the second century BC of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, where Jews rose up against their Greek-Syrian oppressors in the Maccabean Revolt – and this stronghold was destroyed by Jewish rebels during the uprising.
The fortress, measuring 50 feet by 50 feet, was constructed of stone walls nine feet thick before it was burned to the ground during the Hasmoneans and Seleucids battle.
Hasmonean was a dynasty of Jewish Kings who fought to liberate Judea from Seleucid rule, which was a Greek dynasty reigning over a large portion of the Middle East.
The ancient battle began when the Hasmoneans spotted Seleucid soldiers stationed in the fortress that sat on a hill overlooking a hill overlooking the Hellenistic city of Maresha.
No fighting was done inside the structure, but the Jewish rebels knock down the roof that led to the walls collapsing – and then they set their enemy fortress ablaze.

According to Saar Ganor, Vladik Lifshits, and Ahinoam Montagu, excavation directors on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, 'It appears that we have discovered a fortress, part of a fortified line erected by the Hellenistic army commanders, built to protect the large Hellenistic city of Maresha from Hasmonean offensive.
'Our theory is that the Seleucids blocked the entrance of the fortress and fled to the city as their enemies approached.'
Hanukkah commemorates the Maccabean, or Hasmonean, victories over the forces of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes who reigned from 175 to 164 BC and rededication of the Temple.
The revolt was led by Mattathias Maccabues and his son Judas, who were the first Jews who fought to defend their religious beliefs rather than their lives. of the restored Temple should be celebrated every year for eight days beginning on that date.
The Maccabean revolt led to the capture of Jerusalem, the reestablishment of Jewish worship in the Temple, and the Hasmonean dynasty that ruled Judea until about 67 BC.   
The fortress was divided into seven rooms and the walls still stand an impressive six feet even after crumbling thousands of years ago.
In addition, the excavation uncovered a stairwell leading to a second floor, which was not preserved.
While moving mounds of dirt away from the ruins, archaeologists uncovered thousands of collapsed stones that revealed a massive one-foot-thick destruction layer that held hundreds of artifacts dating to the late second century BC.
The team pulled troves of pottery, slingshots, iron weapons, burnt wooden beams and dozens of coins from the site.
'Based on the finds and coins, the building's destruction can be attributed to the Idumea led by the Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus around 112 BCE,' the archaeologists said in a statement.
Hyrcanus, a high priest and ruler of the Jewish nation, was a son of Simon Maccabeus who was the youngest son of Mattathias Maccabeus.
IAA general director, Eli Eskozido said in a statement: 'he stories of the Maccabees are coming to life before our eyes, and this is the most fascinating part of the Israel Antiquities Authority's work, when dedicated, hardworking archaeologists breathe life into the historical annals of the people who passed through this land.
'In a few days, we will be celebrating Hanukkah, whose central theme is the Hasmoneans' defeat of the Hellenists, leading to the establishment of the first independent sovereign Jewish entity. 
'The Hasmoneans could have had no idea that 2,000 years later, students living in the State of Israel would be following in their footsteps. It is extremely exciting.'",-2
1755,"Shell announced a big change to its corporate structure, with plans to move its tax residency from the Netherlands to Britain, dump its dual-share structure and remove the legacy “Royal Dutch” from its legal name. The oil giant is under pressure to increase returns to investors. Relocating its tax base to Britain gives it more freedom on share buy-backs. Shell is keeping several big divisions, such as global upstream, in the Netherlands. Nevertheless the Dutch government said it was “unpleasantly surprised” by the news.
Toshiba laid out formal proposals to split into three publicly listed companies, a move that came soon after General Electric’s similar decision to split. The Japanese conglomerate wants to house its nuclear, infrastructure and engineering businesses in one company, create an asset-management firm that will oversee its tech holdings in another, and start a new company for its chips and small devices. Some shareholders want Toshiba to sell itself to a private-equity buyer instead.

Meanwhile, Johnson  Johnson, another huge conglomerate, said it would spin off its consumer-health division into a separate business, leaving it to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
Natural-gas prices surged in Europe again, after Germany’s energy regulator temporarily suspended its certification of the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to transport Russian gas to western Europe. More Russian supplies would ease the continent’s energy crunch, but the regulator said that the pipeline’s operator was not in a “legal shape compliant with German law”.
Japan’s economy shrank by 0.8% in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, a blow for Kishida Fumio, the new prime minister, ahead of his announcement of a big stimulus package. Business investment plunged in the quarter, as global supply-chain problems hit the country’s exporters. Consumer spending also fell amid a resurgence of covid-19.

Britain’s annual inflation rate jumped to 4.2% in October, the highest level in a decade and up from 3.1% in September. This was mostly because of higher energy costs and supply-chain shortages, but a tightening labour market has added to inflationary pressures. The number of people in employment rose sharply in October, allaying fears that many of the 1m still on the government’s furlough scheme, which ended in September, would lose their jobs. Record job-vacancy rates persist, which often leads to higher wages to attract staff.
Joe Biden accused oil and gas companies of “anti-consumer behaviour”, alleging they were ramping up petrol prices for profit, and asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. The president is under political pressure as a result of surging prices at petrol pumps.
What supply-chain crisis?
Walmart reported a bumper quarter for sales, and said its shelves would be fully stocked for the Christmas shopping season. The retailer has found that shoppers are gradually returning to pre-pandemic habits, with more of them visiting physical stores than a year ago. Target issued a similar earnings report.
Just a week after its IPO, Rivian, a maker of electric vehicles backed by Amazon, reached $153bn in market capitalisation, overtaking Volkswagen in value. Its share price then dived by 15%, wiping out its lead over VW. Lucid, which produces luxury electric cars, passed Ford in market value. Rivian and Lucid have yet to make a profit, but investors are betting that the companies’ shares will perform as well as Tesla’s, though they could also be as volatile.
The British government ordered a full investigation into Nvidia’s proposed acquisition of Arm, a British chip-designer, in part on national-security grounds. Nvidia, America’s most valuable semiconductor manufacturer, later revealed that America’s Federal Trade Commission has “expressed concerns” about the deal, which is also being investigated in the European Union.
AstraZeneca is looking to make “modest” profits from new orders of its covid-19 vaccine. The drugmaker produced its vaccine in collaboration with Oxford University, and has been selling it without a profit margin (unlike rival firms). Its doses have been used mostly in Europe, but also in developing countries, where it will still be sold at cost.
The right to be disconnected
News sites pored over the recent approval of a law in Portugal that bans employers from contacting their staff outside working hours, including by email. Companies will also have to pay some of the cost of remote working, such as an employee’s higher energy bills, and cannot monitor home workers in any way. Office workers in Portugal have nothing to lose, it seems, but their email chains.",2
1756,"WHEN IT COMES to tackling climate change, the British government lacks neither ambition nor self-regard. In 2019 it enacted a law committing itself to reaching net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. A medium-sized country that accounts for 1% of global emissions believes it can pull the rest of the world along at a UN climate conference next month in Glasgow. But is Britain serious about keeping its own promises? A flurry of government plans released this week suggest not.
The net-zero strategy contains many bold targets, which often come with caveats. By 2035 Britain will be powered entirely by green electricity, “subject to security of supply”. By the same year, every new home-heating system installed should be an efficient electric-heat pump or a hydrogen boiler, so long as the costs of such things fall to a reasonable level. Tree-planting will more than double in speed.

Wisely, the government recognises that there are many ways to reach net-zero emissions. Britain may move quickly away from fossil fuels and to electricity provided by wind turbines and new nuclear-power stations. Alternatively, it could rely on hydrogen, capturing the carbon released when it is created from natural gas. The government will spray money at lots of tech—hydrogen production, small nuclear reactors, devices that take carbon from the air—in the hope that some work cheaply.
“It’s more detailed and ambitious than anything you’ll find elsewhere in the world,” says Chris Stark, chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, an official watchdog. Inevitably, some government departments (such as business and transport) have bolder, more detailed plans than others (such as agriculture). But it is useful to know which are the laggards. Encouragingly, most political critics of the plans argued that the government should do more, not less.
Yet getting to net zero, or even close, is so difficult that Britain must do everything right. And there are two weak links in the chain that connects dreams to accomplishments. Unfortunately, these are the two strongest institutions in the government.
The first is the Treasury. The problem is not so much that it might have provided more money to speed the green transition, although that is true. A much-touted £450m ($620m) subsidy scheme for heat pumps may cover only 30,000 installations a year, for example. The larger problem is what Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official who now works at the Institute for Government, a think-tank, calls the department’s “wholly owned, proprietorial approach” to tax.
The Treasury sees its job as collecting money from the public and distributing it to other departments, to be spent (often unwisely, it fears) on their projects. It does not regard taxes as devices to help departments achieve their objectives. So the transport department must try to decarbonise the roads by subsidising electric cars and banning the sale of petrol- and diesel-powered ones. The more obvious (and economically efficient) route of taxing fuel more highly is out of the question.
The second weak link is the prime minister, Boris Johnson. This week he shilled for his government’s green plans with typical bonhomie. He cheerfully misquoted Gordon Gekko from the film “Wall Street”, likened himself to Moses and assured readers of the Sun newspaper that the “greenshirts of the boiler police” would not “kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet” and seize their gas-fired devices.

Political salesmanship and cheer are good things. The trouble with Mr Johnson is that he cannot bear to deliver bad news. The government’s net-zero strategy contains soothing words about working with the grain of consumer choice. There is, as the prime minister puts it, not “a hair shirt in sight”. But if Britain is to reach net zero, many noses must be put out of joint.
Especially noses belonging to people on whose votes Mr Johnson depends. The old have bigger carbon footprints than the young, largely because they tend to live alone or with one other person. Their consumption patterns will have to change. Yet the Conservative government relies on older voters (see charts). Nasty geographical patterns exacerbate the problem. Installing a heat pump costs around 7% of average net housing wealth across the Midlands and north of England, where the Conservatives won many new votes at the general election in 2019, but less than 3% in London, where the party has given up.
Mr Johnson could be bolder. A poll for The Economist by Ipsos MORI finds not only that 83% of Britons are concerned about climate change, but also that 51% believe the cost of tackling it will, in a year’s time, be larger than any savings from things like lower heating bills and cheaper petrol. Only 9% think the savings will be higher than the costs. People expect the trade-off to be more favourable in ten years’ time. Britons seem to be prepared for hair shirts. They just don’t want to wear them forever.■

1757,"America’s annual inflation rate soared to 4.2% in April, higher than expected and fuelling concerns that rising consumer prices may become a problem for the American economy. Inflation hawks blame the huge amounts of stimulus injected into the economy and a boom in consumer demand (prices for used cars were up by a fifth, year on year). Global supply bottlenecks are also pushing up costs for manufacturers. The Biden administration, however, thinks inflationary pressures are temporary and will ease later this year.
Commodity prices are also going up, with the prices of iron ore and copper reaching record highs, in part because China’s factories are sucking up supplies. Oil prices are on the ascent again, approaching $70 for a barrel of Brent crude.

The FBI launched an investigation into a cyber-attack that forced the closure of the Colonial Pipeline, which stretches from Texas to New Jersey, providing half the transport fuel for America’s east coast. A criminal gang called DarkSide claimed responsibility. It describes itself as apolitical. There was some panic-buying of petrol (gas) as pump prices soared.
With the outlook for inflation uncertain, stockmarkets bounced around as investors pondered whether the Federal Reserve would change direction and raise interest rates. The share prices of high-growth big tech companies have fallen in recent weeks because higher bond yields lower the value of their forecast earnings.
Markets were also rattled by weak data on the American jobs market. Employers added 266,000 people to their payrolls in April, well below the numbers for February and March. And job vacancies hit 8.1m at the end of March, the most since records were first compiled in 2000. That led to a lot of head-scratching by economists trying to explain a lack of hiring when the economy is taking off.
Just warming up
The British economy shrank by 1.5% in the first quarter compared with the previous three months. The post-Christmas lockdown hit output hard in January, but by March it was expanding again as businesses adapted to the restrictions. GDP was still 6% smaller than before the start of the pandemic in February 2020.
SoftBank reported net income of ¥5trn ($46bn) for the year ending March 31st, a record annual profit for a Japanese company. Much of that came from gains in its vision-fund investments, particularly Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce company that went public in March. It reported a deep quarterly loss this week, despite rising sales.
Elon Musk, a vocal backer of digital currencies, reversed his three-month-old policy and said that Tesla would not now accept bitcoin as payment for its cars because of the environmental effects from the electricity used to power the currency on computers.
The EU’s General Court, the second highest in the bloc, ruled that the European Commission was wrong to order Amazon to pay €250m ($300m) in taxes to Luxembourg, finding that the commission had not proved the firm received special tax treatment. The same court made a similar decision last year in the case of Apple; the commission is appealing that ruling to the European Court of Justice.
America’s Department of Defence agreed to remove Xiaomi from its ban on American investment in companies that are said to have ties to the Chinese army. The maker of smartphones and other devices had already won a suspension of the ban in court.
Almost 40% of the shareholder vote at AstraZeneca’s annual meeting rejected the salary package for its CEO, the latest in a wave of rebellions by investors against generous payouts for executives dished out during the pandemic. The pay policy—which increases the potential bonus and stock awards for Pascal Soriot—was approved by just 60% of shareholders at the meeting.
There were more signs of a recovery in the tourism industry. TUI, the world’s largest tour company, said there had been a clear pickup in demand. Although it doesn’t expect its business in 2021 to reach pre-pandemic levels, bookings for holidays next year from Britain, one of its biggest customer markets, are exceeding bookings at this point in 2019.

The share price of Meituan plunged, after the Chinese shopping platform’s chief executive posted an ancient poem on social media that was taken as a swipe against the government. Like Alibaba, Meituan is in the government’s cross-hairs for being too big and influential, and is under investigation for alleged anti-competitive practices. Wang Xing posted a poem written during the Tang dynasty over 1,000 years ago, which criticised the emperor’s attempt to crush dissent.",2
1758,"LESS THAN half of Latin Americans are committed democrats and a growing number are indifferent towards their country’s political regime. A large majority remain deeply dissatisfied with the way their democracies work in practice and they place little trust in their institutions or in each other. They are opposed to military government but a growing number are prepared to accept elected caudillos (strongmen). And they continue to have more trust in the United States than China.

These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll, taken in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist. Because the poll has been taken regularly since 1995 it does a good job of showing how attitudes in the region are evolving. The latest poll reflects views after the first seven months or so of the pandemic, which complicated the fieldwork. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 17 countries between October and December 2020. That was not possible in Argentina, because of a prolonged lockdown. Online interviews were conducted there in May 2021.

The pandemic has hit Latin America disproportionately hard: with 8% of the world’s population it has suffered around 32% of officially recorded deaths. Despite this shock, the poll did not show a drastic change in political attitudes compared with the previous one in 2018. “I expected a fall in support for democracy,” says Marta Lagos, Latinobarómetro’s director. That this didn’t happen may reflect “the sense of solidarity” the pandemic generated, at least in its early months. 

But the broad trend, expressed in recent protests in several countries, comes over loud and clear. Compared with the late-1990s, when the transition from dictatorship to democracy was still fresh in many countries, support for democracy in the region has waned (see chart 1). Only 49% say that democracy is their preferred form of government. Support for authoritarian government is low, at 13%. But, worryingly, more than a quarter of respondents say they don’t care whether or not their country is democratic, a figure that has risen from 16% in 2010. Ask the question in a different, Churchillian, way and 63% think that while democracy may have problems it is the best system, down from a peak of 79% in 2013.

Support for democracy is highest where it is most consolidated, in Uruguay, Costa Rica and Chile (see chart 2). It is high, too, in Venezuela, which is now a dictatorship. Changes of government following elections tend to bring fresh hope in democracy. That applied in 2020 to El Salvador, Guatemala and Paraguay. El Salvador is an example of a demand for strong populist leadership: Nayib Bukele was elected president in 2019, bullied the congress and the supreme court in 2020 and imposed a tight lockdown against the pandemic. His reward is that 66% of respondents in El Salvador think the country is progressing, compared with a regional average of just 19%.
Support for democracy in Brazil and Mexico, Latin America’s two giants, is well below the regional average. Another worrying trend concerns the profile of the typical democrat in Latin America. Younger people and especially those of the upper classes tend to be indifferent towards the political regime (see chart 3). That points to the disdain of elites for democracy.

In 2020 70% of Latin Americans were dissatisfied with the way their democracy works in practice (chart 4). That is little changed from 72% in 2018. However, those are the two highest numbers since the poll began.
The reasons for disillusionment are not hard to detect. Only 22% say their country is governed for the benefit of everyone, rather than the powerful few, though that is up from 17% in 2018, reflecting the common effort to fight the virus. Only 17% think the distribution of wealth in their country is fair. Clear majorities think that access to health care, education and justice is unequal. In Chile 93% think access to health care is unfair—an issue that has been at the heart of recent protests in the country.

Approval of governments rose significantly, to 40% from 32% in 2018. That again reflects a rallying round in the early months of the pandemic. But trust in institutions in general continues to fall (see chart 5). And only 12% of respondents say they trust most people, the lowest figure ever. Not surprisingly, economic problems and unemployment top the list of public concerns. The majority of respondents (58%, down from 62% in 2018) continue to think a market economy is the only way for their country to develop. Although China plays a much bigger role in Latin American trade and investment than in the past, more respondents think its influence is a negative one compared with that of the United States (see chart 6).

In summary, while their faith in democracy has been tested, Latin Americans want to vote and want their voices to be heard. Despite the sense of solidarity generated by the pandemic, their underlying discontent is hardening. The politicians have been warned.
Latinobarómetro is a non-profit organisation based in Santiago, Chile, which has carried out regular surveys of opinion, attitudes and values in Latin America since 1995. The poll was taken by local opinion-research companies in 18 countries and involved 19,004 face-to-face interviews conducted in 17 of them between October 26th and December 15th and 1,200 online interviews in Argentina between April 26th and May 16th 2021. The average margin of error for each country is around 3%. Full details at www.latinobarometro.org

1759,"New York (CNN Business)The oil market has gone from booming to busting, much to the relief of inflation-weary American drivers ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.US crude tumbled to a fresh seven-week low on Friday, settling at $76.10 a barrel. The slide is good news for American drivers hurt by the seven-year high in gasoline prices — a crunch that has soured consumers' views on the US economy. ""We will definitely see some pricing relief on gasoline at the pump,"" Tom Kloza, president of the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN on Friday, adding that the relief will be ""feather-like as opposed to plunges.""After a relentless rise, the national average gas price has finally leveled off at $3.41 a gallon, according to AAA. That's roughly flat from a week ago.""It looks for now as though the 2021 peaks have been established,"" Kloza said.Lockdown jittersUnfortunately, one of the catalysts for Friday's tumble in the market is another ominous development on the Covid front: Austria announced plans Friday to impose a national lockdown, the first in Europe this fall, in a bid to reverse a spike in Covid-19 cases.The lockdown is raising fears in the oil market of tough new health restrictions elsewhere that will slow the economic comeback and eat into energy demand.""The demand signals today are overwhelmingly bearish,"" Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a note on Friday. ""The risk is real in Europe, especially if Austria's move to lockdown has a domino effect across the continent. If Germany follows suit, sub-$80 price levels may be here to stay.""Will China and America team up?Beyond the lockdown fears, oil markets remain jittery over the specter of the United States and China teaming up to intervene in the previously red-hot energy markets.Since crashing to negative-$40 a barrel in April 2020, US crude has climbed as much as $125 a barrel because supply simply hasn't kept up with demand. OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have only gradually increased production. US oil companies haven't been in a rush to add supply either.A coordinated release from two of the world's biggest energy consumers would have a bigger impact than if the Biden administration acted alone to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Officials in China put out a statement on Friday suggesting that a release of barrels from the country's emergency reserve is on the table.""The bureau is pushing forward with crude oil release-related work at the moment,"" authorities that oversee China's strategic oil reserves said in a statement to CNN.According to a readout published by the White House, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed during their virtual summit this week the ""importance of taking measures to address global energy supplies.""A coordinated release by the United States and China could also be used as a bargaining tool to get OPEC+ to open up the taps, after months of refusing to do so.""There is firepower with a concerted effort,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.'Short-term fix'Still, this is not a long-term solution, as releasing barrels from emergency reserves doesn't solve the underlying supply-demand mismatch. And these emergency reserves hold a finite amount of oil — crude that is typically reserved for supply shocks, not surging demand amid an economic recovery.Releasing barrels today leaves the reserves with less of buffer for the next crisis, whether it's a hurricane, a conflict in the Middle East or another supply shock.Goldman Sachs reiterated in a new report to clients on Thursday that a coordinated release would ""only provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit.""The Wall Street bank argued this coordinated release is now ""fully priced in,"" meaning the impact to markets has already happened.""In fact, if such a release is confirmed and manages to keep oil prices depressed in the context of low trading activity into year-end, it would create clear upside risks to our 2022 price forecast,"" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote.In other words, at least some on Wall Street are already looking past this emergency intervention — before it even happens — and predicting higher prices ahead.",0
1760,"FRANCO BLOISI is puzzled. Mr Bloisi is the chef of Assunta Madre, a restaurant attached to Billionaire, a nightclub on the Costa Smeralda. With its turquoise waters and hidden coves, this region of north-eastern Sardinia has long been a summer playground for Arab potentates, Russian plutocrats and Silicon Valley tech czars. “We’ve got the stylish Italians this year,” says Mr Bloisi. But he has seen no trace of the super-rich foreigners. “Their yachts are here. But they’re not going out.”
The absent billionaires are the talk of the Costa Smeralda. This is a land of endless villas and dry-stone walls draped with oleander, of five-star hotels with heart-stopping vistas and heart-stopping prices; a land of poodles, helipads, bespoke swimwear and bronzed middle-aged men in two-seater convertibles. More stylish than tacky, the Costa Smeralda gives its wealthiest holidaymakers, who in the Caribbean might worry about burglary or kidnapping, a reassuring degree of security—or did, until the advent of covid-19.

After a disastrous 2020, the luxury hotels are full again. There is “not a suite to be had anywhere”, says Paolo Manca, president of the island’s hoteliers’ association. At the local airport, outside Olbia, the volume of private flights is 10% higher than in 2019. On the last Sunday in July there were 174. Among them was a private Airbus 340 carrying Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan. His wife and first vice-president, Mehriban Aliyeva, flew in on an equally private Boeing 767.
At the marina in Porto Cervo, among the few in the Mediterranean that can handle the biggest yachts, Carmine Sanna, the general manager, has seen a notable increase in chartered vessels more than 90 metres in length, mostly booked by Americans. The bays south to Porto Rotondo are sprinkled with gleaming super-, mega- and giga-yachts (usually defined as having lengths of more than 24, 50 and 80 metres respectively). Yet the traces of their owners and charterers are scant.
“They don’t want to go out and about, because they fear infection,” says Silvio Pippobello, the airport’s boss. As the Delta variant seeped through Italy, Sardinia experienced a particularly steep rise in the incidence of new cases. In the week to August 5th it was 138 per 100,000, the highest of any Italian region.
Partying during a pandemic can lead to some bizarre juxtapositions. An event staged by Marco Fava, a hairdresser from Rome with a celebrity clientele, was in full swing in the town of Poltu Quatu when a group of paramedics escorting a doctor in head-to-toe protective overalls barged through the crowd of guests.
Some of the wealthiest visitors have been using a testing centre at Olbia airport to have their entourages checked, sometimes three times a week. But fear of covid-19 may not be the only reason why the moguls are missing from their usual haunts. Someone who makes a living from catering to their whims, and who prefers to remain anonymous, says wealthy Russians had begun to withdraw even before the pandemic struck: they no longer felt a need to win acceptance in western European society, and the wine selection at most Costa Smeralda restaurants is beneath their standards. “They prefer to organise dinners aboard their yachts and in their villas,” he says. There they can serve whatever they like. At Olbia airport’s terminal for private flights, a Romanée-Saint-Vivant 2016 is on sale in the duty-free shop at €5,140 ($6,020) a bottle. ■

1761,"IN THE AFTERMATH of a mass shooting at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, two senators introduced a modest measure to require background checks on all gun sales. Out of 100 senators, 54 voted to move ahead with it. In almost every parliament in the world, such a majority would be enough to ensure passage. In the Senate it meant defeat.
The men who framed America’s constitution intended the Senate as a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority. Its present-day failure to pass bills supported by a majority of its members, though, was never any part of that original design. It is the result of what seems to have been a genuine error: a lack of fixed procedures for shutting down debate. That absence allowed minorities in the chamber to use various manoeuvres, most famously the filibuster, to block legislation a majority wishes to pass. Once onerous and used sparingly, subsequent changes to the rules have allowed these ruses to become routine, cost-free and all but ubiquitous. This has turned the Senate into the only legislative body in the world which requires a supermajority for ordinary business.


The ability to filibuster could be abolished by a simple majority vote. But neither party has chosen this route. Instead, as the filibuster has become more routine, frustrated majorities have carved out various exceptions. Now that Democrats find that their unified control of Washington is insufficient for enacting the sweeping agenda of the Biden administration, further exceptions seem possible. But some requirements for supermajorities seem certain to stay.
The room where it doesn’t happen
Few have put the case against supermajorities better than Alexander Hamilton, one of the framers of America’s constitution, who brought to the issue the impassioned frustration of one who had seen them in action. Reflecting on the way they had been used in the Congress created by the Articles of Confederation, he wrote in the Federalist Papers that “What at first sight may seem a remedy, is, in reality, a poison.” Rather than protecting minorities, as its supporters claimed, “its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.”
He and his fellow framers saw the case for supermajorities in circumstances of great consequence—the constitution requires them for convicting impeached officials, overriding presidential vetoes, ratifying treaties and enacting constitutional amendments. They could have also written them in for other matters. They did not.
The filibuster was only rendered possible at all by a parliamentary housekeeping accident. In 1805 Aaron Burr (who, as a service to musical theatre, had killed Hamilton in a duel the previous year) recommended removing from the Senate rulebook the motion used to force the end of debates: it was thought redundant. It was only a few decades later that John C. Calhoun, a senator for South Carolina, realised that the absence of such a rule meant that debate could defer a vote indefinitely. After the civil war, organised filibusters—the term, an anglicisation of the Dutch vrijbuiter, meaning mercenary or privateer, denotes the way in which the tactic overthrows the normal order—became a recognised tactic. But they were used only for matters of great importance.
Those 19th-century filibusters could run indefinitely. In 1917 the Senate created a way to cut them short: a “cloture” vote requiring a two-thirds majority (in 1975 this was reduced to three-fifths, which is 60 votes in today’s Senate). But a minority could still hold business hostage. And if it had enough votes to defeat a cloture motion it could block legislation.
The minority these rules ended up protecting was that of segregationists in the Senate. Their protection was achieved at the expense of the African-American minority in the country at large. From the end of the civil war to 1964 practically the only bills actually defeated by the filibuster were civil-rights legislation opposed by Southern Dixiecrats.

The filibuster has changed since then. The “two-track system” created in 1970 allows the majority leader to consider more than one piece of legislation at a time. This has stopped filibusters from derailing all business, but has also reduced the public cost paid for using the device. Now the threat of a filibuster (known as a “hold”) chills the progress of any bill that seems unlikely to muster the 60 votes needed for a cloture vote. Such threats are now quotidian (see chart 1). “You can make it more difficult to pass a bill than it has ever been before. And you can do so with near total anonymity,” says Adam Jentleson, whose time as deputy chief of staff to Harry Reid, the Senate Democrats’ leader through much of the 2000s and 2010s, led him to entitle his book on the filibuster “Kill Switch”.
Checks in a chequered history
The recent increase in filibustering has been a bipartisan achievement. Both parties, when in the minority, have driven it forward—a ratcheting-up which both parties, when in the majority, have decried. During the presidency of George W. Bush, Mr Reid’s Democrats started to use the filibuster routinely to block nominations for cabinet secretaries and federal judges. A frustrated Mitch McConnell, then the Republicans’ majority whip, openly mulled changing the rules to allow simple majority votes: “What Senate Republicans are simply trying to do is get us back to the procedure that operated quite nicely for 214 years.” But Republican senators under Mr McConnell’s leadership took up the baton with gusto during Barack Obama’s presidency—and Democrats under Mr Reid and his successor, Chuck Schumer, outdid them during the tenure of Donald Trump.
Senators seeking to justify the filibuster say that it is an incentive for bipartisanship in matters of substance. There may have been some merit to that argument when the parties had real ideological overlap, with a smattering of East Coast Republicans further to the left than some Southern Democrats. Those days are gone. The median Republican senator has moved a long way to the right (see chart 2), creating a polarised legislature well suited to a political landscape where animosity towards the other side trumps everything else.

What is more, control of the Senate now swings back and forth. Between 1933 and 1979, the Senate was led by Democrats for all but four years. Since 2000 it has changed hands five times. Put together these changes create “less incentive to share hands and jump over the cliff together” says Sarah Binder, a professor at George Washington University. The rewards for stymieing the majority in the hopes of retaking the gavel in the next election cycle look (rationally) enticing. In these circumstances the filibuster operates as a convenient tool of partisan struggles, not as a helpful stimulus towards dealmaking. The Senate certainly does not seem much more genial and conciliatory than the current House of Representatives, which has no such parliamentary faff.
As the filibuster has risen in use, so have threats to change the rules and impose simple majority votes (called “the nuclear option” in the overheated parlance of the day). In 2013 Mr Reid, then majority leader, launched a limited nuclear strike, eliminating the filibuster on presidential nominations other than those for the Supreme Court. Mr McConnell lamented this “power grab” as a “sad day in the history of the Senate”. But in 2017 the nukes flew again as Mr McConnell got rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court confirmations.
Why did he not go further? One reason is that in the 1970s the Senate created a limited exception to the filibuster: reconciliation, which allows a bill to pass the Senate if its provisions are aimed at changing spending and taxes. This means that tax cuts, like the appointment of conservative judges, are rendered filibuster-proof. If he could provide both those things Mr McConnell was content to do little else; his forbearance reflected shrewdness more than deference to senatorial norms.
The status quo is less pleasing to Democrats. Their plans for dramatic climate action and curtailing income inequality fit poorly with reconciliation, if at all. They are also well aware that the nature of the Senate makes Republican filibusters doubly minoritarian because the states they represent tend to be less populated. The 41 Republican senators needed to defeat a cloture motion could, in principle, represent just 23% of the population.
The process of shoehorning President Joe Biden's covid-19 relief bill through the reconciliation process (which forced the shedding of a long-sought increase to the federal minimum wage) underscores this painful state of affairs for progressives. The stillborn bill to reform the immigration system and create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, introduced at the insistence of the Biden administration, will be another expedition doomed to a dead end.
This has produced new enthusiasm for going fully nuclear. When Mr McConnell, now in the minority again, recently tried to force Mr Schumer to guarantee that the filibuster would not be tampered with, Mr Schumer demurred. Mr Biden—in the past very much a traditionalist on Senate procedure—has not flatly ruled out abolition. But in practice it seems off the table. Two moderate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have expressed their resistance to outright abolition in no uncertain terms. Pressed on the possibility by a reporter, Mr Manchin snapped back “Jesus Christ, what don’t you understand about ‘never’?”
This leaves only the option of a further carve-out. The likeliest immediate crisis point will be a new voting-rights bill with which Democrats hope to head off Republicans’ efforts to amend state election laws. Because voting rights have little budgetary effect, the measure could not pass using reconciliation. The hope of reformers is to force a carve-out for certain genres of critical legislation (beginning with civil and voting rights) and try to expand its remit over time.
Other reforms could temper the filibuster where it still applies—and might meet with Mr Manchin’s approval. Dr Binder suggests lowering the threshold for cloture from 60 votes to, say, 57, then 54, and, finally, 51 as the debate on a bill goes on. Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, suggests requiring the minority to provide 41 votes to continue debate (rather than requiring the majority to find 60) and insisting that the debate-seekers actually hold the floor of the Senate and debate the measure they object to.
There is little doubt that in either case the minority, whichsoever party it might be, would seek to maximise whatever possibilities for obstruction remained. And hopes that more debate would be better debate should be tempered: the Senate will never be the “world’s greatest deliberative body”, as is sometimes grandiloquently claimed. But steps towards simple majority rule would bring it more into line with the rest of the democratic world—and the vision of the framers.

Last September, near Lahore in Pakistan, a woman driving on the motorway late at night ran out of fuel. While she waited for a relative to come and help, two men emerged from the darkness. They dragged her from the vehicle and, with her children watching, raped her.

Maria moved into her uncle’s house in Uganda after her mother died. One night he raped her, covering her mouth to stop her screaming. He said he would kill her if she told anyone. After the fourth time, she ran away. She was 16.
Men attack each other, too. But violence against women, which is almost always perpetrated by men, can be uniquely horrific. Women are often trapped with a violent partner and are usually less able to defend themselves. Violence starts young and is often sexual.
Violence against women is a global scourge, unevenly spread. Those in poor places are most at risk. Women in Africa are more than four times as likely as those in Europe to be killed by their partner or family. Nearly 20,000 African women are believed to be killed this way each year—about two-fifths of the global total, according to the UN. Women in poor countries are also far more likely to be hit or raped by their partner.
Finding reliable data on this subject is extremely hard. In many countries, women are too scared to report assaults, or know that doing so is futile. Surveys are typically more accurate than crime reports. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia about one in five women who have ever been in a relationship say they have been beaten or attacked sexually by their partners in the past year, according to new data from the World Health Organisation. In countries such as Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than one in three say they have been assaulted by their husbands in the past year.
Even these numbers are probably too rosy. Surveys can miss a lot. A study by Claire Cullen of the World Bank found that asking women in a way that ensured anonymity revealed twice as much abuse in Rwanda as when they were asked directly, as they normally are.
Why are men so violent towards women? For much of history, the answer has been: to dominate women. Violence helps them do this; men are on average much stronger than women. Husbands have long hit their wives, or threatened to do so, to force them to do what they want. Fathers have done the same to daughters. Many societies have assumed this to be the natural order of things: injunctions for wives to obey their husbands are common in old laws, customs and religious texts.
What has changed in modern times is that many have come to see this as profoundly wrong. The notion that women should obey men or put up with violence is derided in rich liberal democracies, but it is easy to forget how recent that change is. A century ago, most societies took it for granted that men would “discipline” their wives. Marital rape was criminalised in Germany only in 1997.
Social progress has moved hand in hand with the material sort. In rich countries, laws against domestic abuse are enforced imperfectly, but they are enforced. Wife-beaters are socially stigmatised. And, just as important, women who leave violent husbands know that neither they nor their children will starve. In poor countries, they may not be so sure. So in rich countries women find it easier to walk away (though often still very hard). And knowing that their wives can leave gives men an incentive to treat them better.
One reason domestic violence is more common in poor countries is that money worries are stressful, and men are more likely to lash out when stressed. But there are more fundamental reasons. There is seldom much of a welfare state to fall back on if women leave their husbands and cannot find work. Family and neighbours may judge them. In Africa the difference between the share of women who have been attacked in their lifetime and those who have been attacked in the past year is relatively small, suggesting many are trapped.
Hard-up societies are also far more tolerant of wife-beating (see chart). In sub-Saharan African countries about 45% of women on average say it is sometimes justified (for such things as neglecting the children). In India about the same share of women concur. That is far higher than in much of Latin America or, where data are available, most of the Middle East. In most poor countries women are more likely to express approval of wife-beating than men are, though some are no doubt afraid to say what they really think.

Several studies suggest that covid-19 has made matters worse. Lockdowns have made it harder for some women to escape abusive husbands even briefly. And the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic has increased domestic stress.
Nonetheless, there is hope. In the long run, as countries get richer, attitudes are likely to change. But many women, understandably, do not want to wait that long. So activists are eager to figure out how to change attitudes more quickly.
Education seems a promising avenue. In the long run, it empowers women and makes them less vulnerable to abuse. But in the short run, it does not always help. In sub-Saharan Africa women who attended primary or secondary school are more likely to be abused by their partners than those with no schooling. Only university-level education correlates with a lower likelihood of abuse. It may be that in countries where universal education is relatively new, a little schooling emboldens wives to challenge their husbands, without giving them the means to walk away. Work follows a similar pattern. Women in Africa who work are more likely to be abused by their partners than those who do not. Again, this may be because as women gain a little more independence, their husbands try extra hard to keep them down.
Religion matters. Women in poor Muslim countries suffer less domestic violence than otherwise-similar ones in poor Christian countries. That may be because few Muslim men booze, and men who drink are more likely to hit their wives.
In South Asia more girls than ever attend school and more women work. But in some ways attitudes have regressed “as women have become less dependent on men”, says Shireen Huq, the founder of Naripokkho, a Bangladeshi women’s-rights group; and the backlash “often manifests in more violence”. The authorities sometimes make things worse. The chief justice of India’s Supreme Court recently suggested that a man accused of raping a 16-year-old girl should marry her. If he did, said the judge, “we can help you.”
Home remains the most dangerous place for women. But they are also attacked outside. Most victims never report such assaults, and if they do, they are often blamed. After the motorway attack in Pakistan, Omar Sheikh, Lahore’s police chief, asked in a televised interview why the woman was on a motorway after dark, why had she not gone a “safer” route and whether she had her husband’s permission to drive alone at night.
Mr Sheikh echoed a common logic for sexual attacks in South Asia: that women should be punished for straying outside their traditional roles. “Women’s mobility has always been an issue,” says Syeda Samara Mortada, a Bangladeshi activist. “That hasn’t changed as women have gone out to work.” Caste dynamics further sharpen male entitlement. Men from upper castes often sexually assault Dalit women, the lowest in India’s caste hierarchy.
Women in countries beset by violence in general, such as El Salvador and Honduras, are more likely to be murdered than women almost anywhere else (Nicaragua has made some progress). In South Africa wives are at less risk from their husbands than in much of the continent, but attacks by strangers are a greater danger than in many other places.

In some countries women are assaulted for political reasons. It is an especially vicious way to intimidate dissidents. Dembe (not her real name) is a Ugandan student. In 2019 she planned a protest against higher university fees. She was detained by police for a day. After her release, she was followed and bundled into a van by thugs, who beat and assaulted her. “I wasn’t treated right in that van,” she says. Later she woke up in hospital. The nurses told her she had been there for a week. Political violence targeting women is increasing in Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, says ACLED, a non-profit organisation.
Stemming the vast and often hidden tide of violence is a colossal task. Some favour harsher punishments. South Asians have roared for governments to hang rapists. Some forms of rape are already punishable by death in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Nigerian state of Kaduna recently introduced chemical castration and the death penalty for rape. But the death penalty does not work, says Ravina Shamdasani of the UN human-rights office. Even the harshest punishment is not much of a deterrent if perpetrators are rarely caught.
Courage calls to courage
Many women in poor countries are working to reduce violence in smarter ways. They are campaigning for stronger laws against abusing women—and for attackers to face trial. In Pakistan and Bangladesh protesters took to the streets after a spate of gang-rapes last year, calling for the definition of rape to be expanded, for marital rape to be criminalised, and for survivor- and witness-protection programmes. “We want not to be harassed, raped, abused,” says Ms Mortada, who works with Feminists Across Generations, a coalition that organised a big protest in Bangladesh. “We don’t want to be told what to do to avoid it.”
But getting a good law through parliament is just the first step. In Nigeria a 14-year campaign led to a law in 2015 that expanded the definition of rape and offered victims medical care and legal assistance. Nigeria’s federal system requires every state to adopt the law. Yet barely half have done so. And even if laws are adopted, they are often not enforced.
Nigerian campaigners are undeterred. In June, after the death of Vera Uwaila Omozuwa, a 22-year-old student who was found in a pool of blood at her church, a group of NGOs got all 36 governors of states in Nigeria to declare a “state of emergency” (a political rather than legal move) over rapes and violence against women.
Of the 15,000 men held in Ugandan prisons for violence against women, nearly 7,000 are awaiting trial. As campaigns have put the spotlight on abuse, the Ugandan judiciary has been holding special court sessions to clear the backlog of sexual-violence cases. It is not easy. “You cannot take your husband to court,” say relatives of victims, reports Samuel Munobe, the chief magistrate in Luwero. “Why do you want to embarrass the whole clan?”
Covid-19 has made keeping an eye on corruptible courts harder. Before the pandemic Sautiya Wanawake Women’s Movement in Kenya would organise groups of women to watch court proceedings, to put pressure on judges. Now only the victim’s parents, if anyone, are let in.
Campaigners are trying to ensure survivors get immediate help and can report crimes. Rwanda has set up one-stop centres with police, doctors, social workers and legal help. Survivors are helping each other, too. A Congolese organisation, Synergy of Women, helps victims of sexual assault get medical care, counselling and advice on how to press charges. One counsellor, Mammy Kahumbu, was raped by rebels 11 years ago. “The women are encouraged when they see me looking healthy and strong,” she says. “I am no longer a victim, I am an actor for change.”
The biggest challenge is stopping violence in the first place. Those who witness or experience domestic violence as children are far more likely to perpetrate it or suffer it as adults. Dorcas Coker-Appiah of Gender Centre Ghana, an NGO, has trained teams in rural areas to raise awareness, counsel couples, and link victims with support since 2001. She reckons the scheme has covered a tenth of Ghana. A recent study found that it reduced sexual violence in homes by 55%.
Cash transfers can also help by reducing the stress of poverty, which can trigger violence. If it goes to women, that can anger men. Yet if it is combined with training for women, for example in traditionally female areas like children’s health, this can both empower women and soothe male worries about loss of financial control.
Changing minds is crucial, and needs to start early. A study in Bihar, a north-eastern state of India, found that teenage boys who were taught about non-sexist attitudes during sports coaching were less likely to approve of violence against women. And five years later, they were less likely to abuse their wives physically or sexually.
Campaigners’ efforts are bearing fruit. In about three-quarters of poor countries where surveys have been repeated over a number of years, the share of women reporting physical or sexual abuse from their husbands has fallen. That is progress. But hundreds of millions are still attacked every year. Immeasurably more is needed. ■

1763,"TWELVE YEARS after bitcoin was born, governments are still struggling to cope with cryptocurrencies. Britain has banned Binance, a crypto exchange and the European Union’s regulators want transactions to be more traceable. On August 3rd Gary Gensler, the head of America’s Securities and Exchange Commission, said cryptocurrency markets were “rife with fraud, scams and abuse” and called on Congress to give his agency new regulatory powers. The price of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, gyrates with regulators’ every word.
Governments have an obligation to fight the deception, tax evasion and money laundering that plagues the crypto world. Police seizures of bitcoin suggest that they are becoming more zealous. The harder issue they must grapple with is whether cryptocurrencies threaten the financial system. Were bitcoin to collapse, our crypto “stress test” suggests that its holders would lose hundreds of billions of dollars but that the fallout would be manageable. Yet there is another danger posed by “stablecoins”, a special type of cryptocurrency that pegs its value to conventional money.

Pledges of stability often lead to financial crises. Because banks offer deposits that are redeemable on demand and superficially riskless, but which are backed by longer-term, less liquid and riskier assets, they are vulnerable to runs. Stablecoins are similar. The biggest, Tether, has issued $62bn-worth of tokens which it says are redeemable for a dollar apiece. But of the assets backing the tokens in March only about 5% were cash or Treasury bills, according to Tether’s public disclosures. It says it will update the figures soon and that it is “fully backed by reserves”.

Most of the assets were riskier—about half of them commercial paper. Stablecoins’ growth from a value of $14bn in August 2020 to over $100bn today has given them a big financial footprint. Extrapolating Tether’s disclosures implies that it owns over $30bn-worth of commercial paper, which probably makes it the asset class’s seventh-largest investor, not far off funds run by Vanguard and BlackRock, according to JPMorgan Chase. With estimated leverage of 383-to-1, Tether would be unable to honour all its tokens after losses of just 0.26%—a safety cushion that regulators would never allow at a bank.
Few stablecoins say much about their balance-sheets. Tether’s disclosures of the breakdown of its assets are puny and fall far below the standards expected of a bank. In February Tether was among the defendants who agreed to an $18.5m fine with New York’s attorney-general, which said that in 2017 Tether had misled the market about its US dollar backing and that it had not accurately disclosed the transfer of $625m of its assets to Bitfinex, an online trading platform. Tether says the funds were repaid and that it has a “total commitment to transparency”.
No wonder Mr Gensler calls cryptocurrencies a Wild West. Some policymakers have compared stablecoins to the period of “free banking”, when privately issued banknotes of uncertain backing and worth circulated in America’s economy in the 19th century. A more useful comparison is with money-market funds, which were created in the 1970s to circumvent rules limiting the interest banks could pay depositors. After promising to maintain the value of their shares at a dollar, money-market funds blew up in 2008 in the global financial crisis. American taxpayers stepped in to forestall a fire sale of their assets and a crash in the market for commercial paper, on which the real economy depends. A collapse of stablecoins could look similar.
Regulators must act quickly to subject stablecoins to bank-like rules for transparency, liquidity and capital. Those failing to comply should be cut off from the financial system, to stop people drifting into an unregulated crypto-ecosystem. Policymakers are right to sound the alarm, but if stablecoins continue to grow, governments will need to move faster to contain the risks.
It may be tempting to ban stablecoins, especially if central banks launch their own digital currencies—much as private banknotes were replaced with government monopolies on physical cash. Yet it is possible that regulated private-sector stablecoins will eventually bring benefits, such as making cross-border payments easier, or allowing self-executing “smart contracts”. Regulators should allow experiments whose goal is not merely to evade financial rules. But first they must prevent the repackaging of risks with which the world is all too familiar. ■",2
1764,"OVER THE past decade Gloria Porras, a judge on Guatemala’s constitutional court, has earned a reputation for fearless independence. It came as little surprise to some, then, that on April 13th Congress refused to confirm her nomination for a third five-year term. The move is the latest effort to oust Ms Porras, who has faced a series of lawsuits from groups believed to be acting on behalf of corrupt politicians, smears in the media and attempts to strip her of her immunity as a judge.
Resistance to crusading judges is growing. The constitutional court is the primary target since it deals with politics and crime. Ms Porras often ruled against the rich and in favour of the marginalised. She boosted the rights of indigenous people, who make up at least 40% of the population of 18m. She also helped block a congressional proposal to provide amnesty for crimes against humanity.

The backsliding started under the administration of Jimmy Morales, president from 2016 to 2020. In 2019 he refused to renew the mandate of CICIG, a UN-backed commission that successfully prosecuted dirty politicians and businessmen. But Ms Porras says pressure on her has intensified since Mr Morales’s successor, Alejandro Giammattei, took office.
The judicial system has been hindered in other ways, too. In 2009 a law was adopted to bring transparency to the committees that appoint judges to the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal. But according to the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) a human-rights lobby group, the process has been marred by conflicts of interest and criminal manipulation. For example, an increasing number of law schools have been created to try to influence which judges are picked (the committees are partially drawn from these schools). Last year the special prosecutor’s office against impunity, a state body, suggested that a businessman in pre-trial detention for corruption had attempted to rig the selection process. Congress, as the blocking of Ms Porras’s confirmation shows, is also biased. It barred another judge, Néster Vásquez, from taking his seat on the constitutional court. Other judges on the court have close links to the president: one of them, Leyla Lemus Arriaga, was his chief of staff.
This will further weaken the rule of law in Guatemala, one of the factors behind the migration of its citizens northwards. “The constitutional court was one of the last checks and balances in the country,” says Adriana Beltrán of WOLA. The abuses that will follow its taming are yet another reason to leave. ■",2
1765,"FOR MOST of this century Chile was a stable and predictable country, with steady economic growth and moderate politics. Outsiders saw it as a success story and a model for Latin America. But that stable Chile disappeared two years ago, in an explosion of massive and sometimes violent protests. Discontent had built up and politicians seemed unable to deal with slower growth and narrowing opportunities, especially for younger people. A plan to hold a convention to write a new constitution calmed the protests and seemed to offer a peaceful solution to the sort of grievances that have afflicted many countries in recent years. But Chile has yet to recover its balance, as a polarised presidential election on November 21st is likely to show.
In a vote for the constitutional convention in May (in which only 43% turned out), support surged for the hard left while drying up for mainstream parties. As a result, the convention has become a theatre of wokeness, with calls to wage war against pivotal industries such as mining (accounting for over half of exports) and agriculture for export (more than 30%), alongside more justified demands for a bigger role for the state in pensions, health care and green regulation. Optimists say a realistic, modernising constitution can still emerge; pessimists fear a Utopian list of unaffordable rights and anti-capitalism.

Similarly, Gabriel Boric, the candidate of the hard left, has seemed poised to win the presidential election. A former student leader, he is a democrat. But some of his allies, who include the Communist Party, are not. Much of the left has failed to condemn the criminal violence of a hard core of protesters and has opposed the widely popular deployment of the army to quell a low-level insurgency among some Mapuche, an indigenous group in the south.
Mr Boric wants to expand tax revenues by 8% of GDP over six to eight years (impossible, say many economists) and review trade agreements in order to engage in industrial policy. The laudable intention is to diversify the economy, but by means that seem likely to do far more harm than good. Mr Boric might well prove to be more pragmatic than his programme suggests. But plenty of Chileans are alarmed by it and by his allies.
That is why support has grown for José Antonio Kast of the hard right. He has exploited fears of disorder, violence and uncontrolled immigration, offering a mano dura (a firm hand). His promise of big tax cuts just when Chileans want better services is as delusional as Mr Boric’s revenue target. Whereas Mr Boric promises the most left-wing government since the chaotic Socialist-Communist administration of Salvador Allende, Mr Kast offers the most right-wing one since the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, whose crimes he sometimes denies. Neither offers the combination of stability, economic growth and reform that the country needs.
The seeming advantage of the extremes owes much to the discrediting of politicians from the two mainstream coalitions—and to their loss of self-belief. Some have embraced populist measures, such as letting workers spend 30% of their retirement savings, guaranteeing a future pensions crisis. None offers a convincing counter-narrative to the radicals. In fact, the past 30 years were far from the disaster they are now painted as.
The boast of Utopia
There are two moderate candidates, Yasna Provoste of the centre-left and Sebastián Sichel of the centre-right. Either, and especially Ms Provoste, would offer hope that Chile can draw back from its dangerous polarisation and find a new consensus. Chileans would be wise to vote for them, not least to provide an incentive to Messrs Boric and Kast to move to the centre if they reach the inevitable run-off next month. It is high time for Chileans to come to their senses, and see the merits of the moderate record that they are on the verge of disavowing. ■",2
1766,"ONLY OTTO VON BISMARCK and Helmut Kohl served longer as Germany’s chancellor than Angela Merkel has. Bismarck forged an empire, and invented Europe’s first public-pension and health-care systems along the way. Kohl oversaw the reunification of East and West Germany and agreed to the replacement of the beloved Deutschmark with the euro.
Mrs Merkel’s achievements are more modest. In her 16 years in the chancellery she has weathered a string of crises, from economic to pandemic. Her abilities as a consensus-forger have served her country and Europe well. But her government has neglected too much, nationally and internationally. Germany has got away with it, for now; the country is prosperous and stable. Yet trouble is brewing. And as Mrs Merkel prepares to leave office when a new government forms after an election this weekend, admiration for her steady leadership should be mixed with frustration at the complacency she has bred.

The list of neglected issues is long (see our Special report). Germany looks like a purring luxury car; pop the bonnet, though, and the signs of neglect are plain to see. The public sector has failed to invest adequately or wisely, falling behind its peers in building infrastructure, especially the digital sort. This hampers not just whizzy new tech firms, but every other company, too. It also makes government less effective, a problem exacerbated by a failure to hire enough staff. Penny-pinching is hard-wired into the state. In 2009, on Mrs Merkel’s watch, Germany hobbled itself with a constitutional amendment that makes it illegal to run more than a minute deficit. With interest rates so low, sensible governments ought to have been borrowing for investment, not fainting at the first spot of red ink.
Germany’s most severe domestic problem is a failure to reform its pension system. Germans are ageing fast, and the baby-boomers will place an even heavier burden on the budget later this decade as they retire. On climate change, Germany has also been sluggish, and still emits more carbon per head than any other big EU country, not helped by Mrs Merkel’s shutdown of Germany’s nuclear industry after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.

In Europe, where German influence matters most, Mrs Merkel’s reluctance to wield it has been especially disappointing. The EU has not grappled sufficiently with the weakness of its indebted southern members. Only during the pandemic did it create a financial instrument that lets the EU issue jointly guaranteed debt, and dispense some of the cash as grants, rather than yet more loans. But this was designed as a one-off. Worse, the “stability” rules that will force countries back into austerity to shrink their stocks of debt are ready to revive, unless amended. Germany, always the most powerful voice at the EU table, should have argued harder for a more sensible approach.
In EU foreign policy, Germany could and should have been doing more to force a quicker adjustment to a less comfortable new world. China is an increasingly challenging economic and strategic rival, Russia an unpredictable threat and America a distracted and uncertain ally. Yet Germany has dithered. Despite recent increases, it spends too little on defence. It cosies up to Beijing in the hope of better trading terms. It is giving Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, a chokehold over European energy supplies by backing the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline which, as it happens, makes landfall in Mrs Merkel’s own constituency. It has fallen to others, principally France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to make the case for Europe to do more.
Which German candidate, though, could do better than Mrs Merkel? The polls suggest that Germany is set for a messy new parliament, with no single party, or even two, able to form a government. Instead, some sort of ideologically incoherent three-way coalition is on the cards—one that, by combining high-spending greens and pro-business liberals, may struggle to agree on anything ambitious.
This is another symptom of Merkelian complacency. Comfortable, cautious Germans seem uninterested in serious debate about the future. Crisis-management has become a substitute for initiative. Candidates have no incentive to highlight their country’s looming problems. The result has been one of the least substantive campaigns for decades: all about the horse-race and not about the issues.

Of the possible outcomes, two seem most likely. One is a coalition headed by Mrs Merkel’s party, the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister-party (the CDU/CSU), led by Armin Laschet. The other is a coalition led by Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), who is Germany’s finance minister. In either case, the coalition would be joined by the Greens and by the pro-business Free Democrats. Both outcomes will have serious shortcomings, but of the two, The Economist narrowly prefers the second: a “traffic-light” coalition, headed by Mr Scholz.
That is because the CDU/CSU, frankly, has blown it. Sixteen years in power has been enough. The party has run out of ideas and drive, as its decision to choose the gaffe-prone and uninspiring Mr Laschet for chancellor makes clear. An affable lightweight, he has run a dismal campaign, and is predicted to lead his team to its worst result since the second world war. The polls say that Mr Scholz is preferred by twice as many voters.
The tug from the left
Are they right, though? There are reasons to hope so, but also plenty to fear. Mr Scholz has been an effective finance minister. The German people trust him. He is better placed than a CDU chancellor would be to work with the Greens on climate change. The problem is that although he belongs to the business-friendly wing of his party, the SPD is stuffed with left-wingers. They may try to drag him further in their direction than the Free Democrats will wear and enterprise can comfortably bear.
The world should expect the coalition talks to last for months, poleaxing European politics while they drag on. And at the end of it all, Germany may well end up with a government that fails to get much done. That is the mess Mrs Merkel has left behind. ■

1767,"ISTANBUL, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan dismissed three central bank policymakers on Thursday, two of whom were seen to oppose the last interest rate cut, clearing the way for more policy easing and sending the lira to a new all-time low.
Analysts viewed the move - announced at midnight in the Official Gazette - as fresh evidence of political interference by Erdogan, a self-described enemy of interest rates who frequently calls for monetary stimulus.
With no explanation for the decision, Erdogan fired deputy governors Semih Tumen and Ugur Namik Kucuk, along with the longest-serving monetary policy committee (MPC) member, Abdullah Yavas, the gazette said.
He appointed two new members - Taha Cakmak as a deputy and also Yusuf Tuna - who are little known at the central bank or among economists, leaving the MPC with little monetary policy experience after a years-long overhaul by the president.
Two sources familiar with internal deliberations said Kucuk and Yavas were ousted after disagreeing with last month's 100 basis-point rate cut, which at the time surprised investors and sent the currency tumbling.
Soon after the announcement the lira  weakened to a record low against the dollar, before paring its losses during the day. However it hit a fresh all-time low of 9.1950 at 1444 GMT.
The currency has shed some 19% this year, primarily due to the central bank's bruised credibility and worries among investors and savers over premature rate cuts in the face of inflation that has risen to nearly 20%.
""The lira has lost its institutional support in recent years ... and last night's changes strongly indicate that the central bank is no longer capable of managing Turkey's monetary policy,"" said Arda Tunca, economist at Eko Faktoring.
The combination of monetary policy and financial regulations have left the ""Turkish economy extremely fragile,"" he added.
Last month the central bank cut its policy rate (TRINT=ECI) to 18% as Erdogan - sliding in opinion polls and keen to boost credit and exports - had publicly sought. Most analysts called the easing a mistake at a time of accelerating global inflation.  read more 
TURNAROUND
The MPC overhaul came after the presidency said on Wednesday evening that Erdogan had met Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu and it published a photo of the two men together.
That marked a turnaround from last week when Reuters reported, citing three sources, that Erdogan was losing confidence in Kavcioglu and that the two had communicated little in recent weeks.  read more 
Though the MPC has seen a rapid turnover this year, Kavcioglu pushed for changes in recent days, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the matter.
""Kavcioglu sort of cleared the path to be able to cut rates more quickly with the new members,"" the person said. Now, those who were distant towards rate cuts have been removed.""
Erdogan named Kavcioglu governor in March.  read more 
In just over two years, Erdogan has abruptly fired three bank governors over policy differences, a dizzying display of political interference that badly hit the bank's credibility and predictability.  read more 
""Firing central bank officials in the middle of the night without a very good explanation is not how you build central bank credibility or bolster market confidence,"" one foreign investor said on Thursday.
Turkey's headline inflation hit a 2-1/2 year high of 19.58% in September, while a core measure - which Kavcioglu has been stressing over the last month - was 16.98%.
INTERNAL OPPOSITION
Addressing a parliamentary committee this week, Kavcioglu said September's rate cut was not a surprise and had little to do with the subsequent lira sell-off.  read more 
The bank's next policy-setting meeting is on Oct. 21, when another rate cut is seen as likely.
Market reaction to Thursday's changes included a jump in the premium demanded by investors to hold Turkish debt over safe haven U.S. Treasuries, based on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified index. It hit 521 basis points, the highest since April, leaving spreads above those of Ukraine and Kenya.
The second source who spoke to Reuters said both Kucuk and Yavas - who missed September's policy meeting - had opposed some recent bank decisions.
Kucuk also opposed an unorthodox policy in 2019-2020 of using the bank's forex reserves to support the lira via state bank sales, the person said, adding that Kucuk had warned the MPC that failing to keep rates high enough now only leads to even higher rates in the future.
Cakmak, the new deputy governor, was a deputy chairman at Turkey's BDDK banking watchdog from 2019. Previously he held posts at state lender Ziraat Bank, including head of human resources.
Tuna, the other MPC hire, was a professor and also served as management board member at the BDDK from 2003-2009.
""It can be assumed that the newly appointed members of the central bank committee will support Kavcioglu's and Erdogan's monetary policy,"" said Antje Praefcke, analyst at Commerzbank. ""That is not a good omen for the Turkish lira.""",3
1768,"ON OCTOBER 8th 1871 Catherine O’Leary’s cow kicked over a lantern and sparked the fire that incinerated one-third of Chicago—or so legend has it. The story of the blaze and Chicago’s triumphant rebuilding is often retold with more than a dash of Whiggish inevitability: the fire was the catalyst by which Chicago became America’s commodity capital. But this year, on the 150th anniversary of the great fire, Chicagoans are looking anew at their city’s creation myth, and finding the truth to be much more compelling.
The fire was a disaster. Property records were destroyed when the courthouse burned, but Carl Smith of Northwestern University estimates the damage done in his book “Chicago’s Great Fire: The Destruction and Resurrection of an Iconic American City”. An area roughly three square miles was scorched, levelling nearly 18,000 buildings and killing about 300 people. About one in three Chicagoans was suddenly homeless. The entire business district—now known as the Loop—was torched, resulting in about $200m in property damage (about $4.5bn today).

It turns out the popular history of the fire is flawed. But its two central myths give some insight into the city then and now. First, consider poor Mrs O’Leary and her cow. Historians are sure the fire originated near the O’Learys’ barn, but have exonerated Catherine herself. Yet her supposed culpability persists, says Mr Smith, and reveals the prejudices that roiled America in the late 19th century. “Who could be a better scapegoat than an Irish-Catholic woman?”, he asks.

The second myth is that the breakneck pace at which the city rebuilt (the downtown was revived in two years) changed Chicago in a way that sparked the city’s rapid growth. In reality, the fire accelerated shifts already underfoot. After the civil war Chicago became an entrepot that was integral to the national economy, thanks in large part to its location. About 30,000 people lived in Chicago in 1850; that number ballooned to 300,000 by 1870 and reached 1m by 1890. “The fire is a speed bump on that upward trajectory,” says Julius Jones of the Chicago History Museum. “It doesn’t fundamentally alter the city.”
As Chicago reflects on the anniversary, it is tempting to compare the tragedy to that of covid-19, which has killed more than 12,000 Chicagoans. Both crises revealed inequality (some could not afford to rebuild their charred homes) and provided funds to rebuild. But drawing other parallels is tricky. In 1871 “the lesson people took away from the destruction of Chicago was that it was indestructible,” says Mr Smith. Today Chicago’s trajectory is less clear.
The city’s population grew by 2% in the past decade, a welcome change from the 7% decline seen between 2000 and 2010. But the pandemic has left Chicago’s unemployment rate roughly twice as high as it was in 2019 and nearly 17% of downtown offices are vacant, according to Colliers, a property firm. After the fire, says Mr Jones, Chicago’s residents likened their city to a phoenix, “resurrected from its own ashes to be better than it was before.” Some of that same spirit is needed again.",2
1769,"THIS FUNERAL mask, photographed by Yoshii Yutaka of the Sicán Archaeological Project, in Peru, was discovered 30 years ago, 800km to the north of Lima. The Sicán were a group who flourished around 500 years before the arrival, in the 1500s, of Europeans. The red paint adorning the mask is made of cinnabar, a compound of mercury and sulphur. But turning cinnabar into paint requires a binding agent—and in this case it must have been a good one, to keep the paint attached to the mask for so long. Luciana da Costa Carvalho of Oxford University therefore set out to discover what it was.
Initial mass spectroscopy suggested proteins were involved, but shed no light on which. A follow-up study, however, produced the astonishing suggestion that the binder in question was chimpanzee blood—astonishing because chimps are African, not American animals. Further investigation revealed the mistake. The blood was actually from chimps’ close relatives, Homo sapiens.

Human blood is sticky when it clots, and would certainly bind cinnabar to gold for a millennium—but so would that of many other species. This suggests human blood in particular was chosen for another, presumably ritual, reason. Being picked as the donor of this blood may well have been an honour, though that is impossible to tell. But given many pre-Columbian peoples’ proclivity for human sacrifice, rather than mere bloodletting, it might not have been an honour that was highly sought after.

1770,"“CUBANS HAVE always been resourceful,” says Ana, the owner of a private farm-to-table restaurant near Havana. “But now we need to be magicians and acrobats.” The communist island is facing its worst shortage of food since the 1990s. Finding ingredients was never easy in a place which imports around 70% of its food. Over the past year it has become nearly impossible. When grocery shops are empty, as is so often the case, Ana tries the internet or the black market, only to find that prices are prohibitively high. Farmers no longer want to sell produce to her, she says, as they need to eat it themselves.
The government blames the shortage of food mostly on sanctions imposed by the United States—sanctions which, on June 24th, the UN General Assembly voted to condemn, as it has done nearly every year since 1992. But since 2001 the sanctions have exempted food. Indeed, the United States is the largest exporter of food to Cuba, though last year those imports were at their lowest level since 2002.

Some external factors have affected the food supply. The jump in global food prices, which in the year to May surged by 40%, the largest increase in a decade, has made imports more expensive. But the main problem is the government’s lack of hard currency. Tourism, normally 10% of GDP, has atrophied because of the pandemic: whereas 4.2m people visited in 2019, just over 1m did last year, nearly all in the first three months of the year. Remittances have also suffered. Before covid-19, commercial airlines would operate as many as ten flights a day between Miami and Havana, all packed with cash-toting mulas. But now only a handful of flights go to Havana each week. In addition, this year’s harvest of sugar—one of Cuba’s main exports—was the worst in more than a century, as a result of drought (the dollar shortage also sapped supplies of fertiliser and petrol).
The government is trying desperately to eke out dollars and skimp on imported goods. Cubans can no longer buy greenbacks from state-operated exchanges at the airport. State-owned bakeries are replacing a fifth of the imported wheat flour they use in bread with substitutes made from home-grown corn, pumpkin or yucca, much to the dismay of consumers, who have complained that bread now tastes like soggy corn. The sale of biscuits has been limited in certain cities to cut back even more on imports of flour.
Since February, in a desperate attempt to collect hard currency, the government has required that foreigners pay for their seven-day mandatory stay in a state-owned quarantine hotel in dollars (since June, this has even applied to some Cubans). To earn more from its diaspora, the state also operates e-commerce sites through which Cubans abroad can pay in dollars or euros for food and gifts to be delivered to people on the island.
Indeed many Cubans abroad are trying to help their family members stave off hunger by sending their own care packages. But even these have become harder and more costly to post. Goods from the United States that once took two weeks to deliver can now take up to four months to arrive, as shortages of fuel and trucks in Cuba make the final leg of the delivery trickier.
Bungled policy responses have made things worse. On June 10th the Cuban central bank announced that, from June 21st, Cubans would not be able to deposit dollars into their bank accounts for an undisclosed amount of time. This is despite the fact that, in order to buy goods in state-owned shops, Cubans need to have a prepaid card loaded with dollars. They will now have to exchange their dollars for euros or other currencies, which involves a fee. Emilio Morales, the head of the Havana Consulting Group in Miami, thinks this was a way to scare people into depositing more before the deadline.
Rather than stabilise the economy, the policy is likely to do the reverse. Some exchange houses in Miami soon ran out of euros. Cuban banks were overwhelmed by queues of panicking people trying to deposit the dollars they needed to buy groceries. “Cuba has 11m hostages and is expecting Cuban exiles to pay their ransom,” says Mr Morales. Ricardo Cabrisas, the deputy prime minister, was recently in Paris negotiating another extension on the roughly $3.5bn of loans owed to foreign governments—the island has been in arrears since 2019. An ultimatum from creditors may help explain the government’s desire to hoover up greenbacks.
Despite making some attempts to liberalise the economy, the government is bafflingly poor at boosting agricultural production or wooing foreign investors. Firms producing food in Cuba earn only pesos, which have little value internationally, but must buy almost all their inputs abroad in a foreign currency. The government requires farmers to sell their harvest to the state at uncompetitive prices and imposes draconian rules on livestock management.
Up until last month it was illegal to slaughter a cow before it had reached an advanced age, as determined by the state. Now farmers may kill them either to sell the meat or to eat it themselves. But before they do so, they must jump through a series of hoops, including certifying that the cow has produced at least 520 litres of milk a year. They are also not allowed to let their herd shrink overall, and so can only slaughter one cow for every three calves they add to it—a tall order in the long run, mathematically. As it is, Cuba is having trouble maintaining its existing cattle herd: last year, in the province of Las Tunas alone, more than 7,000 cows died from dehydration. Farmers have to complete paperwork and wait a week for approval, too. “The process of applying to eat a cow is enough to make you lose your appetite,” says a farmer in Bahía Honda.
Cubans are no strangers to difficult times. Eliecer Jiménez Almeida, a Cuban filmmaker in Miami, was a child during the “special period” of hardship after the fall of the Soviet Union, and remembers how his grandmother sold her gold teeth in exchange for soap, just so that he and his siblings could take a bath. For him and for many Cubans, the question is not how many more of the same indignities their people can endure, but how much longer.
Discontent was slightly less likely when Fidel Castro was in power. He had charisma and mystique that neither his brother and successor, Raúl, nor Cuba’s current president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, can replicate. What is more, the Cuban diaspora is larger and wealthier and the internet has shown Cubans that many of their economic difficulties are created by their leaders, not the United States. The best way to stave off popular discontent would be to implement more and bigger economic reforms, at a faster pace, starting with farms and small businesses. It is a measure of Cubans’ disillusionment that the old revolutionary cry of “Hasta la victoria siempre” (On to victory, always) has largely been supplanted by the longsuffering “¿Hasta cuándo?” (How much longer?) ■",2
1771,"COUNTRIES HAVE to make revealing choices as they craft patriotic messages for children. To put it kindly, young minds are tiny treasure-houses that deserve to be stocked with only a nation’s most precious beliefs. To be more blunt, small children are easily distracted, so are best taught only a few important things.
It is therefore worth studying what China’s propaganda chiefs have in store for youngsters this summer. As usual, June 1st was marked this year in China as International Children’s Day, a festival of visits to museums, school picnics and wholesome games. A month later there will be a much larger event: celebrations on July 1st of the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding in 1921.

China’s leader, President Xi Jinping, is presented to the young as “Xi Dada”, or “Uncle Xi”, an austere but caring patriarch. Mr Xi stresses the importance of loyalty, which is why children’s choirs are busy performing such songs as “Me and My Country” and “Follow the Leadership of the Communist Party of China”. Party history is being used to inspire the masses. That explains reports of kindergarten pupils being dressed up in miniature combat fatigues and told to crawl on their bellies while clutching straw-wrapped “rations”, to re-enact Red Army supply runs. There is much talk of China entering a “new era” of prosperity, national strength and global influence. It is not hard, as a result, to find children’s drawings on public display, showing high-speed trains and space rockets adorned with Chinese flags. The young are urged to be proud of ancient glories too, as heirs to what they are told is the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.
This year’s Children’s Day saw the release of a new patriotic film made especially for children. It depicts the pre-teenage life of Zhou Enlai, who was China’s prime minister from 1949 until his death from cancer in 1976. This brilliant, disappointing man is a puzzle for historians. To this day, many Chinese revere Zhou as a moderate who tempered Mao’s worst excesses, especially during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Too often, alas, the record shows Zhou enabling Mao’s follies and failing to defend close allies from political attack. Born in 1898 into a once-grand family of scholar-officials, Zhou was a precocious student of the classics. But his childhood was blighted by the deaths of his mother and adoptive mother and by money woes that, at the age of 12, forced him to leave his birthplace, Huai’an, in the plains between the Yellow and Yangzi rivers, to seek a new life with an uncle in the north.
During the first decades of Communist rule, his privileged class background had to be explained away. A biography published in 1977, “The Early Life of Zhou Enlai” by Hu Hua, depicts Zhou as a “rebel against feudal society”, who as a boy came to hate the gentry class into which he was born. Deepening poverty turned him into a “great proletarian revolutionary”, it relates. That official history manages to praise Zhou’s traditional education while reflecting the party’s then-noisy disdain for pre-Communist codes of ethics, such as those taught by Confucius. Describing Zhou poring over books from his grandfather’s library, Hu asserts that the boy was stirred by histories of “laudable national heroes” fighting foreign invaders, but was uninterested in Confucianism.
Biographies written in the 1990s by historians in the West, including Chae-Jin Lee, Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgen, take a different view. They find that Zhou had a conventional Confucian education, which marked him for life. Nor do they agree that he was an angry rebel, noting his later, loving praise for his two mothers. Both were educated, tradition-minded daughters of scholar-officials. Indeed, they link Zhou’s survival at Mao’s side to a reverence for Confucian teachings about self-restraint and the need for officials to swallow small insults in the national interest.
The new film appears to agree. Chaguan watched “Zhou Enlai in his Childhood” on Children’s Day in a cinema in Huai’an. The movie does not hide Zhou’s ancestral wealth. It portrays him as a solemn little boy in a silk gown, visiting relatives in antique-filled mansions. Confucian customs are shown as expressions of love. The young Zhou kowtows to his elders and studies cobwebbed texts to make his dying mother proud. His adoptive mother teaches him to swallow an unjust punishment with tales of an ancient general who endured humiliations on his way to greatness.
The film is not fast-paced. There is much fidgeting in the cinema, though children perk up at a brief shot of a boy’s bare bottom, and again when Zhou urges his adoptive mother to drink ink as a medicine. The Zhou family’s struggles to afford a middle-class life are crafted to resonate with older cinema-goers. Zhou’s father, a petty official in another town, is depicted as a migrant worker—largely absent, always fretting about money, and emotionally distant from his own son. The film shows health crises that wreck family finances and trigger rows about whether to spend money on medicine or school fees. Such dilemmas remain common today. The film’s ending unites all ages. Over swelling chords, young Zhou waxes indignant on learning that Russia and Japan have taken territory from the ailing Chinese empire, then declares that he studies hard so that China may rise. That phrase of Zhou’s is taught in schools to this day, and triggers murmurs of recognition.
Nationalism instead of class struggle
After the film, a mother in the audience, Lu Ye, calls it “very educational” to see the orphaned Zhou confront debt-collectors, endure hardships and assume responsibilities beyond his years. Ms Lu’s 12-year-old son, Rongye, says that he “really liked” the film. He praises an episode in which Zhou picked and sold wild vegetables to help repay those debts, until his hands bled. “For the welfare of the family, he didn’t care,” Rongye notes approvingly.
The film-makers say that their aim is to promote education and family harmony. China is a deeply conservative place, even as it prepares to celebrate its revolutionary past. Chinese children, told constantly to be diligent and obedient, sensed that all along. ■",2
1772,"IN FEBRUARY 1897 British soldiers raced from the Nigerian coast to Benin City, machine-gunning as they went. Their “punitive expedition” aimed to avenge the killing of several Britons a month earlier and to destroy the Edo kingdom. By the time the soldiers entered the city it was lifeless, all the residents having fled or been killed. But the troops were not disappointed. They discovered thousands of sculptures, which they removed before burning the city.
The bronzes came to be seen as a high point of African art. Given away or sold by officers, they were collected by artists such as André Derain and Pablo Picasso and by European and American museums. One bronze cock ended up in Jesus College, Cambridge—which, on October 27th, handed it to officials from Nigeria. It was the first time a British institution had freely handed a bronze over.

George William Neville, a businessman from Lagos, gave the cock to Jesus College in 1905. Neville was not part of the military expedition but made his own way to the city and grabbed what he could. He was given a guard of 20 soldiers for the return journey. “I would advise you to push on as quickly as possible,” a lieutenant-colonel told him, “for the fact of so many ancient heirlooms leaving the city may attract attention and possibly lead to molestations.”
For decades the cock stood unmolested on a plinth in the college hall. But in 2016 two students (one now a correspondent at The Economist) called for the sculpture to be returned. Three years later Jesus College agreed. Universities can move more quickly than national museums, which are bound by laws and scrutinised by politicians. They also mind how young people see them. When an independent commission established by Oriel College in Oxford asked school pupils whether a statue of Cecil Rhodes, a famous colonialist, would discourage them from applying, two-thirds said yes.
As The Economist went to press a delegation was travelling to Aberdeen University to receive a second bronze. New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art has agreed to return two more. Next year German museums will start handing theirs back. At that point the British Museum, which holds the world’s largest collection of Benin bronzes, will begin to look uncomfortably exposed.
Correction (November 1st 2021): A sentence in this article has been changed to reflect the fact that a report on the Rhodes statue in Oriel College, Oxford was written by an independent commission established by the college, not by the college itself.",2
1773,"OFFICIALS IN XINJIANG have always been suspicious of the distinctive cultural identity of ethnic Uyghurs. They worry that it may fuel separatist yearnings in the far-western region. But in 2014, as the authorities stepped up their campaign to crush terrorism there, the government still tolerated displays of pride in Uyghur culture. In October that year a new talent show, “The Voice of the Silk Road”, aired on state-owned Xinjiang Television. It featured songs in various styles, from pop and R to traditional muqam music with lyrics influenced by classical poetry. The judges mostly spoke in Uyghur.
When China began to open up in the late 1970s, after the death of Mao Zedong, Uyghur culture was allowed to flourish, as long as it avoided any hint of support for a separate Uyghur state. Uyghur writers produced poems and songs filled with universally familiar themes such as love and loss, but also conveying pride in their identity. They created innovative blends of muqam with rock and hip-hop that turned a few Uyghurs into household names in China. Songs in such styles were aired on “The Voice of the Silk Road”.

There was nothing politically edgy about the show. It was merely a regional adaptation of a national hit, “The Voice of China” (which is still running). But it fell victim to a security clampdown, launched in response to sporadic attacks by Uyghurs on Chinese belonging to the ethnic-Han majority. Since 2017 some of the show’s stars have disappeared into a vast new gulag in which more than 1m people, most of them Uyghurs, have been locked up.
Officials say the camps offer “vocational education” to help Uyghurs find better jobs and to curb their “extremist” tendencies. But many of those detained have shown no more sign of extremism than simply being devout Muslims. Often, as with those involved in “The Voice of the Silk Road”, their crime has been to show too much enthusiasm for Uyghur culture, not necessarily just Islam.
Those rounded up who were linked with the show include Zahirshah Ablimit, who came second in the competition of 2014, and Muhtar Bugra, a businessman and poet who was its financier and head producer. Both were eventually released. Still thought to be inside are Memetjan Abduqadir, another producer who is also an actor and singer, and Mekhmutjan Sidiq, the director of Xinjiang Television.
Uyghur groups in the West reckon that the four are among nearly 400 intellectuals and cultural figures who have been detained in the new camps, sent to regular prisons or who have otherwise disappeared since the clampdown began. Some are well known in the region: Perhat Tursun, a novelist and poet; Tashpolat Tiyip, the president of Xinjiang University; Rahile Dawut, a scholar of Uyghur folklore; and Ablajan Ayup, an actor and singer sometimes described as a Uyghur Justin Bieber. Others associated with Uyghur culture have been paraded on state television praising the virtues of the Communist Party or singing patriotic songs.
The chill had begun even before the airing of the first episode of “The Voice of the Silk Road”. In September 2014 Ilham Tohti, a revered academic with moderate political views, was sentenced to life in prison for separatism. Mr Tohti had maintained a website that hosted writing by Uyghur intellectuals on social and cultural issues. He had dared to call for more enlightened official treatment of his ethnic group.
Today the only Uyghur culture allowed in China is of a token kind, conforming to a stereotype endorsed by the party such as smiling Uyghurs wearing brightly coloured traditional costume, dancing in public squares and singing, often in Mandarin. On September 29th, at a side event during a meeting in New York of the UN General Assembly, Chinese diplomats showed a video of such performances. It was called “Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land”.
Uyghurs living in exile in the West have been waging a parallel campaign to keep their culture alive. It has involved airing the works of underground artists in Xinjiang whose songs and poems explore more politically risky themes such as oppression and alienation, says Mukaddas Mijit, a specialist in Uyghur music living in France. As repression has tightened, she says, the works of such musicians and poets have become increasingly suffused with lament and despair.
Some writing has even emerged from the camps, such as poetry by Abduqadir Jalalidin, an academic. His verses were memorised by other inmates who relayed them to the outside world. “In this forgotten place I have no lover’s touch”, one begins. “Each night brings darker dreams, I have no amulet / My life is all I ask, I have no other thirst / These silent thoughts torment, I have no way to hope.” The translation is by Joshua Freeman of Princeton University, a former student of his.
In 2022 a novel by Mr Tursun, one of the detained writers, will be published abroad in English. Called “The Backstreets”, it first appeared online, in Uyghur, in 2013. The surreal fable echoes Ralph Ellison’s classic novel “Invisible Man”, about a black American who does not feel fully seen (Mr Tursun was influenced by Ellison). On a street in Urumqi, Xinjiang’s capital, the narrator meets a man who vows to “chop” to death everyone in southern Xinjiang, a mostly Uyghur area. The man vanishes into the fog and the narrator muses: “I would always be the one he was going to chop, even though we didn’t know each other.”
Mr Tursun’s writings and links with other cultural personalities in Xinjiang may have led to his detention in 2018 and his reported jail term of 16 years. A public figure in Urumqi, his politics had once been officially acceptable. He had even criticised Uyghur ethno-nationalism.
But displays of loyalty to the party are no longer enough to keep people safe. In 2017 Shireli Eltekin, a famous singer, released “A Song for Leader Xi Jinping”, a paean to China’s president. It includes fawning lyrics such as: “You put light into the hearts of the people.” Uyghurs in exile were dismayed to hear a much-loved performer crooning for the regime. But one night in June he was taken away from his home in his pyjamas, says a family friend.
In 2018 “The Voice of the Silk Road” was discontinued.It returned last year, with changes. Introducing the new series, the host made approving remarks about building socialism in Xinjiang and loving the party. In this year’s competition, the first contestant to take to the stage sang a Uyghur-language song from the 1950s called “Leader Mao Zedong”. In the show’s early days, this would have been “unimaginable”, says Elise Anderson of the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington, an American ethnomusicologist who competed in the inaugural series of “The Voice of the Silk Road” in 2014.
Such popular entertainment used to suggest at least some official acceptance of Uyghur culture. Now it is evidence of its suppression. Ms Anderson worries that, inside China, “only a Potemkin version” may survive. ■

1774,"TO FREE-THINKING users of WeChat, a social-media platform, it was a depressingly familiar event. Late on July 6th, those who tried to browse accounts run by LGBT societies at several universities in China were greeted with messages saying the forums, which had been used to publicise events such as webinars and film nights, had been closed for violating unspecified rules. The accounts had probably offended the government, which has little regard for the rights of sexual minorities and even less for freedom of speech.
In the past, such clampdowns have met resistance. In 2018 Weibo, a Twitter-like service, announced a three-month campaign to eradicate pornographic, gay and violent content from its services. In 2019 the platform shut down a discussion group called Les, aimed at homosexual women. It had 140,000 members. In both cases, online anger prompted Weibo to rethink. The service conducted the clean-up, but decided not to suppress content simply for being gay-themed. It allowed the lesbian group to reopen.

This time the online reaction has been more mixed. Many social-media users hailed the closure of the LGBT accounts as a victory for patriots. “External forces are trying to weaken China’s competitiveness by spreading propaganda about LGBT to reduce China’s fertility rate,” wrote one blogger, gathering more than 66,000 views. Some accused LGBT groups of trying to promote a “colour revolution” in China, a reference to uprisings against other autocratic regimes. Hongwei Bao of Nottingham University says popular nationalism in China sometimes adopts the language of the far right in the West. That includes anti-Semitic drivel: one Weibo user with nearly 150,000 followers described LGBT activism as “a culture war initiated by the Jewish elite and the white left”. The term “white left” was coined in China a few years ago to describe Western liberals obsessed with identity politics. Now it is also used to insult Chinese who are deemed to sound like woke Westerners.
Homosexuality has long been vilified as foreign in China. But in the 2000s, as China grappled with rising rates of HIV/AIDS, the government dialled back the bigotry. In 2001 it removed homosexuality from an official list of mental disorders. Since then, at the UN and other international forums, it has gone further by endorsing the rights of LGBT people. At least in big cities, gay people have reported growing acceptance of their sexuality among fellow citizens. “The government doesn’t really care,” says Eric Wang (not his real name), who works for an LGBT-rights organisation in mainland China. “They’ve got more important things to do than oppress us.”
But rising anti-Western sentiment is hampering this progress. Nationalists, egged on by the Communist Party, have become even more vocal during the covid-19 pandemic. They have trumpeted China’s success in controlling the virus while heaping scorn on the West’s fumbling response. Mr Wang says a growing number of Chinese, even those who know gay and transgender people, have started “believing in conspiracy theories”. One is that all LGBT groups are funded by Westerners.
Seker Ma, a graphic designer in the eastern city of Suzhou who was involved with LGBT groups during his recent time at university, says the atmosphere for gay people in China has worsened in the past few months. “A lot of the current wave of patriotism takes this view: ‘Whatever the West supports, we must oppose,’” says Mr Ma.
A worker at an LGBT-rights group in Beijing says that even some gay people think that Western countries use LGBT issues to attack China. Very few such organisations are officially recognised as NGOs—the government views them with deep suspicion. Most are able to operate only by registering as youth centres or charities related to HIV/AIDS. In the build-up to celebrations of the party’s 100th birthday on July 1st, officials warned leaders of such groups to lie low. “We are very vulnerable,” says the LGBT activist. Now nationalism may be posing an even greater threat to their work than the interference of security-obsessed bureaucrats. ■",2
1775,"AESOP’S FABLES are supposed to illustrate a moral point. If he had lived in Central America rather than Greece, though, he might have thrown in the towel at writing one entitled “The Ant and the Acacia Tree”. For, as Sabrina Amador-Vargas and Finote Gijsman of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, in Panama, have discovered, the moral of this particular tale is that laziness pays.
Acacias are a widespread group, but one member in particular, Vachellia collinsii, is famous for its symbiotic relationship with ants. The ants attack herbivorous insects which eat the tree’s leaves, remove encroaching vegetation, and also protect it from disease by distributing antibiotics synthesised by bacteria living on their legs. In return, the tree rewards ants with food in the form of protein-rich Beltian bodies (the white objects in the picture above) and sugar-rich nectaries, and with secure housing inside hollow thorns that have evolved specifically for the purpose.

A cosy arrangement, then. But, like all bargains, one that is subject to negotiation. One of the best known ant symbionts of acacias is Pseudomyrmex spinicola. Members of this species do everything expected of them and help the plants to thrive. Crematogaster crinosa, by contrast, are less desirable tenants. They are lazy defenders against herbivores, fail to clear encroaching vegetation and are not known to spread antibiotics. Given the different services these species provide, Dr Amador-Vargas and Ms Gijsman wondered whether the plants paid them different wages. And, as they write in the Science of Nature, they found that they did. But not in a way that Aesop would have approved of.
For three months, the researchers monitored specimens of V. collinsii at two sites, one of which supported both types of ant and the other only P. spinicola. They paid particular attention to the trees’ thorns, Beltian bodies and nectaries, but also collected evidence of leaves having been chewed by herbivores. For comparison, they looked at acacias lacking ant colonies.
The quality and quantity of accommodation provided was, they discovered, the same in all circumstances. Even when ants were absent, acacias grew similar numbers of hollow thorns. The food rewards on offer, however, varied a lot.
In particular, trees with ants sported 75% more nectaries than those without. This came as no surprise. But the plants also treated the two types of tenant differently. Though the distribution of Beltian bodies remained unchanged, acacias supporting colonies of P. spinicola only produced nectaries along the bases of their leaves. Those supporting C. crinosa did this too, but also sported such structures at the tips of their leaves, encouraging otherwise recalcitrant workers of that species to traverse the leaves to reach an extra reward. That brings these ants into contact with pests they might not otherwise have encountered, driving those pests away. But from an anthropomorphic point of view it hardly seems fair on the industrious workers of P. spinicola, which need no such bribe to achieve the same goal. ■

1776,"IF CHIEF EXECUTIVES are the monarchs of the corporate world, the cadre of well-paid staff they deploy from head office to oversee operations across the planet are their ambassadors. In the golden era of globalisation, sending an expatriate Western executive to a distant emerging market signalled the place was being taken seriously. That model was starting to feel out of date before covid-19 made foreign travel a misery. As Zoom and remote work have become the norm, is shuffling emissaries across the world even worth it anymore?
Some 280m people live in a country other than their own, often because of their job. Many toil on building sites in the Gulf or mind brats in Manhattan. High-flying expats are the most cosseted of these migrants. Their exalted status, should it need to be pinned down, is secured by snagging a housing allowance, school fees for the brood, annual flights home and a healthy salary bump. Some business folk have turned into perennial business wanderlusters, making a career out of flitting from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi to Lagos.

The business case for expats had started to look stretched in recent years. Moving staff to the ends of the Earth made sense when it was tricky to find globally minded (and English-speaking) employees over there. But globalisation has worked its magic. If an American investment bank in Shanghai wants a bright number-cruncher with a top-tier MBA, it has plenty of local candidates to choose from. They will cost a fraction of what it would take to move a transplant—and already speak the language.
Getting head-office staff to up sticks for Jakarta has been getting harder, too. In decades past a compliant “trailing spouse” took on the responsibility of keeping a household running in far-flung places. Now she (as is still more often the case) is likelier to quibble about the impact on her own career. A survey carried out by the Boston Consulting Group found 57% of workers globally were willing to move to a foreign country for work in 2018, down from 64% four years earlier.
The figure fell even further, to 50%, once the pandemic hit. Many expat haunts, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, went through looser lockdowns than America or Europe. But that often meant throttling foreign travel or imposing weeks-long quarantines for returnees. The prospect of a trip to see family for Christmas, or of a weekend getaway to Bali, is part of what makes living in Singapore attractive. Once that goes the trade-off between career and personal life starts looking uncomfortably different.
Many foreigners who had once been given royal treatment felt treated like second-class citizens. Some hesitated to leave their country of assignment for fear of not being able to get back in. Others had to wait longer than locals for vaccines. Clubby communities no longer made space for outsiders. As Hong Kong, once the spiritual home of expatdom, has fallen into China’s ambit, Western imports have started to look like a vestige of the colonial past.
This speaks to a broader economic shift that has dented the need for expats. Once upon a time they used to be the ones able to facilitate access to foreign capital and know-how, often from Western sources. Now money is abundant and the most exciting business opportunities are emerging markets doing business with other emerging markets, particularly in Asia. You don’t need a Westerner to show you how to do that. The world they understand is no longer as relevant.
Expats are not just expensive perk-baggers (as this stand-in Bartleby, a foreign correspondent in his day job, can attest). Companies have cultures and processes which are forged at headquarters, and which envoys can disseminate. They in turn will imbibe new ways of doing things that can be transferred back to other bits of the business. Having an outsider somewhere in the organisational chart of a distant subsidiary can provide reassurance no funny business is taking place there. However, penny-pinching bosses might now consider whether regular Zoom calls will not achieve much the same thing for a fraction of the cost—not least if employees the world over are going to be working from home at times anyway.
The surest way to signal commitment to a market these days is not by importing top talent but by nurturing it locally. Many companies that proudly deployed expats now boast of appointing local bosses to head up each country. That isn’t a reversal of globalisation so much as an affirmation of it.

1777,"POWER CUTS in China. Coal shortages in India. Spikes in electricity prices across Europe. A scramble for petrol in Britain. Blackouts and fuel blazes in Lebanon. Symptoms of dysfunction in global energy markets are everywhere.
In recent days the mayhem has pushed oil prices in America above $80 a barrel, their highest level since late 2014. Natural-gas prices in Europe have tripled this year. Demand for coal, supposedly on the slag heap of history, has surged. The chief executive of one commodities-trading firm says he comes into the office at 5am in order to get the latest news on blackouts in one Asian country or another. And winter, with its need for heating, has yet to arrive in the northern hemisphere.

A few years ago producers of fossil fuels would have responded to such price signals by swiftly ramping up output and investment. In 2014, with crude above $100 a barrel, Royal Dutch Shell, a European supermajor, put more than $30bn of capital expenditure into upstream oil and gas projects. It then splurged $53bn on BG Group, a British rival, to become the world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Not this time. Climate change has led to unprecedented pressure on oil and gas firms, especially European ones, to shift away from fossil fuels. As part of Shell’s long-term shift towards markets for lower-carbon gas and power, its upstream capital spending this year has shrunk to about $8bn. Last month it flogged its once-prized shale assets in the Permian basin in Texas to an American rival, ConocoPhillips, for $9.5bn. It is withdrawing from its onshore operations in Nigeria, a country where it first set foot in 1936. It recently said it would reduce oil production by 1-2% every year until 2030. Asked what the energy-price spike means for investment, Wael Sawan, its head of upstream oil-and-gas production is blunt. “From my perspective, it means nothing,” he says.
This view is pervasive throughout much of the oil industry. In Europe, listed oil companies are under pressure from investors, primarily on environmental grounds, to stop drilling new wells. More upstream investment as prices rise could “delegitimise” their public commitments to cleaner energy, says Philip Whittaker of BCG, a consultancy. In America, publicly traded shale companies, which used to be all too eager to “frack” whenever oil prices spiked, are now under the thumbscrew of shareholders who want profits returned via dividends and buybacks rather than poured down a hole in the ground.

State-owned oil firms are under budgetary constraints, too, partly because of the covid-19 pandemic. Only a few, such as Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) are expanding production. The result is a worldwide slump in investment in oil and gas exploration and production, from above $800bn in 2014 to just about $400bn, where it is expected to stay (see chart).
Keeping it in the ground
Meanwhile, demand has returned with surprising buoyancy as the pandemic eases. For the first time ever the oil market could briskly reach a point of lacking any spare capacity, according to Goehring  Rozencwajg, a commodity-investing firm. That might be only a temporary state of affairs; Aramco and ADNOC could respond rapidly. But temporarily at least it would push prices of crude sharply higher, adding further strains to economies already suffering from soaring costs of natural gas for homes and energy-intensive activities, from steelmaking and fertiliser production to blowing glass for wine bottles.
From an environmental standpoint, higher prices may be welcome if they sap demand for fossil fuels, especially in the absence of a global carbon tax with bite. In its “World Energy Outlook”, published on October 13th, the International Energy Agency (IEA), an energy forecaster, said that the rebound in consumption of fossil fuels this year may cause the second-biggest absolute increase in carbon-dioxide emissions ever. To reach a goal of “net zero” emissions by 2050, the IEA says there is no need for investment in new oil and gas projects after 2021. Instead it calls for a tripling of clean-energy investment by 2030.
The IEA’s argument that no new natural-gas projects, which are less grubby than with other hydrocarbons, are needed rests in part on investments in low-emission fuels, such as hydrogen. But, it admits, these are “well off track”. This points to the risk of treating all fossil fuels, each of which bears the blame for carbon emissions, as equal culprits. Reducing natural-gas supply with no backup could be counterproductive.
For one thing, gas is currently the main substitute for thermal coal in countries like China and India that are keen to lower their power-related emissions. Bernstein, an investment firm, predicts China’s imports of LNG could almost double by 2030, making it the world’s biggest buyer. In the absence of investment in new projects, Bernstein expects global LNG capacity to be 14% short of what is needed by then. That would hamper Asia’s exit from coal.
Moreover, natural gas serves a vital function in maintaining the stability of the electricity grid, especially in places reliant on intermittent wind and solar power (at least until the world’s grids become more interconnected). In such markets the marginal cost of natural gas often sets power prices, even if most electricity comes from renewables with zero marginal cost. The higher the price of gas, the higher the electricity bills. This could dampen popular support for clean power.
Whether new supply will be forthcoming remains up in the air. As the boss of another commodities-trader observes, “because natural gas has been put in the dirty-fuels column, no one is investing.” For the private-sector supermajors, the problem is that they are all more or less evenly split between producing oil and natural gas. Because both often come out of the ground together, the two fuels tend to be inter twined in investors’ minds. This is frustrating. “It’s an incredibly myopic view that we lump oil together with gas,” fumes one supermajor executive. Yet his firm does not seem likely to defy investors by ramping up gas output significantly.
An executive at another big oil company says the higher prices may add pressure to invest a bit more—but not to deviate from long-term climate commitments. Instead, he says new investment is likely to come from two sources that are not exposed to public pressure: the state-owned oil companies and privately held firms. The executive notes that the bulk of the recent increase in rig counts in the Permian basin has come from unlisted frackers, rather than publicly traded ones. Some compare this to bootlegging in the prohibition era. The higher the price of oil and gas, the more incentives there will be to produce them. Provided, that is, this happens out of the public eye. ■

1778,"HONG KONG, July 12 (Reuters) - China's antitrust regulator is set to order the music streaming arm of Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) to give up exclusive rights to music labels which it has used to compete with smaller rivals, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
The State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) will also fine it 500,000 yuan ($77,150) for lapses in reporting the acquisitions of apps Kuwo and Kugou, the people told Reuters - a milder penalty than the forced sale indicated earlier this year.
SAMR, Tencent Holdings and Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME.N) did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
The move is the latest in a clamp-down to curb the economic and social power of China's once-loosely regulated internet giants. The campaign, which began late last year, has included a record 18 billion yuan fine on e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  for abusing its market position.
In April, Reuters reported that SAMR aimed to fine Tencent Holdings at least 10 billion yuan, and that the social media leader was lobbying for leniency. Reuters also reported that SAMR had told Tencent Music it may have to sell Kuwo and Kugou.
Instead, SAMR will no longer require a sale but will impose the maximum 500,000 yuan fine for not properly flagging the 2016 app purchases for antitrust review, the people said on Monday.
""Personally, I think this punishment falls short and is even a boon for Tencent. The acquisitions obviously would restrict competition in the market, and should have been vetoed,"" said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Offices.
""It is too little a hit to Tencent Music's dominant position in the market,"" said You, a commentator on antitrust law.
Reuters could not determine whether Tencent Holdings faces any further antitrust penalty beyond the expected ruling on Tencent Music, China's dominant music streamer.
On Saturday, SAMR said it would block Tencent Holdings' plan to merge China's two biggest videogame streamers - Huya Inc (HUYA.N) and DouYu International Holdings Ltd  - on antitrust grounds, confirming an earlier Reuters report.  read more 
EXCLUSIVITY
Tencent Music, China's equivalent to Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), had been pursuing exclusive streaming rights with labels including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group and Warner Music Group Corp (WMG.O) to fend off competition.
It became the subject of a SAMR investigation in 2018 which stopped the following year after the company agreed not to renew some of its exclusive rights, which normally expire after three years, Reuters previously reported.
It nevertheless kept exclusive rights to music from some acts, including Jay Chou, one of the Chinese-speaking world's most influential artists.
After SAMR's latest ruling, Tencent Music will at least be able to retain rights to music from some domestic indie acts, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Losing exclusive rights means Tencent Music will likely have to redouble efforts to build a more interactive and lively community to engage with its users. The firm has also been diversifying its content through long-form shows and live talk shows to attract more paying users as well as advertisers.
Tencent Music is facing a mounting challenge from ByteDance, which is using its Douyin app - its Chinese version of TikTok - to promote music backed by sophisticated algorithms.

1779,"Schoolies has well and truly kicked off on the Gold Coast as thousands of teenagers flock to the city for a week of partying.
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
With a kiss and a hug goodbye to mum, many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning.
Others had already gone to the local supermarket to stock up on food and drinks for the week ahead.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",-2
1780,"AFGHANISTAN’S PRESIDENTIAL palace has seen its fair share of bad-tempered quarrels between politicians. In recent years the castle-like building in the centre of Kabul was the site of bitter spats between the irascible former president, Ashraf Ghani, and his rival, Abdullah Abdullah. Mr Ghani is said to have taken anger-management classes. At one point he and Dr Abdullah held rival inauguration ceremonies as they disagreed over who should rule. Yet even by those fractious standards, the Taliban’s recent bust-up seems to have been heated.
The trouble kicked off in mid-September, just days after the Taliban announced the make-up of their interim government. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the group’s founders and now a deputy prime minister, is said to have been dismayed that the cabinet was stuffed with conservatives from the old guard and military hardliners from the Haqqani network, a leading faction in the Taliban’s tapestry of allegiances. Khalil Haqqani, minister for refugees and a senior member of the Haqqani clan, countered that it was those very military hardliners who had delivered victory and should therefore be rewarded. Most accounts concur that the disagreement descended into angry words. Some suggest it went further: coming to scuffles, punches and even gunfire as the leaders’ retinues brawled. Mr Baradar, who is seen as one of the movement’s moderates, relatively speaking, lay low in Kandahar for a few days, leading to speculation that he had been wounded.

The Taliban deny there was ever any clash. Mr Baradar is now back in Kabul conducting official business and apparently unhurt, though he seems to have lost the argument. But the reports shone fresh light on the internal politics of a group whose leadership has for decades operated in the shadows, and whose dynamics could be outlined only imperfectly by intelligence agencies and Talibanologists.

Disputes like the palace row should come as no surprise considering the diversity within the Taliban, says Antonio Giustozzi of King’s College London. As the group prospered and grew beyond its roots, it swallowed, attracted or co-opted all sorts of militant networks and commanders, of which the Haqqani clan is only the best known. That resulted not in a Maoist-style centrally controlled insurgency, but a coalition of commanders bound by some core beliefs.
The Taliban’s secrecy during their 20-year insurgency hid some of this disagreement, but a notable flare-up occurred in 2015, two years after the death of the movement’s original leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. The appointment of his successor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, who has since been killed, was rejected by several senior figures including Omar’s son. The Taliban were briefly in turmoil as competing factions jockeyed for power. There are also continuing ideological divisions. These vary from how heavy-handed the group should be in enforcing its social policies to whether to cut ties with foreign jihadists such as al-Qaeda, whom many fighters consider comrades. Whether to work with other domestic political forces is also a thorny topic.

Given these differences, what is perhaps most remarkable is not the Taliban’s feuding, but their cohesion. “Their greatest skill,” says Mr Giustozzi, is to “keep all of this together despite constant friction and constant argument.” That stems from hard work, says Haroun Rahimi of the American University of Afghanistan. The group might be known for issuing authoritarian edicts to Afghans, but it goes out of its way to seek consensus internally. There is deference to clerical seniority and battlefield experience, but controversial matters are laboriously debated in large councils known as shuras. Factions such as the Haqqanis have been allowed some latitude in how they operate. Pakistan’s security forces are also thought to have mediated on occasion.
Such deliberation may salve tensions, but it can also make the organisation conservative and indecisive. Policies are pitched at the group’s lowest common denominator to preserve concord. That makes it difficult for the Taliban to change. Indeed early policy moves appear to show no great evolution, despite vows that the Taliban had moved on from the repressive regime they ran in the 1990s. Harsh sharia punishments such as public hanging and chopping off thieves’ hands are back. Women are being purged from the workplace. Such policies may explain why even Pakistan, which formally recognised the Taliban the last time around, has not yet done so again (see box).
Power has brought new challenges to the Taliban’s internal order. During the 1990s, lingering domestic resistance, which they never completely vanquished, helped maintain unity. But the Taliban now rule the entire country, almost uncontested. Thousands of fighters steeped in a culture of militancy are twiddling their thumbs. Not every commander will win a position in the new government. There is little money for those who do. “I think that disagreements within the top leadership are distracting us from the pressure that the Taliban movement is under from below, from their fighters,” says Mr Rahimi.

Tamim Asey, who heads the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a think-tank in the Afghan capital, describes what he calls “jihadi anarchism”. The Taliban’s branches in some provinces show signs of questioning the writ of Kabul. “The transformation from a militia to a government is costing them, and it appears to be painful,” he says. Some fighters are returning to civilian life. Others appear nostalgic for their campaigning days and admit peace is a bit of a drag. “Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to become a martyr,” moans a Talib guarding the shuttered British embassy.
The new defence minister recently rebuked fighters for their indiscipline, complaining of reprisals, which are forbidden under the Taliban’s declared amnesty for officials of the former regime. He also admonished footsoldiers for inadvertently giving away secrets as they pose for selfies in ministries. “Such hanging out and taking snaps and videos will not help you in this world, or in the hereafter,” he said.
Hints of splits within the Taliban might once have gladdened the hearts of the Western spooks and soldiers arrayed against them. No longer. Serious divisions could pitch the country into civil war, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis and prompting a surge in refugees. A rift would also encourage defections to other militant groups and embolden terrorists like Islamic State. For now, at least, even the Taliban’s erstwhile enemies are hoping the group can keep it together.■",2

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYChildren from ethnic-minority groups hit harderA new report confirms that while deaths in kids infected with Covid-19 are very rare, children and teens from ethnic-minority groups are disproportionately impacted. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly report Tuesday that while Hispanic, Black, Native American and Asian or Pacific people represented 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age group.If rich countries get the vaccine first, twice as many people will die: studyNew modelling from Northeastern University shows that a coordinated vaccine response that provides countries with a number of doses proportionate to their population will save twice as many lives than if rich countries were prioritized.If the vaccine is distributed based on population numbers, it could avert 61% of global deaths. But if higher numbers of doses are given to wealthier countries, just 33% of deaths could be prevented. The US and China are among nations that have not joined an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine ahead of a deadline on Friday.It may be 2022 before we can start thinking about 'normal life' againThat's the stark warning from the World Health Organization's chief science officer, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, who said there needs to be  60% to 70% of the population with immunity before a dramatic reduction in viral transmission is realistic.

1782,"IN THE ANCIENT Chinese game of weiqi, better known in the West as Go, the objective is not to knock out your opponent. Taking turns to add one stone at a time to the board’s 361 spaces, what players firstly seek is to build the largest, strongest structures, and only secondly to weaken and stifle enemy ones. Better players shun contact, preferring to parry threats with counter-threats. Such unresolved challenges multiply, the advantage shifting to whoever poses the sharpest ones. Only when more stones than empty spaces fill the board can resolution of these tactical matters no longer be avoided.
The contest between China and India has unfolded in similar fashion. The two have lately engaged in sabre-rattling and name-calling. But such tension has been rare during their seven-decade rivalry as modern nations. As in a game of weiqi, so long as India and China were focused on building their own core structures, each largely ignored the other.

Far from their crowded coasts and plains, the Asian giants’ 3,500km-long border region remained an empty section of the board. It contained not people or resources but the world’s coldest, driest deserts and its highest mountains. India and China maintained overlapping claims, and their forces sometimes clashed, as in a brief war in 1962. But they both also judged that there was not enough at stake to fight a big war over. So territorial limits continued to be defined in many areas by a “Line of Actual Control” rather than an internationally recognised boundary. By mutual agreement their border patrols went lightly armed. They mostly avoided contact.
As a democracy bound by rules, India has repeatedly sought to end the ambiguity by negotiating a permanent border. But perhaps because its strategists are steeped in the culture of weiqi, China has repeatedly rebuffed such efforts. For a player building formidable structures across the rest of the board, why foreclose on potential pressure points? Better to leave them open for use in the future, when you have more leverage and your opponent has more reason to fear you.
Under President Xi Jinping, China appears to have decided that this future is now. At several strategic spots along the border in the spring of 2020, Chinese troops marched into long-established patches of no-man’s-land, setting up permanent forward positions. When India sent in soldiers to challenge the intrusions, fisticuffs ensued. One clash left some 20 Indians and at least four Chinese dead. China has since refused any return to the status quo ante. This leaves it in control of lands India regarded as its own and, more seriously, in control of vantage points from which to threaten crucial roads and other Indian infrastructure.
From a weiqi perspective China’s boldness is understandable. In the 1980s its economy was roughly equal to India’s. It is now five times bigger, and churns out ever-more sophisticated weaponry while India relies on imports. China’s infrastructure has expanded towards its peripheries at a speed India has been unable to match.
As seen from Beijing, China’s southern neighbour looks weak in other ways. Its democracy is messy and inefficient. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, looks like a puffed-up bluffer. And even as China extends strength by tightening its alliance with India’s arch-enemy Pakistan, Mr Modi dithers. In his dream of a Hindu golden age India needs no allies, only weaker satellites or rich friends. Despite fanfare over defence agreements with America or Japan or Australia, these remain largely notional. India’s army has little functional interoperability with any other.
In short, as the board fills up and one player emerges dominant, there should be no surprise for it to push the advantage. But China has not yet won. Even if his opponent is erratic, the global gameboard may prove wider, and India may turn out to have better-placed assets than Mr Xi realises.
Despite Mr Modi’s failings India retains a big reserve of goodwill as a democracy and a decent global citizen; it would gain fast allies if it really tried to win them. India’s core strength may run deeper, too. Its relative smallness is deceptive: the eastern third of China, where 95% of Chinese actually live, is no bigger than India. As China’s economy matures, India’s remains packed with upward potential. Besides, unlike a game of weiqi this contest between two great and ancient nations will never simply stop. It will keep on going long after Mr Xi and Mr Modi finish playing.",2
1783,"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub
AT THE NORTHERN edge of Lusaka, in Zambia, the 24-hectare Chunga landfill smoulders in the midday sun, its sour smoke scalding the nose and throat. Wesley Kambizi works nine-hour days on the dump with just a beanie and mismatched sneakers for protection: one slip-on, one lace-up, both caked in mud. Local authorities intermittently threaten to bar waste-pickers like him from the site. Worsening poverty in the city means both that more people are scavenging at the landfill and that fewer valuable scraps make it there in the first place.

The world’s cities produce over 2bn tonnes of solid waste every year. Even before the covid-19 pandemic local governments in poor countries struggled to keep their streets clean, clearing less than half the rubbish in urban areas and around a quarter in the countryside. Informal workers, who make up around 80% of the 19m-24m workers in the waste industry, have helped plug that gap. They both haul rubbish and scour municipal dumps and public spaces for things which can be re-used or sold, normally through middlemen, to recycling companies. In India waste-pickers divert over 40m tonnes of refuse away from landfills and into recycling every year, a task that would cost municipalities 15-20% of their annual budget. In South Africa they are responsible for recovering 80-90% of packaging.
Some, like Mr Kambizi, do the job full-time; others resort to waste-picking only when times are hard. The pandemic has enlarged their ranks. Birungi Hidaya lost her job as a teacher in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, soon after the pandemic struck. Now she works the Kiteezi landfill. She turns her nose up at the other scavengers on the dump, labelling them “ignorant” and “not civilised at all”.
The lay-offs that have come with the pandemic have seen more people like Ms Birungi eking out a living by collecting, sorting and selling rubbish. But the pandemic has also created new problems for waste-pickers.
The first is getting to the waste. South Africa failed to classify waste-picking as an essential service during this year’s lockdowns, leaving thousands stuck at home at risk of starvation. In Accra and Kumasi, cities in Ghana, those who live off the landfills worry that local governments will use the pandemic as an excuse to decommission the dumps, something they have long aspired to do.
Panicked citizens make matters worse. In Yangon, Myanmar’s commercial capital, Thiha used to make 500,000 kyat ($370) every month as an independent waste-collector in a working-class area. When a second wave of covid-19 hit in early September people began erecting makeshift barricades around their neighbourhoods, denying him access. His earnings fell by a third.
It is not just the people who are keeping Mr Thiha from the rubbish. The pandemic is producing a lot more medical waste. The amount of it produced in China’s Hubei province increased by 370% after the outbreak began. Manila and Jakarta are expected to produce an extra 280 and 210 tonnes every day, respectively. The Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC) is struggling to keep this sort of dangerous refuse away from the public in general and people like Mr Thiha in particular. It has been tasked with collecting, separating and burning the 50 tonnes of rubbish produced by hospitals and quarantine centres every day. (The sad duty of cremating victims of covid-19 has also fallen to the YCDC. “That’s a different job and also a stressful job for my people,” sighs Aung Myint Maw, deputy director of the sanitation department.)
Such care reflects a genuine concern. Some of the proliferation of pandemic-associated waste has been a benefit to litterpickers—think of all those tiddly little bottles of hand sanitiser. But in poor cities that lack the infrastructure to segregate medical waste it can be a real problem.
Scientists believe covid-19 is transmitted via tiny droplets that people exhale as they breathe, talk and cough. These virus particles can remain infective after a day spent on cardboard, at least two days on steel and three on plastic. Rifling through rubbish is never particularly safe from a health point of view; this year’s influx of infected material makes the business even riskier, particularly for those without personal protective equipment (PPE) and little understanding of how the disease spreads.

The falling price of recyclables presents a third problem. The formal recycling industry ground to a halt when countries closed their borders, making it impossible to ferry waste to the big plants which process it. There are fewer end-buyers for the plastic, paper and metal that scavengers collect. Data from the city of Pune in India show the price of polyethylene terephthalate, the plastic used to make water bottles, has dropped to as little as 10 rupees ($0.01) per kilogram from 22 rupees before the pandemic (see chart). Cardboard is two rupees per kilogram, half what it was.
That has been devastating for Rani Shivsharan, who has been collecting waste in Pune for over 25 years. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s signature Swachh Bharat, or Clean India, mission, the local authority does not recognise her work. Ms Shivsharan has not received any cash transfers or food rations since covid struck. There are days when she survives on tea. “I am scared, but what can I do?” she asks.
Brothers and sisters
Organised waste-pickers are better off on all three counts. A survey of 140 waste-picking associations in Brazil found that after serious disruption in the first weeks and months of the pandemic, three-quarters were back in operation by May. Almost all of them were using PPE, almost 80% had sent vulnerable members into isolation and 45% were quarantining scrap before sorting it. In Belo Horizonte, in south-eastern Brazil, a waste-pickers’ co-operative successfully lobbied the mayor’s office for food baskets and hygiene kits to see them through the pandemic.
The Belo Horizonte association had learned to fight for its members well before the pandemic. It has been almost 20 years since a group of single mothers in the city started collecting plastic bottles. The co-operative has since won a contract with the local authorities, which pays 265 reais ($52) for each tonne of material they sort. Similar stories can be told all round the continent. Waste-workers in Latin American cities like Buenos Aires, Bogotá and São Paulo often operate in co-operatives. The fact that Latin America’s litter-pickers are better organised and better treated is not just a by-product of increased regional prosperity. It is also the result of pressure brought by the waste-pickers themselves and a strong social-justice movement supported by the Roman Catholic church.

This has seen waste-pickers achieve a formal recognition they lack in many cities in Africa. Brazil has been gathering data on the sector for almost 20 years, from the time when waste-picking became an occupation listed in the national registry. Argentina legalised waste-picking in 2002 and has since created a government agency dedicated to the sector: it has a multimillion-dollar budget. Working together, waste-pickers can lobby for contracts or invest in sheds where they sort the day’s harvest and store it until traders offer a good price. The many local names for collectors reflect a sometimes sophisticated division of labour. Cirujas, cartoneros, recicladores and chatarreros may each differ in responsibility and status city by city. By no means all of those who work on the dumps are in associations. But the successes of those who are often help those who are not, too.
None of this has been easy, says Martha Chen, a Harvard lecturer who advises Wiego, a non-profit focused on women in informal work. “Someone from the public or the government doesn’t wake up one morning and think: ‘Let’s think about the waste-pickers’,” she says. “These gains come from years and years of struggle.”
Other regions aren’t going to integrate informal workers into their waste-management systems overnight. But there is one way in which covid-19 might help them do their work and do it safely. In the midst of a public-health emergency, city folk across the globe have begun to appreciate those who put themselves at risk to keep the streets clean. India, with its entrenched caste system, has treated its waste-workers particularly badly in the past. But this year households in Pune have been handing out food packages and cash bonuses to the people who collect their rubbish. It is the same story on the streets of London, where children have adorned their windows with notes of thanks. Rainbows, hearts and smiley faces are dedicated to doctors, postal workers and binmen. ■",2
1784,"IN 2019, AT a conference in China of Chinese-language media firms from around the world, a senior official deviated from his script to make his point clear. It was, he said, the “duty and mission” of such firms to help “retransmit” news from China’s state-controlled press at “important times”. But the more than 400 delegates from over 60 countries, including America, Australia, Britain and Canada, would have needed no reminding. Their presence itself was a sign that China had already succeeded in bringing much of the world’s Chinese-language media under its thumb. Widespread use of WeChat, a censored Chinese social-media platform, is helping it shut out those that are not.
China’s main spending on propaganda abroad has been on the foreign-language news services of its state-controlled media. In recent years it has lavished billions of dollars on building a global television network aimed at rivalling the BBC and CNN, as well as on the overseas expansion of its newspapers. But it has also been working hard to boost its influence among media abroad that are not under the Communist Party’s direct command. Those that use the Chinese language are among its main targets. There are tens of millions of ethnic Chinese living outside the country. The party likes to think of them as potential defenders of its cause in an increasingly China-sceptical West.

Chinese officials say there are more than 1,000 Chinese-language media outlets overseas. Some are newspapers that have long been partisan. Until the 1980s, the most widely circulated ones were run and owned by people from Hong Kong and Taiwan. They were staunchly anti-Communist. Those with Taiwanese connections were usually backed by the Kuomintang, the party that was toppled by the Communists in 1949 and took refuge on the island. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the party grew alarmed by widespread support within the diaspora for the pro-democracy demonstrators. It began stepping up efforts to bend Chinese-language media abroad to the party’s propaganda needs.
The party was helped by dramatic changes within the global newspaper industry as a result of the spread of the internet and falling revenue from print advertising. Many cash-strapped Chinese-language outlets were delighted by offers of paid content from Chinese state media with which they could fill their pages. Owners of Chinese-language newspapers became all too willing to sell their stakes to tycoons with business interests in China, who were eager to show their loyalty to the party by regurgitating its propaganda.
In some cases China’s own state-owned firms became big shareholders. The majority of Chinese-language news organisations outside China are now either directly or indirectly owned by the Chinese government, says Rose Luqiu of Hong Kong Baptist University. In February Sing Tao, a Hong Kong-based Chinese-language newspaper that is widely read in America, was bought by Kwok Hiu-ting, the daughter of a mainland-Chinese property developer. That prompted America to require the newspaper to register as a “foreign agent”, a designation that the Trump administration applied to several mainland-controlled media as a way of highlighting their ties with the Communist Party.
China has also used heavier-handed methods. Journalists and editors who have family members in mainland China are sometimes warned either directly or through their relatives to write copy that pleases the party. Businesses are pressed not to place advertisements in Chinese-language outlets that criticise China. News organisations that try to remain independent struggle to recruit journalists because potential candidates fear retribution, says the founder of one such outlet. Such organisations are subject to cyber attacks. To avoid difficulties, many Chinese-language media practise self-censorship. Most of the big ones in America now read like the  People’s Daily, the party’s official mouthpiece.
Some still resist the party’s embrace. A handful are controlled by overseas-based practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual sect that the party banned in 1999 and calls an “evil cult”. The website of New Tang Dynasty Television, or NTDTV, a Falun Gong-backed outfit, is more frequently visited in America than that of the official Chinese state broadcaster, according to Alexa, an internet research company. There are also services funded by Western governments, such as the BBC, Deutsche Welle, Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, that publish Chinese-language news online. Some international media have news websites in Chinese. Mandarin-speaking vloggers on YouTube broadcast political commentary that is critical of the Chinese government. Several of them have hundreds of thousands of subscribers.
To the party, however, the most crucial subset of the diaspora is made up of the millions of people who were born in China and have gone abroad to work or study, or as émigrés. This group is still outnumbered by foreign-born ethnic Chinese, many of whom are the descendants of people who left China generations ago. But their ranks have been growing fast. China wants to ensure that they do not turn their backs on the party, not least because it fears their potential influence over friends and relatives in China itself.
People in this group rely heavily on WeChat, a super-app that nearly everyone uses in China, to stay connected with people on the mainland and communicate with other China-born contacts abroad. In Australia, over 60% of Chinese-language news consumers say they read most of their news on WeChat, according to a survey by two academics in that country: Wanning Sun of the University of Technology Sydney and Haiqing Yu of RMIT University. WeChat has almost 700,000 daily active users in Australia.
Many Chinese newspapers increasingly rely on WeChat to reach new readers. To make that easier, they often censor themselves. In China, WeChat purges content that the party does not like. The international version of the app is less tightly controlled, but it is difficult for news organisations considered hostile by the party to set up public accounts on it to push their articles to users. In December the platform even deleted a post by Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, in which he said that Australia was a “free, democratic, liberal country”. He was criticising a Chinese diplomat’s Twitter post of a faked image of an Australian soldier killing a child in Afghanistan. WeChat said it had removed Mr Morrison’s message because it had used “misleading words” to “distort historical events and deceive the public”.
In May China’s leader, Xi Jinping, called for a bigger push to explain to people abroad “why the Chinese Communist Party is capable, why Marxism works and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good”. He has found willing assistants. ■",2
1785,"IT WAS A hot and sticky night for football. Because of covid-19 restrictions, the match was played at a neutral site, nearly three hours from Shanghai by car. Adding to the inconvenience, kick-off was at 6pm on a Monday. Yet a few thousand supporters still made the trek on May 10th to watch their beloved local side, Shenhua, battle the club from Hebei, a northern province. “It’s a kind of faith for us,” said A.G. Wan, a middle-aged businessman.
Cries of sha bi, a phrase not translatable in a family newspaper, rang out whenever the referee missed fouls that, for the fans, were plain to see. Cheers erupted when a Shenhua midfielder scored the equaliser with a perfectly struck last-minute penalty kick. The crowd’s passion would have been familiar to football fans anywhere. But the canvas on which it was painted—a league beset by financial chicanery and political meddling—was unmistakably Chinese.

China can seem like an economic juggernaut. Leaders set lofty targets and funnel money to favoured industries, a potent recipe when combined with talented, driven people. Football shows a less flattering side of its system: how the top-down approach that has worked well to build bullet trains can fail in less predictable domains.
The government has high ambitions for football, encapsulated by President Xi Jinping’s stated dream for China to win the World Cup some day. That day remains distant. The national team is ranked 77th in the world, behind tiny Curaçao. And domestic leagues, a crucial building block, are mired in mediocrity.
To understand what has gone wrong, look at the Chinese Super League (CSL), the country’s main football contest. Three months after winning its first-ever CSL title, Jiangsu Suning disbanded in February, tripped up by slowing growth and a more conservative political environment. The team’s owner, Suning, an electronics retailer, has been trying to pay down its debts, like other overstretched Chinese firms. Not long ago a football champion would have attracted buyers, even if bleeding cash. These days, though, few tycoons dare to acquire trophy assets. In all, more than 20 teams have left China’s professional leagues in the past two years.
The economics of football in China are atrocious. Average annual salaries for players of $1.2m in 2019 put the CSL roughly in line with Ligue 1, France’s top division. But revenues in China are piddling, with tickets regularly costing as little as 50 yuan ($8). Guangzhou Evergrande, a club renowned for its profligacy, took in only a third of the 2.9bn yuan ($450m) that it spent in 2019.
Moreover, most wages go to a few extremely expensive players, often imported from abroad, sometimes well past their prime. Carlos Tevez, a faded Argentinian star, described his spell with Shenhua in 2017 as a “vacation for seven months”, despite reportedly earning $40m. In the 1990s foreign clubs rarely gave their Chinese counterparts the time of day, says Joseph Lee, a powerful agent. Now, he says, they view China as “stupid” money.
Why have teams burnt cash with such gusto? Partly it is about branding. Xu Jiayin, the billionaire behind Evergrande, a property developer, once said that owning a football club ensured that his company made the evening news at a fraction of the cost of advertisements. But China’s tycoons are not just targeting consumers. They see Mr Xi’s professed love for football as a way to connect with him. After he rose to power in 2012, Chinese money poured into starry European clubs, from Inter Milan to Manchester City.
The past year has made clear that, far from appreciating their investments in football, Mr Xi and his advisers see them as a red flag. Companies including Fosun, Wanda, CEFC, TEDA and Guangzhou R were among the big spenders, and all have had their finances come under scrutiny. There is talk that some entrepreneurs overpaid for players or for clubs in order to skirt China’s stringent capital controls (the suggestion was that they had kickbacks paid into their accounts abroad).
So the government has introduced tough new rules, a crackdown that parallels Mr Xi’s efforts to reassert control over the broader economy. Politically, there has been a push to induct more footballers into the Communist Party, much as private companies are pressed to set up party branches. And the Chinese Football Association has capped salaries at 5m yuan for Chinese players and €3m for foreigners. It also ordered clubs to drop corporate titles from their names. Guangzhou Evergrande has become Guangzhou.
Ma Dexing, a football columnist, sees the restraints as progress. “Over the past 30 years professional football in China has been chaotic,” he says. Mr Lee thinks the changes have been rash. “It’s like half the building was good and the other half rotten, but they demolished it all,” he says.
The new rules also display officials’ penchant for micro-management. In 2017, to boost youth development, the football association required clubs to field an under-23 player for every match. Managers gamed that rule, substituting youngsters after as little as a minute. So the football tsars mandated that they must play for the whole match. “The narrative every year ends up being ‘How have the rules changed?’,” sighs Cameron Wilson, founder of Wild East Football, a website devoted to the Chinese game.
For China’s national football team, the fundamental problem is not at the elite level but at the grassroots. In big cities there is little space for children to kick a ball around. A hyper-competitive education system, in any case, leaves them little time for play. Officials had hoped that glittering football academies would help. The world’s largest was opened by Evergrande in 2012 with 50 full-sized pitches. So far, though, none of its thousands of graduates has made the senior national team.
The football association has also tried to identify promising players early in life, placing them in development programmes—an approach that works for table tennis and diving but does not translate so well to team sports. “You don’t need an under-15 national team. You need thousands of under-15s playing,” says Joan Oliver, former boss of Barcelona, who now owns Beijing Institute of Technology Football Club in China’s second tier.
With qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup coming up, the government wants short cuts. Over the past three years China has started naturalising foreign footballers. On May 10th it named five, including three Brazilian-born forwards, to its squad. Mr Xi has called for greater self-reliance in China’s quest for global power. Football is a stark reminder that it still needs foreign imports. ■",2
1786," (CNN)The jury in the civil trial against the organizers of a two-day Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, finished their first day of deliberations without reaching a verdict. Judge Norman Moon sent the jury home and told them to come back Monday and be ready to start at 9 a.m.The Unite the Right rally was held on August 11 and 12 in 2017 to oppose the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. As the violence unfolded, it reached a tipping point when James Fields -- who was protesting the statue's removal -- drove his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.Fourteen people and 10 White supremacist and nationalist organizations were sued in a civil lawsuit by some rallygoers and others who argue they suffered life-altering injuries at the protest. The plaintiffs, who include town residents and counterprotesters injured in clashes, are seeking compensatory and statutory damages for the physical and emotional injuries they suffered due to the rally. They also contend rally organizers engaged in a conspiracy and planned the violence to ignite a race and religious war. Defense attorneys and two high-profile defendants who are representing themselves argued none of the plaintiffs had proven the defendants had organized racial violence.Closing arguments concluded Thursday -- sending the legal battle to the jury. The jurors got the verdict forms Friday morning and started deliberating. US District Judge Norman K. Moon said that after Friday court will run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ""Only time I change that if all the jurors agree and want to go beyond that,"" Moon said.The jury will decide in each instance whether a defendant is liable for damages. In a civil trial, plaintiffs' attorneys have to show a defendant is liable by a ""preponderance of evidence,"" Moon told jurors, meaning 50.1% or greater chance of the claim is true.To succeed, the plaintiffs must prove the existence of a conspiracy involving two or more people, according to instructions given to the jurors. Also, plaintiffs must prove that the conspiracy was partially motivated by ""animus"" toward Black or Jewish people or because the plaintiffs supported those communities and that such conspiracy aimed to deprive them of their right to be free from racially motivated violence, the jury instructions say.Finally, the plaintiffs must prove that at least one person in the conspiracy ""took an overt act"" in continuing the racial violence and that the plaintiffs were injured because of that act, according to the instructions.The plaintiffs who were hit by Fields' car are seeking $7 million to $10 million in compensatory damages while others are asking for $3 million to $5 million, according to one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, Roberta Kaplan. It doesn't matter that some defendants didn't know each other, plaintiffs' attorney saysA large team of powerful lawyers under the umbrella of the non-profit Integrity First for America are representing the plaintiffs in their civil case. On Thursday during closing arguments, attorneys for the plaintiffs told the jury that the defendants had prepared for the ""Battle of Charlottesville,"" and messages sent between them and their actions after the violence were proof of a conspiracy.Kaplan told the jurors that they should find the defendants liable ""under the law, under the facts and under common sense."" Another attorney for the plaintiffs, Karen Dunn, pointed to defendant Christopher Cantwell's involvement in the rally alleging, ""He was there because he had an enormous following of armed extremists. ... He could promote, facilitate and execute violence."" Dunn also demonstrated to jury how the rally organizers put out calls to get shields and bring other weapons, including flagpoles and pepper spray, which they referred to as ""gas."" She also showed messages from other White supremacists who support the idea that demonstrators in the street should be run over. ""This is reasonable foreseeability,"" said Dunn said, arguing that all the members are liable for this.""The evidence in this case is crystal clear that this plan went as intended,""  Dunn said.Dunn noted that many of the defendants claim they didn't know what was going on or that they didn't know each other, but ""that doesn't matter, they're still part of the conspiracy.""""This is about the use of force. This was about occupying space and that was the plan for the Battle of Charlottesville,"" Dunn said. Defense says they didn't initiate deadly violence James Kolenich, attorney for Jason Kessler and two other defendants, told the jury, ""Hearing all this testimony or hearing all this from the plaintiffs, I want you to say, 'So what.'""He said the horrific injuries that many of the plaintiffs suffered ""don't prove a conspiracy. And the plaintiffs never claimed they did.""Spencer, who is defending himself, said he was not part of a conspiracy because he never participated in chats on an app used by other defendants. Then, in a tense moment between Spencer and the judge, Spencer recalled then-President Donald Trump's infamous statement about the rally: ""There were good people on both sides."" But Moon told him that quote was never entered into evidence. Spencer said he agreed with the sentiment, ignoring the judge's orders.""There were some bad people on both sides,'' Spencer said, referring to antifa.The defense notably displayed less cohesion than the plaintiffs -- oftentimes shifting the blame for the violence, arguing they didn't like each other, taking snipes at one another and alleging they barely knew each other.They have said they did not initiate the deadly violence that ensued, arguing they were exercising their First Amendment right to protest. They also say there was no conspiracy, and the violence stemmed from law enforcement's failure to keep the opposing groups separated.",0
1787,"“WE’RE WORKING at the limit,” says Apostolos Tsalastras, treasurer of Oberhausen, a town in the Ruhr valley. Like many places in this region, Oberhausen sits on a vast debt pile, mostly accrued when the mines closed and the steel jobs went. Unemployment stands at 10.6%, almost twice the national rate. Last year Olaf Scholz, the SPD finance minister (and its chancellor-candidate), sought to relieve municipalities like Oberhausen of their old liabilities, but was thwarted by his CDU coalition partner. “It’s time for a fresh start,” pleads Mr Tsalastras. His town is locked in a vicious circle of declining investment, slumping tax revenue and a shrinking population.
A federal bail-out meant most municipalities avoided disaster last year. But by 2023 many will face a fiscal crunch, says Jens Südekum, economics professor at the University of Düsseldorf. The commercial taxes that are their main independent source of income are volatile, and covid-19 creates new demands. National laws limit their ability to cut current spending, one of Mr Tsalastras’s bugbears. That puts capital investment in the firing line.

The country’s 11,000-odd municipalities are responsible for a big chunk of public investment. The KfW, a state-backed development bank, puts the municipal-investment backlog at €149bn ($172bn), a number that has risen even as tax revenues pour in. School buildings account for nearly a third of the shortfall; roads just under a quarter. Endlessly delayed mega-projects like Berlin’s airport may have made the country a laughing stock, but it is rusting bridges, shaky phone signals and decrepit school toilets that are the staple of daily conversation.
Ask anyone in local government what the problem is, and the answer is always people. A report by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, which is linked to the SPD, finds a huge decrease in municipal staff over 30 years. Immigration has helped, but a quarter of posts remain unfilled, says Henrik Scheller, one of the authors. Planning and engineering are especially affected, and local governments struggle to compete with private firms. Two-thirds of municipalities expect it to get even harder to find town planners. Surveys find construction companies working at capacity. With such supply constraints, spending more without proper planning merely risks stoking inflation.
Bureaucracy and nimbyism play a role. Companies struggle with a patchwork of planning and building rules. Opponents delay public-infrastructure projects with endless litigation. The number of projects blocked by citizens’ initiatives has doubled since 2000. This is problematic for roads, railways and bridges. But it is a “real hurdle” to climate transformation, says Mr Scheller. The recently revised climate law mandates a reduction in carbon emissions of 65% from 1990 levels by 2030, and their net elimination 15 years later. The share of renewables in electricity production must also reach 65%. And overall demand for electricity for batteries to power electric cars, for heat pumps in buildings, and for “green” hydrogen to help decarbonise industry may rise by a quarter.
Agora Energiewende, a think-tank, estimates that Germany will have to install an extra 5GW of onshore wind power every year until 2030, and 7GW a year after that. In 2020 it managed just 1.4GW. A visit to Schleswig-Holstein shows how hard it will be. As far back as the early 1990s, wind power in this northern state began to revitalise what had been some of the poorest communities in western Germany. Today turbines dot the landscape. Schleswig-Holstein has 8.5GW of installed wind-power capacity, and produces 160% of the electricity it consumes from renewables. It can export the excess via new power lines, including to Scandinavia.
In December the state government published new rules for wind-farm construction, after a five-year moratorium imposed amid growing local tensions. The new rules set aside 2% of land for wind energy, but this may not be enough to meet wind-power targets. Add long waiting times for permits and other restrictions and these targets seem unattainable, says Marcus Hrach of the Kiel branch of Germany’s Wind Energy Association. Industry insiders despair at all the hoops they must jump through. “Few people here oppose wind power, but those who do have loud voices,” says Anton Rahlf, a frustrated wind-farm owner on Fehmarn, an island in Schleswig-Holstein.

Other states are even more restrictive. Rules to protect endangered species vary from state to state. A few years ago litigation, regulation and complex tendering slowed the construction of wind farms to a crawl, although 2021 has offered flickering hints at a revival. The mismatch between the federal government’s ambitions and the reality of local regulation, says Mr Hrach, will make it impossible for Germany to reach its commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
Another difficulty, says Alexander Reitzenstein from Das Progressive Zentrum think-tank, is constructing the power lines needed to transport electricity from the windy north to southern industrial states like Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. Local communities can be given a financial stake in wind farms, but that is harder to do for power lines simply transporting electricity. And under Germany’s federal system, states cannot be bossed around by the government in Berlin. “Lots of politicians who agree on climate in Berlin act differently when a line comes to their local community,” says Tim Meyerjürgens, chief operating officer of TenneT, an electricity-transmission operator, adding that the “salami-tactics” of regular legislative changes harm trust.
There is a near-consensus that the next government must do more to satisfy vast public-investment needs. The debate is over how. For some, tackling the country’s austerity bias is a priority. The debt brake now in the constitution limits opportunities for deficit spending. Critics of German tightfistedness are legion. The European Central Bank has long urged countries with “fiscal space” to exploit it. But all such suggestions have tended to run into an austere wall of fiscal orthodoxy.
Austerity excesses
Since 2013 the annual public-investment budget has risen from around €93bn to €137bn. This, argues Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, suggests the debt brake is “a bit of a straw man”. Better to tackle bureaucracy, capacity constraints and municipalities’ volatile revenues by changing the federal structure. But Sebastian Dullien at the IMK, a union-linked research group in Düsseldorf, counters that a guaranteed, long-term income stream of just the sort the debt brake inhibits might give municipal authorities, construction firms and engineers the planning certainty they need to reduce bottlenecks and increase staff.
Last year the government invoked an escape clause in the debt brake to finance corporate-support, furlough and other schemes during the pandemic, running up a deficit worth 4.2% of GDP. It will be bigger this year. The CDU/CSU wants to reimpose the debt brake once circumstances allow, probably in 2023. So does Mr Scholz, who presents himself as a safe pair of hands (plenty in his SPD would like a more expansive approach). The most interesting proposals come from the Greens, who want to add a “golden rule” allowing a debt-funded ten-year €500bn investment programme, focused on climate and digital infrastructure.
Yet the two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to change the constitution is a formidable hurdle. A more likely prospect is the establishment of public-investment companies, essentially off-budget special-purpose vehicles (SPVs), devoted to capital spending on, say, broadband provision in schools or upgrading railways. SPVs are legally complicated and democratically iffy, frets Mr Südekum. They would incur borrowing costs at a time when investors actually pay to lend to the federal government. But by not adding to the public-debt stock they offer a way of getting round the debt brake. The CDU/CSU chancellor-candidate, Armin Laschet, has flirted with what he calls Deutschlandfonds.
More radical ideas are afoot, notably a proposal by Dezernat Zukunft, a think-tank led by Philippa Sigl-Glöckner, a former finance-ministry official who calls SPVs “a declaration of defeat to silly fiscal rules”. Dezernat Zukunft wants to shift the fiscal debate away from arbitrary debt limits towards the goal of full employment. Low headline unemployment, the group notes, masks low labour-force participation rates among women and part-time workers seeking more hours.
Although the debt brake limits deficits to 0.35% of GDP, the calculations rely on a complex estimate of “potential” output. In the short run, Dezernat Zukunft reckons tweaks that require legal but not constitutional tampering could allow more deficit spending worth €50bn-60bn a year. In the long run Ms Sigl-Glöckner hopes to see off the debt brake for good. That such ideas now get a serious hearing suggests the fiscal debate has at last begun to shift. ■

1788,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",3
1789,"IN EARLY NOVEMBER justices at India’s Supreme Court turned their attention to an urgent plea. Arnab Goswami, a prominent journalist, had been dragged from his home and hurled into jail. Government ministers decried the arrest as an assault on free speech, demanding that Mr Goswami be granted bail. The hearing was brief. “If we as a constitutional court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will?” proclaimed one judge. That evening Mr Goswami swept out of Mumbai’s Taloja prison into a rapturous crowd. “This is a victory for the people of India!” he crowed.
But was it? To much of India’s commentariat, Mr Goswami’s case represented not a test of freedom so much as a test of power. On its current trajectory, by all evidence (as the chart on the next page illustrates), the world’s largest democracy is headed to a future that is less, not more free.

Mr Goswami is a controversial figure. He has pioneered a style of attack journalism that makes his nightly television programme look like a show trial from China’s Cultural Revolution. Its victims are often critics of government policy. They are typically reduced to a corner box as Mr Goswami swells into a finger-jabbing prosecutor, denouncing them as “antinational” or, worse, an agent of Pakistan.
What landed Mr Goswami in jail was not something he said, though his tirades against the Mumbai police have indeed enraged the local government, which happens to be opposed to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The journalist’s alleged crime involved a big unpaid debt to a decorator, who had left a suicide note blaming him, among others, for his fatal distress. “Abetment” to suicide remains an offence in India. The case had been closed in 2019, when the BJP still wielded power in Mumbai, and its reopening smacked of a vendetta.
So the court’s ruling was not surprising. What shocked was the speed of its intervention. Mr Goswami spent just a week in detention, and his case had hardly reached the lowest rung of courts, yet the country’s topmost judges ignored the court’s backlog of some 60,000 cases to schedule a bail hearing within a day of the anchor’s appeal. This is in a country where prisons hold twice as many inmates awaiting trial, some 330,000 people, as they do convicts.
A majority of these “undertrials” come from minority groups and a quarter have spent more than a year behind bars, reckons Leah Verghese, a law researcher. When Mr Modi clamped direct rule on the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year, thousands of its residents were detained. Out of more than 550 writs of habeas corpus such as Mr Goswami’s that Kashmiris filed, courts have disdained to look at all but a handful.
In the same week that Mr Goswami won his swift reprieve, Father Stan Swamy, an 83-year-old Jesuit priest who has championed rights for tribal peoples and is being held as an alleged Maoist terrorist, made a plea before a lower court. As he suffers from Parkinson’s disease and cannot hold a cup steady, lawyers requested that he be allowed to have a straw in his prison cell. The court postponed the hearing for 20 days.
Even more striking is the courts’ foot-dragging over constitutional questions. In 2017 Mr Modi slipped through parliament a controversial law that created “electoral bonds”, asserting that as a budgetary matter it need not be scrutinised by the upper house, which was not then in BJP control. The Supreme Court still has not examined the constitutionality of this innovation, which allows unlimited, anonymous donations to political parties. Other big questions its judges have yet to take up include the imposition last year of direct rule on Kashmir and some 140 legal petitions against the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019, which by inserting religion as a criterion for citizenship undermines the secular nature of the Indian state.
Sleepwalking into authoritarianism?
Slow, uneven and arbitrary justice are not new to India. Yet its courts have often tried to check executive power. It was a judge’s ruling that Indira Gandhi, perhaps India’s most powerful prime minister, had cheated in an election that prompted her in 1975 to plunge India into a 21-month Emergency, during which she threw opponents in jail and ruled by decree. Legal professionals now liken the current moment to that darkest period for Indian democracy. “This government has done so much damage to personal liberty,” says Ajit Prakash Shah, a former high-court judge. “But the courts, especially the Supreme Court, have watched this indiscriminate and violent trampling of dissent like mute spectators.”
It is not only the courts, alas, that seem eager to stay in step with the government. Many cogs in India’s institutional machinery are not merely complacent, but have grown complicit in a project that threatens to turn the country into a one-party state. At least during the Emergency the threat was clear, says Tarunabh Khaitan, vice-dean of law at Oxford University and author of a paper, “Killing a Constitution with a Thousand Cuts”, that details India’s institutional decay. “What we have now is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” he says. “There is no full-frontal big-ticket attack on democracy, but there are multiple, simultaneous attacks on all fronts…We are sleepwalking into authoritarianism.”
Of the ostensibly independent institutions that are now compliant, India’s police stand out. Despite individually humane and honest officers, the impression Indians hold of the force is that its main purpose is to protect the powerful and persecute the weak. A case in point is the Delhi police’s management of communal riots that racked parts of India’s capital for three days last winter, leaving 53 dead.

Top officers in the force, which before Mr Modi’s government stopped releasing statistics comprised just 2% Muslims in a city with a 13% Muslim minority, had been filmed standing next to a BJP politician at a rally where he threatened to attack protesters, mostly Muslims, holding a peaceful sit-in against the new citizenship law. During the violence, police were filmed throwing rocks and torturing captured Muslim youths. More than two-thirds of those beaten, shot and hacked to death were Muslim. Yet Delhi’s finest have declined to register complaints against BJP members for incitement. Their investigations have focused on a purported Islamist-Marxist conspiracy to foment unrest in order to embarrass Mr Modi at a time when he was hosting President Donald Trump.
An amendment made last year to the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), a draconian law from 1967 that allows the state to label and then ban groups as terrorist, now empowers the government to designate any individual as a terrorist. The state may hold suspects indefinitely with no right of bail, confiscate their property and implicate any associate as an accessory to terrorism. During India’s harsh lockdown to combat covid-19 last spring, police in Delhi quietly rounded up scores of youths alleged to have been involved in the riots, and charged many under the UAPA.
Having enjoyed a stranglehold on the Lok Sabha, parliament’s lower house, for six years, and more recently acquired control of the upper Rajya Sabha, Mr Modi’s government has passed a slew of other laws not only to expand its powers, but to dilute those of potential challengers. One thorn in its side has been a law from 2005 that upholds citizens’ right to obtain information (RTI) from state officials. Seen as a big advance for transparency in a country where mandarins remained aloof and unchallenged, the law created an independent commission to ensure that requests from the public receive a response. The number of requests runs at over 1m a year.

In 2019 the government amended the RTI law. It reduced the tenure and prestige of the role of the commission’s chief. Small wonder that the commission is rejecting a growing number of information requests from the public, citing “insufficient documentation”, even as the number of pending requests has swollen by 50%. Having frequently neglected to fill empty seats on the 11-person commission, the government in October tapped a journalist whose chief works are two books that glowingly laud the “Modi model” of government.
Such appointments are a prerogative of the executive, one that previous leaders have scarcely been shy of exercising. More unusual under Mr Modi has been his almost axiomatic choice of candidates with Hindu-nationalist credentials, often from his home state of Gujarat, and his insistence on inserting loyalists even into institutions that had been seen as sanctuaries from party politics. Twice Mr Modi has replaced heads of the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s respected central bank, after they expressed less than fulsome praise of his economic policies. As India’s latest comptroller and auditor-general (CAG), Mr Modi reportedly passed over seven senior secretaries from within the organisation and instead parachuted in a retired official from Gujarat. The CAG has a record of honest and incisive reporting, but has raised hackles by exposing government waste.
Modi operandi
In 2016 Mr Modi similarly ignored institutional precedent in the Indian army, lifting General Bipin Rawat over the heads of two senior officers to appoint him its top commander. Last year, following a change of rules that stretched the retirement age, General Rawat was promoted to chief of staff of India’s combined forces. The army maintains a tradition of keeping a distance from politics that makes it almost unique in its region, but observers have detected a growing tendency for officers to weigh in publicly on civilian matters, and retired soldiers whisper reproach against officers for “cosying up” to politicians.
Mr Modi has made a spectacle of his own commander-in-chief role as no other recent prime minister, and also minted electoral gold from pre-election military operations. Helpfully, India’s soldiers have remained silent at useful moments, too. As independent satellite evidence emerged this summer showing that Chinese forces had occupied strategic posts in territory claimed by India along remote sections of the countries’ border, the army steadfastly refused to comment on Indian government assertions that no land had been lost.
Even the impartiality of the Election Commission of India (ECI), with a sterling seven-decade record of managing the mammoth logistics of Indian votes, has come under scrutiny. During the 2019 general election, which Mr Modi won by a landslide, his opponents sharply protested when the prime minister and other top BJP leaders repeatedly escaped serious censure for issuing what amounted to communal dog whistles, whereas the ECI promptly sanctioned rival candidates for lesser infractions of its strict codes of conduct. One of the body’s three top commissioners did object, but was overruled. His family subsequently found itself being investigated for alleged tax evasion. The official quit the ECI before the end of his term.
Given that India continues to run elections that by most standards are admirably free and fair, it may seem churlish to voice fears for its democracy. After all, even as America’s presidential count was mired in controversy in early November, election officials in Bihar—India’s poorest state, with a population of 125m—managed to count the votes without a hitch in less than a day. Like so many others in recent years, that election was won fair and square by Mr Modi’s team, in Bihar’s case in alliance with a local party.
The BJP’s supporters scoff at the notion that its rise under Mr Modi has entailed any subversion of institutions or dilution of democracy. Such protests are merely sour grapes, insists Raghavan Jagannathan, editor of Swarajya, a right-wing magazine. “Our democracy is flawed, but it is a work in progress, not just about the people who are currently in power.” Modi apologists point to disturbing trends in states that are not ruled by the BJP. Kerala recently introduced a law to punish “offensive” speech by up to three years in prison (but withdrew it after heavy criticism). In Odisha, a family with connections to the BJP that owns a television channel critical of the local ruling party has found itself buried in lawsuits.
Indian politics is a game of hardball. The BJP is the world’s largest political machine, with many multiples the energy, organisational strength and financial backing of its rivals. It has a strong leader in Mr Modi, and a strong narrative, however unpalatable it is to many. This contrasts sharply with the vacillation of Congress, India’s previous dominant party. Led by a fading Gandhi dynasty, it has slowly disintegrated. Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of 23 Congress leaders who recently petitioned Sonia Gandhi, the party president, for sweeping changes, says its leadership has lost connection with people on the ground. Its organisational structure has “collapsed”. Indians who loathe Mr Modi are often just as disparaging of Rahul Gandhi, the party’s mediocre current figurehead.
Grand designs in Delhi
In the absence of a strong opposition at the centre, the most effective resistance to the BJP’s dominance lies in state capitals, as well in the press and more broadly in civil society. These bastions are all under heavy assault. Mr Modi’s fearsome chief lieutenant, Amit Shah, the home minister, has made no secret of his determination to topple Mamata Banerjee, a staunch and often vitriolic critic who has run the pivotal state of West Bengal since 2011, in state elections next year. Opposition parties holding slim majorities in other big states, including Rajasthan and Maharashtra, are acutely aware of the BJP’s capacity to “persuade” defectors to its side. This recently happened in Madhya Pradesh, where Mr Modi’s party unceremoniously unseated Congress after luring away a chunk of its deputies.

By leaning on the big conglomerates that dominate the mainstream media, by favouring outlets that share its ideology, such as Mr Goswami’s, and by flooding social media with agitprop, the BJP has largely marginalised critical voices in the press. In the past two months, new rules have curtailed the permitted level of foreign investment in online media and placed the entire sector under the authority of the broadcasting ministry. The moves appear to be aimed at getting a grip on one of the main remaining outlets for dissent, say editors at three of India’s increasingly popular news sites. One that specialised in hard-hitting investigative stories, HuffPost India, closed on November 24th.
Compliance regulations regarding foreign donations have already been used to shut down tens of thousands of NGOs. The most recent example is the local chapter of Amnesty International, an advocacy group for human rights. In September the government added onerous filing requirements and rules that forbid larger charities from funding smaller ones.
Mr Khaitan, the Oxford law professor, is not alone in warning that the BJP’s one-sided advantage is subtly changing the nature of India’s game. “We do not have a level playing field any more,” he says. “What we are getting is not quite a one-party state, but certainly a hegemonic state.” The trajectory resembles that in other democracies, such as Hungary, Poland and Turkey, where autocracy is on the rise (see chart).

Mr Modi is now taking a keen interest in reshaping Delhi, India’s capital, in more imperial fashion. Following an opaque and hasty process that to no surprise ended with the choice of Mr Modi’s own favourite architect, a fellow Gujarati, as chief designer, the city’s Central Vista, a 3km-long avenue of lawns not unlike the National Mall in Washington, is going under the knife. It will be flanked by ten giant, identical government office buildings. The project foresees the building of a new, expanded parliament, big enough to seat double the 545 MPs that currently sit in the lower house. The old building will become a “Museum of Democracy”. And, naturally, there will be a bigger, fancier residence and office for the prime minister himself.
Another sign of Mr Modi’s direction of travel can be detected in the differing “read-outs” after his congratulatory phone call to President-elect Joe Biden. Among the things that Mr Biden’s team said the two had discussed was a shared commitment to “strengthening democracy, at home and abroad”. In the version from Mr Modi’s office, that bit was left out. ■",2
1790,"FOR MOST of its modern history, Hong Kong had no time for nostalgia. Little remains of the Victorian mansions or art-deco towers that once flanked its harbour. The city was built by unsentimental people in a hurry: traders and shippers and British opium peddlers turned merchant-grandees; imperial officials as tough as the granite of Victoria Peak; wave upon wave of Chinese migrants. 20th-century elites replaced domed and colonnaded landmarks with towers of concrete, glass and steel, destroying their heritage in the name of progress and profit. Only in recent years did the pace of destruction slow, as growing civic pride saw a few old sites preserved.
Today’s ruling elite is bent on further demolition. Its mainland Chinese envoys and Hong Kong officials who look to Beijing for their orders have earmarked a breathtaking list of Hong Kong institutions for dismantling and replacement.

It starts with democratic elections. China’s autocrats were appalled when, after months of demonstrations in 2019 against a proposed new extradition law, pro-democracy politicians won a landslide victory in elections for Hong Kong’s district councils that November. The result gave Beijing reason to fear a similar drubbing in elections to the somewhat more powerful Legislative Council (Legco), set for September 2020. Those elections were duly postponed, with pro-democracy politicians barred from standing and accused of subversion for saying they would oppose the government.
On March 11th, far to the north in a smoggy Beijing, delegates to the National People’s Congress, China’s pliant legislature, approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s election laws by a margin of 2,895 votes (there was one abstention). Branded “Patriots administering Hong Kong”, the amendments will effectively bar avowed opponents of the Hong Kong government or critics of China’s Communist Party from seeking election to anything.
Candidates for elected office are not the only ones to whom such conditions will apply. China and its local allies are demanding all public officials should pass stricter patriotism tests. Over time that will leave less room for the proudly independent judges, some of them foreigners, who currently make Hong Kong’s courts some of the most trusted in Asia. The rule of law in Hong Kong will be remodelled.
A national-security law imposed last June in response to the protests of 2019 is limiting liberties such as the freedom of speech, a free press and the right to peaceful protest. Almost 50 democratic activists were recently charged under the law for holding a primary election before running for seats in Legco. Others have been arrested for holding up banned slogans or for calling for sanctions against China.
In February officials unveiled a new patriotic curriculum to teach children “a sense of belonging to the country” and “affection for the Chinese people”, a response to the pride schools in the city have taken in teaching Hong Kong children to think critically. Children as young as six will be asked to memorise offences criminalised by the national-security law, including subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. Chinese officials and their local allies are convinced that years of liberal education have poisoned Hong Kong’s young minds, leaving them easy prey for foreign troublemakers.
The totemic pledge that Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong would be guided by the principle of “one country, two systems” lies in ruins. The formula, coined in the 1980s by Deng Xiaoping, China’s paramount leader, spoke to Hong Kong’s unique value as a gateway to a vastly richer and more advanced Western world from which China could learn, a value which justified exceptionalism. Guaranteeing that Hong Kong’s capitalist way of life would continue for at least 50 years after the Union Flag was lowered was a way to keep that gateway open without seeing capital and know-how rush out through it.
The China ruled by Xi Jinping today still sees benefits in preserving Hong Kong as an international financial centre. Operating outside the mainland’s strict capital controls, Hong Kong issues its own hard currency, the Hong Kong dollar, that is freely convertible against the American dollar, and offers Chinese firms access to some of the deepest pools of capital on Earth. But Hong Kong’s access to Western know-how, as opposed to money, holds less interest for party chiefs.
Changing the guard
Mr Xi and others repeatedly declare that “the East is rising and the West is in decline.” Successive crises, from the financial crash of 2008 to the covid-19 pandemic, have left Chinese leaders increasingly confident that their model of techno-authoritarian state capitalism is superior to the partisan squabbling, short-termism and selfish individualism they see in the democratic West. When officials talk of preserving “one country, two systems” they are talking of different Chinese systems, not paying tribute to a discarded Western one. China’s rulers are not impressed when Western governments suggest that losing the hearts and minds of 7.5m Hong Kongers is a calamity. Throughout 2019, officials in Beijing growled that they served the interests of 1.4bn Chinese.
They are especially scornful of protests from America, Britain and other Western powers that the changes being imposed on Hong Kong are a betrayal of undertakings to preserve Hong Kong’s way of life that it agreed to before the 1997 handover. Chinese officials and state-backed scholars call the pre-handover Sino-British Declaration a “historical document” and accuse Western critics of colonial nostalgia. To focus on China’s breaking of old promises, though, is to risk missing the sheer scale of its ambitions for Hong Kong's future.
Talk to Chinese officials and state-backed scholars, as well as to pro-government politicians in Hong Kong, and they will insist that neutralising the opposition is a necessary step towards a greater goal: repairing flaws that render Hong Kong’s political and economic systems structurally unsound through a wholesale remodelling of its institutions and society. What is more, they are sure that Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre will generate such profits that Western financial institutions will rush to invest, rendering the grumbling of foreign governments irrelevant.
They may well be right. Many foreign executives reject the notion that political repression is pushing global investors away. On the contrary, a surge of global capital seeking to reach Chinese markets has drawn more investment to Hong Kong over the past year. Cambridge Associates, a large investment group, said on March 8th that it would open an office in the city. The race to enter China has forced some managers to “turn money away”, says a managing partner at a global law firm.
Today’s Hong Kong stock exchange is utterly changed from that of the turn of the century. Then local companies dominated. Now the top traded companies are Chinese giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan and Xiaomi. There are now more than 2,000 mainland mutual funds that can invest in Hong Kong, a number which increased 268% in 2020. A wave of mainland cash has followed. Chinese investors brought net inflows of HK$672bn into the Hong Kong market last year through an investment channel called “stock connect”, 170% up on the year before. The inflows have made the city’s old corporate stars irrelevant. “Fuck them,” says an executive at a Chinese-state-backed investment manager. “They are a drag on the index.”

The HKEX posted a 23% increase in profits for last year, boosted by a number of Chinese initial public offerings. But the fat fees associated with such successes flow mostly to Chinese groups; the financial sector’s success is divorced from the rest of the city’s economy. Many local companies have struggled through the past two years of protests and pandemic. Swire, a 205-year-old, British-headquartered conglomerate which was a pillar of Hong Kong’s old economy, said on March 11th that underlying profits for its property unit fell by 47% in 2020. One investment manager who was born in Hong Kong and works for a local firm says the boom in Chinese business has made him and many around him rich. Yet he sees few opportunities for the city’s youth outside of working for Chinese financial-services groups.
Some of the mainland-born, Western-educated bankers in the upper echelons of Hong Kong banks actively welcome the national-security law. During the protests of 2019 they feared being attacked by locals in the streets for speaking Mandarin, rather than the local tongue, Cantonese. Many are relieved to see order restored to the streets, even with an iron fist. Tougher policing does not affect Westerners, says a mainland financier. His foreign clients in Hong Kong laugh about the anxious memos they receive from bosses at home, asking about political developments. “It doesn’t really affect their life, right? They’re not going on the street to try to demonstrate against the government.”
Class against class
Despite the success of the financial sector Beijing longs to diversify Hong Kong’s economy, says the mainland financier. There are two reasons. One is an ideological distaste for high finance among party bosses who see the proper role of banks as supporting the real economy by lending to businesses that make and sell tangible products. Maintaining Hong Kong as an international financial centre is perhaps at best “a necessary evil” for Mr Xi and his close associates, says the financier—a pragmatic way to allow Chinese firms to raise foreign funds while the mainland maintains capital and currency controls.
The other reason is real concern about Hong Kong’s income inequality, which is among the most extreme in the developed world, and the cruelly high costs of housing in the territory. Officials in Beijing deny all blame for an unhappy Hong Kong and are impatient with Westerners who cast Hong Kong’s discontent as a clash between a freedom-loving public and despotic rulers: Marx has taught them that all politics is rooted in economic forces. Their favoured scapegoats are foreign saboteurs and a small number of Hong Kong-Chinese oligarchs who have dominated the city’s property and retail sectors for generations.
Western critics focus on the blow that the new election law lands on pro-democracy parties. Chinese observers are equally interested in its changes to the Election Committee, which will give Beijing-appointed members the power to dilute the influence of the property tycoons. “It’s shameful for an economy as rich as Hong Kong to have that many people living without basic human dignity in terms of housing conditions. And that sentiment is shared extensively in Beijing, in the leadership,” says the mainland financier.
He predicts a campaign to build large amounts of public rented housing. This could be facilitated by forcing local tycoons to release some of the territory’s copious undeveloped land, a resource they are accused of hoarding so as to increase the value of their property holdings by creating scarcity. Beyond that assault on Hong Kong’s old-school business bosses, a wider campaign is brewing to craft a new “capitalism with Hong Kong characteristics”. The ultimate target is the city’s whole laissez-faire, low-tax economic model, which some officials in Beijing grumble has been elevated to an almost religious creed by local oligarchs, foreign business leaders and civil servants.
National leaders do not hide their exasperation with the low calibre of many who enter Hong Kong politics today. At the same time as the election law changes were being passed in Beijing, the central authorities sent what was widely seen as a warning along these lines in the form of a Hong Kong newspaper op-ed by Tian Feilong, a Beijing-based law professor and member of a government-backed think-tank, the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies. Mr Tian wrote that national leaders do not want to see rubber-stamp loyalists running the city.
In an interview in Beijing, Mr Tian expands on that thought. The central government wants to set patriotism as a “baseline”, so that Hong Kong politicians can stop dwelling on questions about who is a patriot or not and begin to compete on the basis of their policies. Patriots should love their country, says Mr Tian, but only need to respect the Communist Party. The professor insists that moderate democrats, “once they have adjusted” to the new rules, are welcome to seek election to “supervise and criticise” the government as a form of loyal opposition.
It is less clear where calls for loyalty leave judges from Britain, Australia and Canada whose part-time service on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeals is an indispensable source of international business confidence. Some pro-government lawyers describe a legal system in which commercial cases and political cases will be handled on different tracks, with more deference from judges in political cases. Mr Tian says that foreign judges will not be pushed out. But he concedes that the principle of “patriots governing Hong Kong” will create more cases that are not suitable for foreign judges and expose them to discomforting political pressure. “The rules on that”, he says delicately, “may need further clarification.”
As for the hundreds of thousands who joined the protest movement, Mr Tian trusts that education reforms will produce a new generation of youngsters who understand China and love it. He has blunter advice for those too old for school and stubbornly wedded to liberal values. “I think they will experience a painful psychological transition, in other words, they will have to re-educate themselves.”
All the sad mercenaries
Even among some who support the government, this is a moment of painful introspection. A member of Legco elected by one of the “functional constituencies” that represent a specific business sector expresses shame at his role as a reliable vote for the government. “I’m a mercenary for the rich,” he says. Other loyalists are more bullish about managed democracy, seeing a moment to bring technocrats into public office. Maria Tam Wai-Chu, a senior member of the National People’s Congress from Hong Kong, points to the global technology giants which have transformed Shenzhen, the gleaming megapolis that lies just across the border from Hong Kong, and laments that: “We are so backwards here in Hong Kong.” She would like to see technology experts or business executives appointed or elected to Legco, to help the city confront the 21st century. She scoffs at foreigners who worry that those new legislators must be patriots. British MPs swear allegiance to their monarch, she notes.
Regina Ip, a law-and-order conservative and pro-establishment member of Legco, talks of Hong Kong becoming an “epistocracy”, the technical term for a society governed by experts and the highly educated. At the same time, she admits, the anger and discontent seen during the protests in 2019 “has gone underground, it has not gone away”. She calls for patriotic education but also social-welfare policies to generate housing and jobs for the young. “We must have more redistribution,” she says.

A palpable sense of sadness hangs over the territory. Politics has divided workplaces, friends and families. If winning over a majority of Hong Kongers proves slow work, leaders in Beijing may be tempted to play social engineer and craft a more biddable Hong Kong, whether by blurring its borders with the mainland or shipping in new people. More than 1m mainlanders have moved into Hong Kong since 1997. Loyalist politicians in Hong Kong urge young people to try studying and working in the booming mainland next-door, or join the Chinese army.
Though emigration is a constant topic of conversation, an offer of a new fast track to residence in Britain was taken up by just 7,000 Hong Kongers between July 2020 and January of this year. “I think the elites won’t leave because they live well and make so much money. If other people choose to leave, it won’t be difficult for Beijing to find new middle-class professionals to replace them,” says Mrs Ip. “China does not lack people.”
The democratic world has every right to be shocked by the demolition of “One country, two systems” and to respond. America has not lost interest in Hong Kong, which is seen in Washington, DC, as a proof of China’s intolerance for dissent. Last October it imposed banking and other sanctions on the chief executive and nine other mainland and Hong Kong officials accused of undermining the territory’s autonomy, in breach of long-standing Chinese commitments. The territory’s chief executive is now paid in cash, her home filling up with bank notes. On March 16th Joe Biden’s administration imposed bank sanctions on 24 more officials. But the most dramatic steps, involving changes to American policies that treat the Hong Kong dollar as a fully convertible currency, have not been taken, not least because the resulting pain would be felt worldwide.
Western governments are not going to deter the demolition. The old Hong Kong is gone. Judge Mr Xi’s China by what it builds in its place. ■

1791,"All flights to and from the Spanish island of La Palma have been cancelled due to ash from the Cumbre Vieja volcano, which has been erupting since September.
Twenty national flights were cancelled on Saturday, said a spokesman for the Spanish airport authority.
Air travel to the island in the Spanish-owned Canaries archipelago, off the Atlantic coast of North Africa, has been regularly affected since the volcano erupted on September 19 for the first time in 50 years.
No one has died in the eruption on the island of 85,000 people, but it caused serious damage and led to the evacuation of more than 7,000 people, with some buildings swallowed by lava flows.
More than 1,000 hectares of land and more than 2,600 buildings were destroyed, according to the European geospatial measurement system, Copernicus.
Provisional damage was estimated on Friday at nearly 900 million euros ($1 billion), according to the region.
During a visit on Friday and Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced new aid for the economy and infrastructure of the island, which depends in particular on tourism and banana cultivation.
The island of La Palma is experiencing its third eruption in a century, after those of the San Juan volcano in 1949 and the Teneguia in 1971.
Scientists have said the latest eruption could last up to three months.
This is not the first time all flights to and from the island have been cancelled, with the same happening earlier this month on November 3.
With flights cancelled, some tourists who went to the island on a sightseeing trip to witness the eruption had to wait in long lines for ferries to leave the island.
Madrid resident, Patricia Privado, 30, described the erupting volcano earlier this month as 'a spectacle of nature'.
'It is worth it,' she said of her trip. 'To hear it roar, to see how the lava falls. You have to experience it.'
Leon Pena, 65, said he came from the nearby island of Fuerteventura to see what he called 'something unique'.
Both said they knew flight cancellations were a possibility, but they didn't let that deter them from traveling to La Palma.
They also saw their trips as a way of supporting the local economy by spending money on the island, which has suffered greatly from the eruption.
Earlier this month, residents were questioning where financial aid promised by the Spanish government was.
In October, the government pledged 225 million euros in aid, and by the start of November, some 21 million euros of that has been disbursed.
Sanchez said at the time his administration would transfer a further 18.8 million euros for the agriculture and fishing industries and 5 million euros to tackle the 'social aspect' of the crisis.
The volcano's constant roar and numerous earthquakes have also kept locals on edge, and earlier in the month fears were again raised over possible toxic gas being released into the air as the second stream of lava reached the Atlantic ocean.
The stream of molten rock , which began erupting in mid-September, reached the water near the popular surf spot of Los Guirres beach on November 1.
A video uploaded by Spain's Geology and Mining Institute at the time showed rivers of molten rock sliding into the sea and large rocks rolling down a cliff, causing a cone of debris to emerge from the waterline.
Unlike the first time lava reached the ocean - just over a month ago - authorities said there was no need for residents to stay indoors.
'New confinements are not necessary because the populations are far away from the point of contact with the sea that occurred last night,' an emergency services spokesperson told Reuters earlier this month.
Few people live in the affected area, which is mostly banana plantations.
Early on in the eruption authorities had feared that the reaction between the superheated lava and seawater could unleash powerful explosions and set off toxic gas clouds.
During the last major eruption on the island, some 50 years ago, a man died after inhaling such gases.
La Palma's council said on Tuesday that seismic activity around the eruption site, as well as emissions of toxic sulphur dioxide, had been decreasing and the air quality remained good across most of the island.",-2
1792,"The share prices of China’s tech giants swooned after regulators stepped up their offensive against the industry. The   focus this time is on Didi       Global, a ride-hailing service, which was ordered to pull its app from app stores because it is being   investigated for a non-specified misuse of users’ personal data. Only a few days before, Didi had completed a   successful IPO in New York raising $4.4bn, the most for a Chinese company since Alibaba, which is also   in the cross-hairs of officials in Beijing for becoming too powerful.
Another way that China is trying to defang its tech tigers is by cracking down on  Chinese     companies that have listed their shares in America or intend to do so, this week promulgating a broad review of   the rules that allow them to tap foreign capital markets. China’s actions increase the uncertainties for investors.   Those who piled in to Didi’s New York offering saw the value of their stock drop by a quarter in subsequent days.

A bidding war was on the verge of breaking out for Morrisons. Britain’s fourth-biggest supermarket retailer has accepted a   £6.3bn ($8.7bn) proposal from Fortress Investment, but other American private-equity firms are circling. This comes   amid the fastest pace of private-equity buyouts in Britain for two decades, which some decry as a raid on companies   that are undervalued on London’s stockmarket.
Wise, a company providing     currency and banking services, avoided an IPO and listed its shares directly on the London Stock   Exchange, a novelty for the City. The successful flotation of the fintech was a relief for the LSE   following the disastrous IPO of Deliveroo in March, which left some wondering if tech firms should   avoid the bourse.
A consortium of investors in infrastructure submitted a proposal to take over Sydney airport.   At A$22bn ($17bn) it is one of Australia’s biggest-ever buyout offers.
Questions were raised about the future of OPEC after the cartel and its partners failed to reach an   agreement on increasing oil production. Saudi Arabia and Russia want to raise output, but they were blocked by the   United Arab Emirates, which wants the way its output quota is calculated to change. The White House hopes for a   compromise. Without a deal, oil prices will rise, pumping up petrol prices and other inflationary pressures, hot   political topics in America.
Officials from America and the European Union held talks on the EU’s proposed levy on digital   companies, which America says unfairly targets its tech giants. Instead America is championing the push for a global corporate tax of at least 15%, which 130 countries agreed to on July 1st. Ireland was one   of only nine countries that did not sign up.
A ransomware attack targeting users of network-management software made by Kaseya, an American   firm, hit hundreds of medium-sized companies in the United States and elsewhere. It was the most widespread incident   in a number of recent cyberattacks on business and governments. REvil, a ransomware gang thought to be   operating in Russia, said it was responsible and demanded $70m in bitcoin to provide a universal decryptor that would   unlock the affected computers.
Dozens of American states sued Google, alleging that the firm overcharges companies that sell   software through its Play Store. A ruling in a similar (private) lawsuit against Apple is expected soon.
The Mexican government again signalled its dislike of private investment in the energy industry by awarding to Pemex, the state oil company, control of an oilfield that had been discovered by a private   consortium. The consortium, headed by Talos, which is based in Texas, has invested $325m in the   Zama field, one of Mexico’s biggest oil finds to date. Pemex, the world’s most indebted oil company, may lack the   technical expertise to exploit the field.
The Pentagon scrapped a $10bn upgrade to its cloud-computing systems, saying it no longer met its needs. The Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure project (JEDI) had been bogged down in   legal uncertainty ever since the contract was awarded to Microsoft, after Donald Trump let it be known that he did not   want Amazon to get the job (Mr Trump has a long-standing feud with Jeff Bezos). The Defence Department now wants an   entirely new system and will solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft.
Heading for the cloud

Jeff Bezos stepped down as Amazon’s chief executive (he is now the   executive chairman). Mr Bezos still owns around 11% of the company he founded in 1994 and had led as   CEO ever since. The boost to Amazon’s share price when news broke that it would once again bid for   lucrative work at the Pentagon added $8.4bn to his personal fortune, taking it to $211bn, according to Bloomberg.",2
1793,"Energy prices have replaced Covid as the main worry for almost half of British families, an exclusive new poll reveals today.
Some 49 per cent of voters polled say that the recent surge in gas and electricity bills is more of a concern that the pandemic, as the cold of winter approaches.
A third (33 per cent) surveyed by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for MailOnline admitted that they were keeping the heating turned off in cold weather in an attempt to lower their bills. 
Four-in-10 said they were turning the heating down, with the same amount saying they were wearing more clothes indoors instead.
And also a third (30 per cent) said they were cutting down on other spending as they keep an eye on their outgoings. 
It comes the day after it was claimed the average British family is more than £1,000-a-year worse off due to soaring inflation.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rose sharply from 3.1 per cent in September to 4.2 per cent last month, which is the highest level since December 2011.  
The bigger-than-expected rise in the cost of living comes amid surging gas and electricity prices, with regulator Ofgem last month increasing the energy price cap by 12 per cent. But the figures also show sharp fuel costs rises and inflation building across food, household goods and hospitality as supply chain disruption takes its toll. 
With households spending an average of £508.50 a week on all areas in the financial year ending 2020 according to the ONS, Labour said this new CPI rate has seen the outlay go up by £21 a week, £93 a month or £1,111 a year.
The Party added that the Office for Budget Responsibility said last month that it expected CPI inflation to average 4 per cent next year, a figure which would leave the average household spending £1,058 more a year.
Experts said today when inflation is combined with the effects of recent tax changes such as the new social care levy and personal allowance freeze, such big price increases will have a major impact on living standards.
Interest rates look set to rise before Christmas after last month's bigger-than-expected leap in the cost of living.
This has fuelled expectations that policymakers will act next month to cool rampant inflation.
Most economists are forecasting that rates will rise to 0.25 per cent in December from their all-time low of 0.1 per cent as pressure mounts on the Bank of England to rein in inflation.
A mounting cost of living crisis in the UK has seen prices rise across the board - for energy, fuel, food, cars, furniture and eating out.
Inflation has reached levels not seen for nearly a decade in the UK as the global economy reopens and amid mounting supply chain disruption.
The Bank warned earlier this month it may have to increase rates in the ""coming months"" as it forecast inflation peaking at 5 per cent next April. 
It held off from an increase at the November meeting to assess how the jobs market was holding up after the end of furlough.
Robust jobs data on Tuesday showed another 160,000 workers were added to UK payrolls in October and no large uptick in redundancies, despite furlough coming to a close on September 30.
This, coupled with inflation coming in at a higher than forecast 4.2 per cent for October, is widely expected to see the Bank raise rates at its next meeting on December 16.",-2
1794,"“IT’S LIKE TASERING an elderly person who’s already on a pacemaker,” says a British newspaper boss of the newsprint market, where prices have risen by over 50% in a matter of months. The cost of paper that feeds into presses around the world is rising to record highs, pushing up expenses for newspapers from Mumbai to Sydney. When times were good, before ads shifted online, newspapers had a supportive partnership with paper mills. As ads departed and circulations fell, relations became more transactional. They are now at the shouting stage.
Paper mills had the worst of it for years as newspapers reduced pagination, went wholly digital or shut for good. The papers were able to hammer down the cost of newsprint from firms fighting for business as demand declined. Price-taking paper mills suffered in silence. Many hesitated to shut massive machines costing hundreds of millions of dollars.

That hesitance has disappeared; mills are taking out newsprint capacity and diversifying. Norske Skog, a Norwegian pulp and paper firm, said in June it would close its 66-year-old Tasman Mill in New Zealand, for example. Many mills are converting machines to make packaging for e-commerce. UPM, a Finnish firm, announced this year the sale of its Shotton newsprint mill in Wales to a Turkish maker of containerboard and packaging. For JCS Volga, a Russian mill, newsprint used to account for 70% of production; now half of what it makes is packaging. The mills “moved from being price takers to being capable co-participants in a declining market,” says Tim Woods of IndustryEdge, a research firm for Australia and New Zealand’s forestry and paper industries.
The pandemic, with people working from home, meant even fewer newspaper purchases, which depressed demand for newsprint again and increased the pain for paper suppliers. In the past 24 months European mills have responded by shutting almost a fifth of their newsprint capacity, says a buyer for a large British newspaper group.
Then economies reopened. Newsprint demand shot up. That, combined with much reduced capacity and coupled with soaring energy prices, has resulted in a price shock. Particularly controversial are energy surcharges that some paper suppliers are seeking to pass on. Newspaper firms reckon this amounts to breaking contracts. European newspapers will have to pay newsprint prices that are 50-70% higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared with the year before. As for their counterparts in Asia and Oceania, they are facing prices around 25% to 45% above their usual level. Kenya’s Nation Media Group is paying around $840 per tonne, compared with $600 at most in the past, says Dorine Ogolo, a procurement manager at the firm. North American prices went up earlier, and more gradually; contracts are fixed monthly rather than half-yearly. But there, too, newsprint prices are 20-30% higher in 2021 than in 2020.
Germany’s print and media industry association has warned that mills are going to force newspapers to dump paper editions, hurting each other in the process. “It’s about the famous branch that both of them are sitting on,” it said recently. But mills can sell packaging instead. “We’re not going to save the publishing industry by being unprofitable ourselves,” says a mill executive in North America.
For some publishers, price rises will wipe out profits. They will need to do further restructuring involving axing titles and layoffs. Iwan Le Moine of EMGE, a British paper-industry consultancy, expects a big increase in 2022 of the number of papers that shut compared with a typical year. That will lower demand and nudge the market back towards equilibrium. But newspapers will have more hard conversations about paper, full stop, says Douglas McCabe of Enders Analysis, a research firm. More digital adrenaline is one possible riposte to the paper mills’ tasers. ■

1795,"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub
SELF-STYLED visionaries and people particularly fond of their pyjamas have for decades been arguing that a lot of work done in large shared offices could better be done at home. With covid-19 their ideas were put to the test in a huge if not randomised trial. The preliminary results are now in: yes, a lot of work can be done at home; and what is more, many people seem to prefer doing it there.
This does not, in itself, mean the end of the non-home office. It does mean that there is a live debate to be had. Some companies appear relaxed about a domestic shift. On August 28th Pinterest, a social-media firm, paid $90m to end a new lease obligation on office space near its headquarters in San Francisco to create a “more distributed workforce”. Others seem to be against it. Also that month, Facebook signed a new lease on a big office in Manhattan. Bloomberg is reportedly offering a stipend of up to £55 ($75) a day to get its workers back to its building in London. Governments, on which some of the burden will fall if the pandemic persists, are taking a similar tack, encouraging people “back to work”—by which they mean “back to the office”.

They face a difficult task. For working from home seems to have suited many white-collar employees. As lockdowns have eased, people have gone out into the world once more: retail spending has jumped across the rich world while restaurant reservations have sharply risen. Yet many continue to shun the office, even as schools reopen and thus make it a more feasible option for working parents. The latest data suggest that only 50% of people in five big European countries spend every work-day in the office (see chart 1). A quarter remain at home full-time.

This may be due to the residual fear of covid-19 and the inconvenience of reduced-capacity offices. Until social-distancing guidance ends, offices cannot work at full steam. The average office can work with 25-60% of its staff while maintaining a two-metre (six-foot) distance between workers. Offices which span more than five floors rely on lifts; the queues for access, when only two people are allowed inside one, can stretch around the block.
Some offices are trying to make themselves safer places to work. The managers of a new skyscraper in London, 22 Bishopsgate, have switched off its recirculated air-conditioning. Others have installed hand-sanitising stations and put up plastic barriers. But even if offices are safer, it can still be hard to get there. Many employees do not want to or are discouraged from using public transport—and one-quarter of commuters in New York City live more than 15 miles (24km) from the office, too far to walk or cycle.

However it also appears to be the case that working from home can make people happier. A paper published in 2017 in the American Economic Review found that workers were willing to accept an 8% pay cut to work from home, suggesting it gives them non-monetary benefits. Average meeting lengths appear to decline (see chart 2). And people commute less, or not at all. That is great for wellbeing. A study from 2004 by Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University and colleagues found that commuting was among the least enjoyable activities that people regularly did. Britain’s Office for National Statistics has found that “commuters have lower life satisfaction...lower levels of happiness and higher anxiety on average than non-commuters” (see article).

The working-from-home happiness boost could, in turn, make workers more productive. In most countries the average worker reports that, under lockdown, she got more done than she would have in the office. In the current circumstances, however, it is hard to be sure whether home-working or office-working is more efficient. Many people, particularly women, have had to work while caring for children who would normally be in school. That might make it seem as though working from home was less productive than it could theoretically be (ie, when the kids were in school).
Tumble outta bed into the kitchen
But there are lockdown-specific effects which create the opposite bias, making work-from-home seem artificially productive. During lockdown workers may have upped their game for fear of being let go by their company—evidence from America suggests that more than half of workers are worried about losing their job due to the outbreak. A separate problem is that most studies under lockdown have relied on workers to self-report their productivity, and the data generated in this way tend not to be very reliable.
Research published before the pandemic provides a clearer picture. A study in 2015 by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and his colleagues looked at Chinese call-centre workers. They found that those who worked from home were more productive (they processed more calls). One-third of the increase was due to having a quieter environment. The rest was due to people working more hours. Sick days for employees plummeted. Another study, looking at workers at America’s Patent and Trademark Office, found similar results. A study in 2007 from America’s Bureau of Labour Statistics found that home-workers are paid a tad more than equivalent office workers, suggesting higher productivity.
The experience of lockdown has simply accelerated pre-existing trends, thinks Harry Badham, the developer of 22 Bishopsgate. That may be an understatement. Although the share of people regularly working from home was rising before the pandemic, absolute numbers remained small (see chart 3). According to one view, the fact that office-working was so dominant until recently reveals that it must be more efficient than home-based work both for firms and for workers. By this logic the success of a country’s emergence from lockdown can be measured by how many people are back at their desks.

But there is another interpretation. This says that home-working is actually more efficient than office-work, and that the glory days of the office are gone. The office, after all, came into being when the world of work involved processing lots of paper. The fact that it remained so dominant for so long may instead reflect a market failure. Before covid-19 the world may have been stuck in a “bad equilibrium” in which home-work was less prevalent than it should have been. The pandemic represents an enormous shock which is putting the world into a new, better equilibrium.
Brent Neiman of the University of Chicago suggests three factors which prevented the growth of home-working before now. The first relates to information. Bosses simply did not know whether clustering in an office was essential or not. The past six months have let them find out. The second relates to co-ordination: it may have been difficult for a single firm unilaterally to move to home-working, perhaps because its suppliers or clients would have found it strange. The pandemic, however, forced all firms who could do so to shift to home-working all at once. Amid this mass migration, people were less likely to look askance at companies which did so.
The third factor is to do with investment. The large fixed costs associated with moving from office- to home-based work may have dissuaded firms from trying it out. Evidence from surveys suggests that firms have in recent months spent big on equipment such as laptops to enable staff to work from home; this is one reason why global trade has held up better than expected since the pandemic began (see article). Such investments are made at the household level too. In many rich countries the market for single-family houses is stronger than for apartments. This suggests that people are looking for extra space, possibly for a dedicated home office.
Pour yourself a cup of ambition
The extent to which home-working remains popular long after the pandemic has passed will depend on a bargain between companies and workers. But it will also depend on whether companies embrace or reject the controversial theory that working from an office might actually impede productivity. Since the 1970s researchers who have studied physical proximity (ie, the distance employees need to travel to engage in a face-to-face interaction) have disagreed on the question of whether it facilitates or inhibits collaboration. The argument largely centres on the extent to which the bringing-together of people under one roof promotes behaviour conducive to new ideas, or whether doing so promotes idle chatter.
Such uncertainty is exemplified by a study in 2017 by Matthew Claudel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and his colleagues. Their study looked at papers and patents produced by MIT researchers and the geographical distribution of those researchers. In doing so, they found a positive relationship between proximity and collaboration. But when they looked at the buildings of MIT, they found little statistical evidence for the hypothesis that “centrally positioned, densely populated and multi-disciplinary spaces would be active hotspots of collaboration”. In other words, proximity can help people come up with new ideas, but they do not necessarily need to be in an office to do so.
However, not everything about working from home is pleasurable. In July a study from economists at Harvard, Stanford and New York University found that the average workday under lockdown was nearly 50 minutes longer than it was before, and that people became more likely to send emails after work hours. There is also wide variation between workers in how much they enjoy working from home. Leesman, a workforce consultancy, has surveyed the experience of more than 100,000 white-collar workers across the rich world during the pandemic. It finds that satisfaction with working from home varies according to whether that person has dedicated office and desk space or not.
The tide’s turned and rolling your way
And not everyone has the ability to work from home, even if they want to. Research published in April by Mr Neiman and Jonathan Dingel, both of the University of Chicago, found that across rich countries about 40% of the workforce were in occupations that could plausibly be completed from their kitchen tables. Evidence of actual working arrangements during the pandemic backs up those speculations. A paper from Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University and colleagues, looking at American data, suggests that of those employed before the pandemic began, about half were working from home in May.
Indeed, it is uncertain whether the benefits of working from home can last for a sustained period of time. Mr Bloom’s co-written study on Chinese call-centre workers is one of the few to assess the impact of working from home over many months. He and his colleagues found that, eventually, many people were desperate to get back to the office, if only every now and then, in part because they were lonely. Some companies which have tried large-scale remote working in the past have ultimately abandoned it, including Yahoo, a technology firm, in 2013. “Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings,” a leaked internal memo read that year.

The challenge for bosses, then, is to find ways of preserving and boosting employee happiness and innovation, even as home-working becomes more common. One solution is to get everyone into the office a few days a month. An approach whereby workers dedicate a chunk of time to developing new ideas with colleagues may actually be more productive than before.
A study from Christoph Riedl of Northeastern University and Anita Williams Woolley of Carnegie Mellon University, published in 2017, suggested that “bursty” communication, where people exchange ideas rapidly for a short period of time, led to better performance than constant, but less focused, communication. Not much evidence exists that serendipity is useful for innovation, even though it is accepted by many as a self-evident truth. “A lot of people made a lot of money selling this watercooler idea,” says Mr Claudel of MIT, referring to the growth in recent decades of open-plan offices, co-working spaces and trendy “innovation districts”.
Coming into the office now and then is not the only way of generating bursty communication. The same can be achieved, say, with corporate retreats and get-togethers. Gitlab, a software company, has been “all-remote” since it was founded in 2014. With no offices, it gathers together its 1,300 “team members”, who live in 65 different countries, at least once a year for get-togethers and team bonding.
Similarly, companies such as Teemly, Sococo and Pragli offer “virtual offices”, making it easier to communicate with colleagues, rather than going through the rigmarole of scheduling a video call. Using video messaging from Loom, a worker can record her screen, voice and face and instantly share it with colleagues—more useful than a conventional video call, as the video can be sped up or rewound. Gitlab’s workers follow a “nonlinear” workday—interrupting work with bouts of leisure. Rather than talk to their colleagues over live video calls they engage in “asynchronous communication”, which is another way of saying they send their co-workers pre-recorded video messages.
More frequent working from home will also demand the use of new hardware, and the withering away of other sorts. At present, many companies host large data-centres, but these have proved less efficient as more people work from home. Goldman Sachs reckons that investment in traditional data infrastructure will fall by 3% a year in 2019-25. In its place, companies are likely to spend more on technology which allows workers to replicate the experience of being in the same physical space as someone else (higher-quality cameras and microphones, for instance). The more utopian technology analysts reckon that within five years, people will be able to put on a VR headset and immerse themselves in a virtual office—bad strip-lighting, and all.
There’s a better life
All this has wide-ranging implications for public policy. At present it is impossible to know whether home-workers will find it easier or harder to bargain with their employer for pay rises and improvements in conditions, though the idea of asking for a raise through a video chat is hardly an appealing one. Employers may also find it easier to fire remote workers than if they had to do it face-to-face. If so, then calls may grow for governments to give home-workers greater protections.
Another problem relates to employment law, argues Jeremias Adams-Prassl of Oxford University. Just as the rise of the gig economy has prompted questions and court cases about what it means to be an employee or self-employed, the increased popularity of home-working puts pressure on laws which were constructed around the assumption that people would be toiling away in an office. No one has yet thought through how firms should go about monitoring contractual working time in a world where nobody physically clocks in, nor about the extent to which firms may surveil workers at home.
Battles over employers’ responsibilities to their home-workers surely cannot be far away. Should a business pay for a worker’s internet connection or their heating in the dead of winter? Grappling with such questions will not be easy. But governments and firms must seize the moment. The pandemic, for all its ill effects, offers a rare opportunity to rewire the world of work. ■",2
1796,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",3
1797,"As a physical education teacher in Loudoun County, Virginia, I serve a very diverse community in Leesburg. I love and respect all my students and treat them with dignity despite our differences.
My recent court win is an important step toward protecting freedom of expression for everyone. My hope is that it will encourage educators across the nation to freely advocate for their students without fear of consequence. Some Americans have lost sight of the importance of open debate. 
The Loudoun County School Board recently passed a policy that forces teachers to call students by pronouns that are contrary to biology and violate my faith as a Christian.
The policy forces me and my colleagues to subject the very children that we are charged to love and protect to a dangerous ideology that could lead to puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and even sterilization.
While the policy was still under review, I took the time, in my personal capacity, to speak at a school board meeting that was open to the public. I told board members that, as a teacher, I cannot lie to these kids—no good teacher would. However, the policy would force me to do just that, and I urged them to rethink it.
Two days later, I got a call to come into Human Resources, where I was informed that I was being suspended for ‘disruptive behavior.’
I didn’t understand what was disruptive about expressing my concern for my students at a public school-board meeting in the county where I live and pay taxes. I later came to learn that the disruption they were referring to was five parents’ e-mails sent to my school complaining about my speech at the school board meeting. 
As a result of the e-mails, the school board determined that it was enough to jeopardize my family’s livelihood and my future as a teacher. Think about the implications of a school board giving into such demands so quickly—simply as a result of a teacher’s views. 
Freedom of expression is a core liberty and a human right, and the school board was trying to take that away from me. I decided to stand up for what I believe in, and to protect my students. I was fortunate to have the assistance of Alliance Defending Freedom to challenge the violation I was facing and defend my rights in court.
First, the court temporarily ordered the school board to reinstate my job. The Virginia Supreme Court later upheld that order. Now the school district has agreed to settle my case.
As part of that settlement, the trial court permanently prohibited the Loudoun County School Board from punishing me for expressing my views. Teachers are just like everyone else; we have legitimate ideas and views we should be free to peacefully express. No government should be able to force its citizens to say things they disagree with.  
This is especially true in schools, where the marketplace of ideas should be fiercely protected, both for the sake of freedom and the sake of truth. The court has vindicated those rights for me and for all teachers. I can now confidently continue teaching at Leesburg Elementary School without fear of punishment for expressing my views.
It’s been a long, emotional journey up to this point, but I know it’s worth pursuing. As exhausting as it is, I know there’s still more work to be done to truly protect freedom in Loudoun County.
The school board adopted the policy I objected to, Policy 8040, and two of my colleagues, Monica Gill and Kimberly Wright, have joined me to take a bold stand to see that the same rights that we have outside the school are protected inside the school. Our constitutionally protected freedoms don’t vanish when we walk through the school doors.
Monica, Kimberly, and I know that not every parent sees things the way that we do, and we respect that. But some would rather see certain voices silenced or, even worse, compelled to speak in ways that violate our deeply held faith, instead of being allowed to engage in the debate.
Call it cancel culture, call it censorship, call it what you want—all of our freedoms are threatened when the culturally accepted narrative is the only option for discussion.
America is large and diverse, and some of us don’t agree with the ideas that are touted as truth by cable news networks, Hollywood executives, or political leaders. We shouldn’t be singled out for censorship. 
Parents should be allowed to have a say in what goes on in their kids’ schools. We recently witnessed a regime change in the Virginia governor’s office, in part because parents in our commonwealth are waking up to what’s going on.
As a result of what was happening here in Loudoun County, many parents saw that it was time for a change to protect their children from these harmful and radical ideologies. If we’re allowed to debate ideas, kids will learn how to value people while engaging with different opinions in a respectful way. 
Silencing opposing voices only teaches kids that you can get your way by bullying others. Teachers and parents have unique viewpoints when it comes to topics like efforts to control COVID-19 outbreaks, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity ideology. 
In my case, the Loudoun County Court took us a big step closer toward allowing those viewpoints to be voiced without punishment. I love all my students, and I enjoy teaching them health and physical education. In my classroom, every student will continue to be treated with dignity, respect, and care. 
This is much more than a job for me; it is who I am. I don’t see myself as a rebel or revolutionary. I’m just a P.E. teacher who cares deeply about the health and future of my students. Monica, Kimberly, and I are taking a stand for what we believe is right and good for all Americans, not just us.",-2
1798,"BRIGHT GREEN, chocolate-studded delights sprout on store shelves across Japan every year as temperatures rise. Chocolate-mint ice cream bars; chocolate-mint cookies; chocolate-mint candies, chocolate-mint bubble tea, even chocolate-mint bagels. On Instagram, fans post pictures of their favourite “chocominto” items, tagging posts “#chocomintou”, a play on words meaning the “chocolate-mint party” (as in political party). And then, as suddenly as they appear, the chocominto snacks are gone, wilting away at the end of Japan’s hot summers.
Japanese cooking and traditional sweets have long placed a premium on seasonality. Contemporary candy and snack producers now tap into the seasonal mindset to great effect, peddling cherry-flavoured goods during cherry blossom season and sweet potato-flavoured snacks in the autumn. Chocominto is only the latest limited-edition snack fad to enthrall Japanese consumers. “The Japanese market moves with the season,” says Jérôme Chouchan, the boss of Godiva Japan, which uses ingredients and packaging to send seasonal signals, as with chestnut macaroons and brown or red packaging in the autumn.

Yet the proliferation of seasonal, limited-edition items in Japan has as much to do with the structure of the modern market as with age-old traditions. Japan’s ubiquitous convenience stores, or conbini, prize novelty. The selection in stores usually changes once a week, explains Phillip Sugai of Doshisha University in Kyoto: “Having the same exact chocolate bar on the shelves isn’t appealing to the convenience stores; novelty is exciting.”
Where big international confectionery firms tend to manufacture the same items consistently at scale to minimise costs, “the Japanese model is completely opposite,” says Takaoka Kozo, the former head of Nestlé Japan, a big food and drink company. Under his watch, KitKat, a chocolate-covered wafer, began churning out seasonal and limited-edition flavours; the company has produced hundreds of flavours exclusive to Japan, including salt lychee, red-bean paste and wasabi. (The same approach flopped in Britain, where retailers charged higher fees to carry new items.)
Another factor may be the difficulty of competing on quality in the Japanese market. “Every product tastes good,” says Okayama Takuya of Dataspring, a market-research firm. Instead manufacturers have to find other ways to stand out. “It’s very difficult for us to differentiate from our competitors by improving just taste, we have to have some special edition to do so,” says Yokoi Satoshi, head of the Japanese branch of Papabubble, a high-end Spanish sweet-maker.
The confectioner produces a sweet shaped like a chicken wing for stores in Nagoya, which is known for its fried chicken, and one for Osaka resembling a steamed pork bun, a local speciality. In May, it opened a chocominto pop-up shop in Tokyo’s trendy Aoyama district. Pumping out new flavours every few months can present challenges, especially for foreign companies used to producing high volumes of fewer products. But buzzy items make up for the additional costs in sales, says Mr Takaoka.
Few flavours have as devoted a fan base these days as chocominto, which has developed a cult following on social media. “People who like it really like it,” says Ushikubo Shintaro, an influencer who runs a suite of chocominto-themed social-media accounts and published a guidebook to chocominto offerings in Tokyo. The only downside is its fleeting nature. “It is a little bit sad when the chocominto period ends,” Mr Ushikubo admits. He soothes his sorrow with the strawberry-flavoured sweets that grow on shelves in the winter.",2
1799,"THE COMMUNIST PARTY’S leadership, with “Comrade Xi Jinping at the core”, attaches “great importance” to managing internet content. So declared the government on October 20th when unveiling new instructions about what news could be republished online. This was an understatement. Under the party’s rule, China’s press has never enjoyed more than a small modicum of freedom. Mr Xi has relentlessly tightened controls. Reporters and editors deemed politically wayward have been disciplined, fired or jailed.
The new directive, issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), updates a list, first published in 2016, of news sources that other websites may republish. CAC said the revision was aimed at “resolutely closing the ‘back door’ on illegal newsgathering and redistribution”.

The list names 1,358 approved outlets. That is nearly four times as many as were named in the previous one. It is not a sign of relaxation. The larger number merely reflects the proliferation of news websites run by state-owned media. More important to note are sources that are no longer listed. The most conspicuous is Caixin Online, a popular and trusted website.
Since its launch in 2009, Caixin Online has been an outlier in China’s drab media landscape. It often goes far beyond other outlets with investigative reporting and coverage of topics such as corruption, environmental problems and touchy policy debates. In the early stages of the pandemic it called into question the official death toll in Wuhan, pointing to an unusual workload at crematoria. Its founder, Hu Shuli, previously ran a magazine called Caijing, which once occupied a similar niche. Ms Hu is politically well-connected and has a keen sense of how to skate close to—but rarely over—the party’s red lines.
She and her colleagues may feel the effects of another recent tightening of the party’s grip. On October 8th China’s planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), released a draft regulation reiterating a ban on private investment in most news operations. Such restrictions have been in place since at least 2005, but have not been rigorously enforced. State media suggest that this time, change is afoot. According to one widely quoted Chinese expert, previously non-compliant arrangements will be ”cleaned up”. It will be a big job. Like Caixin, many Chinese media, though fully operated and controlled by the state, have complex ownership structures that include big holdings by private investors.
Pro-government commentators have praised the party’s resolve. Sima Nan, a blogger in Beijing with more than 2.4m followers on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, opined that a loosening of media controls in the Soviet Union had hastened its collapse in 1991. “This is an ideological struggle,” he said, comparing the NDRC‘s ban to “removing firewood from under a cauldron”—a common way in Chinese of describing drastic action taken to deal with an emergency.
Sina Weibo is owned by Sina Corporation, a non-state tech giant. But it is clear that the NDRC does not have news analysts such as Mr Sima in its sights. ■",2
1800,"WHEN NILUFER KURBANOVA’S doctor told her she was going to have a boy, he expected a tip for delivering the good news. He did not get one.
Ms Kurbanova does not believe, as many older Georgians do, that sons are better than daughters. Some families feel they need a male child to carry on the bloodline; Ms Kurbanova thinks this is hokum. Traditional families expect sons to look after their parents in their old age, whereas a daughter would look after her husband’s parents. Ms Kurbanova does not see why it has to be that way.

For centuries Georgians strongly preferred boys. When Georgia was part of the Soviet Union, from 1921 to 1991, its communist rulers suppressed some old sexist customs (such as kidnapping brides) and declared that women were equal, even if they did not always uphold the ideal. In any case, practically no one had access to sex-detecting ultrasound machines in those days. This was partly because they could not afford them, and partly because the West restricted exports since some of the machines’ parts had military uses.
That changed when the Soviet Union imploded. Ultrasound became widely available. And patriarchal values made a comeback, perhaps because the collapse of a bossy state prompted Georgians to seek guidance elsewhere. Many turned to the church and to their families. Traditional values, combined with modern technology, led to a surge in the abortion of girl babies. Georgia’s sex ratio swung wildly. In 1991 there were roughly 105 boys born for every 100 girls. (This is the natural rate, since more boys die in childhood and the numbers even out by the time they reach reproductive age.) By 2004 there were 115 boys born for every 100 girls.
But since then the sex ratio at birth has returned closer to normal. For the past five years it has hovered around 107 (though in 2020 it reached 109). In neighbouring Azerbaijan, where sex-selective abortion is still rife, it is 114. In China, it is 112.
Several factors may explain why Georgians started valuing girl babies again. After the initial post-communist turmoil, women’s wages rose, giving them more bargaining power at home. This made it easier for them to overrule husbands who wanted to abort a girl (son preference is more common among Georgian men than women). It also planted the idea in parental heads that a daughter may grow up to earn serious money, and therefore be able to support them in their old age.
Changes in the fertility rate made a difference, too. In 1990 the average Georgian woman had 2.2 children. That plummeted to 1.6 in 2001, as economic turbulence made couples nervous about the future. The patriarch of Georgia’s Orthodox Church was so alarmed that in 2007 he vowed personally to baptise any couple’s third or subsequent child. Whether that helped or not, the fertility rate rebounded to 2.1 in 2019, as the country grew more prosperous. If a family is going to have only one child, a father who passionately wants a son is more likely to insist that the child is a boy.
Even if attitudes grow less sexist, however, Georgians must still face the consequences of the biases of a generation ago. Some regions are already facing a shortage of brides. And next year, Georgians born in the most skewed birth cohort will turn 18. Men who wish to get married may find they need to emigrate. ■",2
1801,"FOR A GLIMPSE of the future, go to Showfields, which has a four-storey department store in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. These being plague years, you can take a virtual tour via its app, which directs you to “the most interesting store in the world”.  Amir Zwickel, Showfields’ co-founder, says the mission is to make it as easy to open a physical as a digital store. During the pandemic, retailers from Europe, Asia and Latin America have opened boutiques without setting foot in America. They can because Showfields provides the architecture to do it remotely, including providing human “storytellers” who act as stand-in brand ambassadors. It tracks customers via its app and with cameras, providing retailers with digital feedback. It also attracts shoppers with art exhibitions and live events. “I want to be for physical retail what Shopify is to e-commerce,” says Mr Zwickel.
Showfields is a landlord, not a retailer. It represents a niche solution to what Melina Cordero of CBRE, a property specialist, says is a dilemma in the retail-property industry: “credit versus cool”. Landlords used to insist that malls and shopping centres recruited tenants with strong brands and creditworthiness. But some venerable names have gone bust. Instead landlords need “cool”, youthful brands to attract shoppers. Showfields offers that. Property barons as arbiters of what is cool or not? That is one of many incongruities in a renaissance that is blurring boundaries between customers and retailers. Mr Zwickel calls it “c-commerce” for its customer-centricity. Retailers, landlords, brands, advertisers and manufacturers are in the service of consumers, whom they know better than ever because of their data trail.

If Showfields is any guide, the physical store will not only survive the rush to e-commerce but even thrive as a place of interaction between retail “stylists” and consumers. Freed from giant stores with their arrays of goods, shops can become more intimate, turning into pillars of the community and places in which to gather. They may be less concentrated in city centres, especially if working from home persists, reducing demand from office workers. Yet soulless shopping centres in suburbia offering only tatty goods and little service may also be on the way out.
The obvious presence in this new landscape will be giant online marketplaces, such as Amazon and Alibaba’s Taobao and TMall. Both are so strong that their dominance is likely to persist, even if it attracts regulatory scrutiny. The antitrust crusade is not an insurmountable worry. If experience in China is a guide, the retail industry does not need breakups for competition and innovation to flourish. Even with the recent surge in e-commerce, 85% of global retail is offline. That is a lot of territory still to conquer. The ubiquity of smartphones in emerging markets means shopping will develop in more interactive and fun ways. New e-commerce channels via live-streaming and short videos will attract entrants.
The opportunity for brands to reach customers direct, without paying huge mark-ups, may democratise retailing in a way not seen since the Industrial Revolution. Before e-commerce came along, retailers were cosy oligopolies. Only through consolidation could they create economies of scale to hold their own against consumer-goods companies. Under the retail renaissance, that will change. Some say it will create a more frictionless economy, with smoother pricing, fewer barriers to entry and more innovation. It will also allow brands to plug more consumer data into their manufacturing models, so that they produce goods closer to what customers want, with less surplus inventory (ie, waste).
This is the optimist’s view. Pessimists will see instead dead malls, abandoned high streets, millions of unemployed shop assistants, dwindling retail tax revenues and piles of Amazon-delivered clutter, and wring their hands. Inevitably the transition will incorporate bits of both. It will lose popularity if societies find no good way to upgrade the skills of retail workers who fall victim to the disruption. It will also be a poor substitute for the shopping experience of old if only a well-off minority have access to the innovative brands and trendy stores depicted in this report.  
Whatever the variety of distribution channels, the retail industry must also respond to climate change and worries about “peak stuff” (will consumers’ urge to binge-buy ever be sated?). Shoppers now put sustainability high up in their priorities when deciding where and what to buy. From Amazon to Zalando, a European online marketplace, many retailers have zero-carbon targets. Yet the manufacture of goods, from farm produce to plastic toys, is a big contributor to global warming. And at the other end are exhaust fumes when packages are delivered or customers drive to stores.
It seems fair to assume that digitisation will produce a cleaner economy than one built around mass production and mass consumption. It also seems realistic that with the world at the foothills of a transformation of retail, innovation is just starting—and some will be aimed at making shopping genuinely more sustainable.  For now, celebrate the overhaul of a model of shopping that after 150 years was oligopolistic, stuck in its ways and a byword for poor service. It takes years for technological breakthroughs to reshape society. E-commerce is in only its third decade. It may turn the next one into a time of vibrant upheaval. ■",2
1802,"GOD, SAYS the Koran, chose Arabic for his revelation because it is easy to understand. But many of the world’s 470m Arabic-speakers beg to differ. According to a report by the World Bank, almost 60% of ten-year-olds in Arabic-speaking countries (and Iran) struggle to read and understand a basic text. Despite decades of investment in education, the Middle East and north Africa still suffer from what the report calls “learning poverty”. “School systems don’t see the importance of engaging kids in reading—or don’t know how,” says Hanada Taha-Thomure, one of the authors. “It creates a gap between children and their language. Many can’t read or write an essay.”
The root of the problem is bad teaching. Arabic lessons are dull and focus on fiddly grammar. Classrooms often have no printed material. Few schools have libraries. Teachers tend to lack “sufficient mastery of the language itself”, says the report. In universities across the region, Arabic departments, along with religious studies ones, attract students with the lowest grades.

In Morocco almost 60% of teachers of ten-year-olds have no higher education. Only Bahrain has a teacher-training college that specialises in teaching Arabic. Teachers tend to be traditionalists, sometimes resorting to beating. Children “don’t love the Arabic language because not even 1% of teachers are reading stories to their students for pleasure,” said Ms Taha-Thomure, a professor at Zayed University in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Some blame the language itself. Pupils are taught Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the formal tongue of officialdom, yet they grow up speaking a native dialect. The dialect closest to MSA is spoken by Palestinians, yet only about 60% of the local lingo overlaps with MSA. The Moroccan dialect diverges far more.
Adults often stumble over the written word, too, so bedtime reading to children is rare. Only about a quarter of Arabic-speaking parents read to their children often, compared with more than 70% in much of the West. Reading for pleasure is widely regarded as critical for a child’s future success. But studies show that Arabic-speaking children do much less of that than children in the West.
Arab education ministries are waking up to the problem. Egypt has developed a trove of online material to bypass the traditionalists. The UAE has begun fitting classrooms with “reading corners”. Across the Arab world girls far outperform boys, in part because female teachers tend to be better, so Saudi Arabia has defied crusty clerics and let women teach boys (though separately from girls). Its education ministry is puncturing the mystique of the sacred texts by distributing Japanese-style comics to every Saudi child over ten, with superheroes speaking Arabic slang. “We are facing generations that do not speak the Arabic language,” says Essam Bukhary, the CEO of Manga Arabia, which produces the comics. “We want to promote reading as a hobby for younger generations.”
Traditionalists quake at such irreverent handling of the sacred language. And Arab regimes are nervous of the free expression a more liberal approach may inspire. Their censors are banning books as keenly as ever and ensure that newspapers all say the same thing. Many officials prefer to keep children disciplined by making them memorise what they’re told, says Andrew Hammond, a lecturer in Arabic culture at Oxford University. Otherwise, he says, they might start thinking for themselves. ■",2
1803,"THE BLACK market in Venezuela has taken a dark turn in recent weeks. In online chat groups, where weary Caracas residents trade everything from detergent to US dollars, covid-19 is the dominant theme. Emotional pleas for medicine are commonplace. The price of oxygen tanks and masks is soaring. So too is rental space for the large refrigerators needed to preserve bodies in the tropical heat, as waiting lists for burials and cremations grow.
Switch on state television and it is another world. Every Sunday Nicolás Maduro, the dictator, addresses the nation. Wards of pristine unused hospital beds are displayed. Venezuela’s relatively low official death count is contrasted with carnage elsewhere. Mr Maduro labels the P.1 variant that is spreading across South America the “Bolsonaro mutation”, blaming an uptick in cases on Brazil’s populist president.

Mr Maduro’s hubris is misplaced. For the first year of covid-19 Venezuela was largely spared. But this was mostly luck. With the economy tanking and sanctions from the United States biting, the number of foreign visitors had already started tumbling. Before the pandemic, at least a dozen big airlines stopped flying there. But since March cases have been rising. Even by the government’s improbably low figures, there were around 1,000 new infections nearly every day in April, a record.
The country is ill-prepared. In 2019 fully 70% of public hospitals did not have reliable running water, according to Doctors for Health, a nationwide medical network. Morgues are now full, says Douglas Leon Natera, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation. Health workers who give out detailed statistics which contradict the government’s claims risk imprisonment, he warns.
Instead of introducing clear lockdowns, Mr Maduro has imposed a bizarre one-week-on, one-week-off procedure, whereby non-essential shops are closed for a week and then allowed to reopen. “He seems to think the virus disappears every other week,” quips one sardonic carequeño. Mr Maduro has also touted a “miracle” cure for covid-19, which he claims was developed by Venezuelan scientists. The quack concoction appears to be made from an extract of thyme. His claims prompted Facebook to freeze his page for a month.
Vaccines are a long way off. Mr Maduro received his first jab on March 6th. But almost everyone else could be waiting months. Less than 2% of the country’s 18m adults have had their first dose, by far the worst roll-out in South America. The vaccines that are available (around 880,000 from Russia and China) are politicised. They have been restricted to those with a state loyalty card known as the carnet de la patria, which is mostly held by people who get state aid and so back the government.
In January up to 2.4m AstraZeneca jabs were reserved for Venezuela as part of the WHO’s COVAX scheme. The catch is paying for them. Venezuela is poor enough to qualify for free shots, but absurdly it still ranks as a “wealthier nation”, because Mr Maduro’s government has refused, since 2014, to provide accurate economic data to the World Bank.
In March Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition and recognised by many democratic governments as the legitimate president, was working on a deal whereby $30m of Venezuelan government funds frozen in the United States would be released to pay for them. Mr Maduro appears to have scuppered the arrangement, claiming that local “technical reports” found that the AstraZeneca jab had undesirable side-effects.
Weeks later, however, the government joined COVAX on more expensive terms. In April it said it had made two down-payments for 11m vaccines, understood to total around $120m. It is refusing to specify the origin of the funds. But assuming the government continues to refuse AstraZeneca’s jab, the vaccines may not arrive in the country until July. “You get the sense that there’s no rush,” says Miguel Pizarro, a politician representing Mr Guaidó at the UN. “Everyone is scared, and that is what a dictatorship wants.”■

1804,"LOS ANGELES, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) on Monday began offering a free mobile plan with about one-quarter of its TV shows and movies in Kenya, a strategy aimed at sparking growth in a key African market, the company told Reuters.
The free plan is available on Android mobile phones and will not have ads. It features Netflix movies and TV shows such as dramas ""Money Heist"" and ""Bridgerton"" and African series ""Blood & Water,"" plus some of the programming the company licenses from others.
Netflix hopes the free plan will lead to users signing up for a paid option with more content.
The world's largest streaming video service is looking to add customers outside of more saturated markets such as the United States, where new subscriber signups have slowed at a time when competition for online audiences has intensified.  read more 
Executives remain bullish on the long-term future, noting there are large markets where streaming television is just starting to take hold. To attract customers in Africa, Netflix is investing in locally made programming such as ""Queen Sono"" and ""Jiva!"" and has partnered with production studios in Nigeria.
""If you've never watched Netflix before — and many people in Kenya haven’t — this is a great way to experience our service,"" Cathy Conk, director of product innovation at Netflix, said in a blog post. ""And if you like what you see, it’s easy to upgrade to one of our paid plans so you can enjoy our full catalog on your TV or laptop as well.""
The free plan started on Monday and will roll out across Kenya in the coming days.
The non-paying Netflix subscribers in Kenya will not be counted in the paid total the company reports each quarter, a spokesperson said.
Netflix has experimented with free offers before. In 2020, it made some episodes of series such as ""Stranger Things"" and movies including ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" available around the world for no charge via web browsers.
The free plan in Kenya is broader. It will look similar to paid Netflix profiles to give viewers a feel for the service, the spokesperson said. Shows that are not included in the free plan will be marked with a lock icon. Clicking on one of those titles will encourage the user sign up for a paid option.
Anyone 18 or older in Kenya can enroll in the free plan and create up to five profiles. No payment information will be required.
Some functions, such as the ability to download a show or movie, will not be available under the free plan.
Netflix, which streams in more than 190 countries, has taken other steps to boost usage in Africa, including creation of a paid mobile-only plan and partnerships with local telecom operators to ease payments. 
The company reported 209 million paying customers worldwide at the end of June. New member pickups slowed in the first half of 2021 after a boom early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Africa currently is a relatively small market for streaming TV subscriptions. Digital TV Research projects Netflix will lead subscription video on demand services on the continent with 6.26 million paying customers in 2026, followed by Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Disney+.",3
1805,"ON DECEMBER 23rd 1938 Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, a curator at the East London Museum, in South Africa, dropped by her local fish market. While there, she spotted the most beautiful fish she had ever seen. It was pale mauve, nearly two metres long, and had silvery markings. Though she had no inkling at the time, it turned out to be part of a group called the coelacanths, hitherto believed to have died out with the dinosaurs.
This find, called Latimeria chalumnae in Courtenay-Latimer’s honour, showed coelacanths are still very much alive. It was hailed as the most important zoological discovery of the century. Now, work just published in Current Biology by Kélig Mahé of the Fisheries Laboratory, in Boulogne, France, suggests that besides having lasted collectively for more than 400m years, coelacanths also hang around for a long time as individuals. Dr Mahé’s study indicates they have similar lifespans to human beings, putting them among the world’s longest-lived vertebrates.

The excitement at Latimeria’s discovery was not just because of the curiosity of its survival. It was also that coelacanths belong to a group which have lobe-shaped fins of a sort thought to have been precursors to the limbs of terrestrial tetrapods. Many experts have therefore sought to study Latimeria more closely. That is, however, hard. Latimeria is reclusive, nocturnal, lives in depths below 100 metres, and is known only from the south-western Indian Ocean and from a second, smaller population, L. menadoensis, near Manado Tua, an island in Indonesia.

In particular, Dr Mahé wanted to know how long Latimeria lives. Previous work, which looked at annual growth rings in its scales, suggested a maximum of 20 years. That does not square with the animal’s slow metabolism and low fecundity, both traits characteristic of long-lived species.
Rather than using standard microscopes, he and his colleagues employed polarised light to study the scales. This revealed extra growth rings so thin that previous work had missed them. Of 27 individuals studied, six turned out to be in their 60s and one was 84.
This was a finding Dr Mahé and his colleagues had more than half expected. What truly surprised them was a discovery made by looking at two unborn youngsters—for Latimeria females bear live young rather than laying eggs. The fetuses’ scales suggested they were five years old, a remarkably long gestation period given the previous vertebrate record of three-and-a-half years, held by the deep-sea frilled shark.
Though interesting, in some ways Dr Mahé’s discovery is bad news. An already-rare, slow-growing animal with a gestation period of half a decade has just about the most extinction-prone profile it is possible to imagine. Latimeria is legally protected, in as much as such protection pertains at sea, and is not a particular target for fisherfolk. But it is already classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It would be both ironic and tragic if, having survived the asteroid impact 66m years ago that did for the dinosaurs, coelacanths were to disappear for good on humanity’s watch. ■",2
1806,"SOME POLITICAL dramas flare up briefly; others redraw the political landscape. The debacle in the House of Commons on November 3rd and 4th, when Boris Johnson tried to tear up the system of parliamentary oversight to prevent the suspension of Owen Paterson, a friend and MP, only to reverse course, looks like the second type. As furious Conservative MPs complained about being treated as cannon fodder, it strained their faith in the prime minister’s judgment and undermined the whips’ authority. It also gave fresh juice to other inquiries into Tory conduct, including Mr Johnson’s recent holiday at a Spanish villa, payment for seats in the House of Lords and the extra-parliamentary legal career of Sir Geoffrey Cox, a former attorney-general who earned £900,000 ($1.2m) in the past year. A YouGov poll after the fateful vote on November 3rd found that a Tory lead of 6% had narrowed to 1%.
Marxist theoreticians argue that, as Hegel put it, beyond a certain point “merely quantitative differences…pass into qualitative changes”. Mr Paterson has stepped down, but for the prime minister the affair may mark the moment when his accumulating errors and U-turns, from getting friends to pay for expensive wallpaper in his residence to changing tack repeatedly on lockdowns, becomes a qualitative shift in public opinion.

Explanations for such a catastrophic misstep range from generous (the prime minister merely wanted to protect a friend and ally) to cynical (he sought to neuter the standards commission before it pronounced on his own actions). But one is particularly compelling: that he was unduly influenced by a clique of ageing Brexiteers. Behind the Paterson debacle stands a group of brothers-in-arms who served shoulder to shoulder in the anti-European trenches for decades. The hard core, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash, David Davis and Sir Bernard Jenkin, were critics of the Maastricht Treaty in the 1990s, “Vote No” warriors under David Cameron, stalwarts of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, self-styled “Spartans” under Theresa May—and champions of Mr Johnson as prime minister.
Dame Andrea Leadsom, who put forward the Paterson amendment, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who did most to push it through, were too young for the Maastricht wars. But they were there in spirit (the infant Rees-Mogg was educated in Euroscepticism by Sir Bill). Lord (Charles) Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, also played a pivotal role. He wrote columns in support of Mr Paterson, his friend for 45 years, and organised a dinner at the Garrick Club on November 2nd, at which Mr Johnson was fed pheasant and claret, and brought round to their point of view.
The clique’s victory in the Brexit vote of 2016 has injected a toxic mix of triumphalism and paranoia into the heart of Conservatism. Its members see themselves as possessing a unique connection with the British people, and a rare strategic genius. They think they can achieve anything, as long as they exert sufficient pressure and plot sufficiently thickly. But they also regard themselves as beset by a hostile establishment that seeks to frustrate their will. Lord Moore’s articles are textbook examples of the style. He has argued that the two-year investigation into Mr Paterson “smacks of political revenge”, and that the parliamentary standards committee selectively targeted pro-Brexit MPs while going easy on Remainers. He urged MPs to reject the committee’s sentence as a way of “reasserting the right of voters, not bureaucrats, to decide who should make [the] law and ensure that it works”.
Successful political parties rely on their elders’ accumulated wisdom to stop them making unforced errors. Even Margaret Thatcher, a radical to her fingertips, paid close attention to William Whitelaw, a moderate grandee—thus her immortal dictum that “every prime minister needs a Willie”. But the Brexit wars have removed a generation of “Willies” from the parliamentary party, notably Sir Nicholas Soames, Sir Alan Duncan, Kenneth Clarke, Patrick McLoughlin and Dominic Grieve. Politics has been left in the hands of ageing zealots in the Commons and lightweight technocrats in Downing Street, such as Dan Rosenfield, Mr Johnson’s chief of staff. The zealots appeal to Mr Johnson’s worst trait, a tendency to believe that he is above accountability; the technocrats lack the strength to rein their master in.
Younger MPs were particularly furious about the Paterson mess, not because they are anti-Brexit saboteurs (most were fervently in favour of leaving the EU) but because they resent being treated so cavalierly by people who wouldn’t recognise them in the corridors of Westminster, let alone say hello. The brewing row over extra-parliamentary income sharpens their resentment. To the ageing baby-boomers within the Brexit clique, £100,000 a year may sound like a reasonable second income; to the 2019 intake representing working-class “red wall” constituencies in the Midlands and north of England, it is serious money.
Mr Johnson now needs to break with the Brexit clique. He should stop listening to the likes of Sir Iain and Mr Davis, who are neither wise nor even particularly intelligent. Gargoyles like Mr Rees-Mogg should be cleared out of front-line politics. In their place, the prime minister should assemble a government of all the Tory talents. The brightest and best of the rising generation should be put on the fast track to high office.
They’re not out to get you
Above all, he needs to break decisively with the triumphalist-paranoid mindset. Neither he nor anyone else has the right to force through controversial legislation in the name of some mystical connection with “the people”. Not everyone who resists his actions is plotting to bring Britain back into the EU. The British establishment, by and large, recognises that Brexit is a fait accompli and the great task of the coming decades is to make the best of it. Mr Johnson can still repair the damage of the past week, but only if he takes it as a spur to party renewal. ■",2
1807,"America’s president, Joe Biden, held talks by video link with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. It was the closest thing to a meeting between the two men since Mr Biden took office in January. Mr Xi told Mr Biden that he was ready to “take active steps” to improve relations between China and America. Mr Biden called for co-operation “where our interests intersect”, including on climate change. America’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the two leaders had agreed to “look to begin to carry forward discussions on strategic stability”. He appeared to mean that America and China would explore talks on nuclear-arms control.

After a lengthy investigation, the Manhattan district attorney’s office moved to exonerate two of the men convicted of assassinating  Malcolm X in 1965. The DA found that prosecutors, the FBI and the police withheld evidence that would have acquitted the two men, who were released in the 1980s (one has since died). A third man confessed to the murder and spent 45 years in prison.

1808,"NASA and the U.S. government are looking for proposals on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon with the goal of having energy on the moon that's not reliant on the sun by the end of the decade.
NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory formally put out a request for proposals from the public on Friday for a fission surface power system. 
In a collaboration between NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab, the two agencies are specifically looking to establish a source of power that does not rely on the sun or solar power for missions on the moon.
'Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,' Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. 
Should the lunar nuclear reactors be a success in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next stop would be Mars, according to the world's leading space agency.
NASA states that such fission surface power could likely provide long-term power for human lunar colonies, regardless of environmental conditions. 
'I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,' Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement.  
The reactor itself would be built on earth before being sent to the moon.
For those who wish to send a proposal, NASA says submitted plans for the fission surface power system will need to include a uranium-fueled reactor core, a thermal management system to keep the reactor at the proper temperature, a system to convert the nuclear power into usable energy, and a distribution system that provides no less than 40 kilowatts of electric power. 
Said power system proposals will need to supply continuous power for 10 years in the lunar environment.
The reactor must also be capable of turning itself on and off without human oversight, that it can operate from a lunar lander deck, and that it is mobile enough to be transported from the lander to a different lunar site for operation if necessary. 
Successful proposals for the reactor must weigh no more than 13,200 pounds, and be able to fit inside a 12-foot diameter cylinder that's 18 feet long when launched from earth to the moon. 
The deadline for proposal requests for an initial system design must be submitted by February 19, the outlet reports.  
This is not the first collaborative project between NASA and the Idaho National Laboratory, with the lab most recently helping build a radioisotope power system for the space agency's Mar's rover Perseverance, which converts heat that's generated from the decay or plutonium-238 into electrical power.
The rover landed on the Martian surface back in February and has remained active on the red planet ever since.  
The Energy Department has also recently been looking for private businesses to collaborate with on various nuclear power plans, most notably a new generation of smaller power plants ranging from small modular rectors to small mobile reactors that can quickly be set up in the field and be removed when no longer needed. ",-2
1809,"ON A RECENT Friday evening in Mendoza, the capital of Argentina’s wine country, a group of well-to-do Mendocinos held a Zoom session with Luciana Sabina, a historian. “Self-rule, it’s a big part of our DNA,” she declared, as she took her viewers through earthquakes and economic crises, singing the praises of Italian immigrants who planted fructuous vineyards in the Andes. In her telling, an epidemic was a turning-point in the province’s history. During a cholera outbreak in the 1880s Mendoza wanted to close itself off from the rest of the country. Argentina’s then president, General Julio Argentino Roca, forced the province to open. “We lost the battle for self-rule, thousands of lives too,” Ms Sabina concluded.
Once again, a pandemic is driving a wedge between Mendoza and Buenos Aires. Covid-19 is surging in Argentina; the country is recording 35,000 new cases a day. The provincial government has defied President Alberto Fernández by keeping its schools open. It has imposed a looser curfew and was against extending Argentina’s lockdown beyond May 30th. The tension is inspiring demands for autonomy more generally. Some political activists even talk of independence from Argentina. They call it “MendoExit”.

“The government just takes from us, it’s a disgrace,” says Luciano, a farmhand on a small vineyard in the province’s Uco valley, where Malbec, the soft red wine that helped make Mendoza famous, is produced. “We live by our work, we Mendocinos provide for ourselves,” remarks Cristina, a young mother checking French oak barrels in a nearby winery. Taxes on exports in particular are disliked. “That money, from our labour, should stay in Mendoza,” says Juan, a winemaker.
Per person, Mendoza gets the least funding from the central government of all of Argentina’s 23 provinces. Last spring José Manuel Ortega, a former investment banker and winemaker, paid for an opinion poll of Mendoza, Córdoba and Santa Fe, the country’s richest provinces, which are all home to opposition leaders. Two-fifths of respondents in Córdoba and a third in Mendoza said they would back seceding from Argentina. Another poll in April showed support rising. “I hate saying it, but this is a failing state,” says Mr Ortega.
One Mendocino legislator, José Luis Ramón, has proposed a plebiscite on independence when the province votes in mid-term elections later this year. A MendoExit movement, run by Hugo Laricchia, a pugnacious acupuncturist, has joined forces with the established regional Democratic party to present a new force in regional politics, called Éxito. Alfredo Cornejo, a former governor of Mendoza and the leader of Argentina’s Radical party, says that “Mendoza has what it needs to live independently.” Mr Cornejo, who has presidential aspirations, is not calling for independence himself, but he plays up to it. “People want out of this Argentina and the way it’s run, not the country itself,” he says.
Whether all this will come to much is unclear. The constitution does not allow for secession, notes Anabel Sagasti, a senator of the ruling Peronist party. But in the Uco valley Raúl, a worker loading cases of Malbec for export, says he would vote for Éxito. “We can’t go it alone, but with others like Córdoba, we could.” His boss laughs at the idea. Not everybody will.■
Correction: In an early version of this story, we described General Roca as a dictator. Though he was an army general who extended Argentina's frontier by dominating indigenous people in the south, he secured the presidency through the ballot box (twice) and ruled as a civilian. Sorry.

1810,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",3

AMID COVID-19’s sweeping devastation, its effect on greenhouse gases has emerged as something of a bright spot. Between January and March demand for coal dropped by 8% and oil by 5%, compared with the same period in 2019. By the end of the year energy demand may be 6% down overall, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental forecaster, amounting to the largest drop it has ever seen.
Because less energy use means less burning of fossil fuels, greenhouse-gas emissions are tumbling, too. According to an analysis by the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of scientists, 2020’s emissions will be 2-7% lower than 2019’s if the world gets back to prepandemic conditions by mid-June; if restrictions stay in place all year, the estimated drop is 3-13% depending on how strict they are. The IEA’s best guess for the drop is 8%.

That is not enough to make any difference to the total warming the world can expect. Warming depends on the cumulative emissions to date; a fraction of one year’s toll makes no appreciable difference. But returning the world to the emission levels of 2010—for a 7% drop—raises the tantalising prospect of crossing a psychologically significant boundary. The peak in carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil fuels may be a lot closer than many assume. It might, just possibly, turn out to lie in the past.
That emissions from fossil fuels have to peak, and soon, is a central tenet of climate policy. Precisely when they might do so, though, is so policy-dependent that many forecasters decline to give a straight answer. The IEA makes a range of projections depending on whether governments keep on with today’s policies or enact new ones. In the scenario which assumes that current policies stay in place, fossil-fuel demand rises by nearly 30% from 2018 to 2040, with no peak in sight.
The IEA, though, has persistently underestimated the renewable-energy sector. Others are more bullish. Carbon Tracker, a financial think-tank, predicted in 2018 that with impressive but plausible growth in renewable deployment and relatively slow growth in overall demand, even under current policy fossil-fuel emissions should peak in the 2020s—perhaps as early as 2023. Michael Liebreich, who founded BloombergNEF, an energy-data outfit, has also written about a possible peak in the mid 2020s. Depending on how the pandemic pans out he now thinks that it may be in 2023—or may have been in 2019.
Previously, drops in emissions caused by economic downturns have proved only temporary setbacks to the ongoing rise in fossil-fuel use. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Asian financial crash in 1997 and the financial crisis of 2007-09 all saw emissions stumble briefly before beginning to rise again (see chart). But if a peak really was a near-term prospect before the pandemic, almost a decade’s worth of setback could mean that, though emissions will rise over the next few years, they never again reach the level they stood at last year.

The alternative, more orthodox pre-covid view was that the peak was both further off and destined to be higher. On this view, emissions will regain their pre-pandemic level within a few years and will climb right on past it. Covid’s damage to the economy probably means that the peak, when it arrives, will be lower than it might have been, says Roman Kramarchuk of S Global Platts Analytics, a data and research firm. But an economic dip is unlikely to bring it on sooner.
What, though, if covid does not merely knock demand back, but reshapes it? This shock, unlike prior ones, comes upon an energy sector already in the throes of change. The cost of renewables is dipping below that of new fossil-fuel plants in much of the world. After years of development, electric vehicles are at last poised for the mass market. In such circumstances covid-19 may spur decisions—by individuals, firms, investors and governments—that hasten fossil fuels’ decline.
So far, renewables have had a pretty good pandemic, despite some disruptions to supply chains. With no fuel costs and the preferential access to electricity grids granted by some governments, renewables demand jumped 1.5% in the first quarter, even as demand for all other forms of energy sank. America’s Energy Information Administration expects renewables to surpass coal’s share of power generation in America for the first time this year.
Coal prices have fallen, given the low demand, which may position it well post-pandemic in some places. Even before covid, China was building new coal-fired plants (see article). But the cost of borrowing is also low, and likely to stay that way, which means installing renewables should stay cheap for longer. Renewable developers such as Iberdrola and Orsted, both of which have weathered covid-19 rather well so far, are keen to replace coal on an ever larger scale.
Those who see demand for fossil fuels continuing to climb as populations and economies grow have assumed demand for oil will be much more persistent than that for coal. Coal is almost entirely a source of electricity, which makes it ripe for replacement by renewables. Oil is harder to shift. Electric vehicles are sure to eat into some of its demand; but a rising appetite for petrochemicals and jet fuel, to which lithium-ion batteries offer no competition, was thought likely to offset the loss.
Breaking bounds
Now oil’s future looks much more murky, depending as it does on a gallimaufry of newly questionable assumptions about commuting, airline routes, government intervention, capital spending and price recovery. In the future more people may work from home, and commuting accounts for about 8% of oil demand. But those who do commute may prefer to do so alone in their cars, offsetting some of those gains. Chinese demand for oil has picked up again quickly in part because of reticence about buses and trains.
As to planes, Jeff Currie of Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for oil will recover to pre-crisis levels by the middle of 2022, but that demand for jet fuel may well stay 1.7m barrels a day below what it was as business travel declines. That is equivalent to nearly 2% of oil demand.
Such uncertainty means more trouble for the oil sector, whose poor returns and climate risks have been repelling investors for a while. Companies are slashing spending on new projects. By the mid-2020s today’s underinvestment in oil may boost crude prices—making demand for electric vehicles grow all the faster.
Natural gas, the fossil fuel for which analysts have long predicted continued growth, has weathered the pandemic better than its two older siblings. But it, too, faces accelerating competition. One of gas’s niches is powering the “peaker” plants which provide quick influxes of energy when demand outstrips a grid’s supply. It looks increasingly possible for batteries to take a good chunk of that business.
Those hoping for fossil fuels’ imminent demise should not be overconfident. As lockdowns around the world end, use of dirty fuels will tick back up, as they have in China. Energy emissions no longer rise in lockstep with economic growth, but demand for fossil fuels remains tied to it. Mr Currie of Goldman Sachs, for one, is wary of declaring a permanent decoupling: “I’m not willing to say there is a structural shift in oil demand to GDP.” Even so, a peak of fossil fuels in the 2020s looks less and less farfetched—depending on what governments do next in their struggle with the pandemic. Of all the uncertainties in energy markets, none currently looms larger than that. ■",2
1812,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday appeared to contradict her boss, President Joe Biden, in expressing disappointment over the acquittal of accused Kenosha vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse.
‘Today’s verdict speaks for itself,’ the vice president told reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force Two in Columbus, Ohio, on Friday.
The former California senator and San Francisco district attorney added: ‘I've spent a majority of my career working to make our criminal justice system more equitable.
‘It’s clear, there’s still a lot more work to do.’
Harris’ comments don’t jive with those made by Biden, who told reporters on Friday: ‘I stand by what the jury has concluded. The jury system works and we have to abide by it.’
Those comments by Biden generated a backlash from liberals on Twitter. Later on Friday, Biden issued a written statement saying he was ‘angry’ and 'concerned' over the verdict.
‘While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken,’ the president said in his written statement.
‘I know that we're not going to heal our country's wounds overnight, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under the law,’ he continued.
‘I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law.
‘Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy.’
Public opinion on the verdict was split largely along partisan lines. While Democrats panned the acquittal, Republicans praised it. 
Biden said the White House and federal authorities have been in contact with Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers and offered support as Kenosha and the nation brace for fallout from the verdict. 
In New York City on Friday night, several protesters angry at the verdict assembled outside the Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn. 
This comes as Republicans renewed demands that Biden apologize for calling the Kenosha shooter a white supremacist before the trial. 
Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, said he was dismayed by Biden's depiction of Rittenhouse as a white supremacist.
'I've never had a case, I don't think I ever will, where within two days or three days of one another, you know, the President and the presidential candidate comment on it. And both of them had such different beliefs,' Richards said.
'President Biden said some things, I think are so incorrect and untrue — he is not a white supremacist. I'm glad that he at least respects the jury verdict.'
Tom Cotton, the Republican senator for Arkansas, tweeted: 'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse.'
Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican party, said: 'Before he knew the facts, Biden prejudged the Rittenhouse case. He smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case. What Biden did was dangerous and inflammatory. 
'Biden needs to apologize and ACT NOW before the left uses his lies to fuel violence.' 
Cori Bush, a congresswoman for Missouri and member of 'The Squad' described Rittenhouse's acquittal as 'white supremacy in action'.
'This system isn’t built to hold white supremacists accountable,' she said. 
'It’s why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free. 
'I’m hurt. I’m angry. I’m heartbroken.'
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agreed, tweeting: 'What we are witnessing is a system functioning as designed and protecting those it was designed for.'
Fellow Squad member Ayanna Pressley added: 'Racism & white supremacy remain the bedrock of our legal system. My heart breaks for the family & loved ones of those whose lives were stolen, and the trauma our communities face today and every day. 
'The struggle for accountability, for justice, for healing goes on.' 
The head of the House Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they’re not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people.' 
Donald Trump's PAC, Save America, sent an email soliciting funds for his campaign coffers and stating: 'GREAT NEWS FOR KYLE RITTENHOUSE, who we knew was innocent all along.
'This trial was nothing more than a WITCH HUNT from the Radical Left. They want to PUNISH law-abiding citizens, including a CHILD, like Kyle Rittenhouse, for doing nothing more than following the LAW.'
Dan Bishop, a congressman representing North Carolina, said: 'Don’t forget, Biden labeled a 17-year old Rittenhouse a “white supremacist.” Beyond shameful.'
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman representing Georgia, said that Rittenhouse was 'one of the good guys'.
She attacked Biden for saying he was concerned at the verdict, warned that he was inciting violence, and angrily singled out fellow members of Congress who had condemned Rittenhouse's actions.
'Kyle Rittenhouse ACQUITTED on ALL charges! May Kyle and his family now live in peace. Those who help, protect, and defend are the good guys. Kyle is one of good ones. 
'@JoeBiden is angry & concerned that the jury found Kyle Rittenhouse NOT GUILTY after being shown mountains of evidence proving his innocence. 
'Biden calling for “peaceful protest” now against the verdict. We all know what it means when the left calls for“peaceful” protest..
And Lauren Boebert, the Colorado congresswoman who has made defense of the Second Amendment a pillar of her policies, tweeted: 'Today is a great day for the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense. Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty on all counts! Glory to God!'
Progressives, however, expressed dismay at the verdict.
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they’re not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people. To call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
Rittenhouse did not take a gun across state lines before the shooting: he picked it up from a house in Kenosha.
Cori Bush, a congresswoman representing Missouri who is considered part of 'The Squad' of recently-elected progressives, said the verdict was 'white supremacy in action'.
'The judge. The jury. The defendant. It's white supremacy in action,' she tweeted. 
'This system isn’t built to hold white supremacists accountable. It’s why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free.  
The jury — a couple of them wearing masks — showed no emotion as the verdicts were read after four torturous days of deliberation and weeks of testimony.
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.

COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
DISMISSED - COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it
Rittenhouse's mother Wendy was in the public gallery and burst into tears as the verdicts were read, while Rittenhouse victim Joseph Rosenbaum's fiancée and victim Anthony Huber's girlfriend and great aunt tearfully listened as their loved ones' killer walked free. 
'I’m hurt. I’m angry. I'm heartbroken.' 
Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Progressive Caucus, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
The district attorney for San Francisco, Chesa Boudin - considered one of the most liberal DAs in the country - also criticized the verdict.
'This verdict demonstrates that our work to make our legal system equal, fair, and just is more urgent than ever. Prosecutors have a critical role to play in criminal justice reform and securing equal justice under the law. 
'We will continue our fight for justice.' 
As the first verdict was read Friday afternoon, Rittenhouse, 18, started to shake as he fought back tears. But by the end he could hold them no longer and he collapsed into his chair, then hugged defense attorney Corey Chirafisi. 
Immediately after the verdict was read, Rittenhouse, dressed in a navy blue suit and purple shirt and tie, was whisked out of the courtroom and into a waiting SUV. He was seen smiling as he was driven away. 
Two men in the public gallery gave each other a high-five but apart from that the 'audience' — as Judge Bruce Schroeder called them — remained quiet and filed out of the room.
Clearly disappointed, prosecutor Thomas Binger, who has been heavily criticized for his actions during the case, sat back in his chair, looked at the ceiling, and issued a sigh as the verdict came in. 
Defense attorney Mark Richards slapped the table  after the fifth not guilty verdict was read. 
All that was left was for Schroeder to complement the jurors for being attentive and co-operative. 'I couldn't have wished for a better jury,' he said before reminding them playfully that they are eligible to be selected again in four years' time.
He also told them that they had the right to discuss the case with the media if they wanted, but told them they also had the right not to. Their names have not been released and he said any media requests to talk to them would be handled by the court and passed on to the jurors. 
Now Kenosha is on edge to see whether it descends into violence again. 
Protestors from both sides milled on the courtroom steps — one white man saying how proud he was of Rittenhouse and the verdict, standing feet from a black woman railing about white justice.
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that has threatened to derail proceedings more than once.
Outside the court, defense lawyer Mark Richards said Rittenhouse was feeling a 'huge sense of relief' at the verdict.
'He is on his way home, he wants to get on with his life,' Richards said.
Richards revealed that the defense team had two mock trials, one with Rittenhouse giving testimony and one without and it was clear from the jury reaction that he had to go on the stand.
He also said the jury deliberations were longer than any other case he had been involved in. 
Richards said he believed the Rittenhouse family would move out of the area because of the number of death threats they have received.
'Kyle is in counseling for PTSD. He doesn't sleep at night,' he said.
'Eventually some anonymity will come back to him but I don't think he will continue to live in this area.'
He said Rittenhouse plans to be a nurse.
Richards also criticized prosecutor Thomas Binger. 'Justice is done when the truth is reached. Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth. It's not about winning,' he said.
But he praised Judge Schroeder, saying he had presided over a 'fair trial.'
'He gives you a fair trial as a defendant — but you don't want him to sentence your client,' he said, commenting on his reputation for handing out stiff sentences.
'If we had lost we know what would happen, he would have gotten life in prison. We asked for a fair trial and we got one.'
He defended Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the from a tumbler the jurors who would become alternates, saying the defense team was 'devastated' that three of the jurors they considered most on their side were barred from the final deliberations. 
Binger had made it clear earlier in the week that he would not comment whatever the outcome of the case.
But his boss Kenosha County District Attorney Mike Graveley issued a statement saying: 'We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations.
'Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.'
Graveley added a plea for calm. 'We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.'
The family of Rittenhouse victim Anthony Huber said in a statement, 'Today's verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son. It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people.'
About an hour after the verdict was announced a woman collapsed from what was believed to be an epileptic seizure outside the courthouse.
Police cleared demonstrators as an ambulance rushed to the scene.
The day started quietly as Judge Schroeder went through a docket of other cases. He arrived at the court shortly after 9am, stopping outside to chat with a group of photographers — jokingly asking why there were so many people around neoclassical courthouse which dates back to 1850.
Unlike nearly every other judge anywhere in the country, Schroder makes a point of walking to his chambers through the public gallery in the eggshell-blue-painted court, decorated with oil paintings of local legal luminaries.
Walking with a slight limp, he greeted reporters, court staff and lawyers as he passed through.
The first three hours of the day's proceedings were quiet with a growing feeling in the court that the jurors were hopelessly deadlocked and no verdict would be coming before the weekend. Schroeder stayed in his chambers for most of the time.
But around noon, the judge ordered that the outer door to his chambers should be closed — for the first time in the trial. From then it was clear that the case was about to come to a close.
A few minutes later prosecution and defense attorneys came into the room along with Rittenhouse, who had been spending time outside the courtroom in a private room on the third floor.
Schroeder announced that the jurors had finally reached their verdict and made his warning to the public gallery not to react. 'As you can see there are several members of law enforcement present and you will be whisked out of here if there is any reaction,' he warned.
Then the jury of seven women and five men filed in, taking their seats to the judge's left.
Schroeder told Rittenhouse to face the jury and 'hearken' to what they had to say.
 Rittenhouse was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other counts for killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz on August 25, 2020. 
Demonstrators have been gathered outside the Kenosha Courthouse all week, as Evers called in 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard to counter the expected protests.  ",-2
1813,"ROLF BUCH has no time to rest on his laurels. On October 4th the chief executive of Vonovia, Germany’s biggest residential-property firm, managed after a long ordeal to seal the creation of Europe’s biggest such company through a merger with Deutsche Wohnen (DW), its main rival. But DW comes with a new headache. In a non-binding referendum last month Berliners backed a proposal obliging all private firms that own more than 3,000 flats to sell them to the city, which could rent them out more cheaply. DW owns more than 110,000 flats in Berlin. Vonovia has another 43,000. A quarter of the combined firm’s properties are in the German capital (see chart).

Mr Buch’s deal with DW almost did not happen, which would have probably sent the 56-year-old Rhinelander into premature retirement. After trying and failing to buy DW in 2015 with a hostile bid, Mr Buch launched another takeover offer in May, this time with the agreement of Michael Zahn, the chief executive of DW. That €18bn ($22bn) all-cash deal collapsed in July after failing to win the approval of at least half of DW’s shareholders.

Mr Buch did not give up. He increased his offer slightly. More unusually, DW’s board agreed to issue primary shares without pre-emption rights and sell them directly to Vonovia if Mr Buch needed more help to get his deal done. The prospect of a deliberate dilution of existing shareholders by DW, which does not need additional capital, did not go down well with Davidson Kempner, an American hedge fund that owns 3.2% of DW, as well as a chunk of Vonovia. It said in a statement that it “raises serious corporate governance concerns”.
Union Investment, a German asset manager, and Deka, a German bank, which also own stakes in DW, agree with Davidson Kempner. They do not buy DW’s justification that it is better to be taken over by a big rival than to have it as the biggest non-controlling shareholder. They speculate that DW’s bosses could have been lured by lucrative golden handshakes or the prospect of higher salaries after the merger and so may not have acted in the best interest of shareholders. Mr Zahn will become deputy CEO of the merged giant and Philipp Grosse, DW’s chief financial officer, will become its CFO. The episode has raised red flags among German investors. “We need to revise our rules on the duty of neutrality of the bosses of target companies,” says Marc Tüngler of the German association for the protection of shareholders.
DW dismisses any suggestions of impropriety. It responded in a statement that it was “common practice” for executives of a target company to join the enlarged group. Moreover, the planned capital increase to get the deal over the finishing line was in line with German securities law. And in the event, it never came to pass.
Even the fiercest critics of the deal concede that it is almost certainly irreversible. But if the merger was a pain, the expropriation vote may prove to be a migraine. The newly elected mayor of Berlin, Franziska Giffey, cannot ignore the burghers’ demands. These reflect a growing frustration with property speculation and rocketing rents. After reunification in 1990 housing costs in Berlin were lower than in other big German cities. Waves of immigrants and young Germans lured by cut-price flats, a hip art scene and a thriving job market have helped push rents up more than two-fold in the past ten years in real terms. Incomes have not kept up.
If, as looks likely, the mayor drafts the law and Berlin lawmakers pass it, affected property firms would sue to overturn it. The developers are likely to prevail in the federal Constitutional Court, which in April declared Berlin’s earlier experiment with rent control unlawful. But the case could drag on for a year or more.
Expropriation is not a solution for Berlin’s housing problems. Instead, Mr Buch says, construction may be part of one. If it were not for Berlin’s labyrinthine bureaucracy, Vonovia alone could have built 7,000 new flats in Berlin in the past few years. Ms Giffey should focus on speeding up building permits and reforming arcane building codes. The city needs fewer pitchforks and more shovels. ■

1816,"AS GOVERNMENTS SPEND more, it becomes increasingly important that they design their taxes carefully. Large European welfare states such as Sweden or Germany rely on growth-friendly value-added taxes (VATs) to help raise the vast quantities of cash they dole out. America can get away with a tax system that is grossly inefficient and needlessly complex only because the amount of revenue it raises overall is relatively small.
Small, but growing. Democrats in the House of Representatives are working out how to pay for President Joe Biden’s proposed social-spending bill, under which America would take a step in the direction of Europe with cash handouts for parents, child-care subsidies, green investment and more money for health care. The bill will probably be watered down in the Senate, but its present size is $3.5trn (1.2% of projected GDP) over the next decade. To help pay for it, lawmakers are proposing the biggest rise in taxes since 1993.

The plan does little to move towards the efficient taxation that would be necessary were America ever to have the European-style welfare state to which many Democrats aspire. That is because the proposals have been crafted with the goal of raising taxes only on households with incomes in excess of $400,000. The left thinks the rich do not pay their fair share. They would like to raise the top rate of federal income tax from 37% to 39.6%, and introduce a new 3% levy on earnings over $5m. They also want to raise the rate of federal tax on corporate profits in excess of $5m, from 21% to 26.5% (glossing over the fact that wages will fall at least a bit as a result). The plan would raise the rate of capital-gains tax and introduce various new levies.
The federal government has some scope to raise more money from high earners. But the idea that the main problem with the existing system that tax rates are too flat is wrong. In 2018 the lowest fifth of earners on average paid no net federal taxes at all. The top 1% paid a total rate (ie, after all deductions) of 30%, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Include state and local levies, and high earners face a marginal tax rate on each extra dollar they take home—the rate that matters for work incentives—which is middling by rich-country standards. Tax refunds for poor families are exceptionally generous. In 2019 a single parent of two children earning two-thirds of average pay faced total net labour taxes of only 10%, according to analysis by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. In egalitarian Sweden the rate was nearly 33%.

Inefficiency is a bigger problem in America than the failure of rates to be sufficiently progressive. Myriad deductions allow the very rich to disguise labour income as lightly taxed capital income. And unwillingness to levy a VAT, which is a tax on consumption, means America relies on taxes that deter work and investment. America is one of only three rich countries to collect more than 70% of its tax revenue from labour income and corporate profits. Sales taxes, levied by states and localities, are the only significant taxes on consumption.
The plan does far too little to boost efficiency. On the upside it would curtail the carried-interest loophole which lets investment managers class their fees as capital gains not income. It would reduce tax evasion by increasing enforcement, such as through audits of the tax-returns of high-earners, which more than pays for itself. And it would try to get more money from “pass through” companies, shells which let many professionals treat their income as business profits, incurring a lower tax rate.
Yet much is wrong with the Democrats’ plans. They appear to have forgone closing one of the most costly loopholes, which writes off capital gains when assets are inherited. The rise in corporation tax would take the total rate, including average state and local levies, to 31%, the third-highest among rich countries. In the House they seem uninterested in a carbon tax to combat climate change. And although it is not yet in the plan, they are talking about lifting the cap on an exemption, from federally taxable income, of money used to pay state and local taxes. The cap was introduced in 2017 under Donald Trump. Lifting it would further subsidise high-tax states and almost exclusively benefit the rich. Democrats would be raising top income-tax rates while narrowing the tax base—the opposite of good tax policy.
America’s economy would survive these proposals. But its creaky and cumbersome tax code should not be asked to support the size of government that many Democrats want in the long term, which includes, say, government-funded universal health care. Republicans know this is implausible. They typically oppose VAT because they see it as too convenient a source of funds. Democrats dislike the tax because it is mildly regressive. But there is a reason VATs underpin European-style welfare states: there is no desirable alternative. ■

1817," (CNN)At first, Cameron Lynch thought she would need prepared questions for the group to discuss in their first Zoom call. On the list of proposed topics: ""Have you had a hard time with friends in the pandemic?"", ""Are you planning to go back to school in the fall?"" and ""How have you been coping on a day-to-day basis?""But Lynch quickly realized that the group of immunocompromised college students didn't need questions to guide them. They just wanted to talk about their shared feeling of isolation during the pandemic. They bonded over the fact that people assume that all teens are healthy. They questioned whether their schools were taking the right measures to help those who are more at-risk. They vented about their friends not understanding their inability to leave the house without fear of contracting Covid.It's a virtual support group for immunocompromised students -- but its members don't call it that. They prefer the name ""Chronic and Iconic."" It all started with a social media post. Lynch, who has Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and a form of muscular dystrophy, opened up in a heartfelt letter to her friends and followers. ""While I have been preparing my body to fight the virus by running so my lung capacity can be better, eating healthy so that my body has enough nutrients to fight, and attempting to manage my disease (which is difficult with teenage hormones), it seems that everyone else has stopped caring,"" Lynch, 19, wrote in the letter, which she shared with CNN. ""My reality is different. My reality is isolating.""Her reality means she can't hang out with other college students who she said she sees on her social media feed ""flood to the beaches to drink their White Claws."" Instead, it means she sits alone in her bed ""afraid that no one cares.""Much to Lynch's surprise, the post resonated beyond her own social network. What started in July as a five-person Zoom hangout has turned into a 50-plus person group -- with students from across the US -- who have an ongoing GroupMe text messaging chain and frequent video calls.As US colleges and universities return -- either in-person, online only or both in what's called the ""hybrid model"" -- immunocompromised students are struggling to figure out how to navigate school during a pandemic. If their classes aren't offered online, some are forced to rearrange their schedules or risk falling behind. If they don't feel safe going to campus, some have to take a leave of absence. And throughout it all, some say the feeling of isolation has become overwhelming. ""I think one thing that the media and schools don't seem to understand is how these policies are impacting the mental health of their students,"" Lynch told CNN. ""By saying that in-person learning is essential, that's basically saying the community can function without us, and is better off when we're not there.""Covid puts life on hold for high-risk students In her letter, Lynch emphasized that her new normal means limiting time outside, even though she's sick of watching shows on Netflix. Unlike her peers, who can cautiously partake in activities, she feels she has to keep her life on hold until Covid is no longer a threat.And she's not alone. People with underlying medical conditions are more likely to become seriously ill if they get Covid-19. Some of them are young and most of them may not look sick at all. Millions of them are living with a compromised immune system.""People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,"" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes on its website. ""They may also remain infectious for a longer period of time than others with COVID-19.""Aside from worrying about getting infected, many of these immunocompromised students said they feel anxious about people -- specifically their peers -- disobeying health and safety guidelines.To date, there are more than 40,000 cases of Covid-19 among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- and is likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days.With social life trickling back to life on campuses, coronavirus outbreaks have hit places where students congregate, like fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning. While most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities.""With the pandemic, we don't have same sense of immortality as other people,"" Lynch said. ""This is very real for us. If we get a cold, we're in hospital for four days. We have to take it more seriously. If there aren't systems in place we have to make them.""They found comfort in a virtual communitySamantha Price, who has Type 1 diabetes, was among the first to respond to Lynch's letter.Price and Lynch met doing community theater in Richmond, Virginia, when they were 10 and nine years old, respectively. They bonded after realizing they both have diabetes. Over the years, they lost touch. But Price saw Lynch's post and reached out.Together, the two created the support group, which now includes people with a range of disabilities. ""We always say, 'Can you explain what that is please?' when people say what their disability is,"" Lynch said. ""We learn what everyone's going through, and how we can better support each other.""Price, a junior at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said it's been comforting to connect with people who understand how she's been feeling.""We're not normally surrounded by people who can relate to us,"" Price told CNN. ""It (the group) helps us have our feelings validated. If I'm super depressed or down in the dumps one day because my friends are going out and posting about it ... complaining isn't going to do anything,"" the 20-year-old said. ""But if I'm able to go to this group and say, 'this happened' 15 people like it or respond and say, 'I totally understand, that happened to me.'""Kaitlin Ahern, a 20-year-old student at Lafayette College, saw Lynch's social media post circulating online and reached out, eventually joining the group.""At this time it's very easy to feel ostracized and alone,"" said Ahern, who said she is immunocompromised because of a medication she takes. ""Because everyone's kind of paying attention to older people because they are immunocompromised, and younger people kind of expect all young people to be able to reckless and go out and party and everything."" Ahern's college is mostly remote for the semester, but she lives near other schools and sees students everywhere. ""I can't see my friends because they are all partying, they aren't willing to give up partying just to wear a mask and social distance (and) see me,"" she said. ""There's very little contact outside of my family. It's very lonely not interacting with anyone.""The virtual group has been ""amazing,"" especially as she struggled to connect to her existing social circle during the pandemic, she said.It's not surprising that the pandemic has affected the mental health of many nationwide, including young people. The National Center for Health Statistics and the US Census Bureau estimate that more than a third of Americans have experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety since spring.A recent CDC survey found that almost 41% of respondents are struggling with mental health issues stemming from the pandemic -- both related to the pandemic itself and the measures used to contain it, including physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.""A lot of students in the group text us, like 'Today was a terrible day, I'm so frustrated,'"" Lynch said. ""We're kind of like a help line in a sense. We're all at home so people respond very quickly.""Now, the group has gone beyond just sharing their problems.""People will talk about their highlight of the week, what quarantine crafts they've started,"" Price said. ""Some people will tell us about their personal lives. We've actually gotten to know these people really well.""Students ask peers to 'stay safely away'Aleah Colón-Alfonso, who has small fiber neuropathy, Lyme disease and accompanying secondary illnesses, said she felt the need to do something after noticing the lack of social distancing and facial coverings in Sarasota, Florida.Though the junior at the New College of Florida isn't part of the virtual support group, she has found a different way to help people who are in similar situations. In July, she officially launched a business called Stay Safely Away, which sells wearable merchandise that lets people display their immunocompromised status to urge others around them to ""stay safely away.""""Communicating behind masks and from a distance is difficult, so my idea and all my products attempt to serve as an unspoken and polite assertion,"" she told CNN.The company now sells more than 150 products, including beach towels, face masks, backpacks, school supplies, swimwear and stickers. All merchandise includes some sort of catchy yet informative message, like: ""I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised"" and ""science is real.""""'I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised' was a direct quote of what I wanted to say to every person I socially distanced myself from,"" she said. ""The phrase is essentially a shortened version of 'I really don't want to be rude -- but I also really don't want to end up on a ventilator!'"" Big plans beyond fallIn recent interviews with CNN, three developmental psychologists said they believe the majority of students are taking the pandemic seriously and acting accordingly. Viral videos of maskless parties and packed bars account for hundreds out of the nearly 20 million college students in the US, they said.But for at-risk students, the fear is still there -- and some must decide whether they feel safe enough to return to campus. ""The first feeling I had about universities and schools reopening was fear,"" Colón-Alfonso said. ""Fear of lives lost, fear of the academic and social impact, and fear of how to accurately make decisions in a time where everything seems uncertain and ever changing. I also felt a distinct trepidation towards institutions who need student tuition if they want to remain afloat.""Colón-Alfonso said her school has been very ""accommodating,"" and she feels safe returning to in-person learning. However, she added, ""I know that my experience is an exception to the rule. Seeing parties on the news, receiving texts from family and friends in college with stories of the danger they see every day is unsettling.""Many at-risk students remain wary of the risks. Lynch, who is in the UK with her family, and Price, who is in Virginia with her parents, said they have barely left their homes. But the time in quarantine has also given them a renewed sense of purpose -- and the two said they have big plans. Eventually, Lynch said, she and Price want to create a national organization for disabled students, with branches at universities and colleges.""There's college diabetes network which we're both apart of,"" Lynch said, ""but this would be for more disabilities -- physical, learning and invisible disabilities.""The two also hope to create a conference when it's safe to meet in person.""My goal is getting people to even acknowledge that there are young disabled people,"" Lynch said. ""It's really important.""For now, though, they continue to focus on building their community virtually -- and staying healthy while studying remotely.""We have an understanding that things suck right now,"" Price said. ""But (staying home) is what we have to do. It's going to be better for us in long run.""",0
1818," (CNN)Austria is going back into a national lockdown and plans to become the first country in Europe to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for all eligible people as the nation's coronavirus crisis deepens, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg announced Friday.Schallenberg said his government would look to impose the national vaccine requirement from February 1. Just under 66% of Austria's total population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lower rates in the European Union, where cases are surging.The national lockdown -- the first in Europe this fall -- starts Monday and will last for 10 days minimum, and could be extended for a further 10 days, Schallenberg told reporters at a news conference in Vienna.""We don't want a fifth wave. We don't want a sixth and seventh wave. We don't want to have this discussion next summer,"" Schallenberg said.The move comes only days after Austria took the step, unprecedented in Europe, of imposing lockdown measures for all those age 12 and older who are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Under those measures, which came into force on November 15, the unvaccinated were ordered to stay at home except for a few limited reasons, with the rules policed by officers carrying out spot checks on those who were out and about.Vaccinations are currently recommended for everyone aged 12 and above in Austria. On Monday, a pilot scheme to vaccinate children aged five to 11 got under way in Vienna, the national capital.Asked by CNN from what age the mandatory vaccination order would apply, the Austrian Chancellory said: ""Details are still to come, from what age and when you are considered fully vaccinated.""Austrian Health Minister Wolfgang Mückstein said Friday that schools and kindergartens would remain open during the upcoming national lockdown.But Schallenberg said it was possible for parents to take their children out of school if they so wished. ""This is always a challenge, for every family,"" he said. During the first Austrian lockdown, schools and kindergartens were closed.Mückstein also urged the wearing of FFP2 masks in all enclosed spaces and said employees could request the option of working from home where possible.Once the national lockdown is lifted, lockdown measures will remain in place for unvaccinated Austrians, Mückstein said, adding that everything needed to be done to avoid a ""fifth wave.""Schallenberg had harsh words for anti-vaccination activists as he addressed the news conference Friday, saying they had acted irresponsibly.""We have too many political forces in this country that are fighting against this [vaccination] vehemently, massively and publicly. That is irresponsible. This is actually an attack on our health care system,"" he said. ""And incited by these radical opponents of vaccination, by specious fake news, unfortunately too many of us have not been vaccinated. The consequence is overcrowded intensive care units and enormous human suffering.""Once it goes into effect in February, Austria's Covid-19 vaccination mandate will be the most stringent measure to control the coronavirus through vaccination yet seen in Europe.In Italy, all workers are required to have a ""green pass"" -- a health certificate that shows proof of either full vaccination, recent recovery from infection or a negative test within the previous 48 hours -- or risk a fine and suspension without pay. People must also show their ""green pass"" to enter public places like theaters and cinemas.However, only health care workers are required to be vaccinated.Italy's government has credited the ""green pass"" strategy with boosting vaccination rates.Neighboring Germany also announced plans Thursday to introduce targeted Covid-19 restrictions on the unvaccinated in order to tackle record levels of infections amid its fourth wave of the pandemic. Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel described the country's Covid-19 situation as ''dramatic'' and ''very worrying"" at a news conference Thursday, following a meeting with Germany's 16 federal state leaders on stricter Covid-19 measures.Merkel warned that intensive care unit beds were filling up much too quickly, adding it was ''high time to take action.""Speaking Friday at a news conference in Berlin, acting Health Minister Jens Spahn described Germany as being ""in a national emergency,"" adding ""we will not break this wave with vaccinations alone.""Asked about the possibility of a lockdown for everyone, Spahn told reporters ''we are in a situation where we cannot rule anything out.""Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's disease and control center, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), told reporters the country had never seen such high rates of infection as now in the whole of the pandemic.For a twelfth day in a row, Germany has reported record new Covid-19 cases. The RKI on Friday reported 52,970 new cases within the past 24 hours. More than 98,000 people have died as a result of coronavirus in Germany, according to RKI data.The country's current daily death rate stands between 200 and 300, Wieler said. However, due to Germany's record level of infections over the past 12 days, ""the death rate is likely to increase over the coming days,"" he said.France is also experiencing a rise in Covid-19 infection rates, but French President Emmanuel Macron has said a lockdown of the unvaccinated is ""not necessary"" given the country's Covid-19 strategy.""The countries who are locking down the unvaccinated are those who don't have the 'health pass' in place,"" Macron said, in an interview with French newspaper La Voix du Nord published late Thursday.France's ""health pass"" confirms the bearer's vaccination status or proof of a negative Covid test and has governed access to a wide variety of establishments in France since its introduction in July.Ireland, which has one of Europe's highest vaccination rates, with 89.1% of people over the age of 12 having been immunized, imposed a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs from Thursday as the country faces a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections.",0
1819,"New York (CNN Business)The oil market has gone from booming to busting, much to the relief of inflation-weary American drivers ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.US crude tumbled to a fresh seven-week low on Friday, settling at $76.10 a barrel. The slide is good news for American drivers hurt by the seven-year high in gasoline prices — a crunch that has soured consumers' views on the US economy. ""We will definitely see some pricing relief on gasoline at the pump,"" Tom Kloza, president of the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN on Friday, adding that the relief will be ""feather-like as opposed to plunges.""After a relentless rise, the national average gas price has finally leveled off at $3.41 a gallon, according to AAA. That's roughly flat from a week ago.""It looks for now as though the 2021 peaks have been established,"" Kloza said.Lockdown jittersUnfortunately, one of the catalysts for Friday's tumble in the market is another ominous development on the Covid front: Austria announced plans Friday to impose a national lockdown, the first in Europe this fall, in a bid to reverse a spike in Covid-19 cases.The lockdown is raising fears in the oil market of tough new health restrictions elsewhere that will slow the economic comeback and eat into energy demand.""The demand signals today are overwhelmingly bearish,"" Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a note on Friday. ""The risk is real in Europe, especially if Austria's move to lockdown has a domino effect across the continent. If Germany follows suit, sub-$80 price levels may be here to stay.""Will China and America team up?Beyond the lockdown fears, oil markets remain jittery over the specter of the United States and China teaming up to intervene in the previously red-hot energy markets.Since crashing to negative-$40 a barrel in April 2020, US crude has climbed as much as $125 a barrel because supply simply hasn't kept up with demand. OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have only gradually increased production. US oil companies haven't been in a rush to add supply either.A coordinated release from two of the world's biggest energy consumers would have a bigger impact than if the Biden administration acted alone to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Officials in China put out a statement on Friday suggesting that a release of barrels from the country's emergency reserve is on the table.""The bureau is pushing forward with crude oil release-related work at the moment,"" authorities that oversee China's strategic oil reserves said in a statement to CNN.According to a readout published by the White House, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed during their virtual summit this week the ""importance of taking measures to address global energy supplies.""A coordinated release by the United States and China could also be used as a bargaining tool to get OPEC+ to open up the taps, after months of refusing to do so.""There is firepower with a concerted effort,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.'Short-term fix'Still, this is not a long-term solution, as releasing barrels from emergency reserves doesn't solve the underlying supply-demand mismatch. And these emergency reserves hold a finite amount of oil — crude that is typically reserved for supply shocks, not surging demand amid an economic recovery.Releasing barrels today leaves the reserves with less of buffer for the next crisis, whether it's a hurricane, a conflict in the Middle East or another supply shock.Goldman Sachs reiterated in a new report to clients on Thursday that a coordinated release would ""only provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit.""The Wall Street bank argued this coordinated release is now ""fully priced in,"" meaning the impact to markets has already happened.""In fact, if such a release is confirmed and manages to keep oil prices depressed in the context of low trading activity into year-end, it would create clear upside risks to our 2022 price forecast,"" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote.In other words, at least some on Wall Street are already looking past this emergency intervention — before it even happens — and predicting higher prices ahead.",0
1820,"LOCK AND DAM 25 on the upper Mississippi River is testament to how good American infrastructure can be. Stretching nearly 1,300 feet (400 metres) across the water, the concrete-and-steel structure is a crucial link in the system that connects Midwestern fields to Southern ports and thence to Asian markets. Roughly 60% of America’s corn and soy exports pass through it every year. But it is almost 100 years old, and engineers wage a constant battle to keep it operational. It has the same capacity as when it was built, while boats have grown bigger. “How many highways built in the 1930s still have the same number of lanes now?” asks Andy Schimpf, a manager at the lock.
Salvation may be at hand. On November 5th the House of Representatives passed a five-year, $1trn bill to repair and upgrade America’s ageing infrastructure. About $2.5bn has been allocated to inland waterways, and Mr Schimpf is optimistic that some will go towards rebuilding Lock and Dam 25, doubling the size of its chamber. Today, workers sometimes need to break apart barges to get them through, and then reassemble them on the other side, which can take up to three hours. A bigger lock could reduce transit time to 30 minutes.

Hundreds of similarly delayed and neglected public projects around America will get a big boost from the infrastructure bill, which President Joe Biden will soon sign into law (it long ago passed the Senate). It includes $40bn of new funding for fixing bridges, the largest investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. There will be nearly $70bn for passenger rail, aimed both at clearing years-old maintenance backlogs and bringing service to new areas. Another $65bn should ensure that every American has access to high-speed internet. And the list goes on and on, from highways to airports and the electricity grid to water pipes.
For years American infrastructure has suffered from under-investment. It would take $2.6trn over the next decade to get it up to scratch, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), a professional body (albeit one with an interest in spending more). The bill will not fix everything. But it could be the beginning of a process that will make a real difference.
How big a difference? Roughly half the headline amount would have been expected as part of regularly budgeted maintenance, meaning that about $550bn actually constitutes new spending, to be disbursed over five years. That might not sound like much, but it is. From 2022 to 2026 federal infrastructure spending will rise from about 0.8% of annual GDP to 1.3%, well above the trend of the past four decades. Adie Tomer of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, says that is nearly the same average level as during the New Deal, which helped lift America’s fortunes after the Great Depression.
As a rough rule of thumb, an additional $100bn per year spent on infrastructure could boost growth by about a tenth of a percentage point when the digging actually begins, and potentially more if it catalyses additional private-sector investment, notes Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley, a bank. In the longer term, she estimates, a sustained expansion of infrastructure spending could support productivity and raise America’s potential growth by as much as a fifth of a percentage point, a big deal for a large, mature economy. “That’s why whenever you talk to economists, infrastructure is the stuff that we go to bed at night dreaming of,” says Ms Zentner.
Getting a positive return will, of course, require the money to be allocated well. Considering the shortfalls in investment over the years, it should not be hard to find good projects. On average a water main breaks every two minutes somewhere in America, while nearly half of all roads are in bad shape, according to the ASCE. In some cases the investments will not generate new growth so much as defend America’s existing strengths. Take the locks on the upper Mississippi: they help American soyabeans compete against Brazilian ones. Labour is much cheaper in Brazil, but transportation is better in America. Keeping the locks in good shape underpins that. “If you were to close any of them down for a few months, it would cost us billions of dollars,” says Steve Censky, CEO of the American Soybean Association.
Just about doubling the federal government’s expenditure on infrastructure overnight could lead to waste, however. Cost overruns often bedevil American infrastructure projects. It is more expensive to build rail in America than in almost any other country, according to Transit Costs Project, a research group. The price of building highways has also soared. That just about anyone can mount a legal challenge against public works in their vicinity is part of the problem, leading to delays and missed budgets. And the current backdrop is hardly propitious, with supply-chain congestion affecting even the most basic home-building projects.
On the positive side of the ledger, the bill creates space for private investors to join the government’s efforts, which could both enlarge total spending and impose more financial discipline. Any city or state seeking federal funding for transport projects costing more than $750m will be required to evaluate whether partnering with private-sector investors would deliver better results. Some projects, such as the development of the first-ever national network of chargers for electric vehicles, naturally lend themselves to co-operation with the private sector, given that is where the technology resides. The government also wants companies to pitch in to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change. Grant programmes, useful in attracting private investment in water systems, are likely to be expanded. “This bill can potentially create a framework for ongoing and necessary public and private investment in infrastructure,” says Aaron Bielenberg of McKinsey, a consultancy.
But a dose of scepticism is also useful. Ultimately, the amount that America spends on infrastructure is a direct result of the amount that Americans are willing to be taxed. And that, by the standards of other rich countries, is not very much. “Ten years from now, I think we will look back and say that this bill was a historic investment, a great expansion of investments that were neglected,” says Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and a former adviser to President Barack Obama. “But people are still going to be saying, well, why don’t we have high-speed rail all over the country?” Even so, better to fix roads, expand ports and lay broadband cables than not.■

1821,"Editor’s note: this story has been updated to take in the release of official preliminary results
THE ATRIUM of the Willy Brandt House, the Berlin headquarters of Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD), erupted in cheers on the evening of September 26th, as an exit poll suggested that the centre-left party had a narrow lead in Germany’s national election. Preliminary official results published the next morning made clear that Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s candidate to replace Angela Merkel in the chancellery, had secured an early edge. They gave the SPD 25.7% of the vote, ahead of the conservative Christian Democrats and their Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), on 24.1%. 

The two parties once commanded over 90% of the vote in Germany. That this number has fallen to around 50% explains why, whatever the final result, Germany is now entering a lengthy period of uncertainty. Assuming that a continuation of the current CDU/CSU-SPD “grand coalition” is ruled out, whoever leads the next government will need to persuade both the Green Party and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) to join them in coalition. That will not be an easy task—not least because Mr Scholz and Armin Laschet, the CDU/CSU candidate, each claimed a mandate to form a government. The leaders agreed they should try to get a government in place by the end of the year, but complex negotiations could upset that timetable. (Angela Merkel will remain chancellor until a new government can be formed.)
In the one case, Mr Laschet would lead a “Jamaica” coalition. In the other, Mr Scholz would become chancellor at the head of a “traffic-light” coalition (the arrangements take their name from the parties’ colours, and Jamaica’s flag). Both would enjoy clear majorities. The SPD also won a huge victory in an election in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and a narrower one in the city-state of Berlin.
In contrast to previous elections, the early projections this year were sufficiently ambiguous for none of the party leaders to make extravagant claims. Perhaps the most important news of the night was that the FDP and the Greens have agreed to begin exploratory talks with one another before agreeing to negotiations with either of the bigger parties. The two parties disagree on much, but if they can assemble a joint position, perhaps including an agreement on the distribution of ministerial portfolios including the crucial one of finance, they will in effect be able to act as joint kingmakers.
For now, what is clear is that Mr Laschet has led the CDU/CSU to its worst-ever election result, down perhaps nine percentage points from the previous election in 2017, itself a historic nadir. The CDU/CSU will take some satisfaction that it has not slumped to the lows found in some recent polls, but the result remains a serious disappointment for a party that has long seen itself as a Kanzlerverein, or “chancellor’s club”. Mr Laschet acknowledged that the party could not be satisfied with its result.
The mood among the SPD’s troops, on the other hand, is bullish. A few months ago the party seemed unable to lift itself from a dismal 15% in the polls. After a strong campaign focused squarely on the unflappable Mr Scholz, they are now looking at a strong result some five points ahead of the 2017 score. Exit polls found a strong preference for Mr Scholz to become chancellor over Mr Laschet—and that the party had done particularly well with older voters. The SPD also looks headed for victory in a state election in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Its hopes of holding on to the city-state of Berlin, where another election was held, look uncertain after a late Green surge. 
The Greens, meanwhile, took just under 15% of the national vote, according to preliminary results. Given that the party was briefly leading in polls as recently as April, that will feel like a disappointment. Yet it will still count as by far the best result in its history. Michael Kellner, the party’s general secretary, said he was “having a hard time getting excited”, but chose to congratulate the SPD on a “great result”. That is a strong invitation to Mr Scholz to start work on a traffic-light coalition. The CSU had lately ruled out the possibility that the centre-right bloc might attempt to form a coalition if it came second in the election. That also gives an early advantage to Mr Scholz, who returned the Greens’ compliment. Much hard work lies ahead, and the complexity of the coalition constellation could well lead to surprises. But for now, it is advantage Mr Scholz.",2

ON SEPTEMBER 2ND 1859 C.F. Herbert, prospecting for gold in south-eastern Australia, saw something sublime in the evening sky. “A scene of almost unspeakable beauty presented itself, lights of every imaginable colour were issuing from the southern heavens,” he would later recall. “The rationalist and pantheist saw nature in her most exquisite robes. The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and final dissolution.”
Those who saw cataclysm in the auroral display were not exactly wrong: just ahead of their time. The Carrington event, as the geomagnetic storm Herbert observed came to be known, was the result of 100m tonnes of charged particles thrown off by the Sun a few hours earlier slamming into Earth’s magnetosphere, a protective magnetic sheath generated by currents in the planet’s liquid core. The electromagnetic effects of the onslaught did not just produce a truly spectacular display of the Southern Lights (and the Northern ones, too, visible as far south as Colombia). They induced powerful currents in any electrical conductors to hand. Some telegraph networks took on a life of their own, no longer needing batteries to generate signals.

Such effects mattered little 20 years before the advent of the light bulb. In today’s ubiquitously, fundamentally and increasingly electrified world a “coronal mass ejection” (CME) as large as that of the Carrington event could cause all kinds of chaos. Induced currents would topple electrical grids. Satellites would have their circuitry fried or be dragged from the sky as the outer atmosphere, bloated by the storm’s energy, rose up towards them.
How bad the effects of an off-the-charts CME might prove is up for debate. Some say a really big storm would knock the power out in various places for a few hours, as a moderate one did in Quebec in 1989. Others predict something little short of the end of days. That the world will some day find out who is right, though, is beyond debate. Solar physicists put the odds of a Carrington-level geomagnetic storm some time in the next ten years at around one in ten. Eventually one will come.
Geomagnetic storms are one of a small set of events found in the historical and geological record that present plausible threats of catastrophe. Pandemics are another, giant volcanic eruptions a third. Seeing how well—or how poorly—countries are currently coping with the only one of these catastrophes of which they have prior experience raises the question of how they might cope with the others.
Technology plays a crucial role in the hazards such events generate. It can bring surcease, as a vaccine might for a pandemic. It can bring vulnerability, as electric grids have when it comes to geomagnetic storms. And it can also bring forth new risks of its own. The most obvious are the technologies of internal combustion and nuclear weaponry, which made possible catastrophic global warming and war on an unprecedented, environment-shattering scale. It is possible that further techno-disasters may lie ahead—and that they may be the most serious of all, putting the whole human future in jeopardy.
In a recent book, “The Precipice”, Toby Ord of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University defines an existential risk as one that “threatens the destruction of humanity’s long-term potential”. Some natural disasters could qualify. An impact like that of the 10km asteroid which ushered out the dinosaurs 66m years ago is one example. A burst of planet-scouring gamma rays from a nearby “hypernova” might be another. A volcanic “super-eruption” like the one at Yellowstone which covered half the continental United States with ash 630,000 years ago would probably not extinguish the human race; but it could easily bring civilisation to an end. Happily, though, such events are very rare. The very fact that humans have made it through hundreds of thousands of years of history and prehistory with their long-term potential intact argues that natural events which would end it all are not common.
Do you feel lucky, punk?
For already existing technologically mediated risks, such as those of nuclear war and climate collapse, there is no such reassuring record to point to, and Mr Ord duly rates them as having a higher chance of rising to the existential threat level. Higher still, he thinks, is the risk from technologies yet to come: advanced bioweapons which, unlike the opportunistic products of natural selection, are designed to be as devastating as possible; or artificial intelligences which, intentionally or incidentally, change the world in ways fundamentally inimical to their creators’ interests.
No one can calculate such risks, but it would be foolish to set them at exactly zero. Mr Ord reckons almost anyone looking at the century to come would have to concede “at least a one in 1,000 risk” of something like a runaway AI either completely eradicating humanity or permanently crippling its potential. His carefully reasoned, if clearly contestable, best guesses lead him to conclude that, taking all the risks he cites into account, the chances of humankind losing its future through such misadventure in the next 100 years stands at one in six. The roll of a single die; one spin of the revolver chamber.
Mr Ord is part of a movement which takes such gambles seriously in part because it sees the stakes as phenomenally high. Academics who worry about existential risk—the trend began, in its modern form, when Nick Bostrom, a Swedish philosopher, founded the Future of Humanity Institute in 2005—frequently apply a time-agnosticversion of utilitarianism which sees “humanity’s long-term potential” as something far grander than the lives of the billions on Earth today: trillions and trillions of happy lives of equal worth lived over countless millennia to come. By this logic actions which go even a minuscule way towards safeguarding that potential are precious beyond price. Mr Ord, one of the founders of the “effective altruism” movement, which advocates behaviour rooted in strongly evidence-based utilitarianism, sees a concern with existential risk as part of the same project.
Risks that are merely catastrophic, not existential, do not tend to be the subject of such philosophical rumination. They are more amenable to the sort of calculations found in the practice of politics and power. Take the risk of a nuclear attack. According to Ron Suskind, a reporter, in November 2001 Dick Cheney noted that America needed new ways to confront “low-probability, high-impact” events. “If there’s a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon,” the vice-president said, “we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response”. Such responses included new wars, new government agencies (the Department of Homeland Security) and new executive powers, including warrantless surveillance.
If every perceived 1% risk were met with such vigour the world would be a very different place—and not necessarily a safer one. But it is striking that some risks of similar magnitude are barely thought about at all. Imagine Mr Cheney was considering the possibility of losing a city over a 20-year period. What else puts a city’s worth of people and capital at a 1% risk every few decades? The sort of catastrophic risks that crop up every millennium or so, threatening millions of lives and cost trillions. Perhaps they should be treated equally seriously. As Rumtin Sepasspour of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University puts it: “Governments need to think about security as just one category of risk.”
Carrington events are a good example. The most devastating effect of a really large CME would probably be on the transformers in electrical grids: gigantic, purpose-built machines that step voltage down between the long-range transmission grid and the distribution grid which runs lower-voltage power into homes, businesses and hospitals.
Strong enough induced currents could damage some of these transformers beyond repair. Because it typically takes between six and 12 months to get a replacement transformer made—and only a few countries have the industrial capacity to make them—that could leave grids crippled for some time. “If you simultaneously lose the ability to pump water, to pump fuel, to communicate, lose eyes in the sky, you pretty quickly get into territory that’s never really been explored before,” says Dan Baker, the director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Stockpiling backup transformers could help mitigate some of those problems. But large transformers are not commodity items. “They don’t have a big warehouse holding these things ready to roll out,” says Mr Baker. Redundant local supplies, such as backup generators, would also help. Mr Baker is not sure, though, that enough is being invested in them.
Sudden impact
In general, scientists and policy wonks who think about these things suspect that grid operators are not as prepared as they should be for a Carrington level storm. But some see progress. William Murtagh, who works at the Space Weather Prediction Centre in Boulder, says American policy on space weather has come a long way, to the point where there are now bipartisan bills going through Congress and that grid operators are being required to certify the excess voltages their systems can cope with.
America does, at least, have a solid plan: the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, published in March 2019. It also has an early warning system. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the space-weather centre in Boulder, also runs a satellite called DSCOVR. Rather than orbit the Earth, DSCOVR circles a point on a line between the Earth and the Sun—the point about 1.5m kilometres inward from Earth where the two bodies’ gravitational attractions balance each other out. Conceived of mainly as a way of looking back at an Earth spinning in eternal sunshine, DSCOVR also measures the stream of charged particles flowing past it from the Sun. When a storm passes by, the satellite’s operators down in Boulder will hear about its approach from DSCOVR between 15 minutes and an hour before the brunt of it hits the magnetosphere, depending on its speed.
There is little planning anywhere for what to do in response to a volcanic eruption large enough to cool and dry the climate around the world, as the eruption of Tambora, a volcano in Indonesia, did in 1815. The fact that the stratospheric sulphate particles which bring about such cooling leave a distinctive residue in glaciers and ice sheets reveals the frequency of these eruptions (see chart 1). But there is no pattern which says when another one might be due.

Careful remote monitoring of the world’s volcanoes, including those that are apparently dormant, should reveal if one is likely to blow in a big way. Again, satellites can play a key role. A technique called radar interferometry makes it possible to see when mountains start to deform as a result of the pressure of the magma building up beneath and within them. Scientists at the University of Bristol are using such data from past eruptions to train machine-learning systems on how to see future ones. Very large eruptions should be fairly easy to anticipate; but quite how large one will prove, and thus quite what effects to expect, will be hard to say in advance.
There are also projects devoted to looking for potentially hazardous asteroids. Here, though, the threat is not what it was. When people began to worry about asteroid impacts in the 1980s, the focus was on events smaller than the dinosaur-killer—too rare to worry about—but still big enough to disturb the climate in the way a very large volcanic eruption does, and thus do damage worldwide rather than just wiping clean some random, and probably sparsely inhabited, part of the planet’s surface. Theoretical models of the population of near-Earth objects suggested there might be 1,000 or so big enough to wreak such havoc, of which only a hundred or so had been discovered. Subsequent observation has found most of the rest of them, and they are all, at the moment, keeping a safe distance. As of 2019 the data suggested that only around 43 near-Earth objects of a potentially climate-changing stature were still to be discovered, according to Alan Harris of MoreData!, a research outfit.
As the need to worry about big asteroids has diminished, though, interest in spotting smaller ones has grown—as has an urge to be able to swat them aside. Next year America will launch a space mission called DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) which will change the orbit of a small asteroid orbiting a larger one, thus demonstrating the first step towards a “planetary defence” capability. It is an exciting, dramatic idea. If your aim were to effectively fund ways of lowering the death toll in future catastrophes, though, it would probably not strike you as the best use of $300m. Investing in early-warning systems for pandemics (see article) would seem a much better bet.
Every which way
It is possible to imagine better early-warning systems for pandemics, solar storms and volcanic eruptions, and carefully considered plans which would use that knowledge to reduce the hazard. What of the other big bads?

Existing anthropogenic risks are already quite well dealt with. There are aspects of climate change that could and should be better monitored—methane sources, for example, and changes in soil moisture—but the subject is hardly systematically understudied. It is in the nature of nuclear weaponry that its possessors spend a great deal of time monitoring each other’s capacities and intentions. As for those trying to develop nuclear weaponry covertly, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation operates a remarkably acute network of monitoring stations that brings together seismometers, radioisotope sensors and detectors of low-frequency sound waves which makes setting off a nuclear weapon of any size without being noticed effectively impossible.

Hazards that do not yet exist but may soon come to pass present a harder problem. The prospect of synthetic biology producing advanced bioweaponry is a fitting target for traditional intelligence methods, coupled with the sort of monitoring that might be used to detect novel natural pathogens, too. Countermeasures might emerge from “precision medicine” approaches built around platform therapies which can be reprogammed for various diseases. Deadly AIs, though, are a different kettle of pseudofish. Today’s AI systems, powerful as they are at recognising patterns, are worrying only to the extent that people use them in worrying ways; in themselves they are no more dangerous, or sentient, than stamp collections. That may change. Most in the field seem to think that one day AIs will be able to give humans a real run for their money. But their views as to when vary widely (see chart 2). Such disparity does not mean no threat will emerge. It does suggest that no one really knows what it may look like.
As a field and a threat, though, AI, like synthetic biology, does have the advantage of emerging from an open academic culture. Its expert practitioners eschew closed publication and discussion. This makes it plausible, at least, to monitor both fields.
Getting such risks taken seriously will never be easy. It is to some extent contrary to human nature. Humans assume that the future will be like the past; they prepare for things they have experience of. Mr Murtagh says that grid operators at high latitudes take solar storms more seriously than others do because of experiences like that of Quebec in 1989. Countries hit hard by SARS have, by and large, done better against covid-19 than those which never had to get to grips with the previous pandemic. When it comes to the truly novel, no one will have that core of experience to build on.
Where experience fails, though, science and imagination may sometimes fill in. Humans often look to the future like Herbert’s superstitious and fanatical mates staring up at the Carrington event’s strange skies, filled with “dire forebodings”. But it can be seen in other ways. You do not have to believe in trillions of people living the good life for ever. Just that there are things to come which are worth caring about, and worth protecting from those threats that reason reveals.■",2
1823,"WHEN THE news finally comes it triggers a range of emotions. Most people told when and where they will receive their first shot of covid-19 vaccine speak of their relief, delight, even their elation. One person danced around the room, another “screamed a bit”, yet another felt giddy. “It feels”, says one, “that my life’s about to begin.” But for some, there are other emotions in play: concern, fear, even anger.
Almost as soon as biomedical researchers began working on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19, people concerned with public health began to worry about “vaccine hesitancy”. It can sound trivial, even foolish, but it regularly costs lives. Hesitancy is a large part of the reason that few young Japanese women get themselves vaccinated against human papillomavirus, and thus are more likely than vaccine-accepting young women elsewhere to contract cervical cancer. Widespread hesitancy during worldwide campaigns against covid-19 could cost many lives, both among the hesitant and among their fellow citizens. Scott Gottlieb, who led America’s drug regulator, the FDA, from 2017 to 2019 (and who is also on the board of Pfizer, a vaccine-maker) argued in a recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that the main challenge to vaccination efforts in America could soon move from supply and logistics to individual reluctance to be vaccinated.

In Britain, a country generally quite keen on vaccination, about 15% of those offered a covid jab so far have refused it. With 13m mostly elderly Britons vaccinated as of February 10th, that suggests almost 2m people who could have been vaccinated have not been. When, eventually, social distancing measures are reduced, those people will remain vulnerable to infection. What is more, that level of refusal, combined with the fact that children are not being vaccinated and that new variants of the virus are less tractable to vaccination, means the country may never see the “herd immunity” that population-wide vaccination programmes tend to aim for—the state in which people neither previously infected nor vaccinated are so few and far between that the virus is hard put to find them. And the level of refusal could grow in months to come; younger people, perhaps because they feel in less danger, seem less keen on the vaccine.

Hesitancy is promoted and spread by a hard core of proselytising “anti-vaxxer” voices whose misinformation and downright lies about microchips, infertility and damage to DNA have spread to the four quarters of the internet. They have been helped by large online misinformation campaigns run by China and Russia seeking to undermine confidence in Western vaccines. But hesitancy is a broader and more complex phenomenon than that. Some are worried, not opposed; some reject specific vaccines while accepting various others; some are adamant, some persuadable, some, in the end, willing to get vaccinated despite their reservations. People interpret vaccines in the light of their own experiences, relationships and trust in authority. Such subtleties make the molecular biology behind the vaccines seem simple in comparison.
There is nothing new about this complex set of fears. To introduce anything other than food into your body or blood is always likely to be an emotionally freighted experience. When Edward Jenner, a British doctor, began vaccinating people with cowpox to defend them against smallpox in the late 1790s there was immediate disquiet. Critics said the idea of vaccination was repulsive and ungodly; cartoonists showed people who had been vaccinated sprouting cow’s heads. But elite medical and political opinion fell in line. Thomas Jefferson was a fan. Napoleon vaccinated his armies, writing that “Jenner...has been my most faithful servant in the European campaigns.” In Sweden vaccination was compulsory in 1803, in Bavaria in 1807; both countries saw smallpox rates plummet.

In 1853 vaccination was made compulsory for all infants in England and Wales with parents who failed to comply liable to a fine or imprisonment. Opposition to this infringement on personal liberty promptly grew, even more so after the law was strengthened in the 1870s.
Victorian anti-vaxxers spread misinformation eerily similar to today’s. In 1878 the National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Reporter told its readers that vaccination could cause diseases including diphtheria, abscesses, bronchitis and convulsions. “On the whole”, it wrote, “it is a greater evil to humanity than smallpox itself!” In echoes of today’s concerns about Big Pharma, the Reporter speculated that compulsory vaccination was a plot by the medical establishment and averred that faithful obedience to the “sacred laws of health” would provide superior protection. It is hard to put a sliver of organic carrot between this sanctimony and the notion that nasty viral pathogens can be warded off by raising children “naturally” and using alternative medicines.
Nevertheless smallpox vaccination became near universal. And then in 1977, 177 years after Benjamin Waterhouse, a Harvard professor and correspondent of Jefferson’s, published his pamphlet “A Prospect of Exterminating the Small-pox”, it became obsolete. The disease was wiped out. No other human disease has yet followed it to oblivion, though polio is close. But many death tolls have been slashed.
Vaccinations have become the most successful public health measure in history. About 85% of one-year-olds around the world now receive all three doses of the combination vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Public support for this is high; nine in ten people worldwide think vaccines are important for children. But there are variations. Support for childhood vaccination is lower in North America, Europe and Russia than in Africa, Asia and South America, and there are pockets where it dips dangerously. What is more, the success of long-running childhood vaccination campaigns does not necessarily translate into acceptance of novel vaccines for adults.
Against complacency
Towards the last quarter of 2020 polls on vaccine hesitancy spurred mounting concern among public health officials. In September a significant number of British people said they were unlikely to get one. A month later, in a STAT-Harris Poll in America, only 58% said they would—down from 69% a month previously. Though Britain bounced back, other countries have seen worrying drops since (see chart 1).

But such polls come with caveats. One is what psychologists describe as the “intention-behaviour gap”; humans are sufficiently complicated that what they say and what they do can be very different things. A second is that polls are snapshots of a process in flux. Vaccine hesitancy is extremely fluid in time and space, subject to all manner of influences. A poll is an instantaneous map of temperatures, when what you need is a moving forecast.
One of the main vaccine-weather forecasters is Heidi Larson, a professor of anthropology, risk and decision science at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She is also the founding director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, which monitors global concerns about vaccines. Looking at her latest survey of sentiment toward covid-19 vaccines in 32 countries Dr Larson sees storms brewing in Lebanon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—two countries in which the political climate is tense.
Hesitancy in the DRC might seem surprising; novel vaccines recently helped quash an outbreak of Ebola there. But Dr Larson says that unlike Ebola, which people have had to live with for almost half a century, covid-19 is new and brings new distrust. Maître Donat, a lawyer in Kolwezi, a mining city in the south of the country, bears out that case. “Here everyone thinks covid is a scam”, he says, “dreamed up by the whites, by Americans.”
Dr Larson worries about this because she has found that, in general, concerns about vaccines that arise in Africa spread much more quickly than in higher-income countries: “It is quite explosive.” Last year a comment by a French doctor about using Africa as a testing ground for vaccines spread like wildfire across Francophone Africa. He apologised, but the damage was done. There are now reports of rising hesitancy, at least partly tied to trust in government, in South Africa and Nigeria, where plans are being laid to start vaccination.
Just as there is variation over time, so there is in space. Even in countries where there is a rush to get vaccinated, hesitancy can crop up in particular communities, particularly in marginalised groups: some groups distrust state authority—sometimes, given the history of medical experimentation, for sound historical reasons; some seek spiritual rather than temporal guidance on how to live their lives.
Naively, one might believe that education would be enough to change this. It is not. Take the reluctance of some American health-care workers to get vaccinated. This is not down to a lack of information or a failure to understand what vaccines offer. It can often reflect a lack of faith in their employers. As in many other parts of the world, nurses, long-term-care staff and others in similar jobs report feeling badly treated over the past year. They may have been put at risk of covid, or fallen ill, or struggled to obtain protective equipment. They will have seen a lot of death. They will mostly have done so on low pay. And they have either not succumbed to the disease or have survived it. This all disinclines them towards accepting the vaccines that their employers now want them to take.
A December survey of 16,000 employees of a health system in Pennsylvania revealed concerns about unknown risks and side effects. At the nadir 45% said they either did not want the vaccine at all or wanted to wait (see chart 2). One-fifth did not trust the rushed regulatory review. Others worried they were not actually at high enough risk for infection or disease. Hard refusals, though, soon began to wane. 

In general, a feeling that the government is cutting corners seems to drive hesitancy up. When Donald Trump appeared to be trying to rush approval along before the election Americans became more hesitant. Concerns have risen in Indonesia and India at the same time as there have been controversies about aspects of government vaccination programmes.
Another factor in hesitancy is peer-group sentiment transmitted through social networks. Parents who choose not to vaccinate children have a much higher percentage of people in their social networks with similar views. The same will be true of people who intend not to get vaccinated against covid-19.
Understanding how the hesitancy weather changes offers ways to modify it. Some are well known to advertisers. People are encouraged by the sight of happy people eagerly lining up to receive vaccines, or by politicians, royalty and celebrities rolling up their sleeves. They may also respond to the notion that something is in scarce supply. Since scares about the H1N1 flu vaccine in 2009 the French have been very dubious about vaccination. But since realising that their country has few doses to offer, their opinions have been changing. To refuse is one thing; to be denied another. Marine Le Pen, a right-wing nationalist who had previously said she would wait and see before getting vaccinated now says she will do so, a decision which is expected to be influential (and which will better position her to attack Emmanuel Macron on the issue in next year’s election campaign).
The bad news about changing the weather in this sort of way is that it can quickly change back again. Vinay Nair, boss of Lightful, a tech firm that works in the charity sector to enhance its use of technology, says that because vaccine sentiment is dynamic, so the response to it has to be too.
It is also important to reach vaccine-hesitant communities directly rather than through the media. In 2017 Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner at the Children’s Minnesota Hospital, told Modern Healthcare, a magazine, about intervening this way among Somali-Americans in Minneapolis after their under-vaccinated community suffered a serious measles outbreak. “We spend a great deal of time meeting imams in the community and ask them to partner with us.” Even with the help of social-media campaigns aimed at younger parents, it is slow, painstaking work. But it is effective.
Storm warning
Unfortunately, help through social media is far from the norm. The Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a not-for-profit group, is tracking 425 anti-vaccine accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube that it says spread covid misinformation; they have 59.2m followers between them, and the number is rising rapidly. The organisation says that while a minority of these anti-vaxxers act on the basis of profoundly held beliefs, about four-fifths have a financial motive as well, or instead. Half are entrepreneurs with businesses that promote alternative or oddball remedies such as homeopathic immunisation or a bleach nebuliser “with a 100% success rate”. The other half are conspiracists who profit from the online-advertising revenue their sites attract and the merchandise they sell.
The work of these groups is a lot easier than that of public-health workers: fear and uncertainty are easier to foster than trust and confidence, and inaction easier to encourage than action. In October last year representatives of the CCDH were present at a private online conference held by influential opponents to vaccination who, it says, saw a historic opportunity to reach larger numbers of supporters, and drive long-term vaccine hesitancy. They outlined three basic tools with which to do so: sow doubt about the seriousness of the threat posed by covid-19; spread concern about the safety of the vaccines; stress the untrustworthiness of experts.
These three basic messages will be adapted with selective reporting—making sure, for example, that Brazilians know that their president has said he will not be vaccinated—half-truths and lies. Ethnic minorities will be told that covid vaccines are unsafe for them, or part of a plot or experiment—something that will resonate in communities that remember stories of this in the past. Young people will be told taradiddles about fertility. The religious groups will hear that vaccines are not halal or contain fetal material. (It is true that the vaccine produced by AstraZeneca is grown in a cell line derived from material taken from a fetus in the 1970s; it is also true that the pope has deemed the use of such cell lines morally acceptable.)
A recent study in Nature using data from 2019 created a network map of 1,300 Facebook pages carrying pro- and anti-vaccine messages and their followers. Anti-vaccine pages were more numerous, faster growing and increasingly connected to pages containing undecided users. If current trends continue, the researchers predicted, anti-vaccine views will dominate online discussion in a decade. A new preprint by many of the same authors reports that the strengthening of online bonds that has been seen during the pandemic has given conspiracy theories greater access to mainstream parenting communities.
On February 8th, in the teeth of ongoing criticism, Facebook said it would remove false claims related to covid vaccines (see article). Many think the move has come too late—and that to shift the balance of power decisively will require further action. Mr Nair believes that tech companies need to amplify positive messages, stories and campaigns
“A mix of factors will challenge our plans to defeat covid-19, from new variants to supply issues. But vaccine hesitancy is a significant threat to population protection against covid-19,” says Dr Larson. And after emotional contagion has taken hold it is difficult to tamp down. As the French experience with the H1N1 vaccine has shown, once widespread a negative impression about a vaccine can be hard to shift.
At the moment, people are leaving vaccination centres happily, and tweeting and posting about their good fortune and success. They proudly display the badges and stickers that show they have received the vaccine. For now, public health is winning. But continued good news cannot be taken for granted; in this struggle, fair weather has to be fought for, not counted on. ■

1824,"IT WAS ONLY a question of time before Kabul fell, says A.S. Dulat, a former head of India’s top spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, speaking from Delhi. The only surprise was the speed of the Taliban’s advance, concurs the ex-boss of Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence, or ISI, Asad Durrani, speaking from Islamabad. The two old warriors nod in unison. Despite lifetimes spent jousting in the shadow war between India and Pakistan, the former foes seem happy to agree on the inevitability of the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. What they do not tell their Indian interviewer is how sharply different the implications of the change are for each of the South Asian rivals.
For India, the house-of-cards collapse of the 20-year-old Afghan democracy represents a strategic setback and a stinging humiliation. Since 2001 India has spent a non-trivial $3bn or so to bolster the American-installed regime. It built roads, dams, power lines, clinics and schools across the country. It trained Afghan officers, including women, in its military academies. It gave scholarships to thousands. India even presented a fancy new parliament, complete with fountains and a giant bronze dome. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, himself inaugurated it in 2015.

Besides losing all its investment in a secular, democratic Afghanistan, India has also lost strategic leverage. There were never Indian troops in Afghanistan, but its aid projects and four consulates certainly spooked the generals running the show in Pakistan. India’s close ties with the Afghan government gave its own security establishment a whiff of “over-the-horizon” influence that felt appropriate to an emerging superpower. When Pakistan-backed Islamists mounted terrorist attacks on India and stirred violence in its restive region of Kashmir, India could threaten to use its Afghan assets to stir trouble in Pakistan’s restive region of Balochistan. Now, with Mr Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government having stirred its own troubles in Kashmir, by stripping the region of autonomy in 2019, it must face the prospect of a new generation of Muslim Kashmiris inspired by the Taliban’s fanaticism.
Perhaps because its spies read the writing on the wall, or perhaps because its teachers and engineers increasingly risked being kidnapped, India had wound down its Afghan presence in recent years. Yet it was only in June that Indian envoys took the first tentative steps to engage with the Taliban. The reckoning with what an abrupt American departure from its backyard means for India has also been slow to settle. The Times of India, the country’s biggest-circulation English daily, voiced one common perception in a sour editorial on August 16th: “At a time when India has strategically hitched its wagon to the US, the Afghan situation should make New Delhi think twice about putting all its eggs in Washington’s basket.”
This is a conclusion that Pakistan, as well as its “all-weather friend” China, will be happy for India to draw. With a stagnant economy and stymied politics, India’s nuclear-armed neighbour has not had much to cheer about of late. So it is that even if urban Pakistanis have little affinity with the Taliban, many are crowing at the Islamists’ success. Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, went so far as to proclaim that Afghans had “broken the chains of slavery” with the West.

Mr Durrani says that Pakistan itself deserves no credit for the Taliban victory, except for having resisted pressure from America and its allies to crack down on the group. He is too modest. The original Taliban, or “students”, of the 1990s, were students in Pakistani madrassas. Certainly, after America’s invasion in 2001, the Taliban would never have survived their years in the wilderness without the haven provided by Pakistan.
That Pakistan has stood by the Taliban is especially striking, considering that an ideological affiliate based in Afghanistan, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), has terrorised Pakistan itself, for example by slaughtering more than 145 children and adults at an army-run school in 2014. Questioned about reports that the Taliban have released TTP leaders from the Afghan prisons, the Pakistani interior minister says airily that he hopes for an agreement between the two countries not to allow their soil to be used to attack the other. Luckily for Pakistan’s generals they are rarely held accountable for any violent “blowback” from the ISI’s nastier associates. Aside from the occasional diversion of a television interview, Mr Durrani can continue to enjoy his retirement in peace.",2
1825,"THE CAENOZOIC—the era of Earth’s history since an asteroid strike 66m years ago ended the dinosaurs’ reign—is often called the age of mammals. And mammals did, indeed, do well in the scramble to fill the ecological niches suddenly vacated by that catastrophe, for there are now about 6,500 species of them. But several other groups were equally, if not more successful. Birds (technically dinosaurs, too, by ancestry, though few think of them that way) have about 11,000 species. Lizards have 7,000.
And there is yet another set of terrestrial vertebrates that prospered post-impact, but which are sadly neglected by zoologists. These are snakes. With almost 4,000 representatives, they are not as speciose as mammals. But they are not far behind.

Snakes’ success is intriguing. Phylogenetically, in the way that birds are dinosaurs that sprouted wings, they are actually a group of lizards that lost their legs. But birds’ success is unsurprising. They were the only dinosaurs to master flight. By contrast, partial or total leglessness has evolved more than a score of times in lizards. Yet each abandonment of limbs, except by snakes, has led to only a handful of modern representatives.

In a study just published in PLOS Biology, Michael Grundler of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Daniel Rabosky of the University of Michigan shed light on the matter. They argue snakes’ unique success among legless lizards is a consequence of a huge diversification of their diets made possible by the new animal groups that flourished after the (non-avian) dinosaurs’ demise. To back their theory up, they put together information about the diets of 882 modern snake species. They then mapped this onto the best available understanding of snakes’ family tree.
The oldest snake fossils go back to the mid-Jurassic, about 170m years ago. These snakes were predators of invertebrates, mainly insects. Their diets thus matched those of most of the other groups of limbless lizards now alive. Just over 100m years ago, however, as the chart shows, Dr Grundler’s and Dr Rabosky’s analysis suggests some snakes started eating other lizards. This change of diet was presumably enabled by the evolution around that time of what might be thought of as snakes’ killer app—the equivalent, if you like, of a bird’s wings. This is the detachment of their lower from their upper jaw, which gives them their famous ability to swallow prey whole. Then, around 75m years ago, some snakes started adding other small vertebrates, such as frogs, to their diets.
But that was just the overture. As the chart shows, ophidian dietary diversification really got going in an epoch called the Eocene, which began 56m years ago, 10m years after the dinosaurs’ demise. It was during the Eocene that many groups of animals now familiar first emerged (including most modern orders of mammals). Snakes, preying upon this diversity, themselves diversified in response, developing such hunting tricks as the venoms for which they are notorious. The result is the plethora of slithery serpents found today. ■",2
1826,"IN SEPTEMBER 2019 Paulo Guedes, Brazil’s economy minister, told Congress that it could “make history” by keeping the budget under control, adding that “the political class shouldn’t be chasing ministers, begging for money.” Now Mr Guedes is backing an underhand government attempt to bypass the constitutional cap on public spending set in 2016, which was a crucial step towards righting the country’s finances. He and Jair Bolsonaro, the president, are presiding not just over a return to fiscal incontinence but also to other economic ills that have dogged Brazil: rising inflation, high interest rates and low growth. And the budget shenanigans have in turn created uncertainty about the future of the country’s flagship social programme.
In the election in 2018 Mr Bolsonaro’s alliance with Mr Guedes, a free-market economist, did much to persuade business people to vote for a former army officer of the hard right who had never before shown any interest in liberal economics. Mr Guedes promised radical reform of Brazil’s swollen and inefficient state. But this pledge has resulted only in some useful savings on pensions, legal independence for the central bank and minor regulatory simplifications. Now the reform drive is over, replaced by Mr Bolsonaro’s scramble for money to buy political support and popularity.

To stave off impeachment over his mismanagement of the pandemic and his family’s misdeeds (which they deny), Mr Bolsonaro allied with the centrão, a big coalition of conservative pork-barrel legislators. When covid-19 struck the government declared “a state of calamity”, allowing it to offer big temporary handouts despite the spending cap. Poverty fell in Brazil in 2020, bucking the regional trend, and Mr Bolsonaro’s popularity rose. In March the government won an emergency constitutional amendment, punching a hole in the spending cap, to allow at least some payments to continue. Now the president’s plunging approval rating is reducing his chance of a second term in next year’s election.
A new constitutional amendment would punch two further holes. It would allow the government to delay making payments ordered by courts (such as refunding excess taxes collected). And it would exploit a recent leap in prices by indexing the budget to December’s annual inflation figure (likely to be over 10%) rather than to June’s (8.4%). These changes would give the government an extra 100bn reais ($18.2bn) to play with next year, reckons Marcos Mendes, a former economic adviser to the Senate.
Some of this money would go to Auxílio Brasil, a revamped anti-poverty programme. This will incorporate Bolsa Família, the successful anti-poverty scheme launched in 2003 by the president at the time, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. But it will add complexity and uncertainty to it, notes Marcelo Neri, a poverty specialist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think-tank. The government has raised the average permanent benefit by 18%, to 217 reais per month. However, Mr Neri points out that inflation had eroded 32% of its real value since 2014. Mr Bolsonaro has also promised a temporary bonus, so that all 17m families in the scheme will get at least 400 reais a month, but only until December 2022. Not coincidentally, that is just after the election.
Another large chunk of the extra money would go on less worthy causes, including around 18bn reais to finance opaque budget amendments that grant overpriced public-procurement contracts to individual legislators in return for their support for Mr Bolsonaro. These were an innovation devised by the centrão. This week a majority of the Supreme Court ruled these secret clauses illegal. That did not stop the lower house of Congress approving the constitutional amendment on November 9th. Whether it will get through the Senate is unclear.
Either way there will be costs. Defeat would cast doubt on the financing of Auxílio Brasil in the future. But victory would be pyrrhic. Four of Mr Guedes’s senior aides resigned last month because they opposed the amendment (the official gloss was for “personal reasons”). Concern about fiscal policy is the “main fuel for inflation”, says Zeina Latif, an economist in São Paulo. The purpose of the spending cap was to halt the remorseless rise in public spending to satisfy insiders, which is neither redistributive nor efficient in overcoming the bottlenecks that hold back growth. Its weakening shows that Mr Bolsonaro is not just bad for the environment, for human rights and for democracy, but also for Brazil’s economy.",2
1827,"OCTOBER 6TH 1979 was a beautiful Saturday in Washington. It was not the kind of day that augured wrenching change in economic policy. But on that date Paul Volcker, then chairman of America’s central bank, announced a radical plan to quash persistent inflation. Before the battle was won, America’s interest rates reached 20% and unemployment surpassed 10%. Car dealers sent him the keys to vehicles they could not sell, in coffins.
China is now facing its own “Volcker moment”, according to Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank. The government’s aim is not to curb an inflationary spiral (China’s consumer prices are rising only modestly) but to break a vicious circle of property speculation and credit expansion. Regulators are making it harder for developers to raise money and for households to buy homes. The new rules have already pushed several property firms, including the country’s biggest homebuilder, Evergrande, to the brink and contributed to a decline in home sales. But are China’s rulers willing to endure anything like the economic discomfort that Volcker inflicted to achieve their goals? The world may be about to find out.

An Englishman’s home is his castle. In China, a home is much more besides. As well as providing shelter and security, housing often serves as collateral, nest-egg, speculative investment, bride-price and ticket to a good school. Housing makes up three-quarters of household wealth, according to the China Household Financial Survey, a data set compiled by academics in China. It accounts for the biggest chunk of household debt, which by one estimate exceeded 70% of GDP at the end of last year. Local governments raise 30% of their revenue by selling land to developers. And policymakers often rely on homebuilding to revive the economy in downturns.
Property dons other guises, too. The high price of housing is often likened to a “big mountain” (alongside costly health care and education) and a “grey rhino” (an obvious but neglected risk). In March Guo Shuqing, the head of China’s banking and insurance regulator, warned that if house prices were to drop, people holding multiple properties would not only suffer “huge losses”, they might also fall delinquent on their mortgages, endangering the banks and leading to “economic chaos”.
The government wants property to play a more modest role. In December 2016 President Xi Jinping said homes were for “living in, not for speculating”, a phrase that officials now often repeat. In 2019 the Communist Party declared that property was not a tool for short-term economic stimulus, a commitment reiterated at a meeting of the ruling Politburo in July.
The authorities are facing the grey rhino more squarely by trying to tackle the industry’s financial fragilities. Last year regulators capped the share of mortgages and property-related loans that banks may hold. They also imposed “three red lines” on prominent property developers, limiting the size of their debts relative to their assets, equity and cash. Now when the president of Country Garden, a high-end developer, talks of his aim to “turn green” he is not referring to the environment, but to keeping clear of those lines.

The impact of the curbs on the property market is becoming more stark. Sales of new homes in 30 cities tracked by Wind, a financial-data firm, fell by 23% in August compared with a year earlier, having fallen less sharply in July and June. Sales were also lower than in the same period of 2019, before the pandemic (see chart). Nomura’s Mr Lu says investors should prepare for a “much worse-than-expected growth slowdown, more loan and bond defaults, and potential stockmarket turmoil.”
Will the regulators blink? In the past, policymakers have been quick to ease property curbs in downturns. A big drop in house sales or prices over several months would probably “jolt the government into a more dovish stance”, argues Rosealea Yao of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy. But Mr Lu believes it will be hard for leaders to reverse course. They have publicly committed themselves to a tighter policy and created bureaucratic momentum behind it. Earlier this year the central government sacked officials in the southern city of Shenzhen for failing to tame prices.
The curbs can be seen as part of the government’s new preoccupation with creating “common prosperity”. Unaffordable housing conflicts with this aim. Research by three Chinese academics—Guanghua Wan, Chen Wang and Yu Wu—has found that the cost of housing causes about 75% of China’s wealth inequality. It may also be one reason why China’s families now have so few children, a trend that increasingly worries the government.
To shore up growth, China may try building more subsidised homes. It has ordered 40 cities to construct almost 1m low-rent housing units this year. But it will take time to ramp up such work on a sufficient scale. Meanwhile, China’s growth will face other threats. Service industries may suffer from pandemic-related lockdowns. Exports may grow more slowly as manufacturing recovers abroad. And infrastructure spending will weaken if local governments cannot sell as much land to developers.
It is hard to imagine China pushing things nearly as far as Volcker did. But then Volcker himself did not foresee the full economic pain that would follow that beautiful Saturday. China’s hard-pressed developers may find themselves with many unsold properties in the months ahead. Where will they send the keys? ■",2
1828,"SHORTLY BEFORE Ángel Hernández handed his wife the glass of barbiturates that would kill her, he asked her once again if she wanted to die. “The sooner the better,” she replied. Ravaged as María José Carrasco’s body was by multiple sclerosis, she struggled to swallow the poison. In the end she forced it down through a straw.
Ms Carrasco’s death in 2019 provoked a media storm in Spain. In Madrid the investigating judge initially referred the case to a court that specialises in violence against women. The prosecutor pushed for Mr Hernández, then 70, to serve six months in prison. But on June 25th Spain enacted a law allowing those with a “serious or incurable illness” or a “chronic or incapacitating” condition to seek help to end their own lives. Twelve days later, Mr Hernández was acquitted.

In much of the West public opinion has long favoured assisted dying. In 2002 60% of Spaniards supported voluntary euthanasia, a share which had risen to 71% by 2019. Writ large, secularisation and increasingly liberal values have solidified support. But so has personal experience, particularly that of baby-boomers who, having witnessed their parents’ suffering, are fighting for the right to deaths of their own choosing.
Change has been rapid. Assisted dying is now legal or decriminalised in at least a dozen countries, with legislation or court challenges pending in many others (see map). On November 5th Portugal’s parliament approved a revised bill which would allow those with “grave, incurable and irreversible” conditions to receive help to end their lives (the constitutional court had in March blocked an earlier version as being too imprecise). Other largely Catholic countries such as Chile, Ireland, Italy and Uruguay are also moving towards enshrining a right to die. In Belgium, Colombia and the Netherlands governments have broadened assisted-dying laws to include terminally ill children.

After years of struggle, activists and politicians have found ways through or around reluctant legislators. The right to die has been ticked through American ballot boxes, squeezed through Australian legislatures, and gavelled through Canadian and European courts. Proponents are using public consultations and petitions to demonstrate public support. And growing evidence from countries with assisted-dying laws has assuaged fears it will become easy to “kill granny”. The changes are snowballing as advocates in one country learn from their counterparts elsewhere.
Assisted dying is still rare. Most cases are cancer-related, and the number of deaths is tiny. But they are nonetheless changing how people think about dying. In some countries assisted dying has been extended to those with mental disorders and dementia, and even to old people who feel tired of life. A clandestine network of baby-boomers who share methods to kill themselves has sprung up on the internet. Even some proponents are beginning to worry about a slippery slope.
Thirty years ago assisted dying was illegal everywhere bar Switzerland. But in 1997 the American state of Oregon approved the Death with Dignity Act, initiating a spate of liberalisation. In Oregon two doctors must agree that a patient is of sound mind and has less than six months to live before he or she can receive the lethal drugs. These must be administered by the patient (known as physician-assisted dying) rather than injected by a doctor (voluntary euthanasia). Around 2,000 people have died under the law (roughly 250 of them last year, see chart 1), with no wrongful deaths reported. Versions of the law are now on the books of ten states, home to a fifth of Americans, as well as in Washington, DC.

Oregon’s rules are being copied internationally, with some modifications. New Zealand’s Oregon-style law came into effect on November 7th. In Australia, the state of Victoria passed a similar law in 2017, and since then all but one of Australia’s six states have followed suit. In Britain, an Oregon-style bill passed its second reading in the House of Lords in October. But to become law it would also need the support of the House of Commons and the government, which looks unlikely. Three-quarters of Britons support a right to die, but only 35% of MPs do.
Some campaigners are circumventing cautious representatives by going through the courts. In February Peru’s constitutional court ruled that the Ministry of Health’s refusal to help a woman with degenerative polio end her life violated her rights to “dignity” and “autonomy”. Several countries, such as Austria, are beginning to flesh out a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011 that people have the right to decide the time and manner of their deaths. After Germany’s highest court declared in 2020 that a ban on repeatedly helping others die was unconstitutional, Dignitas Germany, a non-profit organisation, began to help people kill themselves.
Even after a legislature or court opens the door to assisted dying, those pursuing the option can face high hurdles. With 68 safeguards, Victoria’s law excludes some of the people it was intended to help. Doctors are forbidden to bring up assisted dying with their patients, so many do not know it is an option. Colombia decriminalised voluntary euthanasia in 1997, but is only now regulating the practice. As a result, many Colombian doctors refuse to get involved for fear of prosecution. Approval is rare and can be withdrawn.
Despite such strictures, the expansion of the right to die is not without controversy. In Canada, the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that a ban on medical assistance in dying (MAID) violated the national Charter of Rights. Now MAID is available to all Canadians who suffer from chronic physical illness or disability. Uniquely, the law allows patients to determine what constitutes “unbearable” suffering. In 2020 only 6% of written requests for MAID were refused.
Some advocates for the disabled argue that the amended law devalues the lives of those with disabilities. It’s “literally unthinkable” that MAID would be doled out instead on the basis of race, sex or any other protected characteristic, says David Shannon, a quadriplegic lawyer who campaigns against assisted dying. But others argue that the foundations of the disability movement lie in creating the freedom to make one’s own choices.

Opponents also fear that Canada may end up helping people die before it has helped them live. Disabled people who do not get enough support may choose to die because society has failed them, critics argue. They worry this may prove particularly true for people whose lives have been filled with abuse, racism and poverty, though data from America show that those who choose assisted death are overwhelmingly middle-class, white and educated.
From 2023, Canada will extend MAID to those who suffer solely from mental illness, on the ground that to do otherwise would discriminate. Many Canadians find this troubling (see chart 2). They worry that doctors may indulge the suicidal urges that are a symptom of many psychiatric disorders: one in ten schizophrenics kill themselves, some studies reckon. Others question whether a patient could have tried every possible treatment when the medical and social understanding of mental illness is so rudimentary and mental-health services are so often inadequate. Most people underestimate how serious an intractable psychiatric condition can be, says Mona Gupta, a Québécoise psychiatrist and bioethicist. They see depictions of mental illness in popular culture but have never met anyone severely affected.
The only way out
John Scully, who has lived with severe depression and PTSD for decades, agrees. At home at night in Toronto, Mr Scully, who is 80, is haunted by the horrors he witnessed as a war correspondent: the dead torn apart by vultures, the AK47 scoped to shoot him. He also experiences physical pain. “There is no cure,” he says. Nineteen shock therapies, countless medications and six stints as a psychiatric patient have failed to bring him relief. The “only help available”, he believes, is assisted dying. He sees it as a far more dignified choice than suicide, which he has attempted twice, and he thinks it would be less painful for his family.
Like other bioethicists, Dr Gupta thinks mental disorders should be seen in the same light as other conditions that create chronic pain. For doctors, she says, the assessment process would be much the same: distinguishing between an impulsive death-wish and a considered one, and determining if a patient is mentally competent. Such cases are rare. In 2020 in the Netherlands, only 88 people with mental illnesses—12% of all those who made requests—had their requests for help approved by a euthanasia clinic. Many are heartened by simply having the option.
Canada is making the same mistakes as the Netherlands, reckons Theo Boer, a Dutch ethicist who once supported his country’s euthanasia laws. Since Dutch doctors pushed to legalise assisted dying 20 years ago, he believes that voluntary euthanasia has gone from being a “last resort to prevent a terrible death to a last resort to prevent a terrible life”. Voluntary euthanasia is a shortcut to death, like a C-section is a shortcut to birth, he argues. In the Netherlands as a whole, one death in 25 is assisted, he notes, but in some cities that figure can be as high as one in seven.
The choice to die is often murkiest for those with dementia. In 2016 a Dutch woman with severe Alzheimer’s awoke during her euthanasia and, as she struggled, her family had to hold her down. Before dementia overcame her, she had made a written request for euthanasia, and the doctor prioritised that choice. In 2020, after the doctor was cleared of wrongdoing, the Supreme Court clarified that doctors cannot be prosecuted for carrying out euthanasia on patients with advanced dementia, even if they no longer express an explicit wish to die. The Netherlands averages around two such cases a year.
Bert Keizer, a geriatrician who has carried out some of the Netherlands’ most controversial euthanasia cases, is deeply uneasy about the new guidelines. Euthanasia usually happens with the agreement of the patient, doctors and the family. But in cases of dementia, he muses, “the one who it’s all about’‘ is “removed from the event”. Implicit in the court’s ruling is a judgment that the person one was has more value than the person one has become. A patient who wanted to live could be denied that choice.
What lies ahead
Swiss law, by contrast, mandates that those seeking to kill themselves be mentally competent. This can create a different fear. Alex Pandolfo has early-onset dementia. He has decided to die in Switzerland, yet he has postponed the day of his death once. If he waits too long, he will doom himself to the future he does not want.
Some proponents of assisted dying are pressing to expand eligibility, to include those who feel they have lived a “completed life”. In 2020 the liberal D66 party in the Netherlands proposed a law to make suicide pills available to people over 75 who felt they were done living. Critics point to research from the University of Humanistic Studies in Utrecht, which shows that death wishes in older people are subject to change, and in some cases are caused by loneliness and isolation. Few truly want to die, and those who do often meet other criteria for euthanasia, a commission found in 2016. Supporters say it is important to offer the choice, even though few will take it in the end. Just 3% of the members of Dignitas, which campaigns for assisted dying, end up getting help to end their lives.

Some who are tired of life, or unwilling to endure its decay, do choose to press ahead. At 76, Dawn Voice-Cooper, who suffered from debilitating but not life-threatening ailments, saw her future and did not want to live it: the pain of having her ears syringed; the indignity of swimming with a colostomy bag; the diminishing freedom to move as her arthritic joints stiffened. Life was exhausting and would only become more so. “I don’t want to die but I can’t live like this,” she said. In October she travelled from her home in Britain to an industrial estate on the edge of a Swiss forest. After listening to Nick Drake’s “Day is Done”, she died, with her friend Mr Pandolfo (and a tabloid reporter) by her side.
“Many people are not waiting for laws to pass,” warns Katie Engelhart, author of “The Inevitable”, a book about the right-to-die movement. It reveals a secret world where people, fed up with restraints imposed by laws or doctors, order lethal substances over the internet. Their reasons are often existential rather than physical: a loss of purpose, fear of being a burden or of losing their dignity. People who seek death through legal channels have similar reasons. In Oregon the most common concerns among people who qualify to die owing to terminal illness include loss of enjoyment (94%), loss of autonomy (93%) and loss of dignity (72%).
Some shrug this off, arguing that “assisted dying is not suicide.” But Ms Engelhart believes that such deaths are inevitably linked to the strictures around assisted dying. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, one in five people over the age of 40 who kill themselves have a terminal or debilitating illness. Yet many lonely suicides are not planned and considered, so a black market in suicide can bring terrible risks. Earlier this year a 28-year-old Dutch woman died after taking a substance from an affiliate of Last Will Cooperative, a right-to-die organisation, it seems impulsively. Several members of the group, including its leader, have since been arrested. Prosecutors suspect the group is involved in dozens of deaths.
In the West, assisted dying is helping to change the culture of death. People are talking about it more, and even scripting it, says Naomi Richards, a British anthropologist. Death is becoming an event to be scheduled, controlled, reached via a byway past ageing or suffering. In an Instagram age, it is possible to imagine a “good death” being idealised and curated. Ellen Wiebe, a Canadian doctor, says she has helped people die “on a beach, in a forest and in the middle of a party”. Such deaths may seem particularly appealing when, for generations, dying has been medicalised and hidden, and during a pandemic in which so many have died alone in hospital.
For those left behind, an assisted death can feel like a blessing or a curse. Some, such as Tom Mortier, who has taken his mother’s case to the European Court of Human Rights, feel angry and resentful that a relative was taken too soon. But most find solace. Heather Cooke’s son, Aaron Ball, chose to die last year, at 42, while suffering from metastatic colon cancer. Ms Cooke suffers the agony of a mother who has lost her only child, but she is also comforted that he died in peace, at home, surrounded by his family. Medically assisted dying was a “gift” for us, she says. “But I understand why people fear it.” ■",2
1829,"DUBAI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is in talks with banks to amend the terms of a $16 billion loan due in 2023 and possibly reduce the size of the facility, sources said, as the world's top oil exporter looks to cut outstanding government debt and improve its balance sheet.
The discussions between the ministry of finance and the banks are at an early stage and no decision has been taken yet, said the four sources familiar with the matter.
One said the potential refinancing could be for 50% to 70% of the $16 billion facility, which Saudi Arabia raised in 2018 when it refinanced, extended and increased an existing $10 billion loan raised in 2016 and due in 2021.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia manages its debt proactively all the time and makes regular announcements as deals are completed in the appropriate way,"" a ministry of finance spokesperson said.
The duration of the new facility could also be reduced, to three years from five, with the option of renewing it by two years at maturity, said one of the sources.
The potential de-leveraging could help the kingdom obtain better credit ratings going forward, another source said.
The largest Arab economy suffered a deep contraction last year as the coronavirus crisis hurt its burgeoning non-oil economic sectors, while record-low oil prices weighed on state coffers, widening the 2020 budget deficit to 11.2% of GDP.
But higher oil production and prices bolstered its finances this year, with the kingdom recording a budget surplus of 6.7 billion riyals ($1.79 billion) in the third quarter, its first quarterly surplus in over two years.
On Friday, ratings agency Moody's upgraded Saudi Arabia's outlook to ""stable"" from ""negative"", saying it was likely the government would reverse most of its 2020 debt increase while preserving fiscal buffers.
It estimated government debt will decline below 29% of gross domestic product by the end of this year and to around 25% of GDP by 2025, from 32.5% of GDP last year.",3
1830,"On the day of his confirmation, Enzo Almeni walked through the grand West Doors of Liverpool's world-famous Anglican Cathedral, beneath the monumental statue of the Risen Christ.
He crossed the marbled floor, past the stone tombs of long-forgotten clergymen and commemorative plaques to the great and good of the City, to take his place in a pew before the high altar.
It was March 27, 2017, and Almeni was welcomed into the Church with open arms, in a ceremony attended by beaming friends and well-wishers — among them the retired, devout Christian couple who would invite him to live with them just days later.
This week the cathedral was part of a key line of inquiry for counter-terrorism police investigating a bomb explosion in a taxi parked outside a hospital a mile away, at 10.59am on Remembrance Sunday.
And, as we now know, the bomber was Enzo Almeni, a Christian convert who had changed his name by deed poll from Emad Al Swealmeen, and who had allegedly spent the months preparing explosives which, police confirmed yesterday, could have caused 'significant injury or death'.
The second terror attack in a month — following the killing of MP Sir David Amess — has seen the UK threat level raised to 'severe'.
It has also revealed to the wider public a flaw in the asylum process that some argue may have undermined national security for years: how churches and faith groups have, often innocently, aided some asylum seekers who falsely claim to be Christian converts in order to remain in the UK.
In the wake of the attempted Liverpool atrocity — in which Almeni died — a row has erupted over the so-called 'Pray to Stay' racket.
MPs from the Home Office Select Committee are demanding a Parliamentary inquiry, and a counter-extremism think-tank is calling for an investigation into the 'Liverpool Cathedral convert cluster'.
Home Secretary Priti Patel described the asylum system as 'a complete merry-go-round and it's been exploited by a whole professional legal services industry which has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day-in day-out on legal aid at the expense of the taxpayers'.
The exact circumstances of 32-year-old Enzo Almeni's conversion are not yet known (and there is no evidence he used it to aid his asylum application). 
But the Mail can today reveal the scale of Christian conversions that may have facilitated successful asylum claims sanctioned by the clergy — and how the Church of England's ruling body offered advice on the role of Christian conversions if asylum claims fail.
It is tempting to think of Almeni as an outlier who simply slipped through the intelligence net. 
But Khairi Saadallah, who murdered three men in a park in Reading last year, was also an asylum seeker who converted to Christianity upon arrival in the UK from Libya.
In 2018, a 38-year-old Iranian asylum seeker who raped a teenage girl was spared deportation even though a judge believed his conversion to Christianity was a deliberate ploy to beat the system.
The judge ruled that the man's 850 Twitter posts quoting the Bible placed him at risk of persecution if he was sent back to Iran following his release after serving five years in prison.
In recent years, UK immigration courts have heard the cases of hundreds of asylum seekers who claim to have converted to Christianity in order to stay here.
Under the Human Rights Act, if the asylum seeker can prove they are unable to live in their country of origin without fear of persecution, they can be granted leave to remain in the UK for five years. 
Those who convert from Islam to Christianity are committing the crime of 'apostasy' — 'deserting Islam' — in their home countries, which in some nations, including Iran, is punishable by death.
Supporting evidence provided to immigration tribunals by church leaders, who can vouch for the credibility of the asylum seeker's faith, can be the deciding factor in whether they are permitted to stay or are deported.
According to a report in The Times this week, some people smugglers are now even promoting conversion as a tactic to desperate migrants.
Some Christian churches work closely with immigration solicitors, who, it has been claimed, cross-refer asylum seekers to one another.
Last year, two Glasgow-based Iranian Muslims known only as TF and MA, who had converted to Christianity, won a landmark fight against the Home Office with the support of the Tron Church, a church of Presbyterian desendance in the city which is led by retired solicitor and missionary John Taylor.
This is despite the fact that, in an early hearing, TF was found to have fabricated a letter from an Iranian hospital, and entered the UK on a student visa in 2013 having 'been on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia . . . Undermining his claim that Islam did not play a role in his life'.
The second man first claimed he was a homosexual (a crime in Iran), then claimed to be Christian, which the judge said was being kept 'in reserve' as a 'Plan B' to be deployed if the homosexuality claim failed. 
The judge called the man's claim a 'multi-layered contrivance', adding: 'He is not a genuine asylum seeker and should be removed from the UK on that basis.'
Yet four representatives from the Tron Church, including Mr Taylor who has assisted the claims of dozens of Middle Eastern asylum seekers since 2010, backed their bids, and the joint case was ultimately successful when the Home Office backed down in October before an appeal re-hearing.
The case of TF and MA has already been cited in subsequent conversion tribunals and could pave the way for hundreds more claims. The Tron Church declined to comment on the case yesterday.
Some asylum seekers are open about the reasons for conversion. A man known only as Abdul, from the Middle East, recounted his experience to academic William Wheeler in a book published this year. [Conversion] was '60 per cent for my case', he admitted after his previous appeals for asylum failed.
'He succinctly described what being a refused asylum seeker means: your case is closed,' wrote Mr Wheeler. 'In order to put in a fresh claim, you need 'a new story'. Ultimately his claim was unsuccessful.
Of course, many asylum seekers are truly desperate people who have reached the UK after fleeing despotic, war-torn and dangerous regimes, and as charity is a core tenet of Christianity, it is only natural that church leaders would help those in need.
But is it possible that occasionally they go beyond that moral imperative to assist in more dubious claims?
In 2017, the Church of England (C of E) opted to encourage asylum seekers as part of its Presence and Engagement Programme, designed to assist clergy in parishes where more than one in ten of the population follow a non-Christian faith.
That year, the General Synod, the Church's governing body, advised clergy that where someone has already had an asylum application turned down, a conversion to Christianity would boost the chances of a successful new claim — seemingly issuing instructions to facilitate conversions when an original appeal has failed.
'Note that if the person has converted to Christianity after a previous refusal, that may be the basis of a fresh claim,' noted the text entitled 'Supporting Asylum Seekers — Guidance for Church of England Clergy'.
It makes clear that 'convincing evidence will be required' which might include 'testimony from a church leader; other testimony confirming their faith or conversion; evidence of persecution of Christians/Christian converts in their home country and evidence of laws from their country that punish apostasy'.
To Calvin Robinson, a CofE Ordinand in Holy Orders training for the priesthood, the message is clear: 'This document clearly shows the Church advising that a fresh asylum claim can be made if someone converts to Christianity.
'It's a demonstration for the clergy — it's saying in black and white the way to do it. 
'Here's the way to get them through. 
'Here is the loophole: Baptise someone and they can make a fresh claim'. It is an abuse of the sacrament of baptism.
'We're at risk of terrorists infiltrating our country and the Church is actually complicit at this moment. 
'The Archbishop needs to be very clear on what is meant by this document. For me as a Christian I find it offensive.'
Mr Robinson said that he had spoken to CofE priests and vicars who had raised it as an issue and felt 'discriminated against' as a result.
'One vicar told me about immigrant ringleaders who would bring a group of Muslim asylum seekers to a church on a Sunday, request a baptism for them regardless of the time they've been in the community, and within three weeks they are back asking for letters for their lawyers [to support asylum claims],' he told the Mail.
'The lawyers and vicars are working together to rubber-stamp these asylum claims.'
The rise in baptisms coincides with the drive in churches around the country to increase congregation numbers.
Indeed, at the time of Almeni's baptism in 2015, Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral was having some success in boosting its congregation even as it embraced prospective converts.
The weekly average aggregate attendance had risen from 438 in 2013 to 702. 
At the end of that year, Church Commissioners agreed £1 million of funding to roll out the cathedral's 'multiplying congregations' scheme across the diocese.
Dr Rakib Ehsan, a specialist in radicalisation and terrorism at the think tank the Henry Jackson Society, describes some elements of the church as operating 'almost an anti-deportation network in the UK'. 
'In recent times Anglican devotion has taken a dip,' he says. 'Is there a desperation to boost the numbers and reverse that trend?'
It is a provocative stance, but Church groups have been aware for years of the extent of doubtful conversions. 
In 2016, the Rev Pete Wilcox, a former Dean of Liverpool, said: 'I can't think of a single example of somebody who already had British citizenship converting here with us from Islam to Christianity. 
'Once you are a baptised Christian it is really not conceivable that you would be deported to a Muslim country.'
And Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian — a former curate at Liverpool Cathedral who is himself an Iranian refugee who converted to Christianity, and was later ordained — said the same year that 'people are desperate for a better life and sometimes they will lie for it — that's understandable'.
'There are many people abusing the system,' he added. 'I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault?'
Rev Sally Smith, a CofE priest at St Mark's Church in Stoke-on-Trent, said she'd seen around 150 conversions to Christianity in her church, and that she believed 'a very, very small minority of people' had done so in order to boost their asylum claims.
'I'd say probably on about 10-15 occasions I will guide people through the course, but there is no way that I would provide a letter to the Home Office or assist a person to go to court if I didn't believe they were absolutely genuine Christians,' she told the BBC Today programme this week.
'I always say: ""I'm not . . . helping you to swap one set of religious dogma for another in the hope that it will help you to gain asylum, because that's just not what we're doing.""'
The total number of asylum seekers converting to Christianity in Britain is unknown, but anecdotally, their numbers are rising.
Almeni was one of around 200 asylum seekers to convert to Christianity at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral over a four-year period, while 200 Iranian asylum seekers were baptised over a five-year period in a parish church in Stockton-on-Tees near Middlesbrough.
Meanwhile, in one year alone [2016], a quarter of confirmations conducted by the Bishop of Bradford were of converts from Islam.
Bradford and Liverpool, along with Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent and Stockton, are home to 'dispersal centres', where refugees are placed before their asylum claims are processed.
In recent years, clusters of Christian churches in these dispersal centre towns have sprung up, specifically catering to the new demographic.
Liverpool Cathedral hosts a weekly Persian service, attracting up to 140 people, while St Mark's in Stoke-on-Trent delivers some services in Farsi to suit its new congregation of up to 90 per cent Kurdish and Iranian immigrants.
Certainly, there is no shortage of advice for asylum seekers wanting to improve their chances before an immigration tribunal. 
Indeed, a public document issued by the CofE in support of asylum seekers states: 'If an asylum claim is on religious grounds, [solicitors] will rely on input from clergy. 
'Occasionally a solicitor is not sympathetic to claims of Christian faith; in which case it might be better to find another one.'
Advice used by the Joint Public Issues Team, a partnership between the Methodist Church, the Baptist Union of Great Britain and the United Reformed Church, was drawn up by a solicitor specialising in asylum law, who is also a member of the Methodist Refugee Working Group.
The jointly issued guidance in 2018 advises on how their clergy members can aid asylum seekers in the congregation and on testifying at an immigration tribunal, provides template legal letters and suggests how to counter arguments by the Home Office.
'The Home Office may argue that a Christian may safely return to their country of origin if they do not announce their faith,' states the document. '
They may contend that members of the United Reformed Church, for example, do not evangelise. 
'While you should never attempt to invent evidence of evangelistic activity, you may want to affirm that to evangelise is essential to what it means to be Christian.'
A spokesman for the Joint Public Issues Team said: 'We have seen people of all faiths and none treated inhumanely by the current asylum system . . . [and] will continue to call for an asylum system which gives people the fair hearing they deserve.'
Which brings us back to the Liverpool bomber Enzo Almeni's case. An asylum seeker of Iraqi and Jordanian origin, his first claim failed in 2014. 
The following year, he undertook the five-week Alpha 'crash course' on Christianity and was baptised at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral.
In 2017, he met retired Liverpool lay pastor Malcolm Hitchcott, and his wife Marion, both 77. 
They housed him for eight months, took him to Bible classes and welcomed him to their faith, culminating in his confirmation that year.
Over the years he lodged numerous appeals for asylum. At the time of the bombing at Liverpool Women's Hospital there was an appeal still outstanding, seven years after his arrival. 
Separately, a Home Office source has said that Almeni's attempts at using his Christianity in the asylum process was typical of the way arrivals had attempted to 'game the system'.
The Church of England hit back, stating that: 'It is not the role of clergy to establish the legitimacy of asylum claims and to assess security implications. 
'We are not aware of any evidence to suggest a widespread correlation between conversion to Christianity, or any other faith, and abuse of the asylum system.'
It declined to comment on the record about issuing guidance on conversions to aid with second asylum claims, but emphasised there is no evidence this was done to boost congregation numbers.
Liverpool Cathedral says that 'welcoming [asylum seekers] into a worshipping community is one way we engage'. 
It adds that it has developed 'robust processes' for discerning someone's commitment to faith before their application, including a connection to the community for at least two years.
Quite how robust those processes are is now under the spotlight.",-2
1831,"MUCH OF THE time most people do not think about the complex choreography that makes modern shopping possible. You just click and wait—and not too long, mind—for a package or three to arrive on your doorstep. Over the past few months, however, the world’s supply chains have elbowed their way into the foreground, as surging demand for goods and supply disruptions have restricted the flow of trade. At ports around the world, dozens of ships stacked high with containers wait at anchor for their turn to unload, while the cost to ship a box from China to America’s west coast has jumped roughly tenfold from the pre-pandemic level.
You may think the snafus represent the beginning of the end of globalisation. Consumers are learning how infections half a world away or a ship stuck in the Suez Canal can disrupt the near-instant access to goods they take for granted. Manufacturers are discovering that lean supply chains can mean inadequate access to essential components as well as low costs. The disruptions are one reason inflation is high in America, Britain and elsewhere. But amid the logistics blues, markets are working as they tend to do, and firms are finding routes around blockages. Under intense pressure, global supply chains are not in fact failing; they are, rather, adapting.

The troubles began in 2020, when firms that had idled production in the expectation of a slump instead faced heavy demand for cars, electronics and home-exercise equipment. Generous stimulus, in America especially, kept order books full while the pandemic skewed spending toward goods rather than services. Producers of computer chips have been unable to keep up with the rush. The shipping industry had no spare capacity and has faced a series of disruptions, from the saga of the stuck ship Ever Given, to the closing of ports amid outbreaks of covid-19 and storms like Hurricane Ida. With the system stretched thin, a mishap anywhere affects the movement of goods everywhere. Experts reckon it may take a year or more for conditions to return to something like normal.
In the meantime, firms are neither twiddling their thumbs nor abandoning global supply chains. Instead, they are improvising. Some retailers, like Walmart, have taken to chartering entire ships exclusively for their own cargo. Passenger aircraft are being refitted for freight. Chipmakers are weighing their priorities: TSMC, from Taiwan, is supplying some carmakers and Apple before producers of computer servers, say. Soaring shipping fees themselves help adjust the flow of goods. Higher freight costs scarcely affect the price of expensive electronics which can be crammed into containers, but matter more for bulky, low-value goods like garden furniture. Some consumers may be disappointed, but this means that shipping tangles depress the value of trade by less than might otherwise be the case.
The strains on supply chains will leave their mark. This year capital expenditure will be exceptional—global investment is likely to be 15% above the pre-pandemic level by the end of 2021, reckons Morgan Stanley, a bank. Firms are aware of the risk from shipping disruptions and trade disputes and are tailoring their investment programmes accordingly. In places like America and Japan they have been encouraged by government policies to incentivise the “reshoring” of production. Toshiba, a Japanese electronics firm, is closing a long-standing factory in China. A number of carmakers are bringing bits of their supply chains in-house or at least closer to home, especially for chips. New orders for smaller container ships may reflect the view that production will become more regionalised.
Shipshape
Global supply chains will survive this trial. Indeed, the adjustments and investments made in response to recent woes are likely to make them better able to cope with disruptions—by ensuring adequate supplies of critical components, for example. That should allow them, eventually, to fade once more out of sight and out of mind. ■",2
1832,"IN 2020 CALIFORNIA’S population shrank for the first time, as people left for less expensive places. Recently, however, headlines have been focused on who is coming to the Golden State: a parade of Democratic luminaries, to drum up support for Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, as he fends off a “recall” election to remove him from office on September 14th.
The high-profile visitors demonstrate how much is at stake. If voters recall Mr Newsom and elect a Republican, it could flip the US Senate. (California’s governor will appoint the successor to 88-year-old Dianne Feinstein, should she retire.) A new governor could also appoint judges and the heads of departments, issue executive orders and veto line items on the budget. One legislator warned that replacing Mr Newsom with a Republican would produce a “lost year in California state government.”

Recent polls should give Mr Newsom some comfort: The Economist’s polling average shows he has the support of roughly 54% of voters But it is not just his record facing scrutiny. This election has called attention to the recall itself—a quirk that is being abused for partisan ends.
California is one of nineteen states that permits the removal of state-level officials through a vote. Only four gubernatorial recall elections have made it to the ballot in America; Mr Newsom’s will be California’s second. Voters removed California’s governor through a recall only once, in 2003, when the unpopular Gray Davis failed to manage an electricity crisis and was replaced with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
But Ken Miller, a professor at Claremont McKenna College, notes that this election differs from 2003. None of the more than 40 candidates running against Mr Newsom has Mr Schwarzenegger’s celebrity. The frontrunner, Larry Elder, is an African-American shock jock who dubs himself “the sage from South Central” and has a Trumpian predilection for provocation, including suggesting that the descendants of slave owners could be owed reparations. The electorate has also changed, notes Mr Miller: in 2003 35% of California voters were registered as Republican, versus only 24% today. Democrats now outnumber Republicans by nearly two to one.
Republicans have not won a state-level office in California since 2006, when Mr Schwarzenegger was re-elected as governor. Recall attempts have become the only way that Republicans have a chance of getting back into office, says Sherry Jeffe, a political analyst. The exercise is also eyebrow-raising because of its timing: if voters are so unhappy with Mr Newsom, they could vote him out of office when he runs for re-election next year.
Mr Newsom won election in 2018 with 62% of the vote (the greatest share of any Democratic candidate for governor in state history). Republicans had tried to recall him five times before the sixth attempt gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Two things helped Mr Newsom’s critics: a judge granting a four-month extension for signature gathering due to covid-19 and Mr Newsom’s idiotic decision last autumn to eat indoors with friends at a fancy restaurant while he was telling people to socially distance and not even see their own families for the holidays.
Judgment day
Whatever its outcome, the recall election has taken a toll on Mr Newsom. But the state is losing out too. The recall election will cost $276m in taxpayer money. Toni Atkins, president pro tempore of the California State Senate, says “having to deal with a recall takes away focus from critical issues that the governor should be spending his time on.” That includes fires, drought, the pandemic and affordable housing, among other issues.
Since the beginning, recalls have had their critics. In the 1780s, Alexander Hamilton decried the “state of vassalage and dependence” a senator would feel if a state’s legislature could recall him, as was being discussed. In 1911, President William Howard Taft vetoed Arizona’s statehood resolution partly because of a provision that would have let judges be recalled. In 1911 voters amended California’s constitution to allow for recalls, as a Progressive-era tool that would allow voters to bypass the influence big business exerted on the legislature. But since then “interest groups have learned how to game the system to subvert the democratic will” by making use of recalls and ballot initiatives, says Rick Rivas of Govern for California, a good-governance group.
Because of the way that California designs its recall process—with a majority needed for removal but just a plurality for the winner—Mr Newsom could win 49% of the vote but be replaced by someone with a much smaller share of support. “I have no doubt that next year we’re going to see a number of ideas on recall reform from the legislature,” says Ms Atkins. The legislature could tweak the recall process to dissuade partisan meddling by, for example, mandating that the lieutenant-governor automatically ascend if the governor were recalled. It could also establish a “malfeasance” standard, which would require that the governor commit an illegal act in order to be recalled, or raise the number of signatures required to put a recall on the ballot.
Any of those actions would require a Constitutional amendment, which a majority of the electorate would need to approve. In the end, the voters may decide on a total recall of the recall.■

1833,"Spooked by supply-chain disruptions, the Office for National Statistics has started to monitor supermarket and grocery shops. A survey of 288 stores suggests only patchy problems. Just 5% of sites looked low on fresh vegetables, and 6% on toilet roll. But 12% lacked chocolate selection boxes, 17% sparkling water and 18% frozen turkey.

When lorry-drivers are scarce, heavy, low-margin products like bottled water are not a priority. For other products, Christmas stockpiling could be a factor. Sales of frozen poultry in October were up 27% compared with a year ago, according to Kantar, a data firm, and those of Christmas puddings were up by a third. Scattered shortages of paracetamol are probably also related to the season: sales of cough medicine have doubled.",2
1834,"The Liverpool suicide attacker who officials suspect converted to Christianity to aid his asylum application was in a mosque 'all day, every day' at the time he began building his bomb to blow up a maternity hospital, it emerged today.
Emad Al Swealmeen, who was baptised and confirmed at the city's Anglican cathedral in 2017, was seen worshipping during Ramadan and praying with a Muslim friend in the week before Sunday's attack, it is alleged. 
The revelation will further fuel suspicion that his conversion to Christianity four years ago was just an act to persuade the Home Office to grant him British citizenship and prevent them deporting him because he had found Jesus. 
Immigration sources said today that Al Swealmeen used a false identity and multiple appeals to 'frustrate' attempts to remove him from the UK before he tried to kill women and babies on Remembrance Sunday. 
Police believe Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months and began buying components online for his suicide vest after he began renting a flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, in April, which he then turned into a bomb factory.
Investigators are said to have admitted that the device would have caused 'damage, death and destruction' on a massive scale, but they were 'lucky' when the unstable device's detonator went off and killed him as he was 'jostled' when the taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.   
Police are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown.
But a security source told the Telegraph: 'Methodology wise this attack is entirely jihadist, but we have an open mind as to what precisely was motivating him. If he built a much more destructive device then the detonation looks accidental. It looks lucky'.
The Church of England was today accused of aiding asylum seekers to 'game' the immigration system by helping hundreds to convert from Islam and 'pray to stay' in the UK as it emerged people smugglers are using Instagram to urge migrants to follow Jesus to help them gain British citizenship. 
Emad Al Swealmeen lost his first bid to stay in Britain in 2014 but appealed again in 2017 after he worshipped at Liverpool Cathedral and his case was still outstanding when he blew himself up in a taxi on Sunday.
He was baptised and confirmed having apparently spoken 'endlessly and passionately about Jesus', but members of the city's largest Anglican church admitted they 'lost contact' with him within months of the ceremony. He was one of around 200 asylum seekers to adopt the faith there over a four-year period.
A clergyman at Liverpool Cathedral previously raised concerns about asylum seekers cynically posing as Christians to boost their chances of being awarded refugee status. Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian admitted in 2016 that 'plenty of people' were lying about their intentions after it emerged that the Church of England had christened hundreds of asylum seekers under a scheme dubbed 'pray to stay'. 
He said: 'There are many people abusing the system... I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault? And who are they deceiving? The Home Office, me as a pastor, or God?'  
MPs are to demand a ­formal Parliamentary probe into whether fake Christian converts are duping the Church of England to avoid being deported back to strict Muslim countries they came from. 
It came as new statistics revealed that between January 2020 and June this year, 29% of all migrants arriving by boat say they are from Iran and 20% say they are from Iraq. 91% of all migrants came from just 10 countries - including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and Yemen. These are also nations named in the top 20 countries where Christians are the most persecuted for following Jesus. 
Priti Patel said last night that Al Swealmeen, who changed his name to Enzo Almeni shortly after finding Jesus, exploited the UK's asylum 'merry-go-round' while a Home Office source said changing from Islam to Christianity is now 'standard practice' among asylum seekers 'to game the asylum system'. 
Pledging to overhaul the asylum system, Home Secretary Miss Patel declared: 'The case in Liverpool was a complete reflection of how dysfunctional, how broken, the system has been in the past, and why I want to bring changes forward. It's a complete merry-go-round and it's been exploited by a whole professional legal services industry which has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day in day out on legal aid at the expense of the taxpayers.'
The newspaper quoted the insider as claiming that the failed asylum seeker, who somehow remained in the UK for seven years, attended the mosque 'all day every day' during Ramadan - and was seen worshipping the week before the suicide attack. 
It also emerged that Al Swealmeen adopted a fake identity, Enzo Almeni, and made repeated asylum appeals and applications, including one in January.
The terrorist has been accused of trying to 'game' Britain's creaking immigration by finding Jesus after his first asylum application failed in November 2014 when the Home Office rejected his claims that he was from Syria saying they believed he was from Jordan. 
Adding to the picture that he was lying to the authorities, following his death his family abroad said that he was actually from Iraq. 
Al Swealmeen launched an appeal within the First Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber which was dismissed on April 16, 2015.
Later that year appeals to both that court and to the Upper Tier Tribunal were also refused.
It is understood that Al Swealmeen made a fresh asylum application to the Home Office in 2017 under his new name, but this was rejected two years later.
The 32-year-old then made a new application to the First Tier Tribunal on January 19 this year which was under review at the time he blew himself.  
Yesterday police found several 'suspicious packages' after raiding a pub and asylum hostel linked to the Poppy Day suicide bomber.
Officers said Emad Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months but have not found any evidence that he conspired with or was inspired by a terror group.  
A Royal Logistics Corp bomb disposal vehicle was seen arriving in Sutcliffe Street, Liverpool along with a fire engine, and the cordon was slightly extended to Boaler Street before ending this evening. 
Residents who had been told to leave their homes have now been warned that they may see explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) officers on Thursday in case further 'suspicious' items are found.
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said several suspicious packages were found, and were examined by EOD officers before being recovered by forensic teams. 
Searches have also been carried out at a property in Rutland Avenue that had been rented by Al Swealmeen since April, and that is the main focus of the police investigation. 
Police earlier said Iraq-born Al Swealmeen had rented a property in Liverpool seven months ago and had started making 'relevant purchases' for his homemade bomb 'at least' since that time. 
Officers are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown. 
One theory is that the bomber was suffering a mental health crisis having been devastated at his continued failure to gain asylum here because the Home Office refused to believe he was Syrian.  
In an update on the investigation ACC Jackson said that the pizza chef who converted from Islam to Christianity began renting his flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool at around Easter. 
ACC Jackson said: 'A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time'.
He added: 'At this time we are not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others'.  
Confirming the terrorist's cause of death he said: 'The post mortem on the deceased has taken place and the cause of death has been described as injuries sustained from the fire and explosion.' 
He also said that the 32-year-old asylum seeker had suffered from periods of mental illness that will 'form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand'.
Mr Jackson added: 'There is much comment in the media about Al Swealmeen and it is clear that he was known to many people. We continue to appeal for people who knew him, especially those who associated with him this year as we try and piece together the events leading up to this incident and the reasons for it'. 
The number of failed asylum seekers being deported from the UK fell to a record low of under 8,000 last year - down almost 40,000-a-year in eight years, MailOnline can reveal today.
Official Home Office figures show that tens of thousands of failed asylum seekers are still waiting to be sent back to the country of their birth - and cases are taking longer to complete because of the number of appeals.
In 2013 around 47,000 failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals were deported. This dropped to a low of 8,000 last year, with covid, in part, being blamed for the record low last year. 
UK Border figures from June show that there are currently 125,000 asylum cases outstanding in Britain. 
Of these 5,900 people, including Almeni until his death, were awaiting the outcome of an appeal. Some have been waiting for years.
Approximately 39,500 people are still waiting to be deported. 
There have between 19,000 and 35,000 new asylum applications a year for the past 17 years. In that period the number of applications rejected has dropped from 74% in 2004 to 46% in 2019. But this jumped back to 70% in 2020.
Around three-quarters of applicants refused asylum at initial decision lodged an appeal and almost one third of those appeals were allowed. 
There are calls for the Home Office to review their policies and practices in the wake of the attack after it emerged suicide bomber Enzo Almeni, 32, had been in the UK for seven years without gaining permanent residency.   

His 1lb bomb went off as his taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital just before the 11am national silence on Remembrance Sunday. 
There have been conflicting reports about what the device was made of. 
Some insiders claimed it was packed with ball bearings and made using homemade TATP explosives. TATP is unstable and known as a 'Mother of Satan' because it is liable to blow up accidentally. It was used by Islamist terrorist in the Paris suicide attacks of 2015, the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017 and the failed Parsons Green Underground station. 
But other experts believe he may have bought his explosives online or on the high street and may have even constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
Detectives are now trying to trace Al Swealmeen's movements to discover whether he bought his explosives online or on the high street. Experts now fear the bomber constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
A former counter-terror official told The Telegraph: 'The white smoke that can be seen billowing out of the cab could indicate the use of gunpowder and there is also a flash within the cab itself which could be powder burning.
'It is possible to construct homemade devices using fireworks, but it still requires a degree of expertise and planning.'
There are suspicions that he might have followed a recipe for the material used by the 7/7 bombers who targeted London in 2005. 
Worryingly, no one who knew him raised the alarm about his behaviour. His local mental health trust said he had previously been receiving help, but was no longer a patient. 
A Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We can confirm Emad Al Swealmeen had previously accessed our services but was not a service user at the time of the incident.'
Friends said Al Swealmeen had wrestled with depression and was sectioned in 2014 after he was rejected for asylum for the first time. 
They recalled how the bomber was so 'car mad' that he nicknamed himself 'GT' and had the initials tattooed on his arm along with a chequered flag. 
He changed his name to Enzo Almeni – after the Ferrari boss – and loved go-karting so much that that he bought his own helmet and got friends to sign it.
He was a regular at the TeamSport Go-karting track, on Liverpool's Brunswick docks, often going with his housemates or on his own to race laps.
Friends said they were astounded that the 'quiet and bashful' young man, who was also a big fan of country singer Johnny Cash, was behind the Poppy Day bomb.
One, who knew Al Swealmeen through his job at a pizza takeaway, said: 'He called himself GT because he loved cars, it was a little nickname he gave himself, he even had it tattooed on his arm.
'He was quiet, but not in a weird way, he was just really shy. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw his picture. Of all the people that worked in the takeaway he would have been bottom of my list to do something so sick.
'He was reserved, but not like he was hiding something, more like he was lacking in confidence. He did speak to me about feeling depressed one time, but didn't really go into it. At the time he lived in a shared house with a few others and all he cared about was go-karting.
'He showed me his helmet that he had bought, he was really excited about it. He went go-karting a few times on his own, he was so into it, and I remember him getting a tattoo and showing it off.
'He also loved Johnny Cash and he told me he wanted to get a Johnny Cash tattoo too.'
Malcolm Hitchcott, 77, a lay pastor and retired Army officer who gave Al Swealmeen a room in his home for eight months in 2017, remembered accompanying him on a trip to the track.
Pictures on social media show him in racing overalls at the karting venue, where he took part in 'Top Gun' marathon karting races and '50-lap' events. 'He got me to sign his helmet, rather like Lewis Hamilton signs helmets [for fans],' 
Mr Hitchcott added: 'He never spoke about a particular driver but he loved Ferrari, he was a Ferrari man. His email address was Ferrari-related too. He was very interested in motor racing.'
The indoor facility boasts 40mph karts and several of Liverpool's sporting greats such as Jamie Carragher, Sam Quek and Tony Bellew on its celebrity leaderboard.
But a source said Al Swealmeen had not been to the track for over a year. Last night the businessman who employed Al Swealmeen at his pizza takeaway for several months in around 2016 said he was a 'nice, polite guy'.
'I was shocked when I saw who it was,' the man, who did not want to be named, said.
'I still can't believe it. He was a nice, polite guy. He wasn't a practising Muslim, he told me he lived with a Christian family, and he definitely wasn't a fanatic.
'I've employed Muslims before, some of them don't like touching ham if it isn't Halal, but he didn't seem worried about that.
'He worked part-time for me, he had a visa and was legit. I paid him about £50 a day.
'Never in a million years would I think him capable of something like that.'
The friend agreed Al Swealmeen was not religious.
'He never really talked about religion,' he added. 
'I didn't think he practised any faith, although I do remember him telling me one time he had been to church and was trying to get to know people there.
'I would love to know what happened to him over the past few years. He must have been manipulated or corrupted. The man I knew and what he did on Sunday – they are like night and day.'",-2
1835,"“A NEW GLOBAL energy economy is emerging.” Thus declared Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, a global forecaster, launching the organisation’s World Energy Outlook, its annual flagship report, on October 13th. It is appearing less than three weeks before COP26, a big UN climate summit, gets under way in Glasgow. Not by chance: the IEA brought publication forward by a month so that the report could be a “guidebook” for the UN's shindig. 
The new economy detected by Mr Birol still has a long way to go. To be sure, the report spies it in many places. Clean energy, such as wind and solar, is the cheapest source of new power in most regions. Electric vehicles account for a tenth of new car sales in China and Europe. And since 2016 more green investment has flowed into the power sector, which is crucial for decarbonisation, than into the oil and gas industry. 

But the report's main purpose is to forecast the various paths the world could take as it tries to decarbonise. In the most pessimistic pathway, countries adhere to their stated energy policies and global warming continues unabated. On this trajectory, there is a 50% chance that the world’s mean surface temperature will increase by 2.6°C, and still be rising, by the end of this century, relative to pre-industrial levels. Another possible trajectory assumes that countries honour the climate pledges they have announced so far, which are more ambitious than their stated policies. Faster decarbonisation ensues (see chart). In that case, fossil-fuel demand peaks around 2025 and the planet’s heating is limited to about 2.1°C.
The best-case scenario is one in which the world only warms by 1.5°C by the end of the century—the more ambitious end of the target governments agreed on at the Paris climate summit in 2015. Increasingly climate science suggests that, in terms of the detrimental impact of climate change, the gap between 1.5°C of warming and 2°C (the upper bound of the Paris goal) is large. To achieve that cooler goal, carbon-dioxide emissions must be net zero by the middle of the century. The world is way off track. Countries’ current climate pledges would achieve less than 20% of the emissions cuts by 2030 needed to keep warming to 1.5°C.
How can the world get onto the right path? The IEA points to four areas of policy that need sharpened focus over the next decade: using clean electricity for more purposes, such as transport or heating; energy efficiency; preventing leaks from fossil-fuel operations; and boosting green innovation. All this ambition will, of course, require plenty of money. To cut carbon-dioxide emissions to net zero by mid-century, the IEA estimates, investment relating to the energy transition needs to grow three-fold, to roughly $4trn a year by 2030.
Much of the IEA’s analysis will not surprise those who follow the climate-change debate. But the report does add yet another voice to calls for more climate action ahead of COP26. And the IEA’s calls are particularly striking. The organisation was founded in 1974, after the first oil shock. Its aim back then was to protect the interests of oil-importing countries. Now as another energy crisis shakes the world, it wants more than ever to rid those countries of fossil fuels. ■

1836,"A picture showing a grinning Prince Andrew was on display at Jeffery Epstein's notorious 'Pleasure Palace' where he was accused of molesting teenage girls.
The image, which sat next to a framed photograph of billionaire paedophile Epstein at his former Florida retreat in Palm Beach, shows a smiling Andrew apparently in military uniform in his younger years.
The Duke of York, 61, had previously denied making frequent visits to Epstein's Florida home, despite the former housekeeper Juan Alessi claiming Andrew spent 'weeks at a time' at the property when he was working there.
Sources warned the revelation of a picture being proudly displayed at Epstein's home was 'incredibly damaging' for the embattled royal.
One told the Sun: 'Epstein cultivated powerful friends and would show them off in pictures around all of his homes.
'This is incredibly damaging for Prince Andrew because it shows how highly Jeffrey prized his friendship with a senior member of the Royal Family. His picture was shown off in Jeffrey's home like a trophy.'
Sources indicated the scandal-hit royal faces further public scrutiny as news of the picture emerged.
The source continued: 'Andrew's reputation is hit every time something like this emerges - and he is already facing another year of further lurid headlines.'
In his 2019 Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew admitted he had visited Epstein's Florida home, but denied making repeated visits.
He explained: 'I definitely did not visit his Palm Beach house three or four times a year, absolutely not. In total, probably four times in total throughout the time that I knew him.
'In fact probably that was the place that...if you see what I mean, he was in the house more there than in other...in other places that I was at. But it was usually because I was going...I was going through and on somewhere else so it was a day, that was it.'  
Other newly released pictures showed the financier donning a kilt as he poses with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is pictured elsewhere riding a motorbike near Scotland's Skibo Castle. 
Friday marked the latest development in the Epstein saga, as the Duke of York faces a US lawsuit from Virginia Roberts Giuffre who claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew.
The Duke of York also faced a fresh headache this week when campaigners and experts warned his finances should be investigated by MPs and tax authorities.
Prince Andrew faced mounting scrutiny on Tuesday over whether he broke the Royal Family’s conduct rules by accepting a £1.5million off-shore payment from Tory donor and long-term friend David Rowland.
The Queen’s scandal-hit second son received the payment days before he paid off a loan from the financier’s own Luxembourg bank.
Buckingham Palace conduct rules state that royals should ‘never accept gifts of money, or money equivalent, in connection with an official engagement or duty’.
The Duke of York has previously been accused of attending naked pool parties and receiving massages by Epstein's former butler Juan Alessi, 70.  
Alessi, who started working for Epstein in 1991, has previously been interviewed by the FBI, police and victims' lawyers and said the Prince stayed for 'weeks at a time' in a sworn statement to Palm Beach police in 2005.  
Prince Andrew has consistently denied all sexual allegations made against him.  
Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges that alleged he abused women and girls under the age 18 at the Florida estate and his Manhattan mansion in the early 2000s. 
The waterfront property became the epicentre where he groomed and sexually assaulted underage girls and women as part of a sprawling sex trafficking scheme, prosecutors said.
The house was where the crimes that would eventually lead to his downfall were first reported in 2005.
Epstein had been recruiting underage girls for 'massages' from Palm Beach high school and one eventually confessed to her mother what was going on, who then went to the police.
The girls would be hired to massage Epstein in their underwear or totally naked. Often the massages progressed to sexual touching as Epstein allegedly used vibrators on the girls and masturbated.
He paid them hundreds of dollars at a time with another $200 going to other schoolgirls who recruited them to go to mansion on Palm Beach's El Brillo Way.
Dozens of victims were underprivileged middle and high school girls recruited in and around Palm Beach County between 1998 and 2006.
Earlier this year, demolition crews ripped down the notorious Palm Beach mansion where the financier sexually assaulted young girls. 
The property, which had stood since 1952 and was bought by Epstein in 1990 for around £2million, included a main house, a pool cabana building and another staff house - all of which were demolished.  
Developer Todd Michael Glaser purchased the sprawling Palm Beach estate for $18.5million (£13.7m) and he sighed 'finally' as the first bulldozers began raising the house of horrors to the ground on April 18.
Glaser, who has previously said it would be personally satisfying to tear down the mansion due to its horrific history, said he plans to replace it with a 14,000-square-foot 'Art Moderne home'.",-2
1837,"OFFICIAL FIGURES say there have been 55,000 covid deaths in South Africa since March 27th last year. That puts the country’s death rate at 92.7 per 100,000 people, the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. It is also a significant underestimate—as, it seems safe to infer, are all the other African data on the disease.
Over the year to May 8th the country recorded 158,499 excess deaths—that is, deaths above the number that would be expected on past trends, given demographic changes. Public-health officials feel confident that 85-95% of those deaths were caused by SARS-CoV-2, the covid-19 virus, almost three times the official number. The discrepancy is the result of the fact that, for a death to be registered as caused by covid-19, the deceased needs to have had a covid test and been recorded as having died from the disease. Although South Africa does a lot of testing compared with neighbouring countries, its overall rate is still low. And the cause of death is unevenly recorded for those who die at home.

South Africa is not particularly unusual in its levels of testing or in missing deaths outside the medical system. Excess mortality has outstripped deaths officially reported as due to covid-19, at least at some points in the course of the epidemic, in most if not all of the world. According to the most recent data, America’s excess deaths were 7.1% higher than its official covid-19 deaths between early March 2020 and mid-April 2021.
Studies of such mismatches have proved illuminating in some countries. For example, Britain saw excess deaths higher than official covid-19 deaths during its first wave, but lower than the official covid death rates in the second—an effect taken to show that measures to stop the spread of covid had saved lives which in another year would have been lost to other diseases, such as seasonal flu, perhaps. Something similar was seen in France.
But the excess-mortality method has failed to provide useful or robust global figures for the simple reason that most countries, and in particular most poor countries, do not provide excess-mortality statistics in a timely fashion. Global estimates have used the official numbers, despite knowing that the figure—currently 3.3m—surely falls well short of the true total.
  
To try to put numbers on how much of an underestimate it is—and thus on how great the true burden has been—The Economist has attempted to model the level of excess mortality over the course of the pandemic in countries that do not report it. This work gives a 95% probability that the death toll to date is between 7.1m and 12.7m, with a central estimate of 10.2m. The official numbers represent, at best, a bit less than half the true toll, and at worst only about a quarter of it.
As well as providing a new estimate of the overall size of the pandemic, the modelling sheds light on the distribution of its effects and on its overall course.


Unsurprisingly, most of the deaths caused by covid-19 but not attributed to it are found in low- and middle-income countries. Our figures give a death rate for the mostly rich countries which belong to the OECD of 1.17 times the official number. The estimated death rate for sub-Saharan Africa is 14 times the official number. And the first-and-second-wave structure seen in Europe and the United States is much less visible in the model’s figures for the world as a whole. Overall, the pandemic is increasingly concentrated in developing economies and continuing to grow.
To create these global estimates of total excess deaths during the pandemic, we drew on a wide range of data. Official counts of covid-19 deaths, however imperfect they may be, are available for most countries; they are shown in the top map on this page. So, frequently, are data on the number of covid cases and the share of covid tests that are positive. In general, if lots of tests are coming back positive, it is a fair bet that many more infections are being missed by a testing regime that is looking only at those seeking medical treatment and those near them.
Boosting the gradient
In some places there have been seroprevalence surveys which show how many people have detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a sign of earlier infection. Other factors we thought might matter included the steps governments have taken to curb the spread of disease—such as closing schools—and the extent to which people moved around.
Demography matters a lot: more younger people typically means lower death rates. So, we inferred, do less obvious factors such as systems of government and the degree of media freedom. To take a specific example, excess deaths in Russia are 5.1 times greater than official covid deaths.
All told we collected data on 121 indicators for more than 200 countries and territories. We next trained a machine-learning model which used a process called gradient boosting to find relationships between these indicators and data on excess deaths in places where they were available. The finished model used those relationships to provide estimates of excess deaths in times and places for which there were no data available. A description of our methodology and the ways in which we tested it, as well as links to replication code and data, are here.
We estimate that, by May 10th, there was a 95% probability that the pandemic had brought about between 2.4m and 7.1m excess deaths in Asia (official covid-19 deaths: 0.6m), 1.5m-1.8m deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean (v 0.6m), 0-2.1m deaths in Africa (v 0.1m), 1.5m-1.6m deaths in Europe (v 1.0m) and 0.6m-0.7m deaths in America and Canada (v 0.6m). In Oceania, with only 1,218 official deaths, the model predicted somewhere between -12,000 and 13,000, the lower bound reflecting the possibility that precautions against covid-19 had reduced deaths from other causes.
The ranges for Africa and Asia are spectacularly wide. So they should be. The data from which to make strong predictions are not available, and in some places do not exist. Yet, wide as they are, they provide a more reliable picture than official tallies. The 50% probability ranges narrow considerably: 3.3m-5.2m for Asia, 0.8m-1.6m for Africa, 8.2m-10.5m for the world.
During 2020 deaths per day rose for 33 of 52 weeks. After a brief lull at the beginning of 2021, they shot up to new highs, driven in large part by the tragedy currently unfolding in India. Our model suggests the country is seeing between 6,000 and 31,000 excess deaths a day, well in excess of official figures around the 4,000 mark. This fits with independent epidemiological estimates of between 8,000 and 32,000 a day. On the basis of the model it would appear that around 1m people may have died of covid-19 in India so far this year. Again, this does not seem out of line with other estimates.
The Indian catastrophe will eventually abate, as lesser spikes have elsewhere. But that does not mean that the global picture will improve. Though the disease rises and falls in waves in any given place—a first wave takes some of the most vulnerable and leads to responses that lower spread, a second wave builds up when those responses are loosened—the waves are not all in sync. That is why, to date, the number of daily deaths worldwide has increased in ten out of 15 months, including some, such as June and July last year, when much of the rich world was between waves.
It is worth noting, though, that despite hitting the poorer parts of the world harder than indicated by data on covid-related deaths, on a per-person basis covid-19 really has been worse in richer countries. For Asia and Africa, the average estimated deaths per million people are about half those of Europe (including Russia). India is comparable to Britain, at least for now.
This might sound surprising to Europeans, who have been in lockdown for the better part of a year. How did people in these mostly poor countries see less death despite frequently lacking interventions to curb the spread of the virus and having less well-funded health care? It seems likely that much of the answer comes down to age. If two populations have the same level of health care, the one with more elderly people will see more deaths. If demography were the only difference, estimates of the way that the risk of dying from covid-19 infection varies with age suggest the disease would be 13 times more deadly in Japan (median age 48) than Uganda (median age 17). Reliable excess-mortality data tend to come from countries with older, more vulnerable populations (see chart).
Low as they are in absolute terms, though, the death rates among poor young populations are much higher than they would be for populations in the rich world with similar age profiles. And for the elderly in poor countries the outlook is clearly grim. South Africa has seen 120,000 excess deaths among those over 60.
The fact that a relative lack of deaths in developing countries seems to be due to age, rather than anything else, has various implications. One is that the virus is spreading easily among younger people—a finding backed by seroprevalence surveys, which find far higher rates of past infection in Afghanistan, India and elsewhere than they do in Europe or America. This suggests lots of non-fatal cases of disease, something which suggests that the problem of “long covid” will be worse in these countries. It also means that the virus is getting plenty of opportunities to mutate.


There is an exception to this story. In some countries in South-East Asia, deaths seem remarkably low, at least so far. This is not an artefact of the model: excess-death data for Malaysia and Thailand have hardly risen at all. It is possible that people there benefit from “cross-immunities”—a level of protection against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by past infection by other viruses circulating in the region. Unfortunately, though, there are signs that the figures are now mounting (see Asia section).
The Economist’s global excess-death-toll estimates are, as far as we know, the first of their kind. They are not the only way to infer the total number of deaths due to covid-19. On May 6th the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington published the results of a simpler model which applies fixed multipliers, mostly based on test-positivity rates, to official covid-19 death tolls in different countries and territories. This methodology often provides numbers which fail to match reported excess deaths. For example, IHME estimates that there have been 100,000 covid-19 deaths in Japan, far more than have been reported, but the excess-death figure for the year to March 2021 was -11,000.
However they are made, estimates are no substitute for data, notes Ariel Karlinsky, a statistician at the Kohelet Economic Forum, an Israeli think-tank, who as leader of the World Mortality Dataset project has collected many of the excess-mortality data on which The Economist’s model relies. Only by better tracking of mortality in poor countries can estimates of the death rate be improved. Resources should be put into such measures not just to honour the dead and the truth, but also because, without such basic numbers, estimates of other impacts—economic, educational, cultural or in the health of survivors—are hard to understand, or to compare. ■

1838,"“A DEBT THAT we owe to the global community” is how Santiago Wills, Colombia’s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva, described the talks he has been chairing on ending subsidies for fishing that damages global stocks. Sadly, he was announcing a default. The aim of finalising an agreement by the end of this year will be missed. Negotiations have dragged on for two decades. They had been given some impetus by the decision in 2015 to include in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the aim of eliminating subsidies “by 2020”, a target missed and reinterpreted to mean the end of the year. But environmentalists are despondent that the last vestige of a hard deadline has now vanished. “Missing the SDG target is really important,” says Annabelle Bladon of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a think-tank in London.
The talks are intended to eliminate subsidies that contribute to “illegal, unreported and unregulated” (IUU) fishing, estimated to account for a remarkable 20-50% of the global catch, as well as those that sustain legal overfishing and the building of overcapacity. Many fish stocks are collapsing. It is estimated that the proportion of the total stock of fish in the oceans that are overfished—ie, exploited at such a pace that the fish population cannot replenish itself—has risen from 10% in 1974 to 34% now. This is endangering coastal communities that rely on fishing. Roughly 39m people depend on capture fisheries for their livelihood. And fish provide 20% of animal-protein needs on average for 3.3bn people.

A big reason why it remains profitable to fish when stocks are low (and hence more expensive to catch) is that governments subsidise the industry—in a wide range of ways from cheap boats and gear to free ice, but above all, through cut-price fuel. Of the $35bn a year lavished on the industry, about $22bn ($7.7bn of which is for fuel) is estimated to contribute to the destruction of fish stocks. Some environmentally devastating practices—such as China’s bottom-trawling off the west African coast—are especially fuel-intensive both in the distance sailed and the type of fishing itself. A study published in 2018 in Science Advances, a journal, found that, without subsidies, 54% of high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable. Another study, by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has calculated that ending all harmful subsidies could result, by 2050, in a 12.5% increase in global fish biomass and a 3.5% rise in the annual global fish catch.
Mr Wills laid much of the blame for the failure to meet the deadline on the pandemic. It is certainly true that covid-19 has preoccupied governments, sucking attention, resources and political will away from many other concerns, including obscure and long-running talks at the WTO. It did not help that Switzerland in March banned all but very small gatherings, interrupting the process. The postponement of the WTO’s biennial ministerial meeting, due to be held in Kazakhstan in June, was a further setback to hopes of a political push for a deal. So had been the failure to appoint a new director-general after Robert Azevêdo relinquished the role in September, leaving the organisation with no high-profile advocate of a deal.
Big differences still remain between the parties despite the circulation of a revised, “consolidated” draft text last month. At issue are such basics as the scope of the agreement (should it cover all sorts of subsidy?) and the definitions of “overfishing” and “overfished stocks” (with environmentalists complaining they rely on vague, unscientific language). And should a ban on subsidies apply just to individual vessels engaged in overfishing, or to the operators of fleets (since a cash subsidy for fuel to an innocent vessel is fungible)? Then there is the handling of “unassessed” fish stocks, ie, those not sufficiently surveyed to be judged sustainable or not, which by some estimates account for more than 70% of the global catch, and many of which are believed to be severely overfished. Even the definition of “fish” has proved contentious.
But the issue that has probably generated the most heat is that of “Special and Differential Treatment” (SDT) for poorer countries—ie, exemptions. It has always been accepted that some such carve-outs would be needed. It is even included in the wording of the missed SDG, and is one of the “pillars” of the talks. But if too much is excluded from the agreement it will become meaningless. China for example wants SDT and counts itself a developing country. It is by far the most important fishing nation, with the largest fleet, accounting for about one-fifth of the global catch. It is also the world’s biggest exporter of fish and, predictably, the biggest subsidiser. But other countries too—in particular, India, another big fishing country, but one with a fleet confined largely, unlike China’s, to its own waters—have also argued hard for big exemptions. And India is pushing for a weak dispute-settlement mechanism. Rich countries, too, subsidise their fishing industries and, as the issue’s curious prominence in the fraught Brexit negotiations show, it is one where nationalist and protectionist sentiments run deep.
So, despite the disappointment, few who have followed the talks are surprised by the failure to meet the deadline. Mr Wills insisted on an optimistic take, preparing to circulate a new draft and chair resumed negotiations next month. Even some outside observers, like Isabel Jarrett, manager of the programme to end harmful fisheries subsidies at the Pew Charitable Trusts, point to progress, saying the parties “are closer than they have ever been” to success. Getting them to the finishing line may require the pressure of a WTO ministerial meeting, and even then, the outcome might be an agreement riddled with loopholes. Meanwhile, as Mr Wills pointed out, that debt keeps getting bigger.",2
1839,"CHRISTIAN LINDNER, the leader of Germany’s pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), is likely to emerge as a crucial figure after the election. Polling suggests it will be hard to form a coalition without the FDP. The 42-year-old Mr Lindner will relish the chance to cap his rapid political ascent with a job inside Germany’s next government—ideally as finance minister. His enemies would see that as their worst nightmare.
The FDP advocates tax cuts, slashing red tape, pension reform and limits to European fiscal integration. More recently it has urged a faster easing of lockdown rules. The party has doubled its support in the past year, thanks in part to the collapse of the conservative CDU/CSU. A snappy dresser and charismatic performer who regularly tops “Germany’s hottest politician” lists, Mr Lindner dominates his party to the exclusion of its other talents. At a recent campaign event in Berlin he was swarmed by admirers after delivering a fiery speech in which he sniped viciously at the Greens’ plans for debt-funded investment.

For decades the FDP was the kingmaker of German politics, propping up coalitions led by the CDU/CSU or the SPD. But the next government will probably need three parties to make up the numbers. That could mean a choice between a right-leaning “Jamaica” coalition, with Armin Laschet as chancellor, or an SPD-run “traffic-light” grouping, led by Olaf Scholz. Both would include the FDP and the Greens as junior partners. In 2017 Mr Lindner aborted Angela Merkel’s attempts to form a Jamaica coalition, declaring it better not to govern at all than to govern badly. “The FDP didn’t give us a millimetre,” says Lisa Paus, a Green MP involved in the talks.
This year Mr Lindner will hope to give Jamaica another try. He gets on well with Mr Laschet, with whom he built a CDU-FDP coalition in North Rhine-Westphalia in 2017. But as the SPD’s prospects have grown, Mr Lindner has opened the door to Mr Scholz by quietly softening his stance on fiscal issues. His price for making possible a traffic-light government would be the finance ministry, a perch from which he would seek to rein in the spending plans of the SPD and Greens (and France’s aspirations to deepen euro-zone integration). Many Greens and Social Democrats detest Mr Lindner’s brand of politics, and the feelings are mutual. From this witches’ brew of resentment and mistrust, a government may somehow emerge.",2
1840,"AT FIRST GLANCE, a murder in Istanbul, an abduction in Dubai and a deportation from Austria may seem to be unrelated. But they are all part of a disturbing pattern of behaviour by authoritarian regimes, which are using violence, intimidation and technology to silence dissent abroad. A report published on February 4th by Freedom House, a think-tank, argues that “transnational repression” has become more common. It found that 31 states had physically attacked their citizens living in other countries since 2014, with China, Russia and Rwanda among the worst offenders. China alone is responsible for 214 of the 608 direct attacks recorded. Millions more have been intimidated by harassment, digital surveillance and smear campaigns.
Regimes differ in the way they choose their targets. China goes after a wide variety of victims: religious and ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs, political dissidents, human-rights activists, journalists and former princelings. Russia targets outspoken politicians and former insiders who might spill President Vladimir Putin’s secrets. The Kremlin does not usually harass ordinary Russians abroad. However, the regime in Chechnya, a violent Russian republic, does. Chechens who have fled to western Europe are routinely spied on, threatened and occasionally killed. Iran and Saudi Arabia target outspoken exiles. Turkey hunts for Gulenists, members of an Islamic group whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for an attempted coup in 2016.

Physical attacks, such as murders, assaults, detentions and illegal deportations, are the most direct method of crushing enemies abroad. Freedom House believes there have been many more cases than it has managed to count. Blatant assassinations, such as the dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and a columnist for the Washington Post, in his country’s consulate in Istanbul, are quite rare. Illegal deportations and forced renditions, favourite tactics of Iran and Turkey, are more discreet. Dissenters can be hauled back home, tortured and sometimes executed away from the gaze of disapproving foreigners.
Grabbing people on foreign soil can be hard to do alone, so many countries turn for help to friendly foreign powers or even to formal international agreements. The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a security pact involving China, India, Russia and five Asian “stans”, has a shared “blacklist” of dissidents. Saudi Arabia uses the Gulf Co-operation Council to keep tabs on unreliable exiles.
Democracies can be unwitting accomplices. In March 2020 Austria complied with a request to deport Hizbullo Shovalizoda, an activist, back to Tajikistan. Austria’s Supreme Court later invalidated his extradition, but he is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for extremism. Rogue regimes have long manipulated the “red notices” of Interpol, an international policing organisation, to snare their opponents abroad (Russia has issued more than 40% of all such requests for arrest pending extradition now in circulation). And America’s “war on terror” provided regimes with both a model for rendition and a criminal label for those they want to abuse: 58% of the victims identified by Freedom House had been accused of terrorism.
Governments can also make exiles’ lives difficult in more subtle ways. Common tactics include withholding travel documents, denying consular services and threatening relatives back home. For example, in its attempt to shut down the website of a group of Ahmadis, a religious minority, in America, Pakistan has reminded the exiles that Ahmadis back home can be charged with blasphemy for referring to themselves as Muslims. Since many have relatives in Pakistan, where blasphemy is punishable by death, this is a potent threat.
Technology is making it easier for states to oppress at a distance. The internet and social-media networks which at first connected and empowered dissidents can now trap them, explains Marcus Michaelsen, a researcher who studies authoritarian politics. The Arab Spring a decade ago was a turning point. From thousands of kilometres away, states are now able to track the movements of anyone with a smartphone or a laptop, deploying surveillance software and malware to monitor and harass them. Some even have “backdoor access” to social-media platforms. Saudi Arabia bribed a Saudi programmer at Twitter to provide the whereabouts of troublesome tweeters. China is believed to exercise control over WeChat, a lifeline for Chinese abroad. Such technologies make it easier not only to find out where people are, but then to threaten them, or worse.
Technology also makes repressive regimes more aware of far-flung dissidents’ grumbling. Once they had no idea what the diaspora said about the tyrant back home. Now they can monitor social media and hear every unencrypted and possibly seditious word. This makes the exiles seem more of a threat, so repressive regimes feel more impelled to go after them.
The technology and tactics of extraterritorial repression are, for their perpetrators, helpfully inexpensive. “More and more states are realising that this is easy to do and fairly cheap,” says Gerasimos Tsourapas, of the University of Birmingham. Rwanda, a small, fairly poor African country, is a striking example. Determined to silence those who challenge its self-image as an African “development darling”—and to crack down on those who question its version of the country’s bloody history—the government extends its repressive reach far beyond its borders. Last year Paul Rusesabagina, a former hotelier whose heroism saving Tutsis during the genocide was portrayed in the film “Hotel Rwanda”, was kidnapped in Dubai and brought home. He has since been charged with terrorism; many suspect his real crime is to be an outspoken opponent of Rwanda’s autocratic president, Paul Kagame. Like China, Rwanda seeks to control its people abroad through spyware, an army of social-media trolls, and a coercive network of embassies and expatriate organisations. Senior regime insiders who defect have the most to fear. A former intelligence chief, for example, was strangled in a hotel room in South Africa. But Freedom House says that “all Rwandans are at risk of transnational repression.”
One reason why rogue states get away with harassing exiles is that democracies often look the other way. Sometimes, argues Mr Tsourapas, by acceding to extradition requests and Interpol red notices, and by broadening the definition of terrorism, they have even been complicit.
Extraterritorial repression is not new—Leon Trotsky was in Mexico City, more than 10,000km from Moscow, when Stalin had him murdered with an ice pick. What is new is the ease with which dissidents can be snooped on from afar. This, coupled with the global rise of authoritarian regimes and the disinclination of the previous American administration to advocate human rights, has allowed ever more despots to spread fear globally. As Freedom House argues, stopping them will require the re-assertion of international norms and the punishment of the worst offenders.",2
1841,"Andrew Marr today revealed he was leaving the BBC after 21 years, including 16 years fronting his Sunday morning political programme - and will join LBC and Classic FM.
The 62-year-old said he was 'keen to get my own voice back' and would now focus on presenting political and cultural radio shows and writing for newspapers.
Father-of-three Marr, who is married to fellow political journalist Jackie Ashley, 67, and earns up to £339,999 a year at the BBC, added that leaving to join LBC's owners Global would give him 'a new freedom' to do journalism with 'no filter'. 
MailOnline understands that Global will be paying Marr at least £500,000 a year for his new role, although the Leicester Square-based network refused to confirm this. 
Industry experts said LBC would be a 'great home for Andrew as he won't have to abide by the BBC's strict impartiality rules'. It comes after Marr hinted in May that he may be leaving the BBC because of 'not being able to speak in your own voice'.
The Glasgow-born veteran broadcaster joined the BBC in May 2000 as political editor and later spent 16 years at the helm of his own Sunday morning show. 
Global said Marr will be presenting new shows on LBC and Classic FM, a new weekly podcast on Global Player, and will also write a regular column for LBC's website. 
His exit comes as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg is said to be in discussions about leaving her role to become a presenter on Radio 4's Today programme.
Jon Sopel is the 6/4 favourite to replace her, with previous political editors such as Marr and Nick Robinson having moved on to other presenting jobs at the BBC.
This week Sarah Smith was made the BBC's new North America editor, taking over from Sopel, and Marr's departure suggests the staffing movements could continue. 
Marr tweeted today: 'Personal announcement. After 21 years, I have decided to move on from the BBC. l leave behind many happy memories and wonderful colleagues. 
'But from the New Year I am moving to Global to write and present political and cultural shows, and to write for newspapers.
'I think British politics and public life are going to go through an even more turbulent decade, and as I've said, I am keen to get my own voice back.
Andrew William Stevenson Marr was born in Glasgow in 1959 and was privately educated in Scotland before gaining a first-class English degree at Cambridge University.
His media career began in 1981 when he joined The Scotsman as a trainee reporter, and in 1984 he moved to London where he worked as a parliamentary correspondent for the newspaper, before becoming a political correspondent.
He joined The Independent in 1986 as a member of the new newspaper's launch staff before leaving for The Economist, where he ultimately became its political editor.
Marr returned to The Independent as the newspaper's political editor in 1992, and became its editor in 1996, where he oversaw radical changes in its format in a bid to halt a decline in readership figures.
He left in early 1998, with some reports suggesting he was sacked, and took roles at different papers before arriving at the BBC as political editor in May 2000. It was a position he held until 2005 when he began presenting The Andrew Marr Show which has become the most important political television show of the week.
He also presents Radio 4's Start the Week and has written more than a dozen books, including the History of Modern Britain.
Marr is married to political journalist Jackie Ashley, 67, with whom he has a son and two daughters – and he also has a love of painting.
In 2008 he took out a super-injunction to suppress reports of a relationship with a fellow journalist five years earlier.
At the time, he believed he had fathered a child with the woman. He also made maintenance payments – until he discovered through a DNA test that he was not the girl's father.
The affair, which ended in 2003, was common knowledge at Westminster and within the BBC, but the injunction banned publication of his name in connection with the story.
Marr later admitted he was 'embarrassed' about resorting to legal action, saying: 'I did not come into journalism to go around gagging journalists.'
Then in 2012 he was photographed putting his hand down the trousers of an unnamed female colleague during an intimate late-night clinch in a Soho back alley.
After the pictures emerged, he said: 'I am really embarrassed and so annoyed with myself. It was just a goodbye clinch. It had been a long drunken evening and it was just a silly thing.'
The veteran broadcaster, who lives in Primrose Hill, North London, has suffered a number of health scares over the past decade.
Marr was taken to hospital in January 2013 after suffering the stroke at home but returned to host his show later that year. In 2018, he declared 'it's good to be back' after undergoing an operation to have a cancerous tumour removed from his kidney.
In June he contracted Covid despite being double vaccinated and felt 'seriously ill' but had fully recovered by the end of his quarantine period.
'I have been doing the Andrew Marr show every Sunday morning for 16 years now and that is probably more than enough time for anybody!'
In a statement released by Global, Marr added: 'Coming to Global gives me a new freedom - to do fast-paced, very regular political journalism on LBC with no filter, in entirely my own voice. 
'On Classic FM, I'll be exploring my love of classical music, and culture generally, with some surprising guests. I feel I'm joining a young, hungrily ambitious and exciting company and I can't wait to get stuck in.' 
Marr received an annual salary from the BBC of up to £339,999 in the 2020/2021 year for his work on The Andrew Marr Show, Radio 4's Start the Week, documentaries for BBC One and election night.
This was down from a salary of up to £364,999 in 2019/2020, and up to £394,999 in 2018/2019.
Addressing Andrew Marr's departure from the BBC, its director-general Tim Davie said in a statement: 'Andrew Marr has been a brilliant journalist and presenter during his time at the BBC.
'He leaves an unmatched legacy of outstanding political interviews and landmark programmes. We wish him well for the next chapter.'
Other BBC colleagues including Newsnight policy editor Lewis Goodall were among those congratulating Marr on his lengthy career at the corporation.
Goodall wrote: 'What a huge loss to the BBC Andrew but what an incredible contribution over so long. Best of luck with the new gig.'
And Fran Unsworth, the BBC's outgoing director of news and current affairs, said: 'Throughout his long and distinguished career at the BBC, Andrew has been a firm favourite with our audiences.
'Andrew started at the BBC as a knowledgeable and insightful political editor and went on to become a feature of the UK's Sunday mornings, on Sunday AM, which became the Andrew Marr Show. He is a fantastic presenter and interviewer, whose wisdom and skill will be a loss to our screens.
'We thank him greatly for his years of service and wish him the best of luck in his new role.'
Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid added: 'Congratulations on the new role but this is a huge blow for the BBC and for those of us who rely on The Andrew Marr Show to set us up for the week ahead. Wishing the very best, to the best.' 
Sky News political editor Beth Rigby said: 'Sunday mornings won’t be the same without you on my telly. But very best of luck in your next chapter.' 
And his new LBC colleague Eddie Mair joked: 'It turns out that three years ago Global wanted to hire Marr but because of a typo they got me by mistake.' 
Global said his new 'opinion-led programme' on LBC will be 'fully visualized' on Global Player and he will 'give his view on the biggest issues of the moment, along with agenda-setting guests'.
The company said he was joining Britain's biggest commercial news talk station which has posted its highest ever listening figures, with more than three million people now tuning in across the UK each week. 
Radio industry consultant Paul Chantler told MailOnline today: 'Andrew Marr is a major signing for Global and will further enhance respect and credibility for LBC in particular. 
'LBC is going from strength to strength and now has a stellar lineup of presenters. It's a great home for Andrew as he won't have to abide by the BBC's strict impartiality rules. 
'At LBC, he will be allowed to express his own opinions and undertake interviews with attitude as impartiality is achieved across the output as a whole not just within a single programme. LBC will certainly allow him to find his own voice again.' 
Marr will also present a new programme on Classic FM, playing music and interviewing guests from the world of politics and arts. 
Andrew Marr's Sunday morning programme on BBC One has been appointment television for those in the Westminster bubble, as well as its keen observers. His departure from the corporation leaves a vacancy in one of the most high profile jobs in political journalism. Here are some of the contenders to replace him:
Laura Kuenssberg
The BBC's political editor is likely to be among the frontrunners for the job.
It was previously reported Kuenssberg is negotiating stepping away from her role of the past six years to join the Today programme as part of a major reshuffle of the BBC's on-air staff.
Zeinab Badawi
The presenter of BBC Global Questions and HardTalk has hosted Marr's show before so would be a familiar face to his regular viewers. She is bookmaker Coral's favourite to take over, with odds of 2-1.
Emily Maitlis
The presenter of Newsnight has won acclaim for her high profile interviews with the Duke of York, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton and would be a sparring partner to be reckoned with when sitting down with political leaders.
Andrew Neil
It has been mooted that the former long-time BBC presenter could return to the fold after he stepped down from his roles as the chairman and host of a prime-time show on GB News.
Neil has since said it was a 'huge mistake' for him to become the face of the fledgling channel and hinted he is keen for another job in TV, saying: 'I don't want GB News to be the full stop in my broadcasting career.

The former BBC political editor, who has filled in for Marr before, is currently a presenter of both BBC Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Political Thinking.

A regular presenter of BBC News At Six and Ten since 2010, the broadcaster has previously worked as the broadcaster's correspondent in Asia, Africa, Washington, Paris and Brussels.
Earlier this year he replaced John Humphrys as the host of Mastermind, when the veteran journalist stepped down after 18 years in the role.
Victoria Derbyshire
The award-winning broadcaster has presented some of the BBC's biggest programmes, including Newsnight and Panorama, and fronted her own current affairs show.
When plans to axe her self-titled BBC Two programme were leaked, the host said she was 'absolutely devastated'.
She was introduced to a whole new audience when she competed on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! last year.

The BBC's media editor is a presenter of the prestigious Today programme on Radio 4, as well as Start The Week.
He is also a restaurant critic and makes regular appearances on television as a guest on the judging panel of MasterChef.
Sophie Raworth
The BBC newsreader, who has also covered for Marr in the past, is one of the main presenters of the BBC News At Six and Ten. She has also presented election night coverage, as well as Watchdog, Crimewatch and coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show.
In May, Marr was interviewed at Aye Write, Glasgow's book festival, and was asked whether he ever felt 'a desperate urge to come out of the closet' over his political views, replying: 'Yes, absolutely.'
The Times reported at the time that Marr refused to say anything else about his personal political views, saying: 'I cannot tell you now because I will lose my job.' 
Marr added: 'There are many privileges of working at the BBC, including the size of the audience and all of that, but the biggest single frustration by far is losing your own voice, not being able to speak in your own voice.
'What I could say safely is that I think we are going to go through a period of politics — the next ten or 20 years — much more turbulent and much more interesting and testing and challenging then anything we have seen in the last ten years, which have been big enough. 
'I think it will be very, very hard for people like me to carry on being completely neutral and completely sotto voce all the way through that. At some point, I want to get out and use my own voice again.'
Ashley Tabor-King, founder and executive president of Global, said: 'Andrew is one of the finest and most respected broadcasters and journalists of our time and we are honored to welcome him to the Global family, especially at a moment when we are celebrating record audience figures.
'LBC now takes its next step. Andrew Marr will be an unmissable moment in the schedule and we are excited that he will be part of LBC and Classic FM's incredible presenter line-up.'  
Marr will join a host of other presenters at LBC including Nick Ferrari, James O'Brien, Eddie Mair, Shelagh Fogarty, Iain Dale, David Lammy, Camilla Tominey and Matt Frei.
He will also join the likes Alexander Armstrong, Moira Stuart, John Suchet, Myleene Klass, Margherita Taylor, Bill Turnbull, Alan Titchmarsh, John Humphrys and Charlotte Hawkins at Classic FM. 
James Rea, director of broadcasting and content at Global, said: 'It is fantastic to welcome a broadcaster of Andrew's calibre to Global. 
'We are looking forward to him bringing his sharp, political insight to LBC at such an exciting time for the station and his passion for classical music and the arts to Classic FM. I know that our audience will enjoy listening and interacting with him from next year.'
Marr has hosted the BBC's flagship political programme, The Andrew Marr Show, for the past 16 years and regularly presents on BBC Radio 4.
He is also a documentary-maker and author, having written more than a dozen books.
It comes just nine days after veteran broadcaster Adam Boulton, who is the same age at 62, said he would leave Sky News following more than 30 years after saying that there is a 'move against the Baby Boomers' in the TV world.
Having joined the channel as political editor for its launch in 1989, the 62-year-old public school-educated Oxford graduate has served as editor-at-large since 2014.
Mr Boulton's departure was said to have been a mutual decision, although he said in an exit interview that television was now 'very sensitive to the idea of diversity'.
Speaking about his fellow veteran Sky broadcasters Dermot Murnaghan, 63, and Kay Burley, 60, Mr Boulton told The Times: 'We've had our day.' 
The announcement of his departure came after John Ryley, the head of Sky News, said TV was moving away from the era of the 'all-powerful anchor'.
And it was announced just seven months after his fellow veteran broadcaster Jon Snow said he would leave Channel 4 News at the end of this year.
The 73-year-old, who has spent 32 years as the show's anchor, said he felt it was 'time to move on'. However, he will continue to front future 'longer-form projects' for Channel 4.
Earlier this week Sarah Smith was appointed as the BBC's new North America editor.
The 52-year-old, who became the broadcaster's first ever Scotland editor in 2014, takes over from Jon Sopel who left the post last month after seven years.
Prior to this, she was based in the US working for Channel 4 and helped cover big American news stories such as the 2008 presidential election and the global financial crash.
Smith is also a regular host on BBC programmes including the Today programme and Newsnight. She began her journalistic career as a trainee at BBC Scotland.
Her father was former Labour leader John Smith, who served as party leader from July 1992 until his death from a heart attack in May 1994. 
The Archbishop of York cut up his dog collar during The Andrew Marr Show in December 2007 in protest over Robert Mugabe's rule of Zimbabwe.
Dr John Sentamu said he would refuse to wear the Anglican symbol of office until Mugabe was no longer in power.
His demonstration followed Mugabe's controversial presence at the EU summit with African leaders in Lisbon
The archbishop criticised African leaders who rallied round Mugabe and defended him as a freedom fighter who liberated his country from white rule.
Speaking on Marr's programme, Dr Sentamu took off his dog collar, saying: 'As an Anglican this is what I wear to identify myself, that I'm a clergyman.'
He then took out a pair of scissors before snipping away at the dog collar, adding: 'Do you know what Mugabe has done? 
'He has taken people's identity and literally, if you don't mind, cut it to pieces.
'So, as far as I am concerned, from now on I am not going to wear a dog collar until Mugabe is gone.'
In November 2017, he put the dog collar back on, again on The Andrew Marr Show, after Mr Mugabe left office following 37 years of authoritarian rule.
David Cameron was told to 'shut up' by broadcaster Andrew Marr while appearing on his BBC programme in April 2014.
As the show drew to a close, the then-prime minister tried to speak about the schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria by the Boko Haram Islamist group.
But footage published online shows Marr appearing to say: 'I, I…Prime Minister shut up I'm afraid. I'm really, really sorry, we have run out of time.'
However, Mr Cameron did not appear to be angered by the interruption and quickly replied to Marr: 'I've gone on, sorry.'
Andrew Marr faced criticism for his interview with Boris Johnson in October last year, which led to the BBC having to defend him as 'duly impartial'.
The interview, which was said to have left 10 Downing Street furious, saw him interrupt the Prime Minister and claimed he was not telling the truth about wage growth in Britain.
Mr Johnson argued during the programme: 'After more than 10 years of flatlining, what you're seeing is people with low incomes being paid more.'
But Mr Marr retorted: 'You've said something that isn't true, I'm afraid. The Office of National Statistics (ONS), your own body, says that wages are not keeping pace with inflation. So, in real terms, over the last three months, wages have gone down, not up.'
LBC radio presenter Iain Dale later praised Marr as an impartial interrogator, but Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she would 'argue otherwise'.
In a response to viewer complaints, the BBC said: 'There were many issues covered in the interview with the prime minister, such as violence against women, the HGV driver shortage and the national insurance tax rise, and so it was imperative for Mr Marr to keep the conversation on track in order to have time for them all. Sometimes Mr Marr repeated his question to press the prime minister into giving a clear answer for the audience.
'Mr Johnson is no stranger to robust and challenging interviews and we consider it is appropriate to hold the leader of the nation to account on different issues. However, we're satisfied that Mr Marr questioned Mr Johnson in a fair, duly impartial and professional manner.'",-2
1842,"THE WORLD'S leaders may quail at extinguishing coal-fired plants or raising petrol prices, but they can be relied upon to embrace one ally in the fight against climate change: the tree. For all his claims that climate change was a hoax, even Donald Trump, as president, championed an initiative to plant a trillion trees. So there is cause for scepticism about the pact, announced at the Glasgow climate summit this week, to put an end to deforestation before the decade is out.
The world has seen similar non-binding declarations before. In 2014, governments, companies and non-governmental organisations committed to halving deforestation by 2020 and ending it by 2030, under the New York declaration on forests. The first target was missed, the second looks to be a stretch. And those trillion trees remain an achievement chiefly of alliteration. Nevertheless, this week’s announcements significantly improve on previous efforts.

This time, Brazil and Indonesia have signed on (though India has not). States have promised to stump up cash to protect and restore forests, including in the Congo basin, and recognised that indigenous people are best-placed to care for the forests they live in. At least as significant is the commitment from the private sector, including large financial institutions, to root deforestation out of their supply chains and portfolios.

Forests serve as carbon “sinks”, sponging up a net 7.6bn tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. Slashing, burning or thinning trees or otherwise degrading ecosystems accounts for 11% of emissions. So programmes to plant and protect forests will be essential to meeting the Paris agreement’s targets of limiting the rise in global average temperatures to between 1.5°C and “well below 2°C” above pre-industrial levels. The text of the Paris agreement envisions a balance between anthropogenic emissions and sinks “in the second half of this century”. This has already led to a flurry of national and corporate strategies for hitting net-zero emissions through forestry, from restoring carbon-rich peatlands to developing agroforestry.
The problem is that the world lacks a shared, sensible system for valuing the contribution of trees to sequestering carbon. This is an accounting puzzle of great complexity. Depending on whether and how it is solved, trees could wind up being either part of the solution to global warming or part of the problem.
The accounting tricks and standards now in use, and new standards for a carbon market to price offsets for protecting or planting trees, among other initiatives, are on the agenda at the United Nations conference in Glasgow. As parties to the Paris agreement reckon with how to achieve the goals they have set for themselves, transparency and accountability are high on the agenda.
Many countries list forestry as essential to reaching net-zero. China and India have vast tree-planting programmes. Russia wants to take advantage of the fact it is home to 20% of the world’s forests, to offset its greenhouse-gas emissions. Bhutan, one of the few countries to plausibly claim to have reached net-zero, can do so only by taking credit for a heavy dose of forestry. Myanmar is in a similar situation.

At the heart of the issue is that the natural carbon cycle in which trees and other plants play an ancient role is being thrown out of whack by human activity. The cycle is normally slow and self-regulating. Trees soak up CO2 from the atmosphere, then return some of it when they decompose or burn in natural wildfires. Over time, that CO2 cycles back into new plants. In the absence of human intervention, sources and sinks of carbon achieve balance.
Humans are distorting things in two ways. Deforestation and forest degradation increase greenhouse-gas emissions because they accelerate the release of stored carbon, defying any equilibrium. And the 1.1-1.3°C of global warming that has come with the 2.5trn tonnes of CO2 already added to the atmosphere further increases emissions of carbon: more warming leads to more decay and wildfires.
At the same time, putting carbon dioxide from fossil fuels into the atmosphere gives plants more to work with, increasing the effectiveness of some sinks. But this is not an unqualified benefit: trees migrating north into the Arctic circle thanks to this “carbon-dioxide fertilisation” are darkening land that would previously have been snow-covered and white. Darker lands absorb more energy from the sun, amplifying the warming of the polar region.

All of these ways humans affect forests, and with them the atmosphere, are devilishly complicated to disentangle from one another—and from what would have happened in their absence. Some standards and methods are in place. Independent scientists and the bean-counters of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have devised shorthand to help countries measure their exhalation and inhalation of carbon. In annual greenhouse-gas inventories that countries submit to the UN, changes in emissions in land labelled as “managed” are deemed to be anthropogenic. What falls under the label of “managed” varies by country; it can include everything from pastures on deforested land to protected forests that, while not actively managed, would be defended by firefighters if spark came to flame. The changes in emissions from managed land therefore include natural, background carbon cycling not directly affected by human activity.
In addition to enabling some fuzziness around what counts as human emissions and sinks, this accounting system allows countries to offset their industrial emissions against existing forests. For example, Myanmar’s latest greenhouse-gas inventory shows that it emits 8m tonnes of greenhouse gases each year from industry and burning fossil fuels, while its managed forests soak up 96m tonnes. Although the country is still burning fossil fuels, it can claim carbon neutrality under the agreed accounting rules.
Myanmar’s industrial emissions are a tiny fraction of the global annual total of 52bn tonnes, so any fudging would not matter much. The same cannot be said of Russia, the world’s fourth-largest emitter. For years Russia has viewed its vast forests as central to its efforts against climate change. Russia’s commitment to the Paris goals states that by 2030 it will reduce its emissions by 70% relative to 1990 levels, “taking into account the maximum possible absorptive capacity of forests and other ecosystems”. In 2019 Russia could claim its forests absorbed the equivalent of 25% of its industrial emissions.
That effect is declining, as ageing trees soak up smaller and smaller amounts of CO2. According to Russia’s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the sink will drop to zero—absorbing as much carbon as it emits—within four decades. It was a boon, then, when last year Russia’s first inventory of its forests since the mid-1990s found that the volume of its forests had increased by 25%. Earlier this year, an independent study published in Nature calculated that this carbon sink is 47% greater than previously understood. Much of the increase is due to natural growth, as forests reclaim abandoned agricultural land, or as trees creep north. Such revisions are worth hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon emissions, and should show up in Russia’s future inventories.
To add to this windfall, the Russian government recently announced it would include unmanaged “reserve” forests alongside managed forests in its greenhouse-gas inventory. That could immediately improve Russia’s annual reports, if not the climate, by helping to add hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 to its forest sink.
Shared, enforceable standards for measuring the contribution of trees to national emissions would make it easier to compare progress, country by country, toward climate goals. But ecologists have warned that a disconnect between national greenhouse-gas inventories and the estimates made by independent scientists make this impossible. Because official greenhouse-gas inventories count emissions from “managed” ecosystems, and global climate models use another method, the two systems yield different results. According to climate models, Earth’s land masses emit 5.5bn tonnes more CO2 each year than the inventories account for. Neither count is better, say the researchers, but because the climate models are used to map out pathways to a stable climate, and the inventories track progress along those pathways, they are comparing apples and oranges.
Improved standards would also create a sounder basis for the growing market in carbon offsets, a key to marshalling the private sector against climate change. For example, activists in Brazil see global trading in carbon credits, envisioned in article 6 of the Paris agreement, as a silver bullet for reducing deforestation, the cause of roughly half of Brazil’s emissions. Their thinking is that a global carbon market will turn forests into a tradable commodity, making land in the Amazon more valuable with trees than without.
But to be effective in stabilising the climate, projects that receive carbon credits for stopping deforestation, or promoting reforestation, must be able to demonstrate they are decreasing emissions that would otherwise have taken place—in carbon offset jargon, this is known as additionality. It is possible, for instance, to buy carbon offsets for protecting trees in the Amazonian state of Pará. But the vast majority of land there is already federally protected, and so should not be seen as a basis for carbon credits.
When it comes to forests, the carbon-offset market is also unable now to factor in what is known as permanence. Replacing a diesel bus with an electric one probably removes emissions forever—with any luck there will be no diesel buses left to buy when the electric one reaches the end of its life—but a patch of forest can be cleared or burnt in the next decade, or even the next week. How can the market ensure that offsets purchased today have enduring effects? And in Brazil and elsewhere, programmes to reforest or plant new forests also come with a leakage problem: protecting one patch of land might simply encourage deforestation elsewhere.
All these problems apply to the existing, voluntary carbon markets. An economy ticket on a flight from London to New York generates approximately 600kg of CO2; offsets for that carbon can be purchased for as little as a few dollars through commercial tree-planting schemes. That may ease a traveller’s conscience, but whether it will protect the climate is far from certain. Over the coming fortnight, delegates at COP26 will try to reach agreement on guidelines to assure permanence and account for additionality, in hopes of creating a model that can be emulated in the voluntary markets.
That is all to the good. There is indeed no poem lovely as a tree, and carbon offsets, and the forests they may cause to be planted or protected, can help slow and even stop climate change. But for that to happen the world’s leaders will need to demand far less popular measures as well, like ending the use of fossil fuels and transforming farming. Climate models show that ecosystem sinks will be most effective at absorbing CO2 if warming remains in the range of the Paris goals. If temperatures soar, as looks likely, carbon-rich tropical ecosystems will dry out, burn and become carbon sources rather than sinks. Trees cannot solve the climate crisis. Only people can.

1843,"WHEN DRIVING, Clara-Marina Martinez makes a note of any unusual behaviour she sees on the road. She then feeds these into machine-learning algorithms, a form of AI, which she is helping develop for Porsche Engineering, a division of the eponymous German sports-car company.
Those algorithms are intended to produce a system reliable enough for a car to drive itself. Such a fully autonomous car, known in the industry as Level 5, should be able to complete an entire journey without any intervention from the driver, and cope with all situations on the road. But this is proving hard to achieve, and many attempts to do so are being scaled back. Last year, for instance, Uber, a ride-hailing service, sold off its unit developing self-driving cars.

Autonomous vehicles are touted as being not just convenient but potentially safer. However, just as people take time to learn how to drive safely, so do machines. And machines are not as quick on the uptake. The RAND Corporation, an American think-tank, calculates that to develop a system 20% safer than a human driver, a fleet of 100 self-driving cars would have to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and cover 14bn kilometres. At average road speeds, that would take about 400 years.
Carmakers such as Porsche therefore accelerate the development process using simulators. These teach software about hazards only rarely encountered in reality. Dr Martinez and her colleagues employ “game engines”, the programs that generate photorealistic images in computer games, to do this. These are used to create virtual worlds through which the software can drive.
Objects in these virtual worlds are assigned their physical characteristics (ie, buildings are hard, people are soft) so that the sensors in vehicles, such as cameras, radar, lidar (a form of radar that uses light) and ultrasound transceivers respond in the appropriate way. Once the software has been trained, it is tested in real autonomous vehicles by re-creating those situations on a test track.
How quickly, if ever, all this will translate into reality remains to be seen. Both regulators and customers will need to overcome scepticism that a software driver really can be safer than a wetware one. From Porsche’s point of view, though, there is one other pertinent question. Given that much of the reason for owning a sports car is for owners to show off what they perceive to be their driving skills, just how big a market will there be for a version where software takes those bragging rights away?

1844,"CAPE TOWN, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Efforts to develop an African base for COVID-19 vaccine production will focus on trying to replicate Moderna's (MRNA.O) shot, but a lack of progress in talks with the U.S. company mean the project will take time, a senior WHO official told Reuters.
The drive to produce vaccines in Africa is designed to help more developing countries access COVID-19 shots after rich nations bought up most of this year's supply.
Moderna said last October it would not enforce patents related to its shot during the pandemic, raising hopes that other companies might be able to copy it and help boost COVID-19 vaccine production.
In practice, though, it is hard to replicate a vaccine without the information on how it is made, and the World Health Organization-backed tech transfer hub in South Africa - set up in June to give poorer nations the know-how to produce COVID-19 vaccines - has so far not reached a deal with the company.
""The talks have not yielded any results,"" Martin Friede, WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research coodinator, told Reuters.
Moderna did not respond to a request for comment.
The case highlights the challenges faced by the WHO as it battles to expand vaccine production to help address the glaring inequalities between rich and poor nations in the pandemic.
More than three quarters of the 5.5 billion COVID-19 shots administered worldwide have gone to high and upper-middle income countries, which make up just over a third of the world's population.  read more 
Currently only 3% of Africa is vaccinated, the African Union's top health official said last week, compared with more than half of the United States and three quarters of Spain.
Friede said Moderna's vaccine had been chosen as an abundance of public information and its pledge not to enforce patents made the shot slightly easier to copy than some rivals.
""We have to make a choice now. The deadline is upon us; time to start ordering chemicals. We've chosen Moderna,"" he said.
But even if the hub manages without Moderna's help, it could take more than a year to get a distributable vaccine as clinical trials would only begin in the latter half of 2022, he added.
TUSSLE OVER WAIVERS
In May, the United States said it would support waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines in order to help speed an end to the pandemic.
But the idea has faced opposition from pharmaceutical firms,  which argue they need to oversee any technology transfer due to the complexity of the manufacturing process.
Pfizer (PFE.N) and its partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE) separately struck a deal in July for South Africa's Biovac to help make around 100 million doses a year of their COVID-19 vaccine for Africa. Their shot, like Moderna's, uses so-called mRNA technology.
However, the deal is to ""fill and finish"" the vaccine, the final stages of production where the product is put into vials, sealed and packaged for shipping. It does not cover the complicated process of mRNA production, which Pfizer and BioNTech will do at their European plants.  read more 
Neither responded to requests for comment.
The WHO has been trying to persuade Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech to join forces with its African tech transfer hub.
But COVID-19 vaccine makers have warned that non-authorised producers would compete for vital raw materials and production gear that the established players - most of which have earned huge profits from vaccination - rely on.  read more 
Hub consortium partner Afrigen Biologics will produce the initial batch of doses, before transferring the skills and technology to local manufacturing partner, Biovac Institute - both are Cape Town-based - which will mass produce the vaccines.
""This is not something that we are asking industry to give us for free,"" Friede said about talks with the companies for access to information, adding that royalties, territorial limitations and other constraints could be built into a deal.
Healthcare analysts doubt the plan can be mobilised quickly.
""There are many steps which will require lots of iterations before they can be ready for prime time commercial grade production,"" said Prashant Yadav, a global healthcare supply chain expert at the Center for Global Development in Washington.",3
1845,"AT 7.30AM ONE February morning last year, the great Bay of Paracas shimmered in the light from the desert. Storms of seabirds—small Inca terns and petrels, large cormorants and Peruvian boobies—swirled over the shore, retreating like a mirage on approach. Flamingos flew javelin-straight. Pelicans bobbed on the water, so ungainly that they seem designed by a committee until they took flight, elegantly skimming the waves.
All take advantage of a food chain centred on great shoals of anchoveta (Pacific anchovies), which in turn feed on the nutrient-rich plankton provided by the upwelling of the cold Humboldt current along much of Peru’s coastline of 2,500km (1,600 miles). These riches have given the country one of the world’s great fisheries, the third-biggest after China and Indonesia. Exports of fishmeal, oil and frozen and canned fish are worth around $3bn a year. All told, the fishing industry supports around 700,000 jobs. And fresh fish and seafood are at the heart of Peruvian cuisine, one of the world’s tastiest.

Peru has many problems at the moment. The pandemic has hit it hard. It is suffering political instability that a presidential run-off election next month is unlikely to resolve. But sustainably managing the country’s marine resources is a vital medium-term task. It is also a matter of current dispute.
Last month the government of Francisco Sagasti, the president since November, published a draft decree to establish a marine reserve, known as the Nazca Ridge. It would cover an area of the Pacific about the size of Latvia 100km offshore that contains a submerged mountain range up to 4kms down. This undersea massif is a refuge for endangered species, such as the loggerhead turtle, sharks, orcas and the blue whale, as well as yellowfin tuna and swordfish.
Environmentalists have pushed for this for years. Peru has been a pioneer in managing the anchoveta fishery. In 2009 it introduced a transferable quota system. The marine research institute fixes the total catch and monitors boats closely. The stock has remained roughly constant. But the country has been a laggard in creating marine protected areas. Under the international Convention on Biological Diversity, it signed up to a target of protecting 10% of its seas by 2020. But so far it has only designated four small coastal reserves (Paracas, the first, dates from 1975). That contrasts with a regional average in Latin America of almost a quarter.
The Nazca Ridge covers 7.3% of Peruvian waters. Both environmentalists and the fishing industry back it in principle. But a big row has broken out over the details. Article 5 of the draft decree separates the reserve vertically into two zones. It would allow commercial fishing for the first kilometre below the surface and ban it below that, with one exception: a single family with six boats would be allowed to continue deep-sea long-lining for Patagonian toothfish, as that family has done for a dozen years. The fishing industry has pushed for Article 5. “It’s important that the specifics are set out and not left open to interpretation,” says Cayetana Aljovín of the National Fisheries Society.
For some environmentalists Article 5 pre-empts a scientific discussion about the management of the reserve. For others it undermines the whole point of it. “It’s a power battle for the fishing industry,” says Patricia Majluf of the Peruvian branch of Oceana, an NGO. “They think Peruvian waters are theirs and they manage everything perfectly.” International experience shows that banning all fishing in an area leads stocks to regenerate and quickly increases catches nearby. And enforcement is easier if all boats are prohibited.
The problem is that Peruvian law recognises prior rights, even in protected areas. Officials are worried that a total ban would be legally unenforceable. “You have to allow a very small amount of activity to protect a very large area,” says a senior official. He says the government will try to prevent the toothfishing family from transferring their permit to any other fishermen.
Mr Sagasti’s government has done a creditable job of trying to mitigate the pandemic and organise vaccinations. But it is only a caretaker. An imperfect reserve may be the most it can manage before it leaves office on July 28th. Yet the issues at stake will surely recur. According to some scientists, climate change is likely to lead to fewer anchoveta. Peru should find a way to organise watertight reserves. Private property rights cannot be as absolute over the fish in the sea as they are on land.",2
1846,"IN AN INTERNAL memo to staff in 2016 JPMorgan Chase relaxed its dress code. The American bank’s 240,000 employees could hang up their suits and don business-casual attire—once reserved for casual Fridays—all working week. Some garments remained beyond the pale (T-shirts, flip-flops, tank tops, yoga pants). But many—polo shirts, skirts (of appropriate length), dress sandals—became fair game.
JPMorgan was, sartorially speaking, ahead of its time among stuffy corporate giants (turtlenecks and hoodies have long been the fashion choice of Silicon Valley titans). Others followed suit, as it were. Men’s corporate uniform—and the female power suit designed to mirror it—increasingly came to be seen as a vestige of the male-dominated offices of yore and no longer fit for purpose in a world of greater (though still imperfect) workplace equality. As more and more people ran or cycled to work, they found that changing into a full suit was impractical, since jackets folded into rucksacks tend to lose their crispness.

These days ties are no longer de rigueur in client meetings even for pinstriped investment bankers at Goldman Sachs. Purveyors of formal wear have fallen on hard times. Last year Brooks Brothers, which had been sewing button-down shirts since 1818, filed for bankruptcy. Last month Marks  Spencer, a British retailer, announced it would no longer sell men’s suits in more than half of its bigger stores.
As the pandemic completely decoupled work and presence in the office, employees at many companies switched into something even less starchy. Unlike JPMorgan, however, most have not put any guidelines in place as to what is and isn’t appropriate. Although the Delta variant is forcing companies to delay a return to the office, that day will come. When workers are back at their desks, at least some of the time, new sartorial rules may be required.
Much has been written about what people wore on Zoom calls during lockdowns (and what they did not wear: some retailers report that tops significantly outsold trousers in the past year and a half). Fashion designers like Giles Deacon in Britain have launched “work from anywhere” fashion collections, aiming for slightly looser-cut clothing that nevertheless looks smart. Two Japanese companies, Aoki and Whatever Inc, created pyjama suits—a hybrid of a suit and soft, comfy loungewear—perfect for the video conference attended from home. Aoki uses the same fabric as pyjamas but with a suit-like cut. Whatever Inc’s WFH Jammies are “business on the top, loungewear on the bottom”.
That is not to say that business-casual Fridays have given way to athleisure work weeks. Indeed, some workplaces are already experiencing a backlash against informality. In 2017 Britain’s House of Commons decided that male MPs were no longer required to wear ties when attending debates; previously they could go tieless only on hot summer days. But at the beginning of September this year Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, announced that he expected all parliamentarians to smarten up. Jeans, chinos and sleeveless tops are out.
Looked at in the aggregate, individuals’ clothes speak to more than just personal preferences. People’s sartorial choices add up to a zeitgeist. It is no accident that the cheerful glitz of the 1920s came right after the despondency of the first world war and the Spanish flu. Today’s tailoring brands hope that when the pandemic recedes at last male and female professionals will feel a renewed desire to dress up.
So does Bartleby. Like Sir Lindsay, she would recommend that employees maintain a degree of formal presentation. Yes, some people can pull off a dishevelled look—but not everyone. Dressing with taste and elegance does not have to involve designer clothes or expensive watches. It signals commitment and seriousness. A freshly laundered, crisp shirt announces to the world that you have made an effort; a tracksuit does not.
And if going to the office is a ritual, styling an outfit can be a pleasure, not a chore. The way one dresses is part of his or her self-expression. It also separates the public and the private. Peeling off formal office clothes and slipping into something cosy marks a daily transition from work to non-work. That line was blurred during lockdowns and could do with some sharpening. A man in a suit and tie is a man loosening his tie at the end of the day.

1847,"A tech billionaire allegedly kept a spreadsheet of 5,000 women he has had sex with, one of them a teenager he paid off to keep quiet, despite losing his high-profile job over a sexual misconduct allegation in 2016.
Michael Goguen, 57, a former partner at Sequoia Capital who now heads his own firm, has been sued by four former employees who say they helped manage his 'harem' of women.
The explosive lawsuit claims the investor met with the women at various safe houses or at a 'boom boom' room in the basement of his bar in Whitefish, a small town in Montana where he now lives.
The married billionaire, who has two children, once asked his employee to arrange a hit on a former friend who knew too much about his personal life, according to the lawsuit. 
A retired Whitefish police chief now says that Goguen - whom he compared to serial predators Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein - 'has to be stopped.'
These are the latest allegations of sexual impropriety leveled against Goguen, who in 2016 was accused of 'countless hours of forced sodomy' by his former girlfriend, exotic dancer Amber Baptiste.
The latest 135-page lawsuit was filed in February by former employees of Goguen’s Amyntor Group LLC, a security contractor, according to the New York Post.
It lays out a complex operation headed by Goguen to protect his simultaneous affairs. The breakdown of the operation, and the employees who helped it run, can be traced through multiple guilty pleas by former employees and associates who threatened to speak out about the alleged scheme.
Among the plaintiffs is Matthew Marshall, the former head of Amyntor who quickly grew to become Goguen's 'right-hand man.' 
Marshall pled guilty to wire fraud and other charges earlier this month after he pretended to be an elite member of the Marine Corps and asked Goguen for money for 'off the books' missions, according to the Flathead Beacon.
But Marshall says Goguen, who is currently married to his fourth wife, allegedly kept a 'harem' of 'numerous women, including married women, strippers, and prostitutes,' who he bought homes for and used for 'illicit sexual activity.' 
Goguen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. 
The tech investor is worth more than $5 billion, according to the New York Post. 
He flew some of the women in his private $42 million jet. 
'Marshall was being asked to purchase, out of his personal accounts, vehicles, jewelry, earnest money deposits on properties, and to provide cash or other items for Goguen’s mistresses, or as hush-money payoffs to Goguen’s acquaintances and employees who had ""learned too much"" about Goguen’s sexual misconduct and crimes, and the Goguen Sexual Scheme,' the lawsuit states.
'Goguen informed Marshall it was best to have him pay the property expenses, especially any expenses that were solely for Goguen’s safe houses, out of his personal account to avoid his then wife Jordana from discovering that Goguen owned a number of properties that he used extensively for extramarital affairs because Jordana had visibility over Goguen’s accounts at that time.'
The lawsuit, which is asking for $800 million in damages, claims various violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) act. 
It accuses Goguen of offering 'gifts' to the women - including alcohol, travel, jewelry, cash and health care expenses - 'to perform other deviant sexual acts with him, and/or to maintain their silence as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.' 
He gave one woman a credit card and bought her a five-bedroom home after her husband, a prominent businessman, found out about their affair and began divorce proceedings, according to the Post. 
Goguen also allegedly gave Eric Payne, who did construction for Goguen, an office in the basement of Casey's Bar, an establishment that he owns in Whitefish.
The office 'was passcode protected, had a built-in full size stripper pole, and commonly referred to as the ""boom boom"" room where he and Payne could procure young women to engage in sexual acts with them for money, drugs or other items of value as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.'
Goguen was vindictive against those who tried to put a stop to his nefarious activities, according to the lawsuit viewed by DailyMail.com.
His friend Bryan Nash called him a 'pedophile' after Goguen brought his two daughters to Nash's house but later absconded with their high-school-aged babysitter to have sex with her in a cottage on the property. 
The age of the babysitter is not clear. 
'Goguen threatened to kill Nash if he “said anything to anybody” about his “character flaw,” later telling Nash that he “owns Montana” and “supplies law enforcement,'"" the lawsuit states.
Goguen then began having sex with Nash's wife and paying for her divorce proceedings, allegedly costing Nash more money in a drawn out legal battle.
He used Marshall to investigate and harass Nash, who went to authorities 'to no avail,' the lawsuit states. 
In September 2014, Goguen texted Marshall using the encrypted texting service Wickr, writing: 'Nashf*** has pushed me too far and his occasional reminders he might help blow the lid off my personal life requires an extreme response. The cyber route isn't having the impact on him that I was hoping to achieve,' according to the lawsuit.
'Buddy, he’s f*****with my life, career, etc. and the potential for me being destroyed if he gets traction with the authorities or press is significant. This requires an extreme response. He will f***** destroy the ""bigger picture"" for us if he's not stopped. 
'He needs to be killed. I know that's a VERY big ask but we are in defcon 5. We can discuss details in person but we do NOT have conversations about this on our cell phones. Wickr only…'
Marshall did not try to have Nash killed, the lawsuit states.
In May 2020, Nash pled guilty to one count of blackmail after prosecutors say he threatened to release negative information about Goguen if he didn't pay him $250,000 to cover his divorce proceedings, according to the Flathead Beacon. 
Goguen is from Bedford, Massachusetts, according to the Post. 
He went to Cornell and Stanford universities, where he studied electrical engineering, and joined Sequoia Capital - an early investor in Google, YouTube and PayPal - in 1996, according to his LinkedIn.
He was let go from his job at Sequoia after Amber Baptiste accused him of physical and sexual assault over a 13-year period after he picked her up at a Texas strip club, according to the Post.
She said he sodomized her for 'six hours at a time' and forced her to call him 'king' and 'emperor' in a lawsuit asking for $40 million.
Goguen then told Marshall to act as his 'general 100x more aggressive than Patton was, to coordinate and make sure everything is happening that should be happening — PR firms, private investigators criminal side, local PR, everything,' according to February's lawsuit, emphasizing the lengths he was willing to go to, and the money he was wiling to spend, to punish those who hurt him. 
Back in 2016, Sequoia called Baptiste's allegations 'unproven and unrelated to Sequoia' but said that Goguen's departure 'was the appropriate course of action.'
In 2019, a judge dismissed Baptiste's lawsuit for failing to provide relevant documents or to submit to a medical examination, according to TechCrunch. 
A different judge then found that Baptiste committed fraud and extortion and granted Goguen a restraining order preventing her from repeating her claims, according to the Flathead Beacon.
The latest lawsuit does not name any of the allegedly 100 women in Goguen's 'harem.'
It does note, however, that he's bought some of them homes, including a multi-million dollar home in Santa Monica, California for a woman whom he allegedly got pregnant multiple times but paid to have abortions. 
Retired Whitefish Police chief Bill Dial, who is also suing Goguen, told the Post: 'This man has to be stopped. He’s a billionaire a la Harvey Weinstein and Epstein. There's a lot of people in this community who know what he’s about and they’re afraid of him.'
Goguen's employees say that a detective by the name of Shane Erickson was 'forced to resign' after failing to investigate sexual assault allegations against Goguen while 'improperly accepting gifts and other compensation' from him.
'Mr. Erickson was forced to resign from his position as a Police Detective with the Whitefish Police Department for failing to investigate the alleged conduct by Goguen and improperly accepting gifts and other compensation from Defendant Goguen while employed with the Whitefish Police Department,' the lawsuit states.
The teenager, identified only as Pam Doe, was given alcohol and cocaine by Goguen, Payne and a third individual, the lawsuit states.
In an email she wrote to her lawyer, she said she had been asked to pop out of a cake at a party when she was 17, wherein after she was 'roofied' and asked to be an 'escort,' to multiple men.
During the course of his investigation, Erickson told Marshall that Goguen admitted he paid her $1,200 to have sex with him. 
'During the course of April, May and June 2018, Det. Erickson openly shared with Marshall the fact that he was spending time with Goguen, including having dinner at his house, spending time on Whitefish lake, going on a coyote hunt and doing other leisure activities with their families,' the lawsuit says, adding that Goguen took Erickson via private jet on his 'yearly week-long ~$20,000 elk hunt in Colorado with private guides.'
Pam Doe eventually recanted her allegations. She was allegedly 'forced to sign a non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreement' and paid off. 
Whitefish police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. ",-2
1848,"CCTV captured the shocking moment a boxing promotor dodged death by inches after a speeding driver crashed into his car at 80mph a split second after he got out of the way.
Footage on CCTV shows boxing promotor Andy Booker jumping into his parked car as a manic driver slams into his car.  
The crash happened on 6.45 pm on Wednesday night in Askern, Doncaster in South Yorkshire.
In the video, the speeding driver hits an oncoming white van before hitting Mr Booker's parked car and the boxing promoter darts into his car just in time. 
Mr Booker's car lights flash while the other driver hits a wall further down Moss Road.
Both cars are then filmed wrecked at the scene after the crash.
Mr Booker, who says he is friends with former World Heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, said: 'Well that was close I just managed to get in my car as he hit me at about 80 miles an hour or he would have gone straight over me.
'Cop said a split second and it would have been a different ending.
'It was so close I only just managed to get in my car.' 
A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said they received a call to report that a car believed to have been used in an earlier assault was in collision with another car before veering into a wall further down Moss Road.
They said: 'The occupants all fled on foot before officers arrived.
'They are described to have been wearing dark clothing and approximately five foot 11 in height.
'Two of the occupants were seen fleeing down Marlborough Road.
'Enquiries at both scenes continue at this time.'
Police are asking anyone in the area at the time who saw or hear anything suspicious or who has dash cam or CCTV footage which may have caught the incident which could assist with enquiries to call 101, quoting 774 of November 17.",-2
1849,"IN THE HENGDUAN mountains of Sichuan province, swollen brown rivers and trees heavy with ripe mangoes do not evoke digital wizardry. Yet until recently, there were buildings here with rack upon rack of specialised computers. They were often near hydropower plants that supplied them with electricity from dams. They needed lots of power. Their machines were used for “mining”, a process that involves validating transactions conducted in bitcoin and other digital currencies by solving cryptographic puzzles. In return, they received newly minted coins. The buildings were recognisable by their huge cooling systems: usually a wall on one side covered in giant fans to draw in air.
But across Sichuan, the fans have stopped whirring. In May, a government committee tasked with promoting financial stability vowed to put a stop to bitcoin mining. Within weeks the authorities in four main mining regions—Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Yunnan—ordered the closure of local projects. Residents of Inner Mongolia were urged to call a hotline to report anyone flouting the ban. In parts of Sichuan, miners were ordered to clear out computers and demolish buildings housing them overnight. Power suppliers pulled the plug on most of them.

The clampdown has had a global impact. Bitcoin’s “hash rate”, a measure of the computational power being used by the world’s mining machines, has fallen by half in recent weeks. Its “difficulty rate”, which rises and falls as computers join or leave the mining effort, last week fell to an all-time low. China had accounted for about 65% of bitcoins earned through mining, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. But analysts think about 90% of its mining has now ceased. Chinese miners are selling their computers at half their value.
China’s mining boom began in 2017, after a surge in the price of bitcoin caught the attention of local entrepreneurs. The country was already making most of the machines that mine bitcoin globally, as well as the tailor-made chips on which they run. It also had the capacity to produce more power than it needed. In 2018 this excess amounted to 70 terawatt-hours (TWh), equivalent to Switzerland’s total energy production. Rather than let the surplus go to waste, plants sold it to mining farms. The seasons would determine where those farms operated. After the end of Sichuan’s drenching summer rains, when prices there would rise, miners would drive their machines to somewhere near a cheaper source, usually coal-fired power plants thousands of kilometres away in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. (Energy from solar and wind power is not reliable enough to power non-stop mining.)
In 2017 China, fearing a loss of financial control, banned cryptocurrency trading. But local governments still welcomed the miners: they were a source of taxes and other levies. In June a state-run zone in Ya’an, a city in Sichuan, had been set to open in time for the start of the rainy season. It was offering cheap power for mining and other digital activities. “It was a win-win,” says Kirk Su, a miner who had been planning to put some of his machines in the zone. “China was leading in mining in all respects: cheap power, cheap labour, fast and easy access to kit,” he says.

Then came the clampdown. It was targeted in part at the cryptocurrency traders. The mining industry itself has little to do with the volatile business of trading. But miners could not function without converting their new bitcoins into yuan. For this they used exchanges that had moved offshore after the trading ban, but still targeted Chinese users. The government may have decided that to rid China of crypto transactions, “mining had to go”, says Bobby Lee, who co-founded China’s first cryptocurrency exchange (it was forced to shut in 2017). He now runs Ballet, an app that lets users manage their digital currency.
Another aim may have been to reduce emissions. The Cambridge numbers suggest that Chinese miners used around 83TWh of electricity a year, similar to Belgium’s total power consumption. (Still, China could have chosen to ban mining only in its coal-belching north, says Mr Lee.) Officials may also have worried about collusion between local governments and mining operations, some of which had been getting subsidies earmarked for innovative big-data firms.
The central government said it wanted to “resolutely prevent the transmission of individual-level risks to broader society”. That may, in part, have been a reference to the activities of some mines that had been setting up Ponzi-like schemes, promising big returns to investors. Other scammers have been masquerading as cryptocurrency traders. Last year over 100 people were arrested for running two such operations, PlusToken and WoToken.
To evade the clampdown, big miners have sent their machines overseas. Mr Su, who also runs a logistics business that transports mining machines, has been chartering Boeing 747s to get used ones out swiftly. Most are going to Russia and Kazakhstan, which together account for about 13% of the world’s bitcoin mining. But there are few data centres abroad with space for lots of new machines, including in America, the second-biggest miner. Building a farm there costs between five and ten times what it does in China, says Mr Su. That is too much for most Chinese miners. More than half of their computers will stay put for now, he says.
Some smaller miners are still finding ways to operate. One says he is lucky to have teamed up with a privately owned hydropower station that is loth to forgo the extra revenue (it risks being fined by the grid or booted off it). While meeting your correspondent, he struck a deal to buy a farm from a fellow miner for 5m yuan ($770,000), powered by a plant that is off the grid. If his machines can function there for 15 days, he will have earned his investment back in bitcoin.
In an abandoned school in southern Sichuan, Mr Su has stored 10,000 machines from some of his shuttered farms. For every day they spend there, unplugged and stacked to the ceiling, he says that 1m yuan in potential profit is lost. ■",2
1850,"FRENCH OFFICIALDOM is abuzz with preparations for the PFUE, which the MEAE and SGAE are organising for the PR in 2022. Lost? Spare a thought for the outsider who must daily navigate the French passion for acronyms and initialisms. All countries use them, but France has a particular penchant. The latest (PFUE) refers to the French Presidency of the European Union, which starts in January 2022 (and is in fact the presidency of the Council of the European Union). No matter. The abbreviation is already everywhere, and, as the opening sentence says, officials from the foreign ministry and a secretariat in the prime minister’s office are preparing this occasion for the president.
The preference of the French for abbreviations is so ingrained that they scarcely notice it. Britain may have its NHS, or America NASA. France has them for every part of life: transport (TGV, RER, SNCF), politics (PS, EELV, LREM, LFI, RN (formerly the FN) and LR), unions (CGT, CFDT), work (SMIC, CDD, CDI, CSE, RTT), the police (BRI, RAID), taxes (CSG, URSSAF, IFI). The principle seems simple: why use a word like budget when an abbreviation like PLF (projet de loi de finances) will do?

What is behind this zeal? Some date it to the organisation of the modern state in the late 19th century, when bodies such as unions (CGT) or the political movements that later joined together as the SFIO, the precursor to the Socialist Party (PS), emerged, and with them the complex names that deserved shortening. Perhaps it is also the result of the state’s tendency to bureaucratic complication; an acronym can simplify rather than confuse. So the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (the national railway) becomes the less indigestible SNCF.
The fact that practitioners of such an elegant language infect it with such abominations has not gone unnoticed. The Académie Française, which polices such matters, recommends that when it comes to acronyms “moderation is a good thing and abuse dangerous.” Curiously, one of the few spheres in which the French leave prolix descriptions alone is food. No CDC for confit de canard, nor BDV for blanquette de veau. Organisational or bureaucratic life, it seems, is to be tolerated and shortened. Gastronomy can take its time.
Correction (November 1st 2021): The PFUE refers to the presidency of the Council of the European Union, rather than the presidency of the European Council as we originally stated.",2
1851,"FOR WEEKS, Democrats in Congress have been trying to pull off a delicate legislative two-step with President Joe Biden’s agenda. House progressives refuse to vote for an infrastructure bill, which passed the Senate with bipartisan support, until the Senate passes a social-spending bill. That measure has to be slender enough—negotiations have whittled it down to around half of its initial $3.5trn size—to satisfy moderate Democrats, but not so meagre that it loses progressives’ support. And Mr Biden would love it done before he arrives at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow on November 1st. His legacy hangs in the balance, and the tactics surrounding this legislative pas de deux are intensifying an argument over the party’s direction.
Democrats won unified control of the federal government in 2020, defeating an incumbent president for the first time since Bill Clinton beat George H.W. Bush in 1992. Joe Biden ran on an agenda that was farther left than either Hillary Clinton’s or Barack Obama’s. Now the debate over that agenda is highlighting a rift in party strategy. Conservative Democrats such as Joe Manchin, a senator from West Virginia, contend the party must not throw fiscal caution to the winds. But progressives such as Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, argue that the party must be bold, proving it can honour its promises.

Even if the rival factions compromise and pass Mr Biden’s legislation, Democrats will still probably lose their congressional majority next year. Mid-term elections since 1934 have typically produced a backlash against parties occupying the White House; they have lost an average of 28 seats in the House and four in the Senate in those contests. The Democrats’ current advantage will vanish if they lose four seats in the House and one in the Senate.

Longer-term trends also paint a dire picture for the Democrats, especially in the Senate. For half a century they have been losing support among rural voters and gaining in the cities. This has packed their voters into metropolises in coastal strongholds, such as California and New York, as well as smaller cities in states where Republicans outnumber them, such as Florida, North Carolina and Texas. Less-populated conservative states like Idaho and Wyoming remain reliably Republican. Because each state has the same number of senators, the chamber gives Republican voters a disproportionate number of seats.
According to calculations by Daily Kos, a liberal website, Republicans have not won the cumulative popular vote for the Senate since the three election cycles leading up to 1998 (the chamber is divided into thirds, with one-third elected every two years). Yet they have won the majority of its seats in seven of those 12 cycles.
How can Democrats combat these trends? One group of strategists sees the answer in population growth among some of America’s most left-leaning voters—young people and Hispanics. But that theory fell apart in the last election, when non-college-educated Hispanics swung hard towards Mr Trump and turnout among young voters, though up, remained below the overall average.
Many Democrats have instead come round to the views of David Shor, a data analyst who worked for Mr Obama. Mr Shor’s proposed strategy is to decrease “education polarisation”—the gap between the votes Democrats get from college-educated Americans and those they get from people with no college education—to the level of 2012. That was the most recent year in which whites without college degrees gave Democrats 40% of their votes or more, according to Catalist, a political-data firm. Last year just 37% voted for Mr Biden. Since only 36% of Americans over the age of 25 have a college degree, relying on them to fill the gap is not viable. Whites without degrees make up the largest share of the population in rural states.
Mr Shor’s solution is “popularism”: the idea that Democrats need to emphasise their most popular policies, such as economic redistribution and lower health-care costs, and avoid topics such as immigration and defunding the police that alienate working-class white voters. Though “don’t do unpopular stuff” sounds a glaringly obvious strategy, the debate over the theory has taken hold of the party.
How Democrats should carry out Mr Shor’s plan is unclear. Education polarisation is not a new trend. A study of survey data stretching back to 1948 by Amory Gethin, Clara Martínez-Toledano and Thomas Piketty, all economists, illustrated parallel trends in many Western democracies. The authors write that it will be hard to reverse unless Democrats become the champions of conservative positions on “sociocultural” issues, such as law and order, the environment and immigration.
Persuading someone to change their vote grows harder as political identities deepen.In 2020 the link between a voter’s partisan identity and self-described ideology was the strongest on record. According to an analysis of survey data by Charles Franklin, a political scientist and pollster in Wisconsin, a person’s stated ideology explained roughly 57% of their partisanship in 2020, up from 49% in 2016 and 20% three decades ago. This rise in social sorting helps to explain the decrease from 10% to under 5% in the share of Americans who regularly switch parties, according to The Economist’s analysis of survey data from the American National Election Studies, a poll conducted in election years since 1952.
Much of Mr Trump’s success in 2016 stemmed from his understanding that policy preferences are fickle: identity-loyalty and group conflict are more powerful levers to earn a person’s vote. Democrats cling to the theory that their popular policy agenda will eventually secure them a permanent majority. But before support for a wealth tax, say, can win over non-college whites, they will first need to feel that Democratic candidates understand them and share their cultural outlook.
There Democrats face a further hurdle: their increasingly nationalised brand. According to Jonathan Rodden, a political scientist, one reason left-leaning parties worldwide have been doing poorly with rural working-class whites is that their candidates struggle to differentiate themselves from the party’s ultra-progressive elected officials from the big cities. This imposes the otherworldliness of very left-leaning Democratic politicians elsewhere onto the party’s candidates in the heartland. Recent losses for conservative Democrats in Montana and North Dakota show how vulnerable they are to this.
When the Republicans were in a similar position in the 1960s, locked out of power by the union of progressive northern Democrats and conservative southern ones, they mustered a realignment. They used the backlash against the civil-rights and feminist movements to woo conservative non-college whites. But entrenched identities now make such a feat harder. It appears nearly impossible for Democrats to win back a substantial share—say, 5%—of the blue-collar northern whites they once relied on for power, especially in the Senate. They are likely to be disadvantaged by America’s geography-based electoral system for many years to come. ■

1852,"OXFORD NANOPORE’S MinION is a tiny but powerful device. When a hotel worker in Sydney tested positive for covid-19 in March last year, the portable DNA sequencer traced the infection to a flight attendant for an American airline, avoiding a general lockdown. The success of biotech firms—another celebrity is BioNTech, of Covid-19 vaccine fame—is sucking capital into life sciences. When such companies expand, they do so not with offices or shops but by means of white-walled, shiny-surfaced scientific laboratories.
Commercial-property investors have long banked on offices, retail and industrial buildings. Less conventional assets like mobile-phone towers were the preserve of specialists. Now the big guns of real estate are competing over them too. Thus laboratory space has become commercial real-estate’s hottest property, along with other facilities that power the digital economy. Data centres and infrastructure that connect smartphones are booming.

The investors’ motivation is clear. The pandemic convulsed commercial-property prices globally. American retailers closed nearly 15,000 shops in 2020. By mid-October, with people attached to remote work, offices were only a third full. The risk profile of some conventional property assets has deteriorated sharply.
In contrast, demand for assets like labs and data centres has never been stronger—a trend visible before the coronavirus began to spread. As rent collections for shops and restaurants plummeted last year, data traffic from virtual meetings and online shopping exploded. Companies that use the underlying data centres and mobile towers are demanding more of them. These digital-economy winners look as safe as houses.

The shift is reflected in the changing make-up of America’s ten largest real-estate investment trusts (REITS). A decade ago the most valuable such vehicle was Simon Property Group, the country’s biggest mall owner. Today it is American Tower, a fast-expanding owner of tens of thousands of phone masts around the world. Five of the top ten REITS currently manage either data centres or mobile towers.
The loudest buzz currently surrounds life-sciences and lab space. Investors are flooding the health-care sector with capital. Drug makers, medical-equipment manufacturers and other life-sciences firms have raised a record $103bn in venture capital so far this year, up from $63bn in 2019, according to JLL, a property consultancy. A generous slice of capital is going into property. JLL estimates that up to $87bn is now being directed towards life-sciences real estate worldwide. That is equivalent to a third of all global spending on commercial property in the second quarter of this year.
Landmark deals are cropping up frequently. In October GIC, Singapore’s sovereign-wealth fund, purchased a 40% stake in Oxford Science Park from Magdalen College, part of Oxford University; the deal valued the park at ten times its worth just five years ago. Blackstone, a private-equity firm, recently doubled its ownership of life-sciences floorspace in Britain, investing over $1bn in two new sites. Shares of life-science REITS are booming.
By now, lab space is growing hard to come by. In Boston, where much of it in America is held, less than 5% of labs were available in the third quarter.In the Golden Triangle, as the area between London, Oxford and Cambridge is known, premises have run out. The Harwell life-sciences campus near Oxford will add 1.5m square feet over the next seven years to meet demand—equivalent to three-quarters of all the office space London’s financial district will add this year. Chris Walters, director at JLL, estimates unmet demand for lab space in and around Cambridge at 1m square feet—equivalent to nearly a quarter of retail space on London’s Oxford Street.
Where markets are tight, participants will seek to expand supply. In the case of sci-tech property that is harder than it sounds. Constructing new phone towers means navigating strict planning laws and NIMBYS. New data centres need land with access to cheap electricity and high-speed internet. Life-sciences firms like to cluster around top universities and academic medical centres that provide the chemists, microbiologists and other experts that populate their labs. One fix is finding secondary locations. Cities like Los Angeles, which is fairly near the San Francisco Bay Area, and Pittsburgh, home to Carnegie Mellon, a university known for prowess in artificial intelligence, are attracting startups awash with capital. In Britain, life-sciences hubs are springing up in the north, where pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca and GSK have manufacturing sites.
Another remedy is converting existing offices and industrial space. Boston Properties, one of America’s largest office REITS, says it can convert 5m square feet of conventional sites and buildings into laboratories. It is no easy process, for labs are complex spaces governed by biosafety rules. They need four times the amount of air that offices do. Waiting lists in London for “wet” labs, facilities in which dangerous chemicals and other hazardous substances can be handled, are lengthening.But property investors are game to try. In New York conversions could almost double the city’s lab space for rent, according to Newmark, a real-estate advisory firm.
Even empty shops are being repurposed. Savills, a British property firm, reckons London has at least 1.8m square feet of retail property that could be refashioned into laboratories.Shops’ high ceilings mean plenty of room for high-performance ventilation, and service lifts for moving dangerous materials. It will doubtless take years for supply to catch up with demand. But as the locus of work and commerce moves, real-estate investors are shifting with it.■

1853,"IN 2019, WHEN Labour’s vote collapsed, Deborah Mattinson headed north to listen. Throughout the New Labour era she had run focus groups of swing voters. What car would Labour politicians drive? What did they drink and smoke? But she had not tested opinion in “red wall” seats in the Midlands and northern England, home to voters who had been among Labour’s most reliable before Brexit drove them into the arms of the Conservatives.
In a book published last September Ms Mattinson offers detailed studies of new Tory voters in three former Labour seats to help rectify that omission. And she offers some advice for Sir Keir Starmer, who became leader after that drubbing. He must introduce himself clearly, prove Labour’s economic competence and show that his party is serious about the fate of provincial towns. Above all, he must set out a positive, patriotic vision. In the words of Colin, a bricklayer from Stoke-on-Trent whom she interviewed: “Show us the Britain they want to see and the Britain they believe in.”

Ms Mattinson is now Sir Keir’s director of strategy. But his supporters worry that Colin has not been answered. Labour’s agenda must be clarified now, says a shadow minister, in order to sell it to constituents before a general election expected as early as 2023. Both Labour’s and Sir Keir’s ratings are poor (see chart). Covid-19 has robbed him of opportunities to campaign and influence the news agenda. A lot rides on his address to the party’s conference in Brighton on September 29th.
Supporters of Jeremy Corbyn, who led Labour into the disastrous 2019 election, see Sir Keir, formerly Britain’s public prosecutor, as an empty suit devoid of ideological conviction. That is unfair. Starmerism is distinctive as an approach to leadership, a political culture and a diagnosis of Britain’s faults. And the man himself is best defined as a post-populist leader.
Sir Keir’s leadership follows two populist revolutions: as Labour voters were repelled by Mr Corbyn’s hard-left populism and lured by Tory Brexiteers, they delivered the party its lowest tally of MPs since 1935. Post-populism is a bet that voters are nauseous after the tumult, and hankering for stability and professionalism. Focus groups suggest that Mr Johnson’s new voters do not dislike him, but doubt his ability for office. Labour’s refrain will be: “Serious times need a serious person.”
Behind the appeal of any populist movement, says a friend of Sir Keir, is the belief that life couldn’t be any worse if everything was thrown up in the air. One task of a post-populist is to pick up the pieces, which requires a “quiet, unflashy decency and competence”. Sir Keir is a defender of institutions such as the civil service and judiciary that are routinely bashed by ministers.
Another is to bury the past. Sir Keir, a leading opponent of Brexit, is now reconciled with leaving the trade bloc, and would seek merely to facilitate the movement of people and goods between it and Britain. He has worked to weed out the far-left fringe groups, and the anti-Semitism, that flourished under Mr Corbyn.
No plain sailing
A third task is to tackle the discontent that fed populism in the first place. Sir Keir sees Britain’s biggest problems as insecure work and the hollowing-out of public services, both of which were cast into sharp relief by covid-19. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, likens parts of Britain to the flyover states that voted for Donald Trump or the provincial France that produced the gilets jaunes, in part because they had been denuded of skilled jobs by globalisation.
Labour’s plans include stricter employment laws and a higher minimum wage. It seeks to restore pride and dignity to work, Sir Keir told trade-union leaders on September 14th. He is hawkish on crime, particularly on teenage tearaways and sex offenders. This stance combines criticism of the impact of austerity on policing with an appeal to socially conservative voters. Much of his economic agenda is reminiscent of Mr Corbyn’s. (Labour is still committed, in principle, to nationalising utilities.) That it sounds different is down to his director of policy, Claire Ainsley, who argues that left-wing parties need to express their agendas through moral values: family, fairness and hard work.
All these elements of Starmerism can be divined from the speeches and writings of Sir Keir’s inner circle. And he will set them out in finer detail in a 14,000-word essay due to be published before the party conference. What alarms his colleagues is that this philosophy lacks a slogan, or even a policy shortlist. One party official calls it “a jigsaw with many pieces and no picture”. Labour must learn from the Tories, says the shadow minister, and sell its message by repeating a handful of key propositions to the point of exhaustion.
And beyond the philosophy lie two further questions, upon which Sir Keir’s electoral chances depend. The first is whether he has the flair and daring to seize the agenda when opportunity arises, like Tony Blair, Labour’s great election-winner. The second, and larger, is whether the populist moment has passed. Are Britons really yearning for a safe pair of hands? ■",2
1854,"A federal judge has blamed the former president for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot, saying that Donald Trump 'created the conditions' for the unrest with his 'lies.'
Judge Amit Mehta, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, indirectly invoked the president's name Friday when sentencing John Lolos to 14 days in jail for his role in the deadly demonstration.
'The fact remains that he and others were called to Washington, DC, by an elected official, prompted to walk to the Capitol by an elected official,' Mehta said.
'People like Mr. Lolos were told lies, were told falsehoods, were told the election was stolen when it was not,' Mehta added, calling Lolos a 'pawn,' according to CNN.  
Mehta appears to be the first judge to hold Trump responsible in a Capitol riot case. 
Judge Mehta, 50, was born in India and attended Georgetown University and the University of Virginia Law School. He was appointed by former President Barack Obama in July 2014 and confirmed by the US Senate via voice vote in December. 
'Once you hear people who should know better tell you that an election was stolen and they say it loudly enough, frequently enough, it's not surprising that people will believe it,' the judge said, according to Politico.
Nearly 700 people have been charged in the riot, Insider reports, and 40 have been sentenced. 
Lolos was sentenced to 14 days in jail and was ordered to pay $500 in restitution.
Prosecutors say that Lolo was seen in a video leaving the Capitol doorway waving a red 'Trump 2020 Keep America Great' flag hooked together with the United States flag, yelling, 'We did it, yeah!' after an unknown individual yelled, 'We stopped the vote!'
He was arrested after a DC airport officer saw a video of Lolos at the riot on his Instagram feed and noticed him at the airport wearing the same shirt.
At the time, Lolos was waiting for another flight out of DC because he was kicked off the first one after 'continuously yelling ""Trump 2020!""' while the plane was on the tarmac, according to Lolo's charging document.
On Wednesday, a judge sentenced Jacob Chansley, also known as the 'QAnon Shaman,' to nearly three-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the riot, with credit for the 10 months he's already served.
'I admit to the world, I was wrong. I have no excuses. My behavior was indefensible,' he said.
Chansley insisted that he is not a violent man, a domestic terrorist or a 'white supremacist.'
As part of an impassioned 30-minute speech to the court, Chansley quoted Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Jesus, and the prison break film The Shawshank Redemption.
January 6 rioters were hoping to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results in favor of President Joe Biden after President Trump repeatedly said the election had been stolen from him, a claim he continues to make today.
Earlier that day, Trump had given a speech in which he told his supporters, 'If you don’t fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'
The riot resulted in the deaths of five people, including Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer trying to stop a crowd from breaking into the building. 
'Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos who were told those lies took it to heart. And they are the ones paying the consequences,' Judge Mehta said. 
'Those who created the conditions that lead to Mr. Lolos' conduct have in no meaningful measure been held accountable.'
He told Lolos: 'You were a pawn. You were a pawn in the game played by people who know better.'
Various reports of Friday's hearing describe Lolos as 'rambling' or going into an 'extended rant.'
As his defense attorney tried to stop him from talking, he continued to cite debunked election fraud claims, claimed the evidence against him was tainted, and encouraged people listening in on the hearing to look up a video of him online, according to CNN. 
'I may have failed to explain why incarceration is necessary here, but I think Mr. Lolos just summed it up,' prosecutors said.",-2
1855,"IN AMERICA presidential campaigns start soon after the mid-term elections and last nearly two arduous years. In Germany, in contrast, for most of this year it was hard to tell that one of the most important elections in post-war history will take place on September 26th. It was only in the first week of August that posters sprouted on lampposts across Berlin, featuring the three high-profile contenders for the chancellorship as well as obscure local politicians running for parliament. Political advertisements are at last running on television. The Social Democrats even broke a taboo this month by running a negative one, attacking the religious beliefs of a close aide of Armin Laschet, the conservative candidate who is the narrow front-runner to succeed Angela Merkel, who is retiring after 16 years as chancellor.
Until devastating floods inundated parts of North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) and Rhineland-Palatinate in mid-July, conventional wisdom suggested a win for Mr Laschet, the candidate of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). But Mr Laschet is also the state premier of NRW, and his response to the floods has been inept. As The Economist launched its election-forecast model online on August 10th, the once soporific election campaign was becoming more interesting. The gaffe-prone Mr Laschet cancelled all campaign events last week and some TV appearances in September, ostensibly to focus on the aftermath of the flood disaster.

Meanwhile Olaf Scholz, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), is gaining ground. Germans do not vote directly for their chancellor, but INSA Consulere, a pollster, found last week that when respondents were asked whom they would pick if they could, Mr Scholz got 27% of the votes. Annalena Baerbock, the Green Party’s candidate, drew just 13% and Mr Laschet 14%. Fully 36% said that they do not want to vote for any of the three.

With Mr Scholz doing well (or at least not blundering), a genuine alternative to the conservative party’s long rule has become plausible. The Economist’s election model, our first for Germany (which can be found at www.economist.com/german-election-2021), blends the latest polls with other indicators, such as data on parties’ past performance, to come up with an educated guess at how many votes and seats each might win. It also measures the considerable uncertainty of the contest. The model’s projections will be updated daily.
Germany’s election system is unusual. Voters get two votes. The first is used to elect a local MP—roughly one for every 250,000 people—using a first-past-the-post system; every winning candidate is guaranteed a seat. The second vote is for a party rather than a candidate. It is more important than the first because it determines the overall proportion of seats that each party holds in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. Candidates’ prospects for the chancellorship depend not on their personal popularity but on how well their parties do on the second vote. Most polls (as well as our online poll-tracker) predict that the SPD will come in third after the CDU and the Greens, or tie with the Greens for second.
Once seats are allocated, coalition talks get under way. As of August 12th our model shows that the combination most likely to have a majority would be the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the free-market Free Democratic Party (FDP). This is known as a Jamaica coalition, after the colours of that country’s flag. The Greens and Christian Democrats might also go it alone in a black-green combo, if their vote share is high enough. Our model also spies a potential upset with an Ampel (traffic-light) coalition of the Greens, SPD and FDP. This would give Mr Scholz his best chance at the chancellorship, though Ms Baerbock would probably claim it if the Greens beat the SPD. It would exclude the CDU from government for the first time since 2005, when Mrs Merkel first took charge.
The FDP has not been in government since 2013, when it failed to cross the 5% vote-share threshold required to get into parliament. But it would be part of two of the three most likely coalitions. “It’s looking good for the FDP,” says Ursula Münch, head of the Academy for Political Education in Tutzing. Christian Lindner, the youthful boss of the FDP, whose party is benefiting from Mr Laschet’s weakness, favours Jamaica but has not ruled out Ampel. Hence he risks losing some of the majority of FDP voters who prefer Mr Laschet to Mr Scholz. Mr Lindner is already discussing ministerial portfolios. He says he would like to be finance minister—and assumes that the Greens would claim the planned environment and climate ministry.
Many pundits think the Greens and CDU/CSU chose the wrong candidates. Did they? “ Jain (yes and no)”, says Olaf Böhnke of Rasmussen Global, a political consultancy in Berlin. The CDU/CSU should have picked Markus Söder, the CSU’s head and state premier of Bavaria, who has better political instincts and is more dynamic than Mr Laschet. But Ms Baerbock ticks lots of boxes, says Mr Böhnke, who adds that all women in German politics face extra grilling. In his view Ms Baerbock’s missteps, including alleged plagiarism in her book and embellishment of her CV, have been exaggerated by the centre-right press.
With a month and a half to go, the outcome is highly uncertain. Since 2005 the number of undecided voters has increased drastically, says Thorsten Faas, a professor of political science at the Free University in Berlin. The last weeks of election campaigns have become more important than ever, which makes both our online poll-tracker and our election-forecast model especially relevant. Particularly with new candidates for the chancellorship, old loyalties may no longer hold, says Mr Faas. Faithful followers of Mrs Merkel will not automatically vote for Mr Laschet.
On August 10th Mr Laschet met his fellow state premiers to discuss covid-19 and recovery from the floods. Such gatherings are important for the Rhinelander: to overcome accusations of lassitude, he must show resolve in helping flood victims and a clear strategy to fight the pandemic’s fourth wave. Otherwise the allure of Mr Scholz, who as finance minister has promised hundreds of millions of euros in flood remediation, will grow even more.

1856,"IT WAS DIFFICULT to tell the smells apart. For months the town of Agareb, near Tunisia’s coast, had reeked of rubbish because of an overflowing landfill. In September the authorities closed the site, which residents were calling a danger to public health. But this month, after trash had piled up in the streets, it was reopened. Protesters cried foul and on November 10th clashed with security forces. Along with the stench of tear-gas and garbage, a new smell filled the air: burning tyres.
One person was killed and a police station was ransacked. It was the worst violence in Tunisia since President Kais Saied suspended parliament and grabbed power in July. Critics called his actions a coup. But many in Agareb applauded him. The town of 40,000 has long been neglected. Its poor residents have grown disillusioned with the country’s decade-old democracy. They say they voted overwhelmingly for Mr Saied in 2019, hoping he would clean up corruption. If he had to act like an authoritarian to do it, so be it.

That was how most of them felt in July. Now they have changed their minds. The people of Agareb are calling Mr Saied a dictator. For it was he who overruled the local authorities and reopened the landfill, in part to provide relief for nearby Sfax. Tunisia’s second city and industrial powerhouse had been suffering under even bigger mountains of uncollected garbage.
Residents of Agareb say the landfill, opened in 2008, was meant to be in use for only five years. A judge ordered it closed in 2019, to no avail. Now it is not only overflowing, but full of dangerous industrial and medical waste, including amputated body parts and fetuses, say activists. They claim the dump has spread disease including respiratory ailments and cancer.
Tunisia collects around 2.5m tonnes of waste every year. Little of it is recycled. Much of it ends up in one of 13 official landfills without being properly treated. A lot of it just piles up in the streets. Even in Tunis, the capital, less than two-thirds of the waste is collected, says the World Bank. In Sfax province the local government refused to collect rubbish after the Agareb landfill was closed.
Collecting trash can be profitable. But the big contracts offered to waste-management companies have been controversial. Elyes Fakhfakh resigned last year as prime minister after he was accused of concealing a conflict of interest in awarding such deals (he denies wrongdoing). His opponents also have links to businessmen with fingers in the waste-management pie.
Last summer an Italian company sent nearly 300 containers of “plastic trash” to Tunisia. A Tunisian firm had agreed to recycle it for a fee. But the trash was mostly household waste, of the sort now piling up on Tunisian streets. The deal violated international treaties, as well as Tunisian law. Twenty-six people, including a former environment minister, were arrested.
The waste-management scandal typifies Tunisia’s corruption and mismanagement, with the burden falling mostly on the poor. It was hoped that Mr Saied’s government would do better. But cleaning up Tunisia is proving to be as hard as ever. Many of the country’s landfills are in poorer areas like Agareb. Any of such places could be the next to erupt. ■",2
1857,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",3
1858,"MOST DEMOCRACIES would struggle to match the productivity of India’s Parliament. During its “monsoon” session, which ended on August 11th, a score of bills covering everything from coconuts to bankruptcy have passed the upper or lower house, or both.
Alas, the reason why laws pass so easily is far from benign. Under Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has eroded many of the checks and balances that underpin true democracy. Elections themselves are largely free and fair. But defamation laws are abused to hound critics. Political opponents are intimidated and even imprisoned. Over 7,000 Indians have been charged with sedition under the BJP, casting a chill on civil society. In a scandal that would topple any accountable government, a global investigation by a group of newspapers and NGOs suggests that Mr Modi’s government has slipped Israeli eavesdropping software called Pegasus into the mobile phones of hundreds of Indians, including opposition leaders, journalists, a former top election official and senior civil servants. As yet, it has faced no serious consequences for an act which, if proven, would no doubt be illegal as well as illiberal.

As for Parliament, Mr Modi and his sidekicks think of it not as a deliberative body but as a rubber stamp. They can do this because the opposition are disorganised and lethargic. Granted, opposition MPs are now demanding a debate and investigation into Pegasus, and boycotting Parliament to press their demands. Alas, the boycott plays into the prime minister’s hands, at least for now, as he bulldozes through his bills. One was discussed for just a single minute. A bankruptcy code of national significance commanded the monsoon session’s longest deliberation—a full 39 minutes.
This is no way to run a country. The V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg, which produces an annual report on the state of democracy around the world, declared this year that India has gone from “electoral democracy” to “electoral autocracy”, as autocratic as Pakistan and worse than Bangladesh or Nepal. It is not the only Asian state where democracy is under assault.
Like unhappy families, every decaying democracy is unique. Myanmar has reverted to full-blown military dictatorship. Sri Lanka has fallen under a family dynasty. Four Rajapaksa brothers run the place, including the president and prime minister, and a younger Rajapaksa generation is on the make.
In Indonesia, elections are free and fair. But President Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, has hollowed out democracy by gutting the anti-corruption commission and co-opting the opposition, thus fostering cronyism and ministerial ineptitude. Malaysia’s gerrymandered constituencies have long ensured the dominance of parties pandering to the ethnic-Malay, Muslim majority, at the expense of secular or multiracial representation. Recent rot has been occasioned by grabs at power by shifting groupings of the Malay elite. The current prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, came to office last year in a backdoor putsch. His power now hangs by a thread, with supporters offering to buy opposition MPs’ support. None of this helps ordinary Malaysians cope with the pandemic or the accompanying economic crisis.
Though countries or territories are all unhappy in their own way, certain shared attributes signal a lurch for the worse. One is the use of investigative authorities to go after domestic foes. In India, after Dainik Bhaskar, a media group, highlighted the government’s bungling of covid-19, tax inspectors launched a raid. Hong Kong was never a democracy, but until last year’s promulgation of a draconian security law at least limited elections gave voice to an opposition. Since then Hong Kong’s most critical newspaper has been closed and national-security cops now vet political candidates. Aspiring to win is, for a Hong Kong democrat, seditious.
Can the rot be stopped? Indian democracy survived Indira Gandhi’s dictatorial Emergency from 1975 to 1977. Today some see the opposition’s coming-together over Pegasus as the beginning of its revival, while a new chief justice is showing welcome independence. In Sri Lanka voters have a record of turfing governments out, and have done so once already with the Rajapaksas. Yet each burst of autocracy leaves democratic norms a little more battered. Once they are broken, it is hard to put them back together, whoever is in office.",2
1859,"DUBAI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is in talks with banks to amend the terms of a $16 billion loan due in 2023 and possibly reduce the size of the facility, sources said, as the world's top oil exporter looks to cut outstanding government debt and improve its balance sheet.
The discussions between the ministry of finance and the banks are at an early stage and no decision has been taken yet, said the four sources familiar with the matter.
One said the potential refinancing could be for 50% to 70% of the $16 billion facility, which Saudi Arabia raised in 2018 when it refinanced, extended and increased an existing $10 billion loan raised in 2016 and due in 2021.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia manages its debt proactively all the time and makes regular announcements as deals are completed in the appropriate way,"" a ministry of finance spokesperson said.
The duration of the new facility could also be reduced, to three years from five, with the option of renewing it by two years at maturity, said one of the sources.
The potential de-leveraging could help the kingdom obtain better credit ratings going forward, another source said.
The largest Arab economy suffered a deep contraction last year as the coronavirus crisis hurt its burgeoning non-oil economic sectors, while record-low oil prices weighed on state coffers, widening the 2020 budget deficit to 11.2% of GDP.
But higher oil production and prices bolstered its finances this year, with the kingdom recording a budget surplus of 6.7 billion riyals ($1.79 billion) in the third quarter, its first quarterly surplus in over two years.
On Friday, ratings agency Moody's upgraded Saudi Arabia's outlook to ""stable"" from ""negative"", saying it was likely the government would reverse most of its 2020 debt increase while preserving fiscal buffers.
It estimated government debt will decline below 29% of gross domestic product by the end of this year and to around 25% of GDP by 2025, from 32.5% of GDP last year.",3
1860,"IT HAS BEEN a summer of unpleasant surprises for the world economy. America, Europe and China are growing more slowly than investors had hoped. Consumer prices are rising uncomfortably fast, especially in America. Even in the euro area, used to tepid inflation, prices in August were 3% higher than a year earlier, the most in a decade. Economies are troubled by shortages of parts and labour, slow and expensive shipping and the bewildering variation of lockdown measures.
The spread of the Delta variant is to blame, but the way the pandemic is affecting the economy is shifting. The world had become accustomed to the virus battering growth, as waves of infection caused a sudden stop in activity, and prices moderated or even fell. Delta, by contrast, looks like a stagflationary force that is sapping growth less dramatically but firing up inflation.

Delta is weighing on consumer spending in the rich world but not causing a collapse. In countries with lots of vaccine, cases are no longer doing as much to stop consumers from moving around. Europe’s service sector has reopened amid its Delta wave.
Consumers seem less scared of the disease even if there are enough unvaccinated people to fill up hospitals. A year ago the number of diners in American restaurants was nearly half the level in 2019. Now service is about 10% down, even though hospitals are three times fuller. In Japan a state of emergency covering Tokyo does not seem to be keeping consumers away from the shops. Only in countries with draconian policies aimed at eliminating the virus are people stuck at home. Australia and New Zealand face new recessions as a result of their lockdowns and China’s service sector appears to be shrinking.
Meanwhile, the spread of Delta continues to interfere with the global supply of goods just as consumers, especially Americans, are intent on buying more cars, devices and sporting gear than ever. Outbreaks in South-East Asian countries with low rates of vaccination are causing production plants and logistics networks to shut down temporarily, prolonging the disruption to supply chains. In America retailers, including Gap and Nike, have lobbied the White House to donate more vaccines to Vietnam, so crucial have its factories become to their businesses. Shortages are driving up prices.

The changing relationship between the virus and the economy has implications for policymakers. They will not be able to repeat the trick from earlier in the pandemic of restricting people’s movement as a way to contain the spread of the virus, while at the same time unleashing stimulus to create a compensating boom in demand for goods.
A service-sector revival is now the only quick route to fast growth because that is where the slack is. In the second quarter of the year spending on services by American households was about 3% below its level in 2019 in real terms. Should the spread of Delta interfere with service industries such as leisure and hospitality, more stimulus will only create more inflation.
It is also harder to argue that fear of the virus scares consumers off spending, and that government restrictions to slow the spread of disease therefore have little extra economic cost. A weaker link between cases and people’s movement, and the necessity of service-sector growth, raise the cost of lockdowns. If pressure on hospitals causes even highly vaccinated countries like Britain to restrict services over the winter, the economic damage will be large and the benefits smaller. The Delta wave may subside soon, easing the pressure on the world economy. If it does not or another variant takes its place, the trade-offs involved in fighting the virus will become harder to justify. ■

1861,"THERE ARE far fewer esteladas, the red, yellow and blue independence flags that only a couple of years ago draped the balconies of Barcelona. The atmosphere in Spain’s second city is more relaxed than at any time since Catalonia’s nationalist politicians began a drive for independence for one of the country’s biggest and richest regions a decade ago. This culminated in a referendum in defiance of the constitution and a unilateral declaration of independence in 2017, the temporary imposition of direct rule from Madrid and then long jail sentences for nine separatist leaders. But with the pandemic having intensified a sense of exhaustion, confrontation is at last giving way to detente.
In June Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s Socialist prime minister, pardoned the prisoners in an effort to calm emotions. At a regional election in Catalonia in February the separatist coalition retained power but Esquerra, the most pragmatic of its three parties, came out on top. Mr Sánchez and Pere Aragonès, the new Catalan president, are to start talks on Catalonia’s future next week.

The more realistic among the separatists know that they overplayed their hand in a region that is deeply divided and where independence has never commanded a clear majority. “Since 2017 Catalonia has been digesting a political failure,” says Salvador Illa, the leader of the Catalan affiliate of the Socialist Party.
The talks will be neither quick nor easy. Mr Aragonès has two demands. He wants a full amnesty: half a dozen other leaders, including Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan president in 2017, are fugitives, subject to trial if they return; and the audit tribunal is seeking to recover from former Catalan officials some €5.4m, misspent—it says—on promoting independence abroad.
Second, Mr Aragonès wants to hold another referendum, with the national government’s agreement this time. Most scholars say the constitution prevents that. Both these demands are politically impossible for Mr Sánchez. The question is whether a compromise is possible and what it might look like.
This matters for Spain as a whole. Jordi Pujol, the founder of modern Catalan nationalism, recently told an interviewer that the separatist movement “isn’t strong enough to achieve independence, but it is to create a very serious problem for Spain.” The country stands out in western Europe for the strength of its peripheral nationalisms, not just among Catalans but also Basques and to an extent Galicians, who all retain distinct languages. The reasons lie mainly in history. In the 19th century, when Romantic philosophers invented modern nationalism, the Spanish state was too weak to impose a uniform language and culture, as happened in France. Centrifugal forces were brutally suppressed during the long dictatorship of Francisco Franco. But Spain’s democratic constitution of 1978 appeared to have settled the issue for good, with sweeping administrative decentralisation to 19 regions.
The framers of the constitution opted for a de facto, open-ended, asymmetric federalism. In need of extra votes in the national parliament, Socialist and conservative governments alike handed over more and more powers to Basque and Catalan nationalists who wanted recognition of their regions’ long history, rather than to be treated the same as new administrative units such as La Rioja or Murcia.
Messy though it is, the system worked well as long as there was money and political goodwill. Since the financial crisis of 2007-09, both have dried up. Politics has been riled by three successive populist movements. There is identitarian populism in Catalan nationalism’s embrace of separatism. Podemos, on the far left, rejects parts of the constitution; it is now the junior partner in Mr Sánchez’s coalition and favours a confederal Spain. Vox has arisen on the hard right. It wants recentralisation. The mainstream conservative People’s Party (PP) will almost certainly have to ally with Vox if it is to win power.
Juan José López Burniol, a lawyer close to Catalan business leaders, believes that a compromise would include recognition of Catalonia as a nation in cultural but not political terms; a ceiling on fiscal transfers to the common pool; a shared tax agency; and reinforcing the powers of the regional government over education, language policies and culture, including Catalan-language public media. This package should then be put to the voters in a referendum.
Mr Pujol has spoken of “a fudge” along similar lines. Mr Illa and the Catalan Socialists are far more cautious, at least in their opening bid. He thinks the talks should focus on reform of fiscal arrangements. “We should use well the powers we already have,” he says. The Spanish state should be more, rather than less, present in Catalonia, especially in cultural policy.
There are three obstacles. To last, any agreement needs the acquiescence of the PP, which wins few votes in Catalonia but benefits from anti-separatist feeling elsewhere and wants to dilute the use of Catalan in schools. Second, it will take years for Esquerra and separatist voters to accept a compromise. Third, the rest of Spain is not a passive spectator. “We can’t allow the dialogue on Catalonia to organise the regional question in Spain,” says Ximo Puig, the Socialist president of Valencia, which is especially short-changed by the current financial settlement.
But in other respects there is consensus among peripheral regions, including Catalonia, that the status quo benefits Madrid above all. In some ways Catalan separatism is a response to relative decline. When Franco died in 1975, Catalonia’s economy was 25% bigger than that of the Madrid region. By 2018 Madrid’s GDP had overtaken Catalonia’s. The PP, which has governed there since 1995, attributes this to its business-friendly policies. The regional government has delivered tax cuts totalling €53bn ($63bn) since 2004, says Javier Fernández-Lasquetty, Madrid’s economic head. “We think there is a direct correlation between the lowering of the tax burden and economic growth,” he says. Others say Madrid, which houses almost all state agencies and is Spain’s transport hub, has benefited disproportionally from globalisation. Public policies could change that.
If Spain were starting from scratch, the best answer to its regional conundrums would be German-style federalism. But there is little chance of that. The conflict which splits Catalonia in two has no definitive solution. But an imaginative compromise ought to be possible. Spain’s future success may well depend on it. ■",2
1862,"USING DRONES to assassinate people has long been the preserve of the most advanced armed forces, such as America’s and Israel’s. But the attempt on November 7th to kill Iraq’s prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, was a dramatic demonstration of how such “precision strike” capabilities are spreading to less advanced countries and even shadowy militias.
Several of Mr Kadhimi’s bodyguards were hurt when at least one drone hit his home in the protected “Green Zone” of Baghdad (more drones may have been shot down). The prime minister survived and, apparently nursing a wounded wrist, soon appeared on television to denounce the “cowardly” attack.

The hit was so rudimentary—apparently involving quadcopters of the sort that can be bought by hobbyists and rigged with small bombs—that it could have been staged by any one of Iraq’s many armed groups. “If you can deliver pizza with a drone, you can drop a grenade,” says James Lewis of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington.
Yet suspicion immediately fell on Iran and its proxies, for two reasons. The first is that Fatah, the political arm of Shia militias aligned with Iran, is furious at losing most of its seats in Iraq’s election last month. Loyalists have staged unruly protests and on Friday attempted to burst into the Green Zone. The following day, at the funeral of a protester killed by security forces, militia leaders vowed revenge against Mr Kadhimi. “The blood of martyrs will hold you accountable,” one said. That night the drone attack took place.
The second reason is that Iran has become the most assiduous provider of drone and other military technology to its proxies and friends, not only in Iraq but also in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Drones are fast becoming Iran’s favoured weapon of asymmetric warfare, unnerving its enemies and threatening to change the balance of power in the region. These are not the sophisticated machines operated by America, such as the Predator and the Reaper. Nor are they akin to the Israeli and Turkish combat drones that allowed Azerbaijan to defeat Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh last year.
Instead, they are often “craptastic” knock-off versions, made with commercially available components, explains Aaron Stein of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. But Iran is also making improvements, not least by reverse-engineering captured drones, such as America’s stealthy RQ-170.
Lacking a modern air force—Iran’s jets date to the time of the Shah before his overthrow in 1979—the clerical regime has invested heavily in ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones. Like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from advanced countries, Iranian ones are used for both surveillance and strikes (not least against ships). Unlike them, Iranian UAVs do not usually carry precision-guided munitions. Instead the drone itself is the guided bomb, flying into the target and detonating like a robotic kamikaze. Iran dispenses with the satellite links that allow Western forces to control drones from the other side of the world. Instead its UAVs are typically operated through line-of-sight radio controls, or can guide themselves with GPS devices of the sort used for retail sat-nav machines.
Iran achieves great range by distributing UAVs (or the techniques to make them) to its allies across the Middle East, thereby threatening targets from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. The drones are often delivered in kits and assembled locally with minimal help from Iran, notes Mr Stein. “These drones allow Iran to orchestrate attacks while maintaining deniability and ambiguity,” says an Israeli military official.
The simplicity belies the threat that the drones pose. Last month an American outpost in Tanf in Syria was hit by five GPS-guided drones. Nobody was hurt—the Americans apparently had warning and got out of harm's way—but American officials later blamed Iran and the Biden administration imposed sanctions on people and firms associated with the drone programme.
“We no longer have air superiority in the theatre,” laments a senior American military source, “Americans got used to owning the skies.” What is more, drones are exposing the vulnerability of vital installations across the region. In 2019 several drones struck Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais, interrupting about half of the country’s oil output for a time. The Houthi militia in Yemen, which is allied to Iran and has been fighting against a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, claimed responsibility. But Western military sources believe the drones were dispatched from Iraq, or perhaps even from Iran.
Israel, for its part, has been grappling with drones since 2004, when an Iranian-made drone flew over the country without being intercepted. Hizbullah, a Shia militia, later broadcast footage of the event. Since then Israel has intercepted about a dozen drones—including one that appeared to be heading for Israel’s nuclear reactor in Dimona in 2012. It also destroyed, via air strikes, Iranian drones and their control systems on the ground in Syria in 2018.
As the country that pioneered the use of disposable and suicide drones to destroy Arab air defences in the 1970s and 1980s, Israel is among those working hardest to defend against them. It has resorted to everything from F-16 fighters to the Iron Dome anti-rocket system, but is looking for a better response. Drones can be hard to detect because they are often small, fly low and slowly, and might not broadcast any signals. They “get lost in the clutter”, notes an official at Israel Aerospace Industries, a state-owned firm that has developed anti-drone systems. “Hard kills” (ie, shooting down the drones) can cause damage on the ground, particularly in built-up areas; jamming radio and GPS signals disrupt civilian life; and lasers-based systems are still in development. “Drone defence is an expensive business as countries have a large number of facilities to protect,” says the official. He points to the spread of 5G mobile-phone networks that might give future attackers the option of controlling drones remotely, akin to having satellite links. “It’s a crazy arms race because the technological possibilities for drone use continue to increase.”■",2
1863,"THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE has not had the greatest few years. In 2019, to great fanfare, it was given to Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, for his role in bringing about a peace deal with Eritrea, Ethiopia’s tiny neighbour. It was hailed as a landmark for the country. “We must plant seeds of love, forgiveness and reconciliation in the hearts and minds of our citizens”, said Mr Abiy, that December, in his lecture on receiving the prize. Sadly, Mr Abiy’s seed-planting phase did not last very long. Last year, disaffected soldiers in Tigray, a northern region of the country with a long history of controlling Ethiopia, rebelled. Mr Abiy launched a brutal police action in retaliation. Last month, the prime minister and Nobel laureate toured the battlefield in what has become a new Ethiopian civil war, promising to use rebels as “target practice.” 
The Nobel peace prize committee has been embarrassed before. Henry Kissinger won in 1973—while the United States, following his strategy, was carpet-bombing Cambodia. Among the bookies’ favourites this year were Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenage environmentalist; the World Health Organisation, for its work in helping to get the world vaccinated; and Alexei Navalny, an imprisoned Russian dissident who last year was poisoned with novichok, a nerve agent, and almost died. Instead the gongs have gone to two journalists: Dmitry Muratov, who edits Novaya Gazeta, a liberal Russian newspaper; and Maria Ressa, a former CNN anchor who founded and is the chief executive of Rappler, a website critical of the Philippine government.
Both journalists have done remarkable work in difficult times. Mr Muratov and his newspaper have long toiled to investigate and expose wrongdoing, even as the net has tightened on critics in Russia. In 2014 Novaya broke stories about the shooting down of MH17, a Malaysian Airlines flight, by Russian-backed militants in Ukraine, and then published an apology on behalf of Russia on its front page at a time when Russia’s government was insisting it had nothing to do with the plane going down. Six of the newspaper’s journalists have been murdered in the past three decades. In March noxious substances were sprayed into the newspapers’ offices in an attempt at intimidation. Dozens of Russian journalists have been designated as “foreign agents” by the state. “We’ve been experiencing enormous pressure, of a sort we never experienced before,” says Pavel Kanygin, one of the paper’s reporters.
Ms Ressa’s news organisation, Rappler, which started as a Facebook page in 2011, has been one of very few Philippine news organisations to openly criticise President Rodrigo Duterte’s government, publishing investigations into extrajudicial killings undertaken by the police as part of his war on drugs. It has been targeted by malicious tax investigations, as well as libel cases. Ms Ressa, who along with several other journalists was named a Time magazine person of the year in 2018, has been fighting several libel cases, which in the Philippines can result in prison sentences. Last year she was convicted of one case of “cyber libel”, which she is appealing, but which could put her in prison for up to six years. In 2016, Mr Duterte, then the president elect, responded to a question about media killings with the claim that “just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you’re a son of a bitch”.
Yet in Russia at least, many are disappointed with the committee’s choice not to give the prize to somebody higher profile, such as Mr Navalny, or Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who stood in the Belarussian election last year. Alexander Etkind, a Russian historian, said he believed Mr Muratov deserved his award, but he had nominated Mr Navalny and he was sorry “that the Nobel committee did not have courage to do the right thing.” Indeed the Kremlin seemed delighted it had not done so. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s press officer, congratulated Mr Muratov for his “talent” and “bravery”. With Mr Navalny still in prison and in poor health, a Nobel would have been deeply embarrassing to Mr Putin in a way that Mr Muratov’s is not. 
Both editors have accepted their awards graciously, speaking up for other journalists and victims of oppression. “I am laughing. I didn’t expect it at all. It’s madness over here right now,” Mr Muratov said, on a Telegram channel, promising to do more to represent independent Russian journalism. He dedicated the prize to the six Novaya journalists who have been murdered, and said he said he hoped it would help people who are critical of Russia’s government, particularly journalists and other news organisations accused of being foreign agents. He also said he thought Mr Navalny deserved it. Ms Ressa learned of her prize while taking part in an online panel on press freedom, and said that she was “in shock…I think it’s a recognition of how tough it is”.
The need to speak out for journalists is undeniable. In 2020, more than twice as many were murdered for doing their jobs as in 2019, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an NGO based in New York. At the end of 2020 over 270 journalists were imprisoned, according to the same organisation. That was the highest figure ever recorded by their annual census, which has been going for almost three decades. Highlighting the perils of being a journalist in repressive countries is no bad thing. Yet some will wonder if the Nobel Committee could not have been a little bolder. ■",2
1864,"MASY, A LISTLESS three-year-old, has just sucked up a packet of Plumpy’Nut, a peanut-butter paste that donors give to malnourished children. It may save her life. Yet her grandmother, Zemele, is still gloomy. Sitting on the ground outside a clinic in Maroalopoty, a village in southern Madagascar, she describes how hard life has become. Her land has had almost no rain for three years. Sandstorms have made the soil less fertile. Masy’s parents have gone away to find work. To make ends meet, Zemele has had to sell three of her four fields. “Before, it was bad,” she says, “but not so bad.”
Madagascar, the world’s fourth-largest island, has long been prone to droughts, cyclones and floods. Now it is reeling from a double catastrophe: crop failure in the south, partly due to climate change, and a covid-19-induced economic crunch.

On August 19th UN agencies appealed for $155m to help feed 1.3m people in southern Madagascar, where some areas are dangerously close to full-blown famine. Some families are so desperate they are selling their daughters, frets Mialy Radrianasolo of Unicef, the UN’s agency for children. “Because of hunger,” she says, the poorest families “want to get rid” of their daughters, so a “man of 60” who may already have four or five wives “can get a 12-year-old in marriage.”
Many children are dropping out of school to work or forage for food. Jean-Chrysostome Gege, the deputy head of a primary school in a village called Ehavo, says it had 250 pupils in 2018 but only 110 last year. Education may yield rich rewards eventually, but hungry households need food today.
The emergency has many causes. Climate change has made the rains less reliable, say UN officials. In Madagascar’s deep south people have long been used to the keré (a drought that brings hunger). But in some places of late the keré has lasted for years instead of months. The UN says this one is the worst in 40 years.

Covid-19, meanwhile, has clobbered the economy. Before the pandemic the World Bank expected GDP to grow by a healthy 5.2% in 2020; instead it shrank by 4.2%. This is even worse than it sounds, since the population is rising by 2.7% a year.
Tourist contraction
Moreover, GDP is expected to rebound slowly, with the IMF forecasting economic growth this year of just 3.2%. To defend Madagascar from the pandemic, the government has sealed it off, admitting only a handful of foreigners and allowing only a few flights to land. Tourists, who used to flock to see Madagascar’s lemur-filled rainforests or wild and unspoilt coast, cannot come. The estimated 1.5m people who depend on them are struggling. Noeline, who sells colourful wooden trucks by a road near Antananarivo, the capital, sold a dozen a day before the pandemic. Now she sells only one, she says.
Malnutrition, though always a scourge, was until recently becoming rarer. The proportion of Malagasy children under five who are stunted fell from around 61% in 1992 to 42% in 2018, according to the World Bank. But it has jumped back up to 47%, says Unicef, and the rate of stunting is higher in the south.
Small-bore solutions
With 28m people in an area bigger than metropolitan France, Madagascar is not densely populated. But it is very poor. In the south, goods and people must move along rutted tracks rather than tarmac roads. The chopping down of trees for fuel has led to soil erosion. Some people are trying to reverse this. In Maroalopoty, a car that arrives from the UN Development Programme is rapidly surrounded by hundreds of villagers. The UN is recruiting them for a couple of dollars a day to plant lines of drought-resistant sisal to tamp down the earth and nearby sand dunes. For some, it will be too little, too late.
Michel Saint-Lot of Unicef complains of decades of poor governance. “You cannot just drill small boreholes equipped with a hand pump for drinking water,” he says. The country needs long-term fixes, he argues, such as water pipelines for drinking water, cattle and irrigation.
Soja Lahimaro, the governor of Androy, one of the worst-affected regions, says he used to think that governments in the far-away capital kept the south poor to show to foreigners, so they would dish out aid. Now he says that President Andry Rajoelina, who appointed him, is doing his best.
Others have doubts. Mr Rajoelina has built costly stadiums and a Roman-style colosseum next to a historic palace in Antananarivo. He also wants to found a new city to relieve the capital of overcrowding. But education and health care remain woeful. When covid-19 struck Mr Rajoelina touted a herbal treatment called “Covid-Organics”, made from local plants. There is no evidence it works. He also initially spurned COVAX, the big global programme that gives free vaccines to poor countries. So far, less than 1% of the population has had even one dose.
Juvence Ramasy, an analyst, says Mr Rajoelina is a populist who makes promises but does not follow through. His grandly titled Initiative for the Emergence of Madagascar, which aims to promote mining and infrastructure, is still just a draft. Some public money has been spent in the south, says Mr Ramasy, but much of it has been stolen by politicians. The region is known as the “graveyard of projects”.
Last week Mr Rajoelina went to Paris to woo foreign investors. It would help if his government quarrelled less with existing investors: for example, over a new airport terminal and two hydroelectric plants built by French companies. Reports after Mr Rajoelina met France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, on August 27th, suggest that these disputes may soon be settled.
But some investors worry about Madagascar’s stability. Two decades ago it came close to civil war, and the army has intervened regularly in politics. Mr Rajoelina’s first term as president, from 2009 to 2014, was the result of a coup. He then won a reasonably fair election in 2018, but politics is far from calm. Recently the government arrested 27 people, including several military officers and two French citizens, who, it said, were planning to assassinate Mr Rajoelina. Details are unclear but police say one of the plotters asked a local oil company for $10m to overthrow the president, and promised oil concessions in return.
The economy is riven with cronyism. Most media are controlled by pro-Rajoelina politicians. The opposition is weak. In May the Global Initiative on Transnational Organised Crime, an NGO based in Geneva, said that Madagascar was becoming a hub for heroin and cocaine trafficking. Local media ignored the story, complains Riana Raymonde Randrianarisoa, an investigative reporter. She believes the traffickers have high-level protection.
Madagascar’s lean season starts in September. Without short-term aid many children will grow up with stunted bodies and stunted minds. To help families feed themselves in the long run, Madagascar needs to develop. Except for a few commercial farms, agriculture has barely begun to be mechanised. Only 15% of Malagasy have electricity; in the countryside, far fewer. At night villages like Zemele’s are almost pitch black. Worse, says Mr Ramasy, “nothing much is changing.” ■

1865," (CNN)Members of the House committee investigating January 6 said on Thursday that many of the questions they have for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have nothing to do with then-President Donald Trump -- suggesting that the panel is still open to discussing the terms of a potential interview. The House select committee has been trying to get Meadows to comply after he defied its subpoena, failing to turn over documents and show up for his deposition last week. Two committee members indicated there are several lines of inquiry that would not be covered by executive privilege.Rep. Pete Aguilar told CNN on Thursday that Meadows, one of Trump's closest advisers, might have a ""minor claim"" to executive privilege over some conversations but emphasized the committee has questions for him that ""have nothing to do with the conversations he had directly with the President.""""His conversations about stopping a free and fair election, about criticizing and stopping the counting of electoral votes, about his coordination with campaign officials on private devices that were not turned over, all of those issues are not privilege worthy and he has some explaining to do,"" the California Democrat added. Rep. Jamie Raskin, another select committee member, also told CNN on Thursday that the committee has ""lots of questions {for Meadows} that have nothing to do with Trump personally."" ""We want Meadows to come in and testify on everything of interest to us,"" he said. ""If he thinks there are some questions that are covered by either executive privilege or the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, he can invoke it and a court can settle it later."" ""But there are certainly a lot of questions that are not even arguably tangentially related to privilege. And those you have to answer,"" the Maryland Democrat added.  The statements come after the current White House indicated last week that concessions do not need to be made for Meadows, notifying him that President Joe Biden will not assert executive privilege or immunity for him on matters related to the probe.The day after that notification, Meadows was a no-show for a scheduled deposition.Previous congressional inquiries have made concessions to close presidential aides. In the late 2000s, in a legal battle over getting testimony from former White House counsel Harriet Miers, the Obama White House engineered a deal that allowed a House committee to conduct interviews it wanted with Miers and former White House chief of staff Josh Bolten by making questions about direct communications with former President George W Bush off limits. A select committee aide told CNN that the panel has not taken any subjects in a potential interview with Meadows off the table and expects to get all the information it is seeking. Meadows' attorney did not respond to CNN's questions about possible negotiations on Thursday.Ahead of his scheduled deposition last week, Meadows' attorney, George J. Terwilliger III, issued a statement saying his client would not cooperate with the committee until courts had ruled on former President Donald Trump's claims of executive privilege, noting ""a sharp legal dispute with the committee.""Aguilar also noted Thursday that there are ways to discuss specific claims of privilege but Meadows is still required to talk to the committee. ""If there were privileged claims, there's a way to address them. What Meadows is saying is he has absolute privilege; he doesn't have to have conversations with us. The courts don't agree with that, past precedent hasn't agreed with that, and Congress has never indicated with that,"" he told CNN later Thursday, expanding on his previous comments. Aguilar added that the record the committee is building shows the large portion of the information it is looking for does not relate to the executive privilege claims that Meadows is making. Last week, White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote to Meadows' attorney, informing him of Biden's decision, and once again cited ""the unique and extraordinary circumstances where Congress is investigating an effort to obstruct the lawful transfer of power under our Constitution.""Su noted that Biden has already determined that executive privilege does not apply to particular subjects within the committee's purview, including ""events within the White House on or about January 6, 2021; attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud; and other efforts to alter election results or obstruct the transfer of power.""The chairman of the House select committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Wednesday that he was signing a letter to send to Meadows outlining everything the committee wants to learn from him, as the panel weighs whether to pursue a criminal contempt referral.This letter would be key to marking the trail of communication between Meadows and the committee, and crucial to building out an eventual criminal contempt referral report, if the committee chooses to go that route.A key question that the committee has said it wants answered by Meadows is whether he was using a private cell phone to communicate on January 6 and where his text messages from that day are.""We have information that that phone may or may not be in his possession. That number is not active anymore that he used, so we just want to know,"" Thompson has said.",0
1866,"SUDAN’S PATH to democracy has always been strewn with landmines. The country became independent in 1956. That year, and again in 1964 and 1986, there were brief attempts at democratic rule. All were scotched by men with guns. In 2019, after 30 years of genocidal military dictatorship under Omar al-Bashir, hope flowered once more. Peaceful protests toppled the tyrant. Many Sudanese longed for the army to retire to barracks.
The army had other ideas. In April 2019 it seized power again. Weeks later, security forces gunned down protesters, killing more than 100 and tossing their bodies into the Nile. Demonstrators kept coming out into the streets, however, braving bullets and beatings. To end the crisis, mediators pressed the protest leaders to let the army stay in charge for almost two years in exchange for a promise that it would hand power to civilians and allow elections in 2022. On October 25th, as the handover approached, officers staged another coup. Perhaps they were nervous of what future courts might say about their role in Sudan’s civil wars. Perhaps they just like being in charge. Either way, Sudan is in trouble.

The power-sharing deal, though squalid, was not always doomed to fail. It gave Sudan’s civilian politicians two years to build trust with the army by, say, offering amnesty for all but the most serious war crimes in exchange for full disclosure about them (an approach that worked in South Africa after apartheid). This opportunity was squandered.
Western donors could have smoothed Sudan’s transition with aid more quickly. Instead the economy kept contracting, fuelling a sense of crisis that the army exploited. Days before the coup, Western diplomats warned the generals to back off. That they did not shows how lightly they now take Western threats.
African coups are making a comeback. The past year has seen successful ones in Chad, Guinea and Mali (its second in less than a year), and failed ones in Madagascar and the Central African Republic. It is as bad as the early decades of independence, when Africa endured roughly four coups a year. The “no-coups policy” of the African Union (AU), which seemed more or less to work after it was adopted in 2000, now counts for little.
Two trends are making putsches more likely. One is the spread of jihadism. In 2012, when soldiers seized power in Mali, the AU swiftly suspended it. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a regional bloc, imposed sanctions and America halted aid. But then jihadists overran the north of the country. Now the AU and ECOWAS appear to have an unofficial policy of publicly ticking the generals off but leaving them in place rather than risking instability. Unfortunately, unaccountable governments tend to govern badly, feeding the very grievances upon which jihadism thrives. By putting short-term stability before democracy, you often end up enjoying neither.
A second trend is the jockeying for influence in Africa by foreign powers. China has won friends with its policy of “non-interference”. Russia is gaining clout by hiring out mercenaries to guard presidents and to train their armies. If Western countries condemn a coup or a rigged election or threaten sanctions, they know that they will lose influence even as Chinese and Russian ambassadors race to the presidential palace with offers of support, aid and loans.
Balancing values and realpolitik is hard, but two principles can help. The first is to draw red lines and stick to them, making it clear that genocide, war crimes and gross abuses of human rights are intolerable and will be met with sanctions, even if that leads to a break in relations.
The second is to remember that Africans themselves, by a wide margin, want more democracy than they have now. The West should respect that desire. So should the neighbours of countries where putsches occur. If coup leaders are tolerated, there will be more coups. ■",2
1867,"HAMBURG, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A specially convened Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) committee will discuss the future of CEO Herbert Diess, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, a week after a longstanding conflict with labour representatives flared up again.
The planned meeting of the rarely-summoned mediation committee of VW's supervisory board comes in response to tensions between management and its works council, after sources said Diess told a recent meeting of the board that 30,000 jobs were at risk as part of the group's electric vehicles push.  read more 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not confirm when the meeting would take place.
""Constructive and confidential discussions are currently being held. Possible results will be communicated in due time,"" said a source close to the supervisory board.
The mediation committee consists of Hans Dieter Poetsch, supervisory board chairman and CEO of Volkswagen's largest shareholder Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE); Stephan Weil, state premier of the German state of Lower Saxony, which owns a fifth of the voting rights of Volkswagen; works council leader Daniela Cavallo; and Joerg Hofmann, head of Germany's largest trade union IG Metall.
Spokespeople for Diess, Volkswagen's supervisory board and Porsche SE all declined to comment.
Shares in Volkswagen extended losses and fell as much as 4.7% following the news.
The escalation of the tussle over Diess's future underscores the fragile balance of power at the world's second-largest carmaker, pitting Diess' ambition to make Volkswagen more competitive with Tesla (TSLA.O) against Germany's influential trade unions.
Diess, who took the helm at the carmaker in 2018 as the third CEO since the Dieselgate emissions scandal broke in 2015, has been repeatedly criticised for his demanding management style as he seeks to overhaul the company.
His current contract, extended early during the summer, runs until October 2025.
Diess, 63, has been singling out Tesla's success as a benchmark for Volkswagen, hailing the efficiency and lean management of entrepreneur Elon Musk's company, which has drawn the ire of labour representatives who fear this will lead to major job cuts.
Underscoring his admiration for Musk's achievements, Diess even invited him to address 200 VW executives via a video call during a recent company meeting.  read more 
When Volkswagen released lower-than-expected third-quarter results last week, Diess said that headcount reduction was needed to make Volkswagen competitive with regard to fast growing EV rivals.",3
1868,"THE NAME of Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa (New Flower), belies its frequent violent changes of government in recent decades. The Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown and later strangled. Mengistu Haile Mariam, a Marxist despot, shot his way to power, imposed a “red terror” and was later ousted by a rebel coalition led by Tigrayans. Now history is rhyming.
Once more the federal government is fighting rebels from Tigray. Once more it has deliberately blocked food and medicine from entering this northern region, where 400,000 people are now starving and millions are at risk. Once more the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) is marching on Addis Ababa. In a rapid offensive it has captured towns straddling the roads north of the capital. An allied band, which claims to represent the Oromos, Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, threatens to cut roads leading to the city from the south. It says it, too, is marching on Addis Ababa.

The last time Addis Ababa fell, in 1991, a bloodbath was somehow averted. Peace talks were held in London. The dictator fled abroad. What fighting there was in the capital lasted only a few hours. This time, however, it is far from clear that the civil war will end so quietly.
The authorities in Addis Ababa have called on its 5m residents to organise themselves in blocks and defend the city. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, shows no sign of agreeing to talks. On November 3rd, at a ceremony marking the start of the war a year ago, Abiy told army officers that “Ethiopia will defeat all her enemies with the blood and bones of her children and live for ever in glory.” He has declared a state of emergency, giving his forces sweeping powers to detain anyone suspected of “terrorist” ties. The police and army are interpreting this as an order to round up all ethnic Tigrayans in the capital. Within hours of the proclamation, Tigrayans were grabbed and shoved in warehouses or old factories. Even doctors and nurses were dragged out of hospitals if they were Tigrayan.
Worse is possible. For months Abiy has used dehumanising language for his foes, calling the TPLF a “cancer” and a “weed” that must be trampled. His office insists that he means only the armed group, not all Tigrayans. But some of his followers may make no such distinction. In other parts of Ethiopia both sides have committed war crimes, some of them ethnically targeted. Now Abiy is urging all citizens to “expose” the agent who “stays in our midst and works for our enemy”. In a post on Facebook that the social-media company has since removed for violating its policies against inciting violence, he urged people to take up “whatever weapon” to “bury the terrorist TPLF”. Ethiopia is a fragile federation of more than 80 ethnic groups. If widespread ethnic killings were to start, it could break up.
Western governments are trying to prevent Africa’s second-most-populous country from going the way of Yugoslavia. Jeffrey Feltman, America’s senior diplomat for the Horn of Africa, is understood to be heading to Addis Ababa to meet Abiy. He may find the conversation difficult. Foreigners who have spoken with Abiy in recent months describe him exuding a messianic zeal. “He can’t understand why the West is not supporting him in fighting the forces of darkness,” says one diplomat, adding that Abiy constantly changed the subject from ending the conflict to “his mission to deliver Ethiopians from the darkness and into the light”.
Abiy has not so far been swayed by sanctions, such as the EU cutting aid or America suspending Ethiopia’s preferential access to its market. The TPLF, which believes its forces are on the brink of victory, has also made little effort to talk. Diplomats believe it may be holding back from an immediate attack on the capital so as to give Abiy a chance to give up and escape.
No one knows whether catastrophe can be averted. But outside powers should try, with a determined mix of pressure and persuasion. The African Union should suspend Ethiopia’s membership until it lifts its embargo on aid entering Tigray, while also making clear that it would not recognise a TPLF government that seized power by force. The UN Security Council should impose an arms embargo, and try to coax both sides to negotiate. Russia and China, which have resisted applying much pressure, should know that they have more to lose than gain from a chaotic break-up of Ethiopia. The fate of a country of 115m people hangs in the balance. The world should not abandon it. ■",2
1869,"THERE IS NO doubt about the biggest election story of the week: the Social Democrats’ surge in the polls. On August 24th Forsa, a pollster, put the centre-left SPD on 23%, a percentage point ahead of its senior coalition partner, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU). The lead may be slight, but it’s the first time in 15 years that the SPD has had its nose in front—and German papers are calling this a “political earthquake”. Two days later Civey, another pollster, placed the CDU/CSU and the SPD level, on 22%—but the conservatives were estimated to be losing ground while the Social Democrats are gaining.

The SPD’s climb has shortened the odds against Olaf Scholz, the party’s candidate, succeeding Angela Merkel in the chancellery. (Our election model gives the Social Democrats a one-in-three chance of becoming the largest party in the Bundestag.) Mr Scholz, who used to run the city-state of Hamburg, may not appeal to the left of his own party, and his flinty style doesn’t exactly set the pulse racing, but as federal finance minister he has done little to frighten conservative voters. That is further bad news for the CDU’s Armin Laschet, whose lacklustre performance does as much to explain the centre-right’s droop as any charm of Mr Scholz’s. On Sunday Mr Laschet has a chance to redeem himself in the first of several television debates among the main candidates. He can’t afford to fluff it.

As in many other Western countries, the debacle in Afghanistan—from where the last German evacuation flight left on August 26th—has been making grim headlines. It is seeping into the election campaign too. Norbert Röttgen, head of the Bundestag’s foreign-affairs committee and a former contender for the CDU leadership, called it “a human drama, a political catastrophe, a moral defeat of the West”. CDU politicians are calling for the resignation of Heiko Mass, the foreign minister, a Social Democrat who in June rejected suggestions that the Taliban were poised to seize control of Afghanistan. The Süddeutsche Zeitung calls Mr Maas “the face of the failure”. Mr Maas refuses to quit. “We all misread the situation,” he said.

Because of the pandemic, more German voters than ever will vote by mail, says Deutsche Post, the national postal service. But the far-right AfD wants to stop voters casting their ballots that way: it’s making its case with a social-media campaign and flyers. The party’s leaders admire Donald Trump, who also railed against postal votes in last year’s American presidential election (and after it). Like Mr Trump, its leaders claim, with no credible evidence, that the election might be manipulated. It is not transparent and it is not safe, nor free, nor secret, they say. In reality, they fret they will do poorly if many voters cast their ballot by mail. But maybe the AfD (which has no chance of governing) should worry less than the CDU/CSU (which wants to carry on doing so). The more votes are cast early by post, the worse for parties now struggling in the polls.

Any prize for the week’s most cringeworthy moment has to go to the Greens. The party released a toe-curling campaign commercial based on “Kein Schöner Land in dieser Zeit” (“There is no country more beautiful than ours at this time”), a popular campfire song. In the one-minute video old ladies, footballers, a farmer, a bus driver, an immigrant, a priest and a group of middle-aged retirees barbecuing in the back garden sing along (mostly out of tune), interspersed with a picture of bees feasting on a flower. The spot was ridiculed by many—including some of the Greens’ own candidates. “Vote for the Greens: for consistent climate protection and so we stop singing,” tweeted Jakob Basel, who is standing for the Bundestag in Rendsburg-Eckernförde, in Schleswig-Holstein. The commercial is aimed at older voters, but Jan Böhmermann, a comedian, may be closer to the truth. “Maybe the Greens actually don’t WANT to get elected!?” he tweeted. Given the party’s slide from first place in early May to third now, he could be onto something.",2
1870,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3
1871,"WITHIN HOURS of the publication of a New York Post article on October 14th, Twitter users began receiving strange messages. If they tried to share the story—a dubious “exposé” of emails supposedly from the laptop of Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential nominee—they were told that their tweet could not be sent, as the link had been identified as harmful. Many Facebook users were not seeing the story at all: the social network had demoted it in the news feed of its 2.7bn users while its fact-checkers reviewed it.
If the companies had hoped that by burying or blocking the story they would stop people from reading it, the bet did not pay off. The article ended up being the most-discussed story of the week on both platforms—and the second-most talked-about story was the fact that the social networks had tried to block it. The Post called it an act of modern totalitarianism, carried out “not [by] men in darkened cells driving screws under the fingernails of dissidents, but Silicon Valley dweebs.” Republican senators vowed to extract testimony on anticonservative bias from Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, the dweebs-in-chief of, respectively, Facebook and Twitter.

The tale sums up the problem that social networks are encountering wherever they operate. They set out to be neutral platforms, letting users provide the content and keeping their hands off editorial decisions. Twitter executives used to joke that they were “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party”. Yet as they have become more active at algorithmically ranking the content that users upload, and moderating the undesirable stuff, they have edged towards being something more like publishers. Mr Zuckerberg says he does not want to be an “arbiter of truth”. The Post episode fed the suspicion of many that, willingly or not, that is precisely what he is becoming.
America’s fractious election campaign has only made more urgent the need to answer the unresolved questions about free expression online. What speech should be allowed? And who should decide? Rasmus Nielsen of the Reuters Institute at Oxford University describes this as a “constitutional moment” for how to regulate the private infrastructure that has come to support free expression around the world.

Social networks have been on the mother of all clean-ups. Facebook’s removal of hate speech has risen tenfold in two years (see chart 1). It disables some 17m fake accounts every single day, more than twice the number three years ago. YouTube, a video platform owned by Google with about 2bn monthly users, removed 11.4m videos in the past quarter, along with 2.1bn user comments, up from just 166m comments in the second quarter of 2018. Twitter, with a smaller base of about 350m users, removed 2.9m tweets in the second half of last year, more than double the amount a year earlier. TikTok, a Chinese short-video upstart, removed 105m clips in the first half of this year, twice as many as in the previous six months (a jump partly explained by the firm’s growth).
Artificial intelligence has helped to make such a clean-up possible. Most offending content is taken down before any user has had a chance to flag it. Some lends itself readily to policing with machines: more than 99% of the child-nudity posts Facebook takes down are removed before anyone has reported them, but most of the bullying or harassment is flagged by users rather than robots. Two years ago Facebook’s AI removed a post referring to “merciless Indian Savages”, before human moderators realised it was a quote from the Declaration of Independence. Facebook now employs about 15,000 people to moderate content. In May the company agreed to pay $52m to 11,250 moderators who developed post-traumatic stress disorder from looking at the worst of the internet.
Discussions about free speech that may once have seemed abstract have become all too practical—the murder of Samuel Paty near Paris last week being the latest shocking reminder. Social networks tightened their policies on terrorism after Islamist attacks in Europe in 2015 and an anti-Muslim rampage in New Zealand last year, which was live-streamed on Facebook and shared on YouTube. The American election and Brexit referendum of 2016 forced them to think again about political communication. Twitter banned all political ads last year, and Facebook and Google have said they will ban them around the time of this year’s election on November 3rd.
The companies have also improved their scrutiny of far-flung countries, after criticism of their earlier negligence in places such as Myanmar, where Facebook played a “determining role” in the violence against Rohingya Muslims, according to the UN (see article). This week Facebook announced that it had hired more content-reviewers fluent in Swahili, Amharic, Zulu, Somali, Oromo and Hausa, ahead of African elections. Its AI is learning new languages, and hoovering up rule-breaking content as it does so.
The room where it happens
Some tech bosses have been rethinking their approach to the trade-offs between free expression and safety. Last October, in a speech at Georgetown University, Mr Zuckerberg made a full-throated defence of free speech, warning: “More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that’s dangerous.” Yet this year, as misinformation about covid-19 flourished, Facebook took a harder line on fake news about health, including banning anti-vaccination ads. And this month it banned both Holocaust denial and groups promoting QAnon, a crackpot conspiracy.
The pressure from the media is to “remove more, remove more, remove more”, says one senior tech executive. But in some quarters unease is growing that the firms are removing too much. In America this criticism comes mostly from the right, which sees Silicon Valley as a nest of liberals. It is one thing to zap content from racists and Russian trolls; it is another to block the New York Post, one of America’s highest-circulation newspapers, founded by Alexander Hamilton (who admittedly might not have approved of its current incarnation, under Rupert Murdoch).
Elsewhere, liberals worry that whistle-blowing content is being wrongly taken down. YouTube removed footage from users in Syria that it deemed to break its guidelines on violence, but which was also potential evidence of war crimes. Until last year TikTok’s guidelines banned criticism of systems of government and “distortion” of historical events including the massacre near Tiananmen Square.
Where both camps agree is in their unease that it is falling to social networks to decide what speech is acceptable. As private companies they can set their own rules about what to publish (within the confines of the laws of countries where they operate). But they have come to play a big role in public life. Mr Zuckerberg himself compares Facebook to a “town square”.
Rival social networks promising truly free speech have struggled to overcome the network effects enjoyed by the incumbents. One, Gab, attracted neo-Nazis. Another, Parler, has been promoted by some Republican politicians but so far failed to take off. (It is also grappling with free-speech dilemmas of its own, reluctantly laying down rules including no sending of photos of fecal matter.) Outside China, where Facebook does not operate, four out of ten people worldwide use the platform; WhatsApp and Instagram, which it also owns, have another 3bn or so accounts between them. “Frankly, I don’t think we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either,” Mr Zuckerberg said in his Georgetown speech.
Say no to this
Bill Clinton once said that attempting to regulate the internet, with its millions of different sites, would be “like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall”. But the concentration of the social-media market around a few companies has made the job easier.

Twitter has faced steep growth in the number of legal requests for content removal, from individuals as well as governments (see chart 2). Last year Google received 30,000 requests from governments to remove pieces of content, up from a couple of thousand requests ten years ago (see chart 3). And Facebook took down 33,600 pieces of content in response to legal requests. They included a Photoshopped picture of President Emmanuel Macron in pink underwear, which French police wanted removed because it broke a law from 1881 restricting press freedom.

In America the government is prevented from meddling too much with online speech by the First Amendment. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives online platforms further protection, exempting them from liability for the content they publish. But carve-outs to this exemption are growing. Firms cannot avoid responsibility for copyright infringements, posts that break federal criminal law, or which enable sex trafficking. The latter exemption, made in 2018, had an impact on speech that was greater than its drafting implied: sites including Tumblr and Craigslist concluded that, rather than risk prosecution, they would stop publishing adult material of all sorts.
In Europe regulation has gone further. In 2014 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) established the “right to be forgotten” when it found in favour of a Spanish man who wanted Google to remove old references to his history of indebtedness. Since then Google has fielded requests for about half a million URLs to be removed each year, and granted about half of them. Last year the ECJ ruled that European countries could order Facebook to remove content worldwide, not just for users within their borders. The European Audiovisual Media Services Directive requires online video services to take “appropriate measures” to protect viewers from harmful or illegal content, including setting up age checks. The European Commission is to publish a Digital Services Act, expected to impose further obligations on internet companies.
National governments have also set their own rules, notably Germany, whose Network Enforcement Act of 2017 threatens platforms with fines of up to €50m ($60m) if they fail to take down illegal content within 24 hours of notification. In response Facebook opened a new moderation centre in Germany. The trouble with privatising the enforcement of the law in this way, points out Mr Nielsen, is that the companies have big incentives to err on the side of caution. A judge may use discretion to ignore rules on speech that are seldom applied (such as a German law that until recently banned insulting a foreign head of state). But a social-media company has no reason to risk ignoring a law.
Who tells your story
Some governments are leaning on social networks to remove content that may be legal. The social-media platforms have their own rules that go further than most governments’. A ban on material that could interfere with “civic integrity” may sound like something from communist China; it is actually in Twitter’s rules. London’s Metropolitan Police has a unit that scours platforms for terrorism-related content, which it “requests” be taken down for breaching the platform’s terms of service—even though the material may not break any law.
“Authoritarian governments are taking cues from the loose regulatory talk among democracies,” writes David Kaye, a former UN special rapporteur on free expression. Last year Singapore passed what it described as an anti-fake-news law, banning the online publication of lies that could harm the public interest. Thailand has enforced its lèse-majesté laws online, in August ordering Facebook to block a critical group called Royalist Marketplace, which with more than 1m members was one of the largest on the platform. (Facebook complied, but is suing the Thai government for breaking human-rights law.)
If neither governments nor executives make reliable custodians of free speech, what can be done to keep the internet a tolerable place while protecting freedom of expression? An increasingly common answer in Silicon Valley is to draw a distinction between freedom of speech and “freedom of reach”: leave posts up, but make them less visible and viral.
Last year YouTube changed its algorithm so that videos that were borderline cases for deletion were recommended less often. After the bombings of churches and hotels in Sri Lanka at Easter in 2019, Facebook prevented the resharing of posts by friends of friends, to stop inflammatory content travelling too far or fast; this rule is in place in Ethiopia and Myanmar. Twitter has tried to stop people from mindlessly sharing fake news by prompting them to read articles before they retweet them. Platforms are adding more labels to content, warning users that it is misleading.

Another idea gaining momentum is that firms should make their data available for audit just as listed companies must open up their accounts. Their internal processes could also be more transparent. At Facebook there is an odd tension between its earnest approach to policymaking, with fortnightly “mini-legislative sessions”, and the fact that every month Mr Zuckerberg personally takes a handful of the hardest decisions on content moderation. Treating the big calls as “corner-office decisions” is a mistake, believes Mr Kaye: better for companies to say, “We have these rules, we’re going to apply them neutrally. And we don’t want that process to be corrupted by political pressure.”
Facebook took a step towards such a system on October 22nd with the launch of its Oversight Board, a watchdog made up of 20 members of the great and good who will scrutinise its moderation decisions and issue binding rulings. The board’s scope is narrower than some had hoped. It can consider only whether deleted posts should be reinstated. It merely applies Facebook’s rules, rather than setting them. It cannot consider posts that have been algorithmically demoted, as opposed to deleted. So some of the most prominent recent controversies—Facebook’s decision to leave up a contentious post by Donald Trump, its removal of QAnon, its reversal on Holocaust denial and its demotion of the Post story—are outside the board’s jurisdiction.
History has its eyes on you
Yet as Alan Rusbridger, a former Guardian editor and member of the new board, puts it, it is a “revolutionary thought”. “A company that has notoriously been very reluctant to surrender control on anything has handed over…the power to make some pretty consequential decisions on its behalf,” he says. He hopes the board will get more powers over time. Facebook says this is premature. But Sir Nick Clegg, its head of global affairs, hopes the board’s remit might one day expand to consider cases submitted by other social networks.
Others have similar ideas. Article 19, a free-speech lobby group, has suggested that platforms could outsource their moderation decisions to non-governmental “social-media councils”, something like the press watchdogs that in many countries hold newspapers to a voluntary code.
For now, the social networks have to get through perhaps the hardest fortnight in their short history. They face the possibility of having to deploy content-moderation tools developed for fragile, emerging democracies in their home country. Facebook removed 120,000 pieces of content aimed at voter suppression in America in the past quarter. The New York Post affair does not bode well for how the companies might handle the fallout from a contested election. “When they appeared to depart from their policies they opened themselves up to the very charges of bias that followed,” says Evelyn Douek of Harvard Law School. As the election approaches, they need to “tie themselves to a mast” of clear rules, she says. A storm is coming. ■
Correction (October 27th 2020): An earlier version of this story said that Facebook employed 35,000 people to moderate content. That is the number of people it has working in safety and security; about 15,000 of them are moderators. Sorry.",2
