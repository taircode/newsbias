1497,"THE PAST year of lockdowns and travel restrictions has been terrible for migrants. In the first six months of 2020 members of the OECD, a club mainly of rich countries, issued half as many residence permits as they did the year before, a record decline. But one country is determined to buck the trend. In October Canada’s government said it hoped to admit 1.2m new residents from 2021 to 2023, equivalent to 3% of the population. The targets for this year and next are a total of 100,000 higher than originally planned.
Even among high-immigration countries, Canada stands out. Australia has kept its annual immigration target steady at 160,000. Employers in New Zealand should give priority to training people already in the country, says its immigration minister. Canada, by contrast, is gung-ho. Immigration is “a key element” of Canada’s economic recovery and its long-term prosperity, says Marco Mendicino, the minister in charge of it. Without it, the country will age. Within 15 years the ratio of workers to pensioners will fall from three to two.

The pandemic has not just sharpened Canada’s zeal to import foreign talent. It is also changing the government’s idea of what talent means. On April 14th Mr Mendicino announced that Canada would open pathways to permanent residence for 90,000 people with temporary permission to stay. Most are workers in health care and other “essential occupations”, which can range from lorry drivers to bricklayers. The rest are graduates of Canadian universities. That weakens a longstanding distinction between two types of foreigners: “permanent residents”, most of whom eventually become citizens, and people entitled to work or study in Canada but who are eventually expected to leave.
Temporary residents are vital to the economy. Canada admits more of them than the permanent sort (see chart). The country has 1.6m non-permanent residents, estimates Syed Hussan of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, a pressure group. In 2018 700,000 foreign students spent C$22.3bn ($18bn), the equivalent of 1% of GDP. Other transient types staff care homes and harvest crops as well as doing jobs that require more education. Seasonal farm workers come to Canada for eight-month stints for an average of 10-15 years, says Mr Hussan.

But temporary status has a dark side. Many workers have permits that oblige them to work for a particular employer, which makes them vulnerable to abuse. Last year 2,000 agricultural workers caught covid-19 in Ontario, according to Mr Hussan, after they were confined to the farms where they worked. Even students can suffer. Some who work as low-paid delivery people exhaust themselves competing to be named “managers”, an often spurious title that improves their chances of getting permanent residency. Worst off are undocumented foreigners, many of whom have overstayed their permission to remain in Canada, and whose numbers are thought to be growing. Most have no entitlement to health care or education.
Canada is choosy about who can stay. Most offers go to “economic-class” migrants on the basis of their ranking in a points system that scores for education, fluency in English or French, their profession and offers of a job in Canada. The country’s foreign-born population is the best-educated in the OECD. Between 2021 and 2023 Canada also plans to admit as permanent residents roughly 312,000 relatives of new migrants or people already in the country and 181,000 refugees.
Tales of taxi-driving doctors prompted Canada to tweak the points system to admit more people that employers want to hire. But it still gives too much weight to credentials, many experts think. And the pandemic taught Canadians the value of workers with less schooling. “They go out, risk their lives, potentially contracting the virus...so we have some food on the table,“ says Harald Bauder at Ryerson University.
Before the pandemic the government had begun to give temporary migrants more chances to settle down. Since 2008 it has offered permanent residency to workers with experience in the country, provided they are skilled and speak one of its languages. Under pilot schemes it also gives 5,500 residency permits a year to care workers and 2,750 to agricultural workers (though not seasonal ones). But now the government is becoming more flexible. In February it invited 27,000 people in the country to apply for permanent residency under its “Express Entry” programme for economic migrants. To do so it cut the number of points needed to qualify from an average of 461 to 75, the lowest ever.
The flow of migration is likely to return to normal by early next year. But the shift towards what Mr Mendicino calls “a fast, innovative and inclusive pathway to permanent residence” may last. Some immigration advocates want the government to go much further. Jenna Hennebry of Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, points out that workers who take Mr Mendicino’s new pathways will still have to speak decent English or French. She fears they are a “fleeting move of convenience” to meet the new targets.
Even so, these changes will transform many a life. Carla Martínez, who arrived from Mexico in 2017, hopes to be among the 30,000 essential workers to get permanent residency under the new scheme. In her first job as a carer she worked “12-14-hour days with no overtime and no weekends”. She later found “the dream family” to work for. But she wants to become a physiotherapist. As a temporary resident she would pay C$90,000 for her training. With permanent status, it would cost just C$15,000. “I wish I could have been doing it by now,” she says. ■
Correction (April 23rd 2021): The original version of this story stated, incorrectly, that most relatives given permanent residency are parents or grandparents of people already in the country. The figures for the number of relatives and refugees have been slightly revised.",1
1498,"FEW IN BANGLADESH would deny that their country has had remarkable success at getting kids into classrooms. Four decades ago less than a third of children finished primary school. Today, 80% do. Before the pandemic, more Bangladeshi girls than boys attended high school. In India and Pakistan, the reverse is true.
Improving the quality of education has proved trickier. More than half of Bangladeshi ten-year-olds in school are not proficient in reading, according to the World Bank, and more than a quarter of those aged between 15 to 24 are not in education, employment or training. A year and a half of pandemic-related school closures have made matters worse.

In some respects, unimpressive outcomes have not held back Bangladesh. The economy has been growing at an annual rate of 6% for the past decade, reaching 8% before the pandemic. The two main drivers of growth, the garment industry and remittances from overseas Bangladeshi workers, have boomed. But that is because labour is plentiful and cheap, not because it is skilled. Bangladeshi labourers in the Gulf often earn less than their Indian brethren. Garment workers in Dhaka, the capital, toil for lower wages than rivals in China.
Sustaining growth will rely on moving from cheap to skilled labour, says Hossain Zillur Rahman of the Power and Participation Research Centre, a think-tank in Dhaka. “Those skills need to be created now,” he says. The government is shaking up the curriculum as a way to achieve that. The plans, which are due to be implemented by 2025, focus on shifting away from mindlessly memorising textbooks and regurgitating them during exams and towards building useful skills. All exams will be scrapped until third grade. Year-end public exams, which start in secondary school, will wait until tenth grade. Before that, students will be assessed on their knowledge and ability throughout the year.
The new curriculum, which comes after years of consultation, including with employers and workers, is designed to address the mismatch between education and the skills required in the economy, says Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, the deputy minister for education. A choice of two vocational subjects from such options as woodwork, graphic design, car mechanics, child care and plumbing will be mandatory for high-schoolers. The government also plans to open more technical universities.
Though many education experts are in favour of the change, some worry parts of it amount to trying to run before learning to walk. How can coding be taught well when “we cannot ensure numeracy and literacy”, asks Niaz Asadullah, an economist who focuses on education inequality at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. Moreover, he says, tens of thousands of madrasas, which are unaffected by the changes, have no government oversight and teach little beyond the Koran.
Nor does changing the curriculum solve many of the other problems underlying Bangladesh’s poor learning outcomes, says Mr Asadullah. Teachers are poorly paid, inadequately trained and too few in number. Bangladesh has among the largest class sizes in the region, with one teacher to 45 pupils in secondary school.
Worse, the system is riddled with corruption. Many teachers bribe their way into staying in cities, ensuring that remote regions get fewer teachers. Appointments at all levels are often based on political influence or bribery, according to Transparency International, an advocacy group. Certificates are handed out on a similar basis. The bribe needed to secure a head-teacher job can be 1m taka ($11,660).
Public funds flow less easily. At 2.1% of GDP, Bangladesh spends less on education than any other South Asian country, and falls well short of the 4-6% recommended by UNESCO, the UN body responsible for education among other things. Mr Chowdhury says that a chunk of education spending comes from different ministries, and so is unaccounted for in this figure.
As a result of all this, many of the curriculum changes introduced over the past decade are yet to be implemented. The recently announced reforms are “on the positive trend”, says Mr Rahman. But only if they actually happen.■",1
1499,"LAURENT FRAT is standing on top of a ridge line in the French alps, preparing to leap down to the valley below. If something goes wrong, he will die. “If I can’t find the landing area it will find me,” he jokes. He claims not to be nervous, although he admits that he tries not to think about his family before he jumps. After checking that the photographer is ready, he is off, arms outstretched, head forward, leaping into the void.
As the air rushes into his nylon suit, it gives him a bit of lift, allowing him to feel as if he is flying (in reality, he is merely falling with style). He will descend 1,500 metres in around a minute before opening a parachute. While flying, he says, he feels “almost invincible”. For a minute or two he feels a sense of freedom that cannot be imagined otherwise: “You think about where you want to go and you go there.” For that minute of invincibility, Mr Frat has risked his life over a thousand times.

Mr Frat is a wingsuit BASE jumper. He jumps from cliffs, bridges and the like (BASE stands for building, antenna, span and earth) while wearing a “wingsuit”—a sort of nylon flying-squirrel get-up. The sport is among the most dangerous recreational activities known to man. Although no reliable figures are kept, more than 300 BASE jumpers have died in the past two decades. As the sport has grown, so has the number of deaths. In the town of Chamonix, though not the area around it, wingsuiting was banned in 2016 after five people died in the space of a few months. They included a Russian who failed to open his parachute and crashed into a building.
Yet the sport is surprisingly popular. Hike in the mountains around Chamonix on a clear, windless day and you are almost as likely to encounter somebody walking to an “exit point” with a parachute as you are to find rock climbers or picnickers. Open canopies are a common sight along certain roads. On a good day, a wingsuiter might make three or four jumps. It is another way to pass the hours; another thing to buy gear for; another way to bond with pals. It just entails a higher chance of becoming what some wingsuiters call a “meat missile”.

This past year, thanks to covid-19, humans have faced a radical increase in risk. Governments and individuals have decided to make huge personal and financial sacrifices to protect people from an increased chance of death. Once-unremarkable activities, such as eating at a restaurant or visiting your grandchildren, are suddenly fraught with the fear of death. The response to the pandemic has shown the extent to which humans are risk-averse—it has proved quite how far they are willing to go to avoid a chance of dying prematurely. So why would anyone jump off a cliff, and willingly expose themselves to it?
Risk-taking used to be easier to explain. Annie Edson Taylor was a 63-year-old schoolteacher when she decided to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901. She hoped to sell a book about the exploit. Evel Knievel jumped motorbikes over ramps, and eventually over a canyon in Idaho, to sell tickets to his shows. But these days there is less money in daredevilry. Red Bull, an energy-drinks company, sponsors many daredevils, but chafes at the suggestion it encourages anything dangerous. In any case its sponsorship is not that generous. Felix Baumgartner, who parachuted from a balloon at an altitude of 39km wearing a Red Bull helmet in 2012, made very little money from it.
Social networks such as Instagram and TikTok have made it possible for anyone to broadcast his or her dangerous exploits. On YouTube it is easy to find footage of wingsuit BASE jumpers “proximity flying” close to rocks (an especially dangerous niche of the sport) and climbers without ropes on sheer faces. Some clips show people taking even more ludicrous risks. Young Russian men dangle from antennae, thousands of feet up, without so much as a rope.
A fickle food
But any notoriety thus acquired is fleeting. Mr Baumgartner made international headlines; TikTok and YouTube daredevils do not, except when they die. In any case, many people happily do their stunts out of the view of cameras. Mr Frat, whose wife also BASE jumps, admits that he likes the reaction he gets talking about his hobby at parties. But he is not interested in becoming a superstar daredevil, and shies away from the extremely dangerous jumps that he would need to do to achieve that. He usually jumps without a helmet camera.

What he does is nonetheless very risky, as he knows. “Realistically”, says Mr Frat, “there is no safe wingsuit BASE jumping. There is no magic formula for staying safe.” He has made over 1,000 jumps without serious injury but he points out that nobody has made 10,000 yet. Anything—a slip on the cliff, an equipment failure, a miscalculation of the flight path—might make a jump his last.
Yet it is not the adrenalin rush of evading death that draws him in. “There is a bit of a misconception that we are all adrenalin junkies,” he says. In fact, he says he tries to “down-regulate” adrenalin. A pumping heart, a rush of fight-or-flight reaction, is not thrilling but terrifying. For Mr Frat, it is the joy and control of BASE jumping that is worth the risk that he will die.

According to Andreas Wilke, an evolutionary psychologist at Clarkson University in New York, some risk-takers are just foolish. Adolescent males especially, do silly things to show off. One study, in which researchers made young men wear VR goggles and walk across a simulated rickety bridge, found that they tended to cross faster in the presence of female spectators. Mr Wilke suggests that physical risk-taking sends a signal to a potential mate that the risk-taker is fit. (Lest this encourage more men to hurl themselves off cliffs, the research also shows that the value of this can be overstated: men overestimate the extent to which females value their engaging in non-heroic risk-taking, such as bungee jumping or risky sports, says a 2005 study by G. William Farthing, then of the University of Maine.)
BASE jumping does not conform to the pattern of youthful exuberance. The bulk of wingsuiters, as well as free solo climbers, extreme skiers and the like, are indeed men. But they tend to be in their 30s and 40s, possibly because learning to BASE jump is expensive. Many, such as Mr Frat, come across more like monks than hotheads. Before leaping from cliffs they train a good deal, by leaping from aeroplanes. Mr Frat studies maps and carries a laser rangefinder to scope out new cliffs. He studies the deaths of other wingsuiters, trying to understand where they went wrong. He carries a checklist: if a jump has too many sketchy parts, he will walk down the mountain again, even if his friends jump. He says if he dies, he would prefer it to be in a way that other wingsuiters who read the reports would not think that he had made a careless error.
People’s appetite for risk appears to be domain specific. People who enjoy jumping off cliffs will not necessarily be keen to put their money into risky investments, or take risks in their relationships. Even within seemingly similar domains, appetites to risk vary. Financial investment can look rather like gambling, but Mr Wilke’s research shows that professional investors perceive gambling as far riskier than most people do. Put into a Las Vegas casino, hedge-fund managers are more likely to behave like the characters in “The Big Short”—who forsake the card tables to research their investment positions—than they are like those of “The Wolf of Wall Street”, who gamble “like degenerates”.
According to Mr Wilke, what varies is not so much people’s appetite for risk so much as their assessment of it. Wingsuit jumpers and climbers recognise the dangers of what they do, but they trust in their abilities to mitigate the risks, and value the rewards highly. “You do the kind of things you’re not afraid of,” he says. That applies even to wingsuiters. Steph Davis, an American climber and another wingsuit BASE jumper, says that people who take the sorts of risks she takes—climbing a sheer mountain face without ropes, for example—do not see it as scary in the way outsiders do. She reckons her decisions at the top of a mountain are “often very conservative”. In her life outside BASE jumping and climbing, she says she is hardly frivolous. She is careful with money, and would not gamble, for instance. But just as gambling seems less risky if you have plenty of money to lose, so BASE jumping is less risky if you have trained, she says. “It’s a question of how much cushion you have.”

Even Ms Davis changed her behaviour in response to covid-19. She lives in Moab, a small, sporty town in Utah, where the local economy shut down in case there was a surge of infections. As the virus spread through America last spring, she quit BASE jumping. With so many people making economic sacrifices to stop the local hospital from being overwhelmed, “I thought it would be a little bit inappropriate to get hurt,” she says.
To know what life is worth
But when summer arrived and the virus seemed to have receded, she went back to the mountains. In the end, wingsuiters like Ms Davis and Mr Frat think that risk is a necessary part of life. “I don’t think that we have evolved to live the way we’re living right now,” suggests Ms Davis. “We have evolved to deal with natural stress. People had to hunt for food, find shelter, defend themselves against threats—taking decisive actions, moving your body,” she says. In general we may try to minimise risk. Yet if we took no risks, and never did anything reckless, we would live less happy lives.
Ms Davis’s hobby has cost her dearly. In 2013 her husband, Mario Richard, another wingsuiter, was killed in a jump in Italy. She briefly quit BASE jumping then. But eventually she decided she did not want simply to endure life—she wanted to enjoy it. Four months later, on New Year’s Eve, she headed to another cliff in Arizona that the pair had previously jumped together on New Year’s Eve before. She was scared, but when she pushed off, she felt a sense of release. “There is no way to avoid risk in life,” she later said. “The real risk is in making your life small.” The coronavirus has shown how interdependent people are. If you catch a deadly virus, you endanger not just yourself but others. But humans crave freedom, not just security. When you jump off a cliff you can believe, if only for a minute or two, that you are on your own. ■

1500,"ON DECEMBER 23rd 1938 Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, a curator at the East London Museum, in South Africa, dropped by her local fish market. While there, she spotted the most beautiful fish she had ever seen. It was pale mauve, nearly two metres long, and had silvery markings. Though she had no inkling at the time, it turned out to be part of a group called the coelacanths, hitherto believed to have died out with the dinosaurs.
This find, called Latimeria chalumnae in Courtenay-Latimer’s honour, showed coelacanths are still very much alive. It was hailed as the most important zoological discovery of the century. Now, work just published in Current Biology by Kélig Mahé of the Fisheries Laboratory, in Boulogne, France, suggests that besides having lasted collectively for more than 400m years, coelacanths also hang around for a long time as individuals. Dr Mahé’s study indicates they have similar lifespans to human beings, putting them among the world’s longest-lived vertebrates.

The excitement at Latimeria’s discovery was not just because of the curiosity of its survival. It was also that coelacanths belong to a group which have lobe-shaped fins of a sort thought to have been precursors to the limbs of terrestrial tetrapods. Many experts have therefore sought to study Latimeria more closely. That is, however, hard. Latimeria is reclusive, nocturnal, lives in depths below 100 metres, and is known only from the south-western Indian Ocean and from a second, smaller population, L. menadoensis, near Manado Tua, an island in Indonesia.

In particular, Dr Mahé wanted to know how long Latimeria lives. Previous work, which looked at annual growth rings in its scales, suggested a maximum of 20 years. That does not square with the animal’s slow metabolism and low fecundity, both traits characteristic of long-lived species.
Rather than using standard microscopes, he and his colleagues employed polarised light to study the scales. This revealed extra growth rings so thin that previous work had missed them. Of 27 individuals studied, six turned out to be in their 60s and one was 84.
This was a finding Dr Mahé and his colleagues had more than half expected. What truly surprised them was a discovery made by looking at two unborn youngsters—for Latimeria females bear live young rather than laying eggs. The fetuses’ scales suggested they were five years old, a remarkably long gestation period given the previous vertebrate record of three-and-a-half years, held by the deep-sea frilled shark.
Though interesting, in some ways Dr Mahé’s discovery is bad news. An already-rare, slow-growing animal with a gestation period of half a decade has just about the most extinction-prone profile it is possible to imagine. Latimeria is legally protected, in as much as such protection pertains at sea, and is not a particular target for fisherfolk. But it is already classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It would be both ironic and tragic if, having survived the asteroid impact 66m years ago that did for the dinosaurs, coelacanths were to disappear for good on humanity’s watch. ■",1
1501,"IN EARLY NOVEMBER justices at India’s Supreme Court turned their attention to an urgent plea. Arnab Goswami, a prominent journalist, had been dragged from his home and hurled into jail. Government ministers decried the arrest as an assault on free speech, demanding that Mr Goswami be granted bail. The hearing was brief. “If we as a constitutional court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will?” proclaimed one judge. That evening Mr Goswami swept out of Mumbai’s Taloja prison into a rapturous crowd. “This is a victory for the people of India!” he crowed.
But was it? To much of India’s commentariat, Mr Goswami’s case represented not a test of freedom so much as a test of power. On its current trajectory, by all evidence (as the chart on the next page illustrates), the world’s largest democracy is headed to a future that is less, not more free.

Mr Goswami is a controversial figure. He has pioneered a style of attack journalism that makes his nightly television programme look like a show trial from China’s Cultural Revolution. Its victims are often critics of government policy. They are typically reduced to a corner box as Mr Goswami swells into a finger-jabbing prosecutor, denouncing them as “antinational” or, worse, an agent of Pakistan.
What landed Mr Goswami in jail was not something he said, though his tirades against the Mumbai police have indeed enraged the local government, which happens to be opposed to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The journalist’s alleged crime involved a big unpaid debt to a decorator, who had left a suicide note blaming him, among others, for his fatal distress. “Abetment” to suicide remains an offence in India. The case had been closed in 2019, when the BJP still wielded power in Mumbai, and its reopening smacked of a vendetta.
So the court’s ruling was not surprising. What shocked was the speed of its intervention. Mr Goswami spent just a week in detention, and his case had hardly reached the lowest rung of courts, yet the country’s topmost judges ignored the court’s backlog of some 60,000 cases to schedule a bail hearing within a day of the anchor’s appeal. This is in a country where prisons hold twice as many inmates awaiting trial, some 330,000 people, as they do convicts.
A majority of these “undertrials” come from minority groups and a quarter have spent more than a year behind bars, reckons Leah Verghese, a law researcher. When Mr Modi clamped direct rule on the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year, thousands of its residents were detained. Out of more than 550 writs of habeas corpus such as Mr Goswami’s that Kashmiris filed, courts have disdained to look at all but a handful.
In the same week that Mr Goswami won his swift reprieve, Father Stan Swamy, an 83-year-old Jesuit priest who has championed rights for tribal peoples and is being held as an alleged Maoist terrorist, made a plea before a lower court. As he suffers from Parkinson’s disease and cannot hold a cup steady, lawyers requested that he be allowed to have a straw in his prison cell. The court postponed the hearing for 20 days.
Even more striking is the courts’ foot-dragging over constitutional questions. In 2017 Mr Modi slipped through parliament a controversial law that created “electoral bonds”, asserting that as a budgetary matter it need not be scrutinised by the upper house, which was not then in BJP control. The Supreme Court still has not examined the constitutionality of this innovation, which allows unlimited, anonymous donations to political parties. Other big questions its judges have yet to take up include the imposition last year of direct rule on Kashmir and some 140 legal petitions against the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019, which by inserting religion as a criterion for citizenship undermines the secular nature of the Indian state.
Sleepwalking into authoritarianism?
Slow, uneven and arbitrary justice are not new to India. Yet its courts have often tried to check executive power. It was a judge’s ruling that Indira Gandhi, perhaps India’s most powerful prime minister, had cheated in an election that prompted her in 1975 to plunge India into a 21-month Emergency, during which she threw opponents in jail and ruled by decree. Legal professionals now liken the current moment to that darkest period for Indian democracy. “This government has done so much damage to personal liberty,” says Ajit Prakash Shah, a former high-court judge. “But the courts, especially the Supreme Court, have watched this indiscriminate and violent trampling of dissent like mute spectators.”
It is not only the courts, alas, that seem eager to stay in step with the government. Many cogs in India’s institutional machinery are not merely complacent, but have grown complicit in a project that threatens to turn the country into a one-party state. At least during the Emergency the threat was clear, says Tarunabh Khaitan, vice-dean of law at Oxford University and author of a paper, “Killing a Constitution with a Thousand Cuts”, that details India’s institutional decay. “What we have now is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” he says. “There is no full-frontal big-ticket attack on democracy, but there are multiple, simultaneous attacks on all fronts…We are sleepwalking into authoritarianism.”
Of the ostensibly independent institutions that are now compliant, India’s police stand out. Despite individually humane and honest officers, the impression Indians hold of the force is that its main purpose is to protect the powerful and persecute the weak. A case in point is the Delhi police’s management of communal riots that racked parts of India’s capital for three days last winter, leaving 53 dead.

Top officers in the force, which before Mr Modi’s government stopped releasing statistics comprised just 2% Muslims in a city with a 13% Muslim minority, had been filmed standing next to a BJP politician at a rally where he threatened to attack protesters, mostly Muslims, holding a peaceful sit-in against the new citizenship law. During the violence, police were filmed throwing rocks and torturing captured Muslim youths. More than two-thirds of those beaten, shot and hacked to death were Muslim. Yet Delhi’s finest have declined to register complaints against BJP members for incitement. Their investigations have focused on a purported Islamist-Marxist conspiracy to foment unrest in order to embarrass Mr Modi at a time when he was hosting President Donald Trump.
An amendment made last year to the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), a draconian law from 1967 that allows the state to label and then ban groups as terrorist, now empowers the government to designate any individual as a terrorist. The state may hold suspects indefinitely with no right of bail, confiscate their property and implicate any associate as an accessory to terrorism. During India’s harsh lockdown to combat covid-19 last spring, police in Delhi quietly rounded up scores of youths alleged to have been involved in the riots, and charged many under the UAPA.
Having enjoyed a stranglehold on the Lok Sabha, parliament’s lower house, for six years, and more recently acquired control of the upper Rajya Sabha, Mr Modi’s government has passed a slew of other laws not only to expand its powers, but to dilute those of potential challengers. One thorn in its side has been a law from 2005 that upholds citizens’ right to obtain information (RTI) from state officials. Seen as a big advance for transparency in a country where mandarins remained aloof and unchallenged, the law created an independent commission to ensure that requests from the public receive a response. The number of requests runs at over 1m a year.

In 2019 the government amended the RTI law. It reduced the tenure and prestige of the role of the commission’s chief. Small wonder that the commission is rejecting a growing number of information requests from the public, citing “insufficient documentation”, even as the number of pending requests has swollen by 50%. Having frequently neglected to fill empty seats on the 11-person commission, the government in October tapped a journalist whose chief works are two books that glowingly laud the “Modi model” of government.
Such appointments are a prerogative of the executive, one that previous leaders have scarcely been shy of exercising. More unusual under Mr Modi has been his almost axiomatic choice of candidates with Hindu-nationalist credentials, often from his home state of Gujarat, and his insistence on inserting loyalists even into institutions that had been seen as sanctuaries from party politics. Twice Mr Modi has replaced heads of the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s respected central bank, after they expressed less than fulsome praise of his economic policies. As India’s latest comptroller and auditor-general (CAG), Mr Modi reportedly passed over seven senior secretaries from within the organisation and instead parachuted in a retired official from Gujarat. The CAG has a record of honest and incisive reporting, but has raised hackles by exposing government waste.
Modi operandi
In 2016 Mr Modi similarly ignored institutional precedent in the Indian army, lifting General Bipin Rawat over the heads of two senior officers to appoint him its top commander. Last year, following a change of rules that stretched the retirement age, General Rawat was promoted to chief of staff of India’s combined forces. The army maintains a tradition of keeping a distance from politics that makes it almost unique in its region, but observers have detected a growing tendency for officers to weigh in publicly on civilian matters, and retired soldiers whisper reproach against officers for “cosying up” to politicians.
Mr Modi has made a spectacle of his own commander-in-chief role as no other recent prime minister, and also minted electoral gold from pre-election military operations. Helpfully, India’s soldiers have remained silent at useful moments, too. As independent satellite evidence emerged this summer showing that Chinese forces had occupied strategic posts in territory claimed by India along remote sections of the countries’ border, the army steadfastly refused to comment on Indian government assertions that no land had been lost.
Even the impartiality of the Election Commission of India (ECI), with a sterling seven-decade record of managing the mammoth logistics of Indian votes, has come under scrutiny. During the 2019 general election, which Mr Modi won by a landslide, his opponents sharply protested when the prime minister and other top BJP leaders repeatedly escaped serious censure for issuing what amounted to communal dog whistles, whereas the ECI promptly sanctioned rival candidates for lesser infractions of its strict codes of conduct. One of the body’s three top commissioners did object, but was overruled. His family subsequently found itself being investigated for alleged tax evasion. The official quit the ECI before the end of his term.
Given that India continues to run elections that by most standards are admirably free and fair, it may seem churlish to voice fears for its democracy. After all, even as America’s presidential count was mired in controversy in early November, election officials in Bihar—India’s poorest state, with a population of 125m—managed to count the votes without a hitch in less than a day. Like so many others in recent years, that election was won fair and square by Mr Modi’s team, in Bihar’s case in alliance with a local party.
The BJP’s supporters scoff at the notion that its rise under Mr Modi has entailed any subversion of institutions or dilution of democracy. Such protests are merely sour grapes, insists Raghavan Jagannathan, editor of Swarajya, a right-wing magazine. “Our democracy is flawed, but it is a work in progress, not just about the people who are currently in power.” Modi apologists point to disturbing trends in states that are not ruled by the BJP. Kerala recently introduced a law to punish “offensive” speech by up to three years in prison (but withdrew it after heavy criticism). In Odisha, a family with connections to the BJP that owns a television channel critical of the local ruling party has found itself buried in lawsuits.
Indian politics is a game of hardball. The BJP is the world’s largest political machine, with many multiples the energy, organisational strength and financial backing of its rivals. It has a strong leader in Mr Modi, and a strong narrative, however unpalatable it is to many. This contrasts sharply with the vacillation of Congress, India’s previous dominant party. Led by a fading Gandhi dynasty, it has slowly disintegrated. Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of 23 Congress leaders who recently petitioned Sonia Gandhi, the party president, for sweeping changes, says its leadership has lost connection with people on the ground. Its organisational structure has “collapsed”. Indians who loathe Mr Modi are often just as disparaging of Rahul Gandhi, the party’s mediocre current figurehead.
Grand designs in Delhi
In the absence of a strong opposition at the centre, the most effective resistance to the BJP’s dominance lies in state capitals, as well in the press and more broadly in civil society. These bastions are all under heavy assault. Mr Modi’s fearsome chief lieutenant, Amit Shah, the home minister, has made no secret of his determination to topple Mamata Banerjee, a staunch and often vitriolic critic who has run the pivotal state of West Bengal since 2011, in state elections next year. Opposition parties holding slim majorities in other big states, including Rajasthan and Maharashtra, are acutely aware of the BJP’s capacity to “persuade” defectors to its side. This recently happened in Madhya Pradesh, where Mr Modi’s party unceremoniously unseated Congress after luring away a chunk of its deputies.

By leaning on the big conglomerates that dominate the mainstream media, by favouring outlets that share its ideology, such as Mr Goswami’s, and by flooding social media with agitprop, the BJP has largely marginalised critical voices in the press. In the past two months, new rules have curtailed the permitted level of foreign investment in online media and placed the entire sector under the authority of the broadcasting ministry. The moves appear to be aimed at getting a grip on one of the main remaining outlets for dissent, say editors at three of India’s increasingly popular news sites. One that specialised in hard-hitting investigative stories, HuffPost India, closed on November 24th.
Compliance regulations regarding foreign donations have already been used to shut down tens of thousands of NGOs. The most recent example is the local chapter of Amnesty International, an advocacy group for human rights. In September the government added onerous filing requirements and rules that forbid larger charities from funding smaller ones.
Mr Khaitan, the Oxford law professor, is not alone in warning that the BJP’s one-sided advantage is subtly changing the nature of India’s game. “We do not have a level playing field any more,” he says. “What we are getting is not quite a one-party state, but certainly a hegemonic state.” The trajectory resembles that in other democracies, such as Hungary, Poland and Turkey, where autocracy is on the rise (see chart).

Mr Modi is now taking a keen interest in reshaping Delhi, India’s capital, in more imperial fashion. Following an opaque and hasty process that to no surprise ended with the choice of Mr Modi’s own favourite architect, a fellow Gujarati, as chief designer, the city’s Central Vista, a 3km-long avenue of lawns not unlike the National Mall in Washington, is going under the knife. It will be flanked by ten giant, identical government office buildings. The project foresees the building of a new, expanded parliament, big enough to seat double the 545 MPs that currently sit in the lower house. The old building will become a “Museum of Democracy”. And, naturally, there will be a bigger, fancier residence and office for the prime minister himself.
Another sign of Mr Modi’s direction of travel can be detected in the differing “read-outs” after his congratulatory phone call to President-elect Joe Biden. Among the things that Mr Biden’s team said the two had discussed was a shared commitment to “strengthening democracy, at home and abroad”. In the version from Mr Modi’s office, that bit was left out. ■",1
1502,"NEW DELHI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - An Indian antitrust investigation into suspected price collusion by some prominent global agricultural firms was triggered by farmers who complained about excessive pricing of imported carrot seeds, documents seen by Reuters showed.
A group representing about 1,500 farmers in the mountainous Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu, a top carrot-growing state in southern India, petitioned the watchdog in 2019 alleging that an ""unfair profit margin"" was being charged on the carrot seeds, the regulatory documents showed.
This is the first time the complaint is coming into public view. It has touched off an investigation that has the potential to affect pricing practices in an Indian vegetable seed market expected to be worth $1.2 billion in five years.
In some instances, the agricultural firms' seeds were allegedly being sold at four times the imported price, according to the documents. The farmers were also denied sale of such seeds in the northern parts of India where they were available at prices up to 50% cheaper, they alleged, according to the documents.
As part of the investigation, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) conducted a multi-city search and seizure operation on Sept. 8 at the local units of Germany's BASF (BASFn.DE), France's Vilmorin & Cie (VILM.PA) and other firms. The watchdog as a policy does not disclose any ongoing cartel investigations.
""There appears to be an understanding/arrangement between the seed importing companies to control the supply of imported variety of carrot seeds and determine their prices,"" the CCI said in May last year in a confidential order, in which it asked its investigation unit to look into the matter.
There ""appears to be a restriction on dealers not to sell to farmers other than those belonging to a particular region,"" and the CCI believed ""seed companies/distributors/dealers are apparently using their market power"" to control demand and supply in the Nilgiris, added the eight-page order.
The subsequent September 2021 raids were conducted at the local units of BASF, Vilmorin's HM Clause, a former distributor entity of Dutch-based Bejo Zaden and some other Indian entities, two people familiar with the operation said.
The investigation could take several months to complete and opens up seed firms and their executives to fines if they are found guilty of violating India's antitrust laws, the sources added.
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
BASF spokesperson Úlia de Domènech said in a statement Nunhems India - its vegetable seeds unit which was raided - was committed to complying with Indian laws and was cooperating with all regulators, including the CCI.
A Bejo India official, who declined to be named, said the company sells seeds at same prices to all distributors and in different geographical regions.
Franck Berger, Vilmorin's head of vegetable seeds, told reporters in France last month five companies were raided in India in the case, adding that HM Clause assisted the authorities.
Spokespersons for Bejo and HM Clause did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
CCI's RAID OPERATION
India's vegetable seed market is set to be worth $1.2 billion by 2026, growing 10% a year since 2020, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence. The country is among the top 15 carrot producers in the world, industry estimates show.
The farmers' 2019 complaint cited an example in which an HM Clause's carrot seed variant was allegedly imported at 7,000 rupees ($93.63) per kilogram and sold at four times the price. A similar margin was charged allegedly on a variant of Bejo's seeds.
The farmers also alleged that when they provided positive feedback on the seeds, company dealers jacked up their prices, which were also different across south and north India.
Ahead of ordering the broader investigation, two CCI officials visited the region last year and interviewed farmers and government officials and collected some seed samples from a laboratory, according to a separate internal CCI report. One farmer during that visit showed the CCI a message on his phone to claim prices of same seeds were different in north and south India, the document stated.
The CCI's confidential order noted that as the same type of carrot seed can be used across India, there was ""no apparent reason"" for selling them at different prices.
During the September raids, data from laptops and smartphones was copied by CCI officials, and some executives were questioned about their practices, the two sources said.
Carrot is a key crop grown in the Nilgiri mountains and R. Rangasamy, president of the complainant farmer group, the Nilgiri Potato & Vegetables Growers Association, told Reuters farmers were suffering due to the high pricing and sale curbs.
""The methodology to fix rates is not transparent ... We are incurring heavy losses because of this randomness,"" he said.",0
1503,"JUST OCCASIONALLY, you can see the tectonic plates of geopolitics shifting in front of your eyes. Suez in 1956, Nixon going to China in 1972 and the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 are among the examples in living memory. The unveiling last week of a trilateral defence pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (introducing the awkward acronym of AUKUS) is providing another of those rare occasions. 
AUKUS envisages a wide range of diplomatic and technological collaboration, from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence, but at its core is an agreement to start consultations to help Australia acquire a fleet of nuclear-propelled (though not nuclear-armed) submarines. One consequence of this is Australia cancelling a contract, worth tens of billions of dollars, signed in 2016 with France for diesel-electric submarines. In announcing AUKUS on September 15th with the prime ministers of Australia and Britain, Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson, President Joe Biden stressed that it was about “investing in our greatest source of strength—our alliances”.  However, America’s oldest ally, France, has reacted with understandable fury. Jean-Yves Le Drian, its foreign minister, called it a “stab in the back”. On September 17th President Emmanuel Macron withdrew France’s ambassadors from Washington and Canberra (though not London). 
The powerful reverberations of AUKUS show what a profound shift it represents. For America it is the most dramatic move yet in its determination to counter what it sees as the growing threat from China, particularly the maritime challenge it poses in the Pacific. Not only is America sharing the crown jewels of military technology, the propulsion plant for nuclear submarines, with an ally for only the second time in 63 years (the other time being with Britain). It is also robustly signalling its long-term commitment to what it calls a “free and open Indo-Pacific”. 

Many countries in the region which share the sense of threat from China welcome that. AUKUS will now provide a potent backdrop for the first in-person meeting of leaders of the Quad—America, Australia, India and Japan—in Washington, DC, on September 24th. Last month, amid a chaotic withdrawal from Kabul, there was talk of America’s lack of staying power and a loss of faith among its allies. For all the anger in Paris, AUKUS changes that narrative. “The larger significance of this is that the United States is doubling down on its allies, and its allies are doubling down on the United States,” says Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney. “Unfortunately, France is collateral damage.”
In Australian eyes the developments that led to AUKUS were largely made in China. It was the heavy-handed pressure that China has applied on Australia, the most striking recent example being the response to its call for an independent investigation into the origins of covid-19, that led to urgent interest in ways to push back. Ditching the submarine contract with France was a bold move. Although the deal with Naval Group, a company in which the French state has a majority stake, had run into difficulties over its escalating costs and delays, and had few friends among politicians or the press, it was nevertheless one of the largest contracts in the history of Australia and was widely thought to be too big to dump. That the government has done so, despite the prospect of hefty penalties, reflects both the scale of its bet on America as an ally and the attractions of the submarine technology it will obtain: far stealthier and with far longer range than the diesel-electric ones.
Britain may be the least important of the AUKUS trio; certainly, its role is belittled in the French decision not to recall its ambassador to London (Mr Le Drian called Britain the “third wheel” in the deal). Even so, for Mr Johnson the pact illustrates his country’s changing role in the world. It conveniently chimes with the post-Brexit effort to promote “Global Britain” (henceforth to be energetically championed by a new foreign secretary, Liz Truss). And it gives substance to the “tilt to the Indo-Pacific” that was embraced in a comprehensive review of foreign and defence policy published in March. 
For the French, too, AUKUS crystallises what they view as profound realities in international relations, notably the idea that Europe needs more “strategic autonomy” so as not to depend excessively on America. However the muted reaction among France’s European partners casts familiar doubt on how serious such autonomy can be. After news of the AUKUS deal emerged, a German official called for “coherence and unity” among Western powers, which he said would require “a lot of effort” to bring about. France has concluded that it will struggle for fair treatment in the face of the reflexes of Anglophone allies to club together (the trilateral deal comes on top of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance that involves the same three countries plus Canada and New Zealand). But French fury, especially against Australia, is also driven by a personal sense of betrayal.
That goes beyond the loss of a giant contract, painful as that is. France sets great store by its role in the Indo-Pacific region, where it keeps some 7,000 troops and has nearly 2m citizens, including in its island territories such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia. It has been assiduously building what it thought was an ever-closer relationship with Australia. As recently as August 30th the communiqué from high-level Australian-French ministerial consultations spoke of “the strength of our strategic partnership” across many areas, and stressed “the importance of the Future Submarine programme”. Yet neither at that summit nor at the many others over the months when AUKUS was in the works was France given any notice of it. The “six months of secrecy” was “quite a performance,” says François Heisbourg, a French foreign-policy expert who through his think-tank had for years been involved in cultivating connections with Australia.
The fallout in France is one of several caveats to what otherwise appears to be a strategic coup for the three partners in AUKUS. The administration’s idea of working together with allies to check China makes sense. But a major split with a key ally—one with serious Indo-Pacific interests—hardly helps. Creative efforts will now be needed from the AUKUS squad to try to mitigate the damage.
Second, there is what this says about American diplomacy. The French were bound to be upset, but the handling of them was graceless. That comes on top of the Biden administration’s poor handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. One example of foreign-policy incompetence looks unfortunate; two in quick succession look like a pattern. That is not a good omen for the management of the relationship with China, which involves elements of military competition, economic laissez-faire and collaboration over, say, climate change and arms control.
Third, American foreign policy has often been criticised, including by Mr Biden, for placing too much emphasis on the military dimension and not enough on diplomacy and other tools. The nuclear-submarine initiative is a big move on the defence front, but China is increasingly powerful in the region on the economic and financial fronts. China responded to AUKUS by criticising its “cold-war mentality”. The next day it applied to join the CPTPP, an 11-country transpacific trade pact that America helped to instigate as a way to limit China’s influence, but then abandoned. 
There is no quick fix for America’s mistakes in economic policy. Indeed, the rivalry between China and America, together with its allies, will play out across many areas over many years. It is the defining geopolitical challenge of the 21st century. And now in AUKUS it has acquired a new landmark.",1
1504,"A bird flu outbreak has been confirmed in Dorset today with officials culling 39 domestic ducks after a case of the 'highly pathogenic' H5N1 strain was found.
The strain of avian influenza was detected at a premises in Southbourne, Bournemouth.
To contain its spread, Government and local health officials are doing door-to-door testing in the area to check for any further cases. 
They have also constructed a 3km temporary exclusion zone to prevent animal movements.
Elsa Hatton, of Southbourne, said a case of the avian influenza H5N1 strain had been found in her flock of 39 domestic ducks. 
The domestic ducks were kept to sell eggs to the local community and have since been culled. 
Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus. 

Bird flu is unique in that it can be transmitted directly from birds to humans. 
There are 15 different strains of the virus. It is the H5N1 strain which is infecting humans and causing high death rates. 
Humans can catch bird flu directly through close contact with live infected birds and those who work with infected chickens are most at risk. 


'We sold eggs to local people for five years in Christchurch and have made many new connections and forged some wonderful friendships through selling eggs here in Southbourne for five years,' she told Dorset Live.
'We are truly heartbroken as ducks are such happy characters and were very much a part of our family.
'We’ll get some more ducks in due course, probably in the Spring.'
Mrs Hatton has shared a tribute to the ducks along with a photo before they were culled. 
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirmed the case in birds at the premises and the area is currently undergoing testing.
Other birds that pose a direct risk will be culled.
A BCP Council spokesperson said: 'Trading Standards Officers from BCP Council are working alongside officers from the Government’s Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) with measures to prevent the spread of the disease. 
'These measures include a cull of the birds who pose a direct risk, as well as further investigation over the weekend into premises in the area who are breeding or keeping birds.
'Please be advised that a 3km Temporary Control Zone has been constructed around an area centred on Castlemain Avenue at this time with regard to animal movements. 
'APHA and BCP Council officers will be knocking on doors in the zone from tomorrow to check for potential further cases. Please note that these officers will be carrying ID.'
Peter Haikin, Regulatory Services Manager, said: 'Avian Influenza predominantly affects only birds and is not considered to be an illness which poses a risk to the general public.' 
All bird keepers in Great Britain are now required by law to undergo certain biosecurity procedures following an outbreak of Avian Flu being declared to help prevent further spread.
Bird flu cases have also been reported in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Essex, Lancashire, North Yorkshire and Derbyshire. 
Last week, people in Lancashire were warned not to pick up any sick or dying birds after an outbreak of bird flu was confirmed at a poultry farm.
A temporary control zone was declared around the affected site in Salwick, near Preston.
Elsewhere, a protection zone was also set up in North Yorkshire after birds there were identified to have the H5N1 virus, the BBC reported.
Defra confirmed the strain of bird flu was found at a property near Leeming Bar, Hambleton, and that testing was underway. 
Earlier this month, a bird flu prevention zone was declared across the country after a number of cases of the virus were detected in captive and wild birds in England, Wales and Scotland.
Farms and bird keepers were ordered to toughen their biosecurity measures after the avian influenza was spotted in poultry at multiple sites across the UK.
The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) will see keepers with more than 500 birds have to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites.",3
1505,"DUBAI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is in talks with banks to amend the terms of a $16 billion loan due in 2023 and possibly reduce the size of the facility, sources said, as the world's top oil exporter looks to cut outstanding government debt and improve its balance sheet.
The discussions between the ministry of finance and the banks are at an early stage and no decision has been taken yet, said the four sources familiar with the matter.
One said the potential refinancing could be for 50% to 70% of the $16 billion facility, which Saudi Arabia raised in 2018 when it refinanced, extended and increased an existing $10 billion loan raised in 2016 and due in 2021.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia manages its debt proactively all the time and makes regular announcements as deals are completed in the appropriate way,"" a ministry of finance spokesperson said.
The duration of the new facility could also be reduced, to three years from five, with the option of renewing it by two years at maturity, said one of the sources.
The potential de-leveraging could help the kingdom obtain better credit ratings going forward, another source said.
The largest Arab economy suffered a deep contraction last year as the coronavirus crisis hurt its burgeoning non-oil economic sectors, while record-low oil prices weighed on state coffers, widening the 2020 budget deficit to 11.2% of GDP.
But higher oil production and prices bolstered its finances this year, with the kingdom recording a budget surplus of 6.7 billion riyals ($1.79 billion) in the third quarter, its first quarterly surplus in over two years.
On Friday, ratings agency Moody's upgraded Saudi Arabia's outlook to ""stable"" from ""negative"", saying it was likely the government would reverse most of its 2020 debt increase while preserving fiscal buffers.
It estimated government debt will decline below 29% of gross domestic product by the end of this year and to around 25% of GDP by 2025, from 32.5% of GDP last year.",0
1506,"“A REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH on how to connect our world without being super-weird…In the Icelandverse, there’s…skies you can see with your eyeballs, volcanic rocks you can caress, and really big geysers you can observe from a safe distance.” So runs a viral advert designed to lure tourists to Iceland. The target of the parody is Mark Zuckerberg in particular, and Silicon Valley in general, for whom the idea of the “metaverse”—a sort of 3D sequel to today’s two-dimensional internet, in which users work, play, buy and sell inside immersive virtual worlds—has become the latest Next Big Thing.
Iceland’s tourist board is not the only sceptic. When, on October 28th, Mr Zuckerberg rebranded Facebook as Meta Platforms, to signal his commitment to the new idea, many assumed it was a PR stunt to divert attention from the social-media giant’s scandals. When Satya Nadella and Jensen Huang, the bosses of Microsoft and Nvidia, made their own pitches a couple of weeks later, people muttered about bandwagon-jumping.

Mr Zuckerberg may well prefer to think about exciting new products than deal with the downsides of his existing ones. And hype is the water in which techies swim. But to stop the analysis there would be too dismissive. There are good reasons to take the metaverse seriously.
One is historical: as computers have become more capable, the experiences that they generate have become richer. The internet began its life displaying nothing more exciting than white text on a black background. Flat images were added in the 1990s. Video came to dominate in the 2010s. On that reading, a move into three dimensions is a logical consequence of the steady growth in computing power.
That progression is more than merely theoretical. Google Maps already offers a virtual space that contains the real world’s stations, shops and streets. The video-game industry—the only type of entertainment fully exposed to the compounding power of Moore’s law—has been selling virtual worlds for years. “EverQuest”, an online game launched in 1999, had half a million subscribers at its peak. (Players quickly co-opted it for socialising, and even weddings, as well as dragon-slaying.) “World of Warcraft”, which arrived five years later, hit 12m. These days 200m people a month hang out on “Roblox”, a video-game-cum-construction-set. Many spend their real money on virtual goods. It is hard to argue that an idea will never catch on when, for millions of people, it already has.
Finally, mockery is an unreliable guide to the future. When YouTube was launched in 2005, commentators wondered why anyone would want to watch spotty teenagers filming themselves in their bedrooms when the delights of cable TV were a button-push away. In two decades, online dating has gone from being furtive and embarrassing to take its place as a perfectly normal way to meet people. Smartphones are some of the bestselling devices ever built. In the 1990s their brick-sized predecessors were mocked as crass status symbols for insecure investment bankers.
This does not mean every Silicon Valley brainwave will automatically succeed. Nor does it mean a fully fledged metaverse will arrive overnight, any more than the world wide web or the mobile internet did. But it does suggest that something metaverse-shaped lying in the relatively near future is an idea worth taking seriously. ■

1507,"FIVE OR SIX years ago, when many Chinese still associated American culture with novelty and fun, Halloween was big business in Caoxian. This rural county claims to be China’s largest source of cheap costumes for children’s parties and school concerts as well as for dramatic galas that are sometimes staged in Chinese workplaces, from small factories to government ministries. Not long ago, Caoxian’s entrepreneurs could live for a year on one month’s sales of pumpkin costumes, witches’ robes and other Halloween paraphernalia, says Ren Yafeng, a local costume merchant, perhaps exaggerating just a little.
In the past three years, however, America’s image has darkened and consumers have become more nationalistic, nudged by Communist Party propaganda and four years of Trumpian bluster. The market signals were swiftly received in Caoxian, for this light manufacturing hub in the eastern province of Shandong is linked to customers by e-commerce. Officials in Mr Ren’s home village, Sunzhuang, report that almost three-quarters of households sell goods on such online platforms as Taobao, 1688 and Pinduoduo.

This month marks the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding. All year, orders have poured in to Caoxian for replicas of the Red Army uniforms that were worn by Communist guerrillas. Schools have been buying child-sized ones for more than a decade, for use in performances. But it is not only children who don them. Such costumes are now all-but-required wearing for groups visiting party-approved “red tourism” sites, such as bases used during the Long March and battlefields where the Communists suffered ghastly but inspiring losses. Since January Mr Ren has shipped 100,000 Red Army uniforms from his warehouse, located at a crossroads between cornfields and a duck pond. He hopes to sell the same number again before the year is out.
The sight of grown men and women dressed as soldiers from the 1930s, in powder-blue or grey tunics, trousers and octagonal caps bearing a red star on the peak, is one of the spectacles of modern China. They can be seen panting up Red Army supply trails in Jinggangshan, a mountain in southern China called the cradle of the revolution. They can be heard reciting Mao’s poems in Yan’an, an old party headquarters, and singing red hymns around vats of thin soup that troops might have eaten long ago. These are pilgrims, for the party, though atheist, unabashedly talks about “sacred” sites, “martyrs” and filling hearts with revolutionary fire. The costumes are an aid to faith. Official documents talk of tourists being inspired by “wearing Red Army clothes, eating Red Army meals and walking Red Army paths”. Some visitors are bureaucrats on government-paid study tours, or workers from private firms eager to show loyalty to the party. Commercial guides also rent out or sell uniforms to individual tourists. Devotion to authenticity varies, with some visitors pairing uniforms with trainers and plastic bags full of modern-day snacks. Those attentive to detail sport old-fashioned cloth slippers, canvas satchels and toy guns.
Children’s costumes still make up most of Mr Ren’s sales, but adult orders are booming. The cheapest Red Army suits sell for 25 yuan ($3.90) while more durable uniforms can go for 100 yuan, including a belt and cap. He reports seeing a first surge in 2015, the 70th anniversary of victory over Japan, and ever-growing orders from revolutionary bases in the past two or three years.
Especially last year, when covid-19 lockdowns forced the cancellation of performances, lots of Caoxian’s costume-makers diversified into another patriotic fashion, selling the supposedly ancient robes known as Hanfu to individual buyers. These floaty gowns and tunics are largely invented, based on a mishmash of historical styles. Still, they are embraced by many Han Chinese, who make up over 90% of the population. They had lacked an ethnic costume they could call their own, unlike Tibetans or other minorities. Even children’s costumes are becoming more patriotic. Those based on “Journey to the West”, a famous folk saga, are brisk sellers, as are some based on a cartoon series from the 1980s about seven brothers born from magic gourds. In Sunzhuang locals call national pride a sign of progress, suggesting that as the Chinese grow richer and no longer worry about their next meal, their minds are turning to “higher things”, such as their own history. The village party secretary, Sun Xueping, used to encourage locals to seek jobs as migrant workers. Now he urges them to stay and make more money selling goods online. If those products reflect love of the country and party, “that’s a win-win”, he beams.
Red tourism, golden opportunities
Down the lane from Mr Ren’s warehouse, a line of beige uniform trousers drying next to a stack of corn cobs reveals a still more specialised business. Through a farmhouse gate lies a backyard workshop employing a dozen people to make costumes worn by enemy troops decades ago. Inside, workbenches are heaped with caps bearing the blue-and-white insignia of the Nationalist regime, which the Red Army overthrew in 1949. Boxes hold the black-and-white uniforms of Nationalist police, who hunted down underground Communists in Shanghai and other cities. These are used by extras in videos or stage shows, guesses the workshop’s owner, Ren Gen. He only receives orders for adult sizes, perhaps because parents do not want children playing villains.
It is revealing that blue or grey uniforms from the party’s earliest decades dominate the replica trade. There is less demand for the green uniforms worn in Mao’s later years, including by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution in 1966-76. In Caoxian, as elsewhere, that dark period saw temples smashed and people with the wrong class background, or even a slender connection to the outside world, tortured by mobs. “People don’t really want to mention such things,” says an older local who remembers those horrors. Nostalgia is both party-approved and profitable in today’s China. It is also selective.■",1
1508,"IT LOOKED LIKE the fall of Saigon in 1975 on fast-forward: an American-backed army melting away, enemy fighters strolling into the presidential palace, desperate crowds mobbing the airport. But the similarities between Afghanistan and South Vietnam were not only superficial. Both states, built to please their American sponsors, had been hollowed out by one of the oldest diseases of governance: corruption.
In Afghanistan, “from your birth certificate to your death certificate and whatever comes in between, somehow you have to bribe,” says Ahmad Shah Katawazai, a former Afghan diplomat. Officials and police routinely demand baksheesh (a “tip”). As the Taliban advanced, the pay-off required for a passport rose to thousands of dollars.

Worse, a government job is itself a valuable commodity. As Sarah Chayes, an expert on corruption, discovered while running an NGO in Afghanistan, officials often buy their posts and must extort kickbacks to recoup their investment. Mr Katawazai says it can cost $100,000 to become a district police chief. Officials’ main goal becomes extorting revenue to distribute to their families and patronage networks.
Afghanistan was partly run by such networks, even before 2001. But America strengthened them by paying off warlords, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). In 2009 ISAF, the coalition of NATO-led forces in the country, set up an anti-corruption unit called Shafafiyat (“transparency” in Pashto), with modest results. The government’s anti-corruption prosecutor mainly pursued political enemies. By the end the country was so corrupt that governors cut deals with jihadists. The army’s numbers were inflated by “ghost soldiers”, absentees listed on the payroll so that commanders could pocket their salaries.
Americans may remember the term “ghost soldiers” from the war in Vietnam, where corrupt senior officers used the same system. One South Vietnamese colonel used to order aimless artillery barrages in order to hawk the spent shell casings as scrap metal. As in Afghanistan, police and soldiers profited from the heroin trade. A report in 1978 on the fall of South Vietnam by RAND, a security think-tank, said South Vietnamese themselves believed that corruption was “largely responsible for the ultimate collapse”.
Why then, when it invaded Afghanistan decades later, did America fail to take corruption seriously? One answer is that political thinkers are only now doing so. Scholars such as Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist, see corruption as a throwback to pre-modern governments where power is based on personal ties rather than institutions. In this way South Vietnam and Afghanistan resemble mafias or the feudal states of medieval Europe. States like these lack the cohesion needed to beat a disciplined insurgency such as the Vietnamese communists or the Taliban.
Another problem, says Mark Pyman of CurbingCorruption, a watchdog, is that corruption is too knotty a problem for military officers focused on their nine-month rotations. For their part, aid agencies too often judge success by how much money they disburse. In both South Vietnam and Afghanistan a vast influx of American dollars caused a surge in inflation, wiping out public-sector salaries. (Afghanistan, with a GDP of about $20bn per year in 2020, received $145bn in American aid in 2001-21. Inflation averaged 17.5% in 2003-8.) Public servants had to demand kickbacks to support themselves.
Hence anti-corruption experts recommend that aid should be frugal and focused on achievements. That is easier said than done. If America does not learn that dollars cannot build a real government, it will end up creating more fake ones. ■",1
1509,"THE IDEA that there are five senses goes back at least as far as Aristotle. But it is not quite true. Four of the senses are obvious, not least because each is associated with a particular organ: sight with the eyes, hearing with the ears, taste with the tongue and smell with the nose. But the fifth classical sense, touch, is distributed over the whole surface of the body, albeit that it is particularly concentrated in the fingertips. 
Touch, moreover, is only one of such distributed senses. Others, perceived consciously, include pain, heat and cold. And modern science has shown there are yet further, unconsciously perceived senses, known collectively as proprioception. These keep track of the position and movement of the body and its parts. This year, the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, in Stockholm, which awards the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine, chose to honour the discoverers of the molecular mechanisms of two of these distributed senses—temperature and mechanical stimulation.

The winners were David Julius of the University of California, San Francisco and Ardem Patapoutian of Scripps Research, a biomedical institute in San Diego. Dr Julius did the pioneering work on temperature. He and Dr Patapoutian, acting independently, then advanced this work. After that, Dr Patapoutian moved on to look at mechanical stimulation.
Dr Julius’s chosen tool for his investigation, which he began in the late 1990s, was capsaicin. This is the active ingredient of chilli peppers. By a chemical coincidence (as was then assumed and is now known) capsaicin reacts with, and thus stimulates, one of the body’s heat-receptor proteins. Dr Julius set out to discover what this protein was. To do so he made millions of fragments of genetic material for proteins known to be active in heat-receptor cells. He then introduced these fragments into other cells, to encourage them to manufacture the relevant protein fragments. That done, he tested the modified cells for sensitivity to capsaicin. 
The fragments which induced capsaicin sensitivity turned out to be parts of a protein now called TRPV1. This belongs to a class of proteins called ion channels, which do many jobs in the body. As predicted, TRPV1 turned out to be heat sensitive. When the temperature rises above 43°C, the channel through it opens, permitting ions of calcium and sodium to pass. That chemical signal stimulates a nerve impulse which tells the brain about the temperature change.
TRPV1 turned out to be one of several temperature-sensitive ion channels, some of which register heat, and some cold. It was one of the cold-sensitive varieties, TRPM8, which was discovered simultaneously by Dr Julius and Dr Patapoutian.
Dr Patapoutian then went on to look at the sensation of touch. Molecular biology having advanced in the interim, he was able to work with whole proteins—or, rather, the genes for whole proteins. He identified 72 such proteins expressed in a mechanically sensitive cell line that looked like potential touch-sensitive sensitive ion channels. He tested them one at a time, by silencing the genes that encode them and poking the resulting cells. The first 71 silencings had no effect. But the 72nd proved to be of the protein he was looking for. He called that protein PIEZO1.
In nature, PIEZO1 is found not in sensory neurons, but rather in organs like the bladder where local sensitivity to pressure is important. But Dr Patapoutian soon discovered a second, similar channel, PIEZO2, which is, indeed, found in nerve endings. It is this that is responsible for touch and proprioception. 
Fascinating work, then. And important. It is through the senses, and the senses alone, that human beings are able to perceive the world. But to some people the award has come as a surprise. In a year of covid, many had been expecting the honours to go elsewhere—perhaps to the inventors of mRNA-vaccine technology. Like God, however, the various Nobel-prize committees work in mysterious ways their wonders to perform.",1
1510,"The Chinese military is now at or near the capability to invade Taiwan, according to a congressional report. 
'The PLA [People's Liberation Army] has already achieved the capabilities needed to conduct an air and naval blockade, cyberattacks, and missile strikes against Taiwan,' according to a report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressionally-appointed agency designated to provide national security and economic advice to Congress and the president. 
'PLA leaders now likely assess they have, or will soon have, the initial capability needed to conduct a high-risk invasion of Taiwan if ordered to do so by CCP leaders. They will continue enhancing this capability in the coming years.'
The report found that the PLA's current sea and air lift capacity could launch an initial landing force in Taiwan of at least 25,000 troops.   
'Given these developments, it has become less certain that U.S. conventional military forces alone will continue to deter China's leaders from initiating an attack on Taiwan,' the report found. 
The commission argued that China is most likely to invade Taiwan if it believes the US 'is not militarily capable of or politically willing to intervene, or if they interpret ambiguities in U.S. policy to mean that opportunistic Chinese aggression against Taiwan will not provoke a decisive U.S. response.'
The report found that Chinese President Xi Jinping had a high tolerance for risk and a desire to establish a lasting legacy, which could outweigh his concern for US warnings against attacking Taiwan.   
It found that China's nuclear buildup puts it on a trajectory to become the 'nuclear peer' of the US in quality, and a peer in quantity of land-based strategic missiles by 2030. 
The report warns that China could switch from a policy of nuclear deterrence to one of 'limited' nuclear first use.  
The US and its NATO allies formulate their nuclear policy on deterrence, meaning they build up weapons capabilities only to deter other nations from launching an attack, and only use their nuclear weapons if attacked first. First use would mean that China launches a nuclear weapon unprovoked to achieve a policy goal.
'Such a strategy would enable Chinese leaders to leverage their nuclear forces to accomplish Chinese political objectives beyond survival, such as coercing another state or deterring U.S. intervention in a war over Taiwan,' the report found. 
The report found that improved nuclear capabilities could encourage Chinese leaders to start a traditional war against US partners in the region, if they believe the US will stay away due to their nuclear capability. 
The report documents Chinese military training with barges, ferries and other civilian vessels to transport troops across the Taiwan Straits or elsewhere – in addition to conventional military transports. 
China considers Taiwan to be nothing more than an unruly extension of mainland territory. The US recognized the island democracy's autonomy until 1979, but the two nation's still enjoy a 'robust unofficial relationship.' 
In June, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that he did not believe China had the capability to invade Taiwan. 
'I think China has a ways to go to develop the actual, no-kidding capability to conduct military operations to seize through military means the entire island of Taiwan if they wanted to do that,' he said.
The White House has sent out confusing messages on its policy toward Taiwan, with President Biden first saying the US 'absolutely' had a duty to defend the island if it were attacked. Hours later, the president's press shop put out a statement saying there was no policy change, the US was still following the Taiwan Relations Act's policy of strategic ambiguity. 
Biden on Tuesday told a crowd he had made little progress to stop China's encroachment on Taiwan, but ruffled feathers in Beijing when he used the word 'independence.' 
'We made very clear we support the Taiwan Act, and that's it,' the president said. 'Its independence,' he added. 'It makes its own decisions.' 
The US does not officially support Taiwan's independence. 
That evening while touting the bipartisan infrastructure bill in New Hampshire, Biden said the US was not encouraging independence. 
'I said that they have to decide -- Taiwan, not us. We are not encouraging independence,' he said. 
'We're encouraging that they do exactly what the Taiwan Act requires,' he said, referring to the 1979 act governing Washington's relations with Taipei. 'That's what we're doing. Let them make up their mind. Period.' 
US officials tread lightly with a policy of strategic ambiguity, meaning they support Taiwan's ability to defend itself without explicitly promising to come to its aid in the event of Chinese attack. 
But, Taiwan's president recently confirmed for the first time that American troops are on the island of Taiwan training the Taiwanese military, and have been there for about a year.  
Chinese military forces held exercises last week near Taiwan in response to a visit by a U.S. congressional delegation to the island.
The state-run Xinhua news agency said Xi blamed recent tensions on attempts by Taiwan authorities to seek 'US. support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China.'
'Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,' Xi said.
 
White House readouts of the summit said Biden had affirmed the administration's 'one China' policy but warned against any change to the island's current status.
Meanwhile, a crackdown in Hong Kong, 'genocide' of the Uyghur minority and China's territorial ambitions in the Pacific Ocean, and its growing arsenal have cast the country as a growing challenge to Washington.   
But, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said this week that Beijing is ready to sit down for arms control talks with the US, a position they've rejected previously.  
Due to the the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) encroachment on the private sector, the report suggested that Congress take up legislation to deter US investors from pouring money into Chinese equity. 
It also called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require publicly traded companies to offer reporting on goods and services in their supply chain that could be linked to forced labor of the Uighur people in the Xinjiang province, and Customs and Border Patrol to place a hold on items originating in Xinjiang.  
It suggested Congress 'strengthen the credibility of US military deterrence' against an attack on Taiwan by building up military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region.    ",3
1511,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",0
1512,"FEW COULD have imagined it would come to this. When the civil war began almost a year ago to the day, Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, promised a swift military operation to bring to heel the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the ruling party of the rebellious Tigray region. The goal, he said, was to bring its leaders to justice for attacking a base that housed federal troops. In less than a month federal Ethiopian forces, backed by paramilitaries from the Amhara region as well as troops from Eritrea, to the north, had captured almost all of Tigray, including Mekelle, its capital. TPLF leaders disappeared into the mountains. Abiy declared victory.
Since then the TPLF has staged such a dramatic comeback that it may now be poised to launch an assault on Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital and seat of the African Union. The TPLF’s leaders, who controlled the central government for almost 30 years until they were ousted after massive protests ushered Abiy into power in 2018, claim they are advancing south at a speed reminiscent of the last time they captured the city, as a battle-hardened band of guerrillas three decades ago.

As panic mounted on November 2nd, Abiy declared a nationwide state of emergency and urged ordinary citizens to prepare to fight to defend the city, stirring fears that the capital of Africa’s second-most-populous country could turn into a battleground. America advised its citizens in Ethiopia to pack their bags.
Whether the rebels are indeed capable of advancing that far is unclear. In recent days they have claimed control of Dessie and Kombolcha in Amhara, both strategically important towns, but they are still more than 250km (156 miles) from the capital. The TPLF also says its forces are marching east into the Afar region in what looks like a bid to control the road-and-rail link to Djibouti.

Meanwhile another rebel group, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), says it has joined forces with the Tigrayans and is preparing to cut the roads into the capital. The federal government has not acknowledged any of this. Communication blackouts in much of the north make it hard to assess competing claims.
What is not in doubt is that the federal army is on the back foot. On November 1st, in a tacit admission that its control of the town was shaky, the government accused Tigrayan forces of massacring a hundred young men in Kombolcha. A day earlier the regional government in Amhara imposed a curfew and shut government offices, saying that all state resources, including government vehicles, should be redirected to the war effort. In Addis Ababa authorities ordered residents to register their guns and organise by neighbourhoods.
Recriminations are already flying. Abiy has alleged that foreign mercenaries were fighting alongside the TPLF in Dessie. Others accuse domestic “traitors” of sharing battlefield intelligence with the enemy. Dawit Mehari, an Amhara activist, says disillusioned Amhara are beginning to point the finger at the federal government itself. “Some think that an interest group inside the government actually wants the national defence force to fail,” he says.
Fearing that ethnic violence could spin out of control, America has urged the rebels to halt their advance. “We oppose any TPLF move to Addis or any TPLF move to besiege Addis,” said Jeffrey Feltman, America’s special envoy for the Horn of Africa. Tigrayans in Addis Ababa are being rounded up. “People are being kidnapped on the street,” frets a part-Tigrayan resident. Some have asked foreign embassies for shelter. Yet many observers also worry about conflict between Oromos and Amharas, the two most populous groups, which could easily erupt if the OLA attacks Addis Ababa. Both groups have competing claims of ownership over the city. “There is a real, palpable sense of fear,” says a Western diplomat in the capital.
Abiy’s emergency decree provides for sweeping powers of arrest as well as draconian restrictions on free assembly, movement and on any media which the government deems to back the TPLF. It also appears to lay the ground for military conscription. For weeks the Amhara regional government has been sending busloads of young men, some armed with machetes and knives, into battle. An adviser to the prime minister told the state broadcaster on October 31st that mass mobilisation would be needed to defeat the rebels.
Foreign governments are scrambling for a peace plan. On November 2nd America announced that it would freeze duty-free access for Ethiopian goods under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It is also expected to slap sanctions on officials if the warring parties do not negotiate.
Yet such diplomacy may already be too late. Abiy’s government is denouncing calls for talks as an affront to its sovereignty. And as Tigrayan forces have advanced, their appetite for negotiations has waned, too. “What kind of negotiations can there be with such a criminal government?” Tsadkan Gebretensae, one of the TPLF’s top commanders, asked in a recent interview with a Tigrayan broadcaster.
Then there is the problem of the Eritrean forces, which joined Abiy’s troops shortly after the war broke out a year ago. Eritrea’s president, Issaias Afwerki, is a bitter foe of the TPLF. Between 1998 and 2000 the newly independent Eritrea fought a bloody border war against Ethiopia, then dominated by the TPLF, that cost perhaps 100,000 lives. Since the TPLF recaptured most of Tigray in June, the Eritreans have been quiet, seeming to bide their time for a final showdown. “A peaceful settlement is unacceptable for Issaias, because it would legitimise the TPLF,” says a seasoned Ethiopian analyst. So the battle for Addis Ababa inches nearer by the day. ■

1513,"IN THE ANCIENT Chinese game of weiqi, better known in the West as Go, the objective is not to knock out your opponent. Taking turns to add one stone at a time to the board’s 361 spaces, what players firstly seek is to build the largest, strongest structures, and only secondly to weaken and stifle enemy ones. Better players shun contact, preferring to parry threats with counter-threats. Such unresolved challenges multiply, the advantage shifting to whoever poses the sharpest ones. Only when more stones than empty spaces fill the board can resolution of these tactical matters no longer be avoided.
The contest between China and India has unfolded in similar fashion. The two have lately engaged in sabre-rattling and name-calling. But such tension has been rare during their seven-decade rivalry as modern nations. As in a game of weiqi, so long as India and China were focused on building their own core structures, each largely ignored the other.

Far from their crowded coasts and plains, the Asian giants’ 3,500km-long border region remained an empty section of the board. It contained not people or resources but the world’s coldest, driest deserts and its highest mountains. India and China maintained overlapping claims, and their forces sometimes clashed, as in a brief war in 1962. But they both also judged that there was not enough at stake to fight a big war over. So territorial limits continued to be defined in many areas by a “Line of Actual Control” rather than an internationally recognised boundary. By mutual agreement their border patrols went lightly armed. They mostly avoided contact.
As a democracy bound by rules, India has repeatedly sought to end the ambiguity by negotiating a permanent border. But perhaps because its strategists are steeped in the culture of weiqi, China has repeatedly rebuffed such efforts. For a player building formidable structures across the rest of the board, why foreclose on potential pressure points? Better to leave them open for use in the future, when you have more leverage and your opponent has more reason to fear you.
Under President Xi Jinping, China appears to have decided that this future is now. At several strategic spots along the border in the spring of 2020, Chinese troops marched into long-established patches of no-man’s-land, setting up permanent forward positions. When India sent in soldiers to challenge the intrusions, fisticuffs ensued. One clash left some 20 Indians and at least four Chinese dead. China has since refused any return to the status quo ante. This leaves it in control of lands India regarded as its own and, more seriously, in control of vantage points from which to threaten crucial roads and other Indian infrastructure.
From a weiqi perspective China’s boldness is understandable. In the 1980s its economy was roughly equal to India’s. It is now five times bigger, and churns out ever-more sophisticated weaponry while India relies on imports. China’s infrastructure has expanded towards its peripheries at a speed India has been unable to match.
As seen from Beijing, China’s southern neighbour looks weak in other ways. Its democracy is messy and inefficient. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, looks like a puffed-up bluffer. And even as China extends strength by tightening its alliance with India’s arch-enemy Pakistan, Mr Modi dithers. In his dream of a Hindu golden age India needs no allies, only weaker satellites or rich friends. Despite fanfare over defence agreements with America or Japan or Australia, these remain largely notional. India’s army has little functional interoperability with any other.
In short, as the board fills up and one player emerges dominant, there should be no surprise for it to push the advantage. But China has not yet won. Even if his opponent is erratic, the global gameboard may prove wider, and India may turn out to have better-placed assets than Mr Xi realises.
Despite Mr Modi’s failings India retains a big reserve of goodwill as a democracy and a decent global citizen; it would gain fast allies if it really tried to win them. India’s core strength may run deeper, too. Its relative smallness is deceptive: the eastern third of China, where 95% of Chinese actually live, is no bigger than India. As China’s economy matures, India’s remains packed with upward potential. Besides, unlike a game of weiqi this contest between two great and ancient nations will never simply stop. It will keep on going long after Mr Xi and Mr Modi finish playing.",1
1514,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",0
1515," (CNN Business)Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder and former CEO of Theranos, is taking the stand in her own criminal trial.Holmes began testimony on Friday afternoon in the San Jose courtroom during the first day of the defense's case. She is also expected to testify on Monday and Tuesday next week, the only days court is in session.Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces 11 federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each charge.Whether Holmes would testify was a big question looming over the trial. She has attended the trial each day, typically with her mother and occasionally her partner. On Friday, her partner, mother and at least one person who appeared to be her friend were in attendance. She was smiling as she took the stand and during much of her testimony.Off the bat, Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey asked her if she believed Theranos had developed technology that was capable of running any blood test. ""I did,"" Holmes testified. ""We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all the technologies in a laboratory. The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples and run that formula,"" Holmes testified, adding that by 2009 or 2010, the company had a ""breakthrough."" Downey then stepped backed to establish the background of the company's origin, including how she was a chemical engineering student at Stanford University and her first patent application.""I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money that they had saved for me to be able to go to college to work on my patent,"" she testified. ""Then I went to try to raise or borrow money.""""Were you able to?"" her attorney asked.""I was,"" she replied.The original patent was not for blood testing. Rather, she started with the idea of a pill that could be swallowed without any other actions needed, she said.Holmes went on to explain the evolution of her idea from a pill to a patch to a benchtop device. ""As I started talking to people about what could be useful for a pharmaceutical clinical trial, I learned people were interested in a benchtop or a tabletop device and we moved to trying to build that,"" she said.She testified that she then built out a prototype and set out to raise financing to develop it into a product. She testified she was introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas ""by someone who had gone to college with my dad."" ""I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long-term,"" she testified, adding that he did a ""very comprehensive diligence process.""Holmes said that process included ""giving him a lot of information about our patents."" ""He asked us to get an audit of our financials,"" she testified. ""He wanted copies of contracts and other information about the business. He wanted to speak to people that we were talking to and interacting with.""He ultimately invested and served as Theranos' chairman of the board for a number of years.Holmes' attorneys previously indicated in court documents that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. They indicated that she is ""likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed, relied on, and deferred to Mr. Balwani,"" who is nearly 20 years her senior. The filings were from 2020 and unsealed just before the trial kicked off with jury selection in late August. Balwani, according to a court filing from his attorneys, ""adamantly denies"" the claims.Her attorneys also indicated plans to have an expert testify about the psychological, emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of Balwani.A Stanford University dropout, Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 with the mission to revolutionize blood testing. Inspired by her stated fear of needles, the company promised patients the ability to test for conditions such as cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos had struck up partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway, and a who's who list of board members and investors. Then it all came crashing down. A damning investigation by The Wall Street Journal in October 2015 called into question the capabilities of the company's proprietary blood testing machine, Edison, as well as Theranos' testing methods. Theranos was subsequently sued by investors for fraud and had its US blood-testing license revoked. The firm settled ""massive fraud"" charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately dissolved in September 2018.",2
1516,"Rodents may be asymptomatic carries of SARS-like viruses, a study has warned — meaning the the 'next COVID-19' may well come from rats.
Researchers from Princeton University performed a genomic analysis of various mammal species, looking specifically at the receptors that SARS viruses bind to.
They found evidence that some rodent species in the past were repeatedly exposed to SARS-like coronaviruses, leading them to likely evolve a certain level of resistance.
SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 infection — is 'zoonotic', meaning that it jumped from a non-human animal into humans.
And previous research has shown that Chinese horseshoe bats can play host to numerous SARS-like without themselves showing extreme symptoms.
Identifying animals that may have similar protections against such infections — and could thus serve as viral reservoirs — is vital for preventing future pandemics.
The study was conducted by molecular biologist Sean King and computer scientist Mona Singh of New Jersey's Princeton University. 
'Our study suggests that ancestral rodents may have had repeated infections with SARS-like coronaviruses,' the duo wrote in their paper.
This, they added, likely have allowed them to acquire 'some form of tolerance or resistance to SARS-like coronaviruses as a result of these infections.
'This raises the tantalizing possibility that some modern rodent species may be asymptomatic carriers of SARS-like coronaviruses — including those that may not have been discovered yet.' 
In their investigation, Dr King and Professor Singh studied the so-called ACE2 receptors that SARS viruses use to gain entry into mammalian cells — characterising the evolution of the receptors across different mammal species.
The team found that primates and other mammals not already known to be SARS hosts tended to have little evidence of past adaptation in the ACE2 receptors, which is what today leaves us vulnerable to symptomatic cases of the disease.
Among rodents, however, the duo's genomic analysis exposed a pattern of rapid evolution in the ACE2 binding interface — evidence by a greater diversity in the amino acid sequences that code for the receptor.
This suggests that some rodent species were likely exposed to SARS-like coronaviruses repeatedly over the course their evolution and, as a consequence, that they may have acquired a form of tolerance to these types of infections. 

'Continuing to explore adaptations in coronavirus animal hosts will be important […] for understanding which animals have possibly adapted tolerance mechanisms through ancient exposures and may be carriers of SARS-like viruses,' the duo began.
Such studies, they continued, will also aid us in 'finding those that are vulnerable symptomatic hosts, as humans have unfortunately proven to be.'
The full findings of the study were published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.  
Zoonotic diseases are able to pass from one species to another.
The infecting agent - called a pathogen - in these diseases is able to cross the species border and still survive. 
They range in potency, and are often less dangerous in one species than they are in another. 
In order to be successful they rely on long and direct contact with different animals.  
Common examples are the strains of influenza that have adapted to survive in humans from various different host animals. 
H5N1, H7N9 and H5N6 are all strains of avian influenza which originated in birds and infected humans.
These cases are rare but outbreaks do occur when a person has prolonged, direct exposure with infected animals. 
The flu strain is also incapable of passing from human to human once a person is infected.  
A 2009 outbreak of swine flu - H1N1 - was considered a pandemic and governments spent millions developing 'tamiflu' to stop the spread of the disease. 
Influenza is zoonotic because, as a virus, it can rapidly evolve and change its shape and structure.  
There are examples of other zoonotic diseases, such as chlamydia. 
Chlamydia is a bacteria that has many different strains in the general family. 
This has been known to happen with some specific strains, Chlamydia abortus for example.
This specific bacteria can cause abortion in small ruminants, and if transmitted to a human can result in abortions, premature births and life-threatening illnesses in pregnant women.",3
1517,"PLATFORM SHOES are back in fashion, at least in athletics. Many of the long-distance runners at the Tokyo Olympics, which begin on July 23rd, will arrive at the starting line sporting footwear with a distinctive chunky-looking heel. It will be more than just a fashion statement. The new shoes offer such a big performance advantage that critics have described them as “technological doping”.
Running-shoe makers have long tried to boost athletic performance, observes Geoff Burns, a biomechanics expert at the University of Michigan. In olden days, a 1% improvement in “running economy”—the energy taken to travel a given distance—would have impressed. But in 2016 Nike released the first version of its “Vaporfly” model, which improved running economy by 4%.

If that percentage were to translate directly into performance, it would knock about five minutes off an elite male’s marathon time. In practice, as Dr Burns observes, it wouldn’t quite do that. A marathon improvement of around 90 seconds would be a more realistic expectation. But Vaporfly and its successors have helped athletes smash a string of records. On June 6th Sifan Hassan, a Dutch runner, completed a women’s 10,000 metres race in 29 minutes and 6.82 seconds, beating a record set in 2016. Two days later she was overtaken by Letesenbet Gidey, an Ethiopian, who clocked 29 minutes and 1.03 seconds. In 2019 Eliod Kipchoge, a Kenyan, became the first to run, albeit in an unofficial event, a marathon’s distance of 42.195km in under two hours. The same weekend Brigid Kosgei, another Kenyan, broke a women’s marathon record that had stood for 16 years.
Scientists are still puzzling over exactly how the shoes work. The soles are made of a new type of foam that offers an unprecedented mix of resilience and squidginess, according to Dr Burns. This returns around 80% of the energy from each strike of a runner’s foot. The carbon-fibre plate may help by stiffening the midsole, and possibly by altering a runner’s gait. By cushioning a runner’s bones, muscles and ligaments from repetitive impacts, the shoes may even help athletes train harder than they otherwise could.
All that is great news for Nike, which sells the Vaporfly and its successors for around $250 each. (Rival manufacturers now offer similar shoes of their own.) Whether it is good for the sport is another question. Different sports have different tolerances for technological assistance. Running tends towards the conservative end of the spectrum.
In January 2020 World Athletics, the governing body of international athletics, passed new rules limiting the thickness of a road shoe’s sole to 40mm. Meanwhile, Nike appears to have shelved plans to deploy high tech shoes designed for sprinters at the Tokyo games, possibly because they did not comply with regulations either. But if they, or a rival manufacturer, have worked out a way around that problem, there could be fireworks in the sprints, too.

1518,"Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets all over Cuba. They have a long list of complaints, from the communist dictatorship’s inept handling of covid-19 to empty supermarket shelves and power cuts. Miguel Díaz-Canel, the president, decried the protests, the largest sign of popular revolt in six decades, and deployed riot police. Nearly 150 people have gone missing. Many of these are thought to have been arrested.
It remained unclear who was behind the murder last week of Jovenel Moïse, the president of Haiti. The national chief of police declared that a Haitian doctor who lives in Florida plotted the attack. More than a dozen former Colombian soldiers said to have been involved in the plot were paraded on Haitian television. Conspiracy theories abound, involving senior Haitian politicians. A power vacuum has been created; three men are vying for the top job.

In South Africa scores of people were killed and hundreds of shops, factories and warehouses burnt in riots instigated by allies of Jacob Zuma, a former president who was jailed for refusing to appear before a commission investigating corruption during his term in office. The government has sent in the army to stop the worst violence since the end of apartheid in 1994.
With the country mired in an economic crisis, two of  Lebanon’s main power plants shut down, taking the entire national grid offline and leaving most Lebanese without electricity. The power plants unexpectedly found that their fuel supply had been cut off.
At least 92 people died when a covid-19 ward caught fire at a hospital in Iraq. It is the second such incident in three months.
France will end its 5,000-strong counter-terrorism operation in the Sahel in the first three months of 2022, President Emmanuel Macron said. The mission started in 2013 when jihadists were advancing on Bamako, the capital of Mali. Jihadists remain active throughout the region.
American prosecutors charged four Iranian intelligence agents with trying to kidnap a journalist based in New York who is critical of the regime in Tehran. The plotters, who are based in Iran, allegedly tried to lure Masih Alinejad to another country where they hoped to abduct her.
Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the United States Senate, said his party had agreed on a $3.5trn budget that proposes huge increases in spending on infrastructure, tackling climate change, health care and other issues.
Democratic members of the state legislature in Texas left the state to deny the Republicans a quorum for passing a bill on voting procedures that would, among other things, restrict access to postal ballots. The legislature’s Republicans passed a motion ordering officials to track and arrest the absent Democrats, who decamped to Washington.
Charlottesville quietly removed a statue of Robert E. Lee that had been the focus of a deadly protest in 2017. Four years ago, a first attempt by the college town in Virginia to take down the monument to the Confederate commander caused white supremacists to rally in its defence.
The number of people who died from drug overdoses in America soared by 30% last year, to 93,331, a record high. Experts blamed stresses related to the pandemic, as well as the closure of addiction-treatment centres during lockdown.
Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, announced that no further prosecutions associated with the Troubles in Northern Ireland, a wave of sectarian conflict that swept the province from the 1960s to 1998, would be allowed to proceed. That would allow a line to be drawn under the era, he said. Some of the outstanding cases related to actions taken by the army and police. Those who support the amnesty argue that attempts to prosecute members of the security forces had become politicised.
Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, published a 5,000-word essay on the “historical unity” of Russians and Ukrainians. Russia-watchers worried that he might be planning to grab more Ukrainian territory.
A cameraman died after being beaten up by anti-gay protesters while covering an anti-gay march in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. More than 50 journalists were attacked. Threats were made to the city’s Pride event; it was cancelled.
Two weeks after he became the first prime minister in Sweden to lose a vote of confidence in parliament, Stefan Lofven was asked by the Speaker to form a new government because no one else could do so. Mr Lofven’s position is still uncertain; he is finding it hard to muster support for a budget that must pass later this year.
A state of emergency came into effect in Tokyo. Pandemic restrictions were reintroduced and will remain in place throughout the forthcoming Olympic games. Restaurants and bars must shut early and may not serve alcohol. No commercial events may be held near the stadiums. All spectators have now been banned from Olympic stadiums in and close to Tokyo.
Coronavirus briefs

Indonesia recorded more than 50,000 new covid-19 infections on July 14th, the second-highest number (after Brazil) of any country. Cases have been rising rapidly and spreading throughout the archipelago. The government has ordered restaurants and places of worship to close in the worst-afflicted regions.
Record numbers of people in France signed up to get vaccinated after Emmanuel Macron announced that people who have not been jabbed will be barred from entering restaurants, cafés and shops and not allowed to travel on trains from August.
The British government confirmed that all remaining pandemic restrictions would be lifted in England on July 19th. Thanks to a successful vaccine roll-out, deaths from covid-19 are low, but rising as infections soar. London’s mayor said passengers will still have to wear masks on the city’s transport network.",1
1519,"CHRISTIAN LINDNER, the leader of Germany’s pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), is likely to emerge as a crucial figure after the election. Polling suggests it will be hard to form a coalition without the FDP. The 42-year-old Mr Lindner will relish the chance to cap his rapid political ascent with a job inside Germany’s next government—ideally as finance minister. His enemies would see that as their worst nightmare.
The FDP advocates tax cuts, slashing red tape, pension reform and limits to European fiscal integration. More recently it has urged a faster easing of lockdown rules. The party has doubled its support in the past year, thanks in part to the collapse of the conservative CDU/CSU. A snappy dresser and charismatic performer who regularly tops “Germany’s hottest politician” lists, Mr Lindner dominates his party to the exclusion of its other talents. At a recent campaign event in Berlin he was swarmed by admirers after delivering a fiery speech in which he sniped viciously at the Greens’ plans for debt-funded investment.

For decades the FDP was the kingmaker of German politics, propping up coalitions led by the CDU/CSU or the SPD. But the next government will probably need three parties to make up the numbers. That could mean a choice between a right-leaning “Jamaica” coalition, with Armin Laschet as chancellor, or an SPD-run “traffic-light” grouping, led by Olaf Scholz. Both would include the FDP and the Greens as junior partners. In 2017 Mr Lindner aborted Angela Merkel’s attempts to form a Jamaica coalition, declaring it better not to govern at all than to govern badly. “The FDP didn’t give us a millimetre,” says Lisa Paus, a Green MP involved in the talks.
This year Mr Lindner will hope to give Jamaica another try. He gets on well with Mr Laschet, with whom he built a CDU-FDP coalition in North Rhine-Westphalia in 2017. But as the SPD’s prospects have grown, Mr Lindner has opened the door to Mr Scholz by quietly softening his stance on fiscal issues. His price for making possible a traffic-light government would be the finance ministry, a perch from which he would seek to rein in the spending plans of the SPD and Greens (and France’s aspirations to deepen euro-zone integration). Many Greens and Social Democrats detest Mr Lindner’s brand of politics, and the feelings are mutual. From this witches’ brew of resentment and mistrust, a government may somehow emerge.",1
1520,"THOR, THE Norse thunder-god, was reputed to carry a hammer known as Mjollnir—a tool for destroying enemies and blessing friends. The hammer has provided suitable inspiration for the name of a powerful new drug to fight covid-19: molnupiravir. That drug has just been approved by Britain’s national medicines regulatory agency—the first in the world to do so. Molnupiravir, made by Merck, a big pharma firm,  and a Florida-based biotech called Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is the first oral antiviral medicine available to treat covid-19. The approval marks another milestone in the world’s fight against covid-19.
Other countries are also working quickly to approve the new medicine, which has provoked keen interest. Last month the interim results of a trial found that patients with a risk factor for covid-19 were 50% less likely to be hospitalised or die if the oral antiviral was taken in the first five days after symptoms. Britain has secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir, and sales of the drug are already brisk. America, Australia, Britain, the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are some of the countries that have secured deals, or are in the process of doing so. 
Demand is likely to be very high. The drug will be used to treat patients who have not been vaccinated, or who remain at high risk despite having had a jab.  Doctors now have a medicine to offer those most at risk from covid, which patients can take at home. The drug is also expected to be affordable globally. It is expected that rich countries will pay $700 a course for the drug, but low-income ones will pay something closer to $20—and maybe less as time goes on. 
Given the difficulties that low- and middle-income countries have faced in obtaining vaccines this year, it is reasonable to wonder whether rich countries are going to hoard the supply of this new drug, or even prevent it from being exported from the countries in which it is made.  That seems unlikely. Since the summer of last year when it bought the rights to the new molecule from Ridgeback, Merck has been looking for ways to make the drug widely available, such was its promise.
Known then as EIDD-2801 the molecule had been shown to inhibit the replication of RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 but had not yet been through trials in humans to test its efficacy.  As part of its covid-19 response, Merck chose to work on two vaccines and two drugs. With the exception of molnupiravir all its other products failed during development. 
Merck increased its own production and has licensed the drug to be made by others. It expects to produce 10m courses of treatment by the end of 2021 and hopes to be able to double manufacturing capacity next year. At the same time, five Indian manufacturers of low-cost generic drugs, including Cipla, Dr Reddy’s and Sun Pharmaceuticals have already signed deals to make generic versions of molnupiravir. Merck says it is also setting aside 3m courses of its own supply for low- and middle-income countries, to make sure not all early supplies are snaffled up by rich countries. 
Another notable move came on October 27th. Merck signed a voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicine Patent Pool—a United Nations-backed organisation that negotiates drug licences on behalf of less wealthy countries. The agreement will allow many more firms around the world to manufacture generic versions of molnupiravir. (One lesson of the pandemic has been the  need to have a global manufacturing footprint.) 
Trevor Mundel, president of global health at the Gates Foundation, says that because many generic drug firms are waiting to gauge  demand for molnupiravir in less wealthy countries, the foundation has made $120m available to get manufacturing going. This money will support guarantees to manufacturers that a certain volume of the new drug  will be bought. The foundation says it is hoping to speed up production by generic manufacturers, some of which can make as many as 10m courses a month. 
In the past year firms such as Pfizer and Moderna have been criticised for the lack of global access to their vaccines and their unwillingness to share the know-how to make them. Will Merck get much thanks for all its generosity? Mr Mundel thinks the speed and global breadth of the launch of molnupiravir will be without precedent in history. If so, that will mark a high-water mark in global health. Not everyone is happy. Médecins Sans Frontières, a humanitarian charity, says the Merck licence from the MPP does not go far enough. James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a “social justice” non-profit, disagrees, saying that the agreement goes further than any other company has done during the pandemic. 
Asked how much Merck had invested in its covid-19 research programme so far, the firm would only say “billions”. It is not likely to recoup this soon from  low- and middle-income countries. There are also concerns about whether the drug will be safe for everyone to take. Its ability to cause mutations in viruses could also pose a risk to fetal development. Regulatory agencies may thus choose to limit the use of the drug to certain groups for these reasons. Nonetheless, countries struggling to beat down  high numbers of covid hospitalisations and deaths, will find molnupiravir a powerful new hammer. ■

1521,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",0
1522,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",0
1523,"Former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has pulled out of the race to be next chairman of media regulator Ofcom and launched a blistering attack on the civil servants he accuses of blocking his appointment.
In a letter to The Times, Mr Dacre said he had been rejected by an interview panel because of his ‘strong convictions’ and has taken the decision not to re-apply for the job despite the appointment process being re-opened by Boris Johnson.
Mr Dacre said he would instead take up an 'exciting new job in the private sector' and attacked senior Whitehall figures' determination to exclude anyone with right-of-centre 'convictions'.
He called his encounters with senior civil servants an ‘infelicitous dalliance with the Blob’.
He wrote: 'To anyone from the private sector, who, God forbid, has convictions, and is thinking of applying for a public appointment, I say the following: The civil service will control (and leak) everything.
'The process could take a year in which your life will be put on hold; and if you are possessed of an independent mind and are unassociated with the liberal/left, you will have more chance of winning the lottery than getting the job.'
Mr Dacre also made reference to Sarah Healey, the permanent secretary at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport who notoriously said working from home allowed her to spend more time on her expensive Peloton exercise bike. 
To the Editor of The Times
Following a welter of ill-informed, increasingly hysterical speculation from the left-wing media, I’d like to set the record straight that I have not reapplied for the OFCOM Chairmanship, nor do I intend to apply despite being urged to do so by many senior members of the government.
I wish OFCOM all the luck in the world as it faces the awesome challenge of trying to regulate the omnipotent, ruthless and, as we’ve learnt, amoral tech giants without damaging freedom of expression – a freedom I spent 28 years as an editor fighting for both publicly, and privately with ministers.
Whether OFCOM, whose Chief Executive is a brilliant career civil servant, latterly at the Ministry of Housing, has the wherewithal to deal with such issues, is a different kettle of fish.
As is the daunting task facing OFCOM of helping ensure that the BBC (which I am on record as describing as a great, civilising force which I would die in a ditch to defend) is saved from both itself and the frighteningly well-resourced streaming giants.
At the original Chairmanship interview – in which the contribution of one of the assessors was unhelpfully undermined by a belated admission of a small conflict of interest – I suggested that OFCOM’s role as independent regulator of the BBC was compromised by the fact that two of its senior Board members were ex-BBC executives (one of whom subsequently resigned over his involvement in the Bashir scandal).
After the interview – at which another candidate, a senior public official with an impressive reputation, was also judged to be unappointable – my feedback was that, though I’d given a good performance, showing a solid grasp of technological issues, I’d revealed strong convictions that were incompatible with the role of an independent chairmanship.
To anyone from the private sector, who, God forbid, has convictions, and is thinking of applying for a public appointment, I say the following: the civil service will control (and leak) everything; the process could take a year in which your life will be put on hold; and if you are possessed of an independent mind and are unassociated with the liberal/left, you will have more chance of winning the lottery than getting the job.
Me? After my infelicitous dalliance with the Blob, I’m taking up an exciting new job in the private sector that, in a climate that is increasingly hostile to business, struggles to create the wealth to pay for all those senior civil servants working from home so they can spend more time exercising on their Peloton bikes and polishing their political correctness, safe in the knowledge that it is they, not elected politicians, who really run this country.

Mr Dacre also praised the BBC as a 'great, civilising force' that he would 'die in a ditch for'. 
He added the Corporation would need to be 'saved from both itself and the frighteningly well-resourced streaming giants' in the future.

Mr Dacre was the editor of the Daily Mail for 26 years. The journalist was educated at University College School in Hampstead, north London, before studying at Leeds University.
He had a taste for news from a young age, having edited his school magazine and university student paper.
After leaving Leeds he worked for the Daily Express as a reporter but joined the Daily Mail a decade later in 1980.
He spent a year editing the London Evening Standard before taking up the mantle at the Mail in 1992.
He became well known for his campaigning headlines such as 'Murderers' in 1997, where he accused five men of killing Stephen Lawrence.
Mr Dacre also received widespread praise for his role in stopping Gary McKinnon being extradited to the US for hacking into Pentagon computers.
He was personally thanked by the 46-year-old Asperger's sufferer's mother for 'standing up for Gary non-stop for years'. 
This year, Mr Dacre will lift the lid on his time at the Mail in a three-part Channel 4 programme called The World According to Paul Dacre.",3
1524," (CNN)Growing up with ""Sesame Street"" in the early 1980s, I found pieces of myself in Cookie Monster's sweet tooth, Big Bird's gentleness and in Grover, who was outgoing and always willing to help others, even though he made a lot of hilarious mistakes. There was even a lady named Maria who was Puerto Rican, just like my family. Maria (played by actress Sonia Manzano) looked and sounded like one of my aunts. I wanted to be a flower girl when she married Luis on ""Sesame Street."" And then along came the movies, which sealed my lifelong obsession with Jim Henson's Muppets.Seeing ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" when I was 7 changed my life. Just like the characters, I studied theater in college, moved to the Big Apple to make my dreams come true and even started doing stand-up comedy, just like my hero, Fozzie Bear. Friendship. Perseverance. Hope. The Muppets helped me get through the lean times and sang along with me when I celebrated any small victories. I didn't know that these amazing characters would prepare me to raise my own child during the rough times we'd face over the past few months. A deep dive into the MuppetsIn my 30s, I took my love of all things Muppet-related to academia. In graduate school, I studied the informal learning that happens for young children when exposed to Muppet movies and other media created strictly for entertainment. I found that kids as young as 3 years old were able to recognize and categorize positive and negative characters, behaviors and situations. Young kids also learned language while being entertained by these movies and television programs, especially when watching with a parent or other close adult. The children immediately picked up new words, when placed in context, and learned more complicated words and ideas by asking the adult watching along, ""What does that mean?""There is much more beneath the surface of ""Sesame Street""'s curriculum-based programming, too. My friends on ""the street"" taught me my ABCs and 123s, of course. But I also learned about helping others, community and what to do with all of the big feelings that took over my little body. These lessons carried with me throughout my life and shaped my relationships with others.I was 18 years old when my grandmother, who was the heart of my family, died. I remember my younger cousin, who was about 7 years old, struggling to understand and cope with her passing. The well-meaning adults, lost in their own grief, used flowery language — ""she's resting in peace,"" ""she's passed on,"" ""she's gone."" As tears streamed down his face, my cousin called out for her and wanted to see her again. I tried to help him understand the permanence of the situation. It didn't even occur to me at the time that I was using the same language the grown-ups on ""Sesame Street"" had used to help Big Bird and 6-year-old me understand Mr. Hooper's death. Helping me parent in a pandemicI had no idea how valuable these lessons of kindness, honesty and emotional intelligence would become once I became a parent. Back in March, a week after my son's third birthday party, I picked him up from preschool. We stopped at the local grocery store — where everyone knows him by name — and went home. We didn't realize that would be the last time my kiddo saw anybody beside his parents for six months — and counting. Like so many American families, when we first began our stay-at-home safety measures, we really thought it was only going to be for a couple of weeks. A month, tops. My son is a tiny empath. One time, I told him that his swim class had been canceled because his instructor was sick. Instead of being upset that he had to miss his swim lesson, my son cried with worry over his teacher's mystery ailment. ""Oh no! What's wrong with Mr. D? Will he be OK?"" That's why, when faced with a global pandemic, my husband and I chose not to ring the alarm bells right away. We told our son that it was just time for everyone to stay at home and spend time with their families for a while, like a little vacation. That seemed to satisfy him.As I grew anxious about the situation at hand, I turned to ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" and channeled Dr. Teeth and the lyrics from ""You Can't Take No for an Answer:""""Whatcha gonna do when the dimes get toughAnd the world's treating you unkind?You gotta hang on to your optimistic outlookAnd keep possession of your positive state of mind""Our family took walks, read stories and made beautiful messes, but it wasn't easy. As more time passed, it was becoming harder to juggle entertaining a toddler and keeping up with our work commitments.  There are big germs out thereAs it became clear that we were in this for the long haul, things in our home got a little looser. Rules and structure took a backseat to safety and comfort. And my son started asking more questions. It was time to change the language we were using. When we potty-trained my son, we talked a lot about hand-washing and germs. So I knew I had a familiar place to start the conversation. We talked about the time he got a runny nose at school because his friend had a runny nose, how he had a fever and how we had to go to the doctor. I told him that there are some big germs out there, and if we get together with lots of friends, it might make us all not feel well. I was honest without scaring him with the gravity of Covid-19. He took it in stride and then said, ""OK. You wanna make some animals with my Play-Doh?""Sure, maybe I left out the fact that some of his friends are, in fact, back at school. I'm heartbroken about everything he's missing out on. Every family has difficult choices to make — and there is no one correct answer. I'm not a parenting expert. I'm just a working mom doing the best I can to keep ""sweeping the clouds away"" for my boy. Sometimes, he has a question I can't answer. Instead of making something up — even toddlers can smell baloney a mile away — I'll say ""I don't know. Let's try to figure it out together."" It's what Kermit would do. 'Smarter, stronger, kinder' That's been the mantra sung at the end of every episode of ""Sesame Street"" since 2016, and it's something I try to take to heart every day. Not just as a parent but as a person living on this planet in 2020.Last night, my kid went to bed happy, healthy and safe. To quote his favorite Cookie Monster song, that's ""good enough for me.""",2
1525,"A GERINGONÇA IS pleasing to say, but difficult to operate. The Portuguese term, sometimes translated as “contraption”, refers to a device patched together from oddly fitting parts. Although the governing arrangement that António Costa, Portugal’s prime minister, assembled in 2015 was dubbed the geringonça, it proved surprisingly durable. But on October 27th it finally fell apart, as two left-wing partners voted down his budget, triggering elections two years early—a rare occurrence in Portugal.
Though the budget was expansive, splashing out on free kindergarten and other goodies and increasing the minimum wage, it was not lavish enough for Mr Costa’s radical allies, the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and the Left Bloc (BE). Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president, had announced in advance that if it failed, he would call elections. If he was hoping to put pressure on the parties to seal the deal, the gamble failed.

The parties are scrambling to influence the electoral timetable. Most want elections on January 16th, to avoid prolonged instability. But the calendar is complicated by the plans of the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats (PSD), a centre-right outfit despite its name, to hold leadership elections on December 4th. That would leave the winner scant time to pick candidates for the general elections. One PSD candidate, Paulo Rangel, is lobbying Mr Rebelo de Sousa (who hails from the PSD himself) to hold the elections later, to allow the party time to regroup. The current leader, Rui Rio, wants to postpone the primary instead. The president was due to announce the date on November 4th.
After an inauspicious start Mr Costa has won respect, not least in neighbouring Spain (where the centre-left Socialists also depend on a far-left party, Podemos). His Socialists came second in 2015’s election, then toppled the short-lived minority PSD government, cobbling together a majority with the BE and PCP, previously considered untouchable by the moderate Socialists.
The then-president required a written agreement between the parties: the BE and PCP never joined the government but made clear commitments of support. But Mr Costa increased his party’s seat count in 2019’s elections. Mr Rebelo de Sousa decided not to insist on a formal agreement before blessing the second geringonça. The Bloc and the Communists, weakened and unbound by any deal, were sure to flounce out at some point.
Some think Mr Costa might have been happy for them to do so now. Portugal’s covid-19 vaccination rate, 87%, is one of the world’s highest. He can point to decent GDP growth and falling unemployment until the pandemic (which in 2020 caused GDP to plunge further than in any year since the 1930s). He has kept the deficit, which made Portugal a ward of the European Union and the IMF after the financial crisis, low enough to win international respect.
But this has come at the cost of public investment: Portugal’s is thought to be the lowest in the EU in 2020 and 2021. Salaries are low by Western European standards: the minimum wage, at €775 ($900) a month, is around €300 less than Spain’s. Many Portuguese head abroad to work.
If Mr Costa nonetheless does well, he might be able to govern with smaller, more tractable allies than the ones that have just let him down. Miguel Maduro, an ally of Mr Rangel in the PSD leadership contest, wants to return to an informal arrangement where whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the second-largest tally of seats agrees not to try immediately to topple a minority government led by the other one.
But all the moderate parties are warily watching Chega, a far-right party with just one deputy now, but worryingly strong support in the polls. Mr Rangel refuses to govern with Chega. (Mr Rio has been more equivocal.) If Chega squeezes the other parties, any new government will be tricky. Portugal may be joining a new European normal: shrinking established parties, growing extremes and complex coalitions, a kind of permanent geringonça. ■",1
1526,"Candace Bushnell walks into the Carlyle Hotel in New York, an uptown vision in a pink cashmere dress and Dolce & Gabbana coat.
On her feet are a pair of divine Manolo Blahnik slingbacks and, frankly, anything less would have been a disappointment.
She sits down, crosses her fabulous legs and orders a cappuccino.
‘I feel like celebrating,’ she says. ‘Last night I didn’t forget a single line.’
At the age of 62, Candace has taken the bold step of starring as a version of herself in a one-woman show which has just opened off-Broadway and comes to London next year.
Is There Still Sex In The City? is adapted from her memoir of the same name and traces her life from well-to-do Connecticut childhood to her cosmo-drinking, party girl heyday, then through her marriage, divorce, the menopause and beyond.
It is funny, poignant and inspiring, all of it delivered by Candace standing atop various pairs of five-inch heels on a stage set furnished with her own pink satin sofa from her Upper East Side apartment, her own carpet and even her own poodles, Pepper and Prancer, who bound on at the end.
If the message here is that her dogs have made her happier than any man ever did, it is one she delivers without rancour or regret.
‘Actually, being a writer has meant more to me than any man could, unfortunately that is true. Writing is the one thing I have that I can totally rely on,’ she says. ‘One of the reasons why a lot of relationships did not work out for me was a lack of respect from the man towards my work. Totally. And I just I can’t do that.
‘Out in the world, women get a lack of respect, but in the home I need a cheerleader. And a lot of guys are not that because there can only be one star in a relationship. And it’s going to be them.’
Bushnell broke out in the mid 1990s as a sex and relationship columnist for The New York Observer. Back then, she didn’t want her parents to be embarrassed by her frank scrutiny of modern sexual manners in her Sex And The City columns, so she invented a character called Carrie Bradshaw, a chic cipher for Bushnell herself.
Even now, an unexpected strain of good girl conservatism informs her opinions, an unusual trait in a celebrated former sexpert. She loathes porn (‘don’t get me started’) and even raises one of her perfect eyebrows at some of the more exuberant passages in E. L. James’ mummyporn bestseller, Fifty Shades Of Grey.
‘Look. I don’t want to say anything negative about the writer. If you can write a book and make millions of dollars, that’s fantastic. Great for you because you know, it’s hard. But I started reading one of the books. And in the first paragraph the guy puts a turnip or something up . . . And I was like, I can’t. I just can’t bear what I have been reading.’
In the velvety plush of the Carlyle’s breakfast parlour, coffee cups are stilled and an enthralled hush descends. ‘Porn has changed sex,’ she continues in her clear, steady voice. ‘I mean, nobody talks about women having orgasms any more.
‘In the early 1980s, the Big O was like a new discovery. And men worked really hard at giving women orgasms. It felt like there was a pride among men; ‘‘I’m going to please my partner.’’ Now you never hear that. Now it’s all, I’m going to please myself.’
Yes well, um, would you like a croissant or something?
‘Now it’s all, I’m going to demand that my partner does things that I see in porn, like anal sex or choking.’
Perhaps some toast?
‘Jan, it is all about the man’s pleasure, not the woman’s. You go on a date and it’s transactional; a lot of guys just want their wiener waxed. I don’t want to get into a whole thing about porn, but I am not a fan.
‘It makes the 1990’s look like an age of innocence, it really does. For a start, there was no social media or cell phones back then, so if you wanted to have sex with someone, you had to do it in person, right?’
Damn right.
In the hit HBO TV series, which ran for six seasons and was made into two Hollywood films, the Carrie/Candace character was played by Sarah Jessica Parker. A lover of beautiful shoes and unsuitable men, Carrie became a feminist and fashion icon for generations of young women who adored her, despite her flaws.
Now she is back to stalk the streets of Manhattan once more in And Just Like That . . ., the rebooted HBO series which starts next month.
The new show finds Carrie reunited with gal-pals Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), although Kim Cattrall will not be returning as sexpot Samantha.
Did she make the wisest decision of all, one wonders?
For nearly three decades later, the landscape of these characters’ lives must have changed completely, along with their physical appearances on and off screen.
Before the show has even been broadcast, the participating actresses have been criticised for daring to age — it’s just so pathetic, but there you go.
Sarah Jessica Parker, now 56, has called comments about her grey hair ‘misogynist chatter’, while Davis (also 56) has been the target of uncharitable comments about plastic surgery treatments. Nixon (55) is also being targeted by trolls.
‘There are people who feel that women over 50 really shouldn’t even be seen in public,’ sighs Candace, whose own hair is a buttery whip of glamorous blonde and whose toned body bears testament to regular Pilates workouts and a 16,000 steps a day dog walking habit.
Despite this, she can still be as vulnerable as the next woman when it comes to the indignities of the ageing process. She once spent £3,000 on face creams after a saleswoman told her she had ‘too much filler in the cheeks’. She has also suffered the double mortification of not one but two boyfriends offering to pay for her to have a boob job.
‘I’m so flat-chested that one boyfriend’s mother used to call me ‘‘The Ironing Board’’,’ she says. ‘Anyway, there are people out there who are envious, people who just want to put someone down to make themselves feel better. Young men in particular have very rigid ideas about what women should and should not be.’
Of course, the truth is that although they are forever twinned in the collective imagination, Candace’s life diverged from Carrie’s many years ago.
After Sex And The City was adapted for the TV series in 1998, Bushnell had nothing more to do with the shows nor the films nor the lucrative revenue streams that followed.
‘As the show has grown it gets farther and farther away from the source material. I mean, there are fans out there who don’t even know it was originally based on a book,’ she says. ‘Did I earn my fair share from it? I often wonder.
Women in the entertainment industry never do as well as the men. I was cut out of certain deals. And I really shouldn’t talk about it because one’s got to be grateful. Yeah. As a woman back then you were told to be grateful for whatever you got.’
She appears not to be embittered by any of this, not even by the universally panned second film, and not her characters’ tendency to indulge in what one critic called ‘featherbrained feminism’.
‘No, the film wasn’t great, but people did their best,’ she says. ‘And as for everything else, I let that all go a long time ago. I don’t even know what a “Carrie” is any more. I just keep moving forward, trying to explore my own creativity.’
She has written ten books, married and divorced ballet dancer Charles Askegard (he had an affair with a younger dancer, Candace named her in the divorce papers) and now lives in contented singledom, mostly in her house in Sag Harbour in the Hamptons.
A recent relationship with a millionaire property developer called Jim Coleman has evolved to ‘just good friends’.
‘These things happen. And anyway, he moved to Palm Beach,’ she says.
Much of this is chronicled in her warts and all stage show, charting the highs and lows of her remarkable life.
‘There I am, 48 years old, my hair falls out, my vagina dries up and I am exhausted,’ she says at one point, cocktail glass in hand, telling it like it is, or was.
On stage she also reveals for the first time that she became pregnant when she was dating ‘a count from Luxembourg’ sometime in the 1980s, but decided to have an abortion.
‘Yes, I did,’ she tells me. ‘And if I had the baby, Sex And The City would not exist. That’s something that people need to understand.
‘Lots of women make this choice because it’s just not the right time. It wasn’t the right time for me to have a child and he wasn’t the right person, he was very unstable.
‘I don’t regret it and I don’t think there is any shame attached to having a termination. To me, bringing a child into the world under the wrong circumstances is what is morally wrong.’
Her stage show is set out in a series of life lessons, which include Men Lie About Everything; When It Comes To Sex There Is No Free Lunch; and perhaps the most important one of all; Your Girlfriends Are Forever.
After the turbulence and hurly-burly of the dating game, Bushnell seems to have happily settled down into a Hamptons existence shared with her dogs and her single girlfriends; a period of her life she calls The Bonus Years.
‘There is so much fun and joy being with a bunch of single women again, all supporting each other, being there for each other. The reality for women is there is a big chance you are going to be single at some point in your life. Statistically, it’s going to happen. And it is something that women need to know how to do; you need to know how to be in a relationship and also know how not to be in a relationship.’
Bushnell is slender with a porcelain doll face, but she shimmers with the strength of a survivor, a woman who has persisted.
As a young girl at acting school, she had to learn how to deal with ‘creepy’ behaviour.
‘At auditions or photoshoots, men would tell me to take my clothes off. I always refused.’
As an older woman, she had to negotiate the privations of the menopause. ‘It’s a big psychological moment for all women, because we’re always told that our worth is based on an ability to have children, then suddenly that is gone, it’s a tool no longer in our toolbox.
‘Some women don’t really have anything else to fall back on. I had a moment of ‘‘Oh my God, this is happening to me’’. It lasted for an hour or so, then I got over it.’
Despite being ‘as horny as hell when I was 18’ she doesn’t miss the sex, not at the moment anyway.
‘Oh God, I don’t really want to talk about my sex life. I honestly don’t. Once you get over a certain age, people don’t want to hear specifics. Anyway, right now I feel like I don’t really have time to pursue a big sexual relationship.
‘I don’t want to be with some twentysomething guy just for sex. I’m too old to have sex just for sex, and that was never me anyway.
‘If I have sex it’s got to be a cool thing. There’s got to be conversation, he’s got to be interesting, there has to be a continued form of communication. That is what I want. I want to have the best sex.
‘But then there is the possibility of emotional disappointment. You know, if I had sex tomorrow with someone and they didn’t call me the next day, I’m probably still going to feel be a little upset. And that is not a good look when you’re 62 going on 63,’ she says, and roars with laughter.
Candace is a card, she really is. You might think that Sex And The City has changed her life and made her fabulously rich, but it hasn’t, not really.
She still lives in a tiny apartment in New York, not far from the tiny apartment she had when she was writing her columns all those years ago. Yes, she says, she bought the house in the Hamptons but one that was ‘on the market for two years because nobody wanted it’.
However, she is not pleading poverty, she still drinks cosmopolitans and she still loves shoes.
‘Last week I bought a new pair of Manolos. I think they were $900. But they are a costume, right? I need them for the show.’
How many new pairs has she bought? ‘Only four,’ she says unabashed.
Nearly 30 years ago, Candace Bushnell entranced millions of women with her buccaneering adventures, her independent spirit and her unshakeable belief that good shoes will bring you good luck. Today, she must sometimes wonder what all that boy-crazy fuss was about. Her life has been no fairy tale, her Prince Charming is still noticeable by his absence, but thrillingly, she still has faith in the power of shoes.
‘If you believe they will bring you luck, then they will,’ she says, wiggling her own Manolos. ‘All you have to remember is that this is not a Cinderella story. It is the opposite of Cinderella. It is not sitting at home waiting for life to happen, saying ‘‘Oh, I lost my shoe and somebody needs to find me’’.
‘It is about putting on your shoes and going out there and finding that life for yourself.’",3
1527," (CNN)The jury in the civil trial against the organizers of a two-day Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, finished their first day of deliberations without reaching a verdict. Judge Norman Moon sent the jury home and told them to come back Monday and be ready to start at 9 a.m.The Unite the Right rally was held on August 11 and 12 in 2017 to oppose the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. As the violence unfolded, it reached a tipping point when James Fields -- who was protesting the statue's removal -- drove his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.Fourteen people and 10 White supremacist and nationalist organizations were sued in a civil lawsuit by some rallygoers and others who argue they suffered life-altering injuries at the protest. The plaintiffs, who include town residents and counterprotesters injured in clashes, are seeking compensatory and statutory damages for the physical and emotional injuries they suffered due to the rally. They also contend rally organizers engaged in a conspiracy and planned the violence to ignite a race and religious war. Defense attorneys and two high-profile defendants who are representing themselves argued none of the plaintiffs had proven the defendants had organized racial violence.Closing arguments concluded Thursday -- sending the legal battle to the jury. The jurors got the verdict forms Friday morning and started deliberating. US District Judge Norman K. Moon said that after Friday court will run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ""Only time I change that if all the jurors agree and want to go beyond that,"" Moon said.The jury will decide in each instance whether a defendant is liable for damages. In a civil trial, plaintiffs' attorneys have to show a defendant is liable by a ""preponderance of evidence,"" Moon told jurors, meaning 50.1% or greater chance of the claim is true.To succeed, the plaintiffs must prove the existence of a conspiracy involving two or more people, according to instructions given to the jurors. Also, plaintiffs must prove that the conspiracy was partially motivated by ""animus"" toward Black or Jewish people or because the plaintiffs supported those communities and that such conspiracy aimed to deprive them of their right to be free from racially motivated violence, the jury instructions say.Finally, the plaintiffs must prove that at least one person in the conspiracy ""took an overt act"" in continuing the racial violence and that the plaintiffs were injured because of that act, according to the instructions.The plaintiffs who were hit by Fields' car are seeking $7 million to $10 million in compensatory damages while others are asking for $3 million to $5 million, according to one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, Roberta Kaplan. It doesn't matter that some defendants didn't know each other, plaintiffs' attorney saysA large team of powerful lawyers under the umbrella of the non-profit Integrity First for America are representing the plaintiffs in their civil case. On Thursday during closing arguments, attorneys for the plaintiffs told the jury that the defendants had prepared for the ""Battle of Charlottesville,"" and messages sent between them and their actions after the violence were proof of a conspiracy.Kaplan told the jurors that they should find the defendants liable ""under the law, under the facts and under common sense."" Another attorney for the plaintiffs, Karen Dunn, pointed to defendant Christopher Cantwell's involvement in the rally alleging, ""He was there because he had an enormous following of armed extremists. ... He could promote, facilitate and execute violence."" Dunn also demonstrated to jury how the rally organizers put out calls to get shields and bring other weapons, including flagpoles and pepper spray, which they referred to as ""gas."" She also showed messages from other White supremacists who support the idea that demonstrators in the street should be run over. ""This is reasonable foreseeability,"" said Dunn said, arguing that all the members are liable for this.""The evidence in this case is crystal clear that this plan went as intended,""  Dunn said.Dunn noted that many of the defendants claim they didn't know what was going on or that they didn't know each other, but ""that doesn't matter, they're still part of the conspiracy.""""This is about the use of force. This was about occupying space and that was the plan for the Battle of Charlottesville,"" Dunn said. Defense says they didn't initiate deadly violence James Kolenich, attorney for Jason Kessler and two other defendants, told the jury, ""Hearing all this testimony or hearing all this from the plaintiffs, I want you to say, 'So what.'""He said the horrific injuries that many of the plaintiffs suffered ""don't prove a conspiracy. And the plaintiffs never claimed they did.""Spencer, who is defending himself, said he was not part of a conspiracy because he never participated in chats on an app used by other defendants. Then, in a tense moment between Spencer and the judge, Spencer recalled then-President Donald Trump's infamous statement about the rally: ""There were good people on both sides."" But Moon told him that quote was never entered into evidence. Spencer said he agreed with the sentiment, ignoring the judge's orders.""There were some bad people on both sides,'' Spencer said, referring to antifa.The defense notably displayed less cohesion than the plaintiffs -- oftentimes shifting the blame for the violence, arguing they didn't like each other, taking snipes at one another and alleging they barely knew each other.They have said they did not initiate the deadly violence that ensued, arguing they were exercising their First Amendment right to protest. They also say there was no conspiracy, and the violence stemmed from law enforcement's failure to keep the opposing groups separated.",2
1528,"WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. delegation will meet with senior Taliban representatives in Doha on Saturday and Sunday in their first face-to-face meeting at a senior level since Washington pulled its troops from Afghanistan and the hardline group took over the country, two senior administration officials told Reuters.
The high-level U.S. delegation will include officials from the State Department, USAID and the U.S. intelligence community, will press the Taliban to ensure continued safe passage for U.S. citizens and others out of Afghanistan and to release kidnapped U.S. citizen Mark Frerichs, the officials said.
Another top priority will be to hold the Taliban to its commitment that it will not allow Afghanistan to again become a hotbed for al Qaeda or other extremists while pressing the group to improve access for humanitarian aid as the country faces the prospect of a ""really severe and probably impossible to prevent"" economic contraction, U.S. officials said.
U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, who has for years spearheaded U.S. dialogue with the Taliban and been a key figure in peace talks with the group, will not be part of the delegation.
The U.S. team will include the State Department's Deputy Special Representative Tom West as well as top USAID humanitarian official Sarah Charles. On The Taliban side, cabinet officials will be attending, officials said.
""This meeting is a continuation of the pragmatic engagements with the Taliban that we've had ongoing on matters of vital national interest,"" said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
""This meeting is not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy. We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions. They need to establish a sustained track record,"" the official said.
The United States' two decades-long occupation of Afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift in August which saw more than 124,000 civilians including Americans, Afghans and others being evacuated as the Taliban took over. But thousands of other U.S.-allied Afghans at risk of Taliban persecution were left behind.
Washington and other Western countries are grappling with difficult choices as a severe humanitarian crisis looms large over Afghanistan. They are trying to formulate how to engage with the Taliban without granting it the legitimacy it seeks while ensuring humanitarian aid flows into the country.
Many Afghans have started selling their possessions to pay for ever-scarcer food.
The departure of U.S.-led forces and many international donors robbed the country of grants that financed 75% of public spending, according to the World Bank.
While there was an improvement for humanitarian actors get access to some areas that they haven't been in a decade, problems still persisted, the U.S. official said, adding that the U.S. delegation would press Taliban to improve.
""Right now, we are facing some real access issues....There are a lot of challenges in ensuring that female aid workers are provided unimpeded access to all areas,"" the official said and added that Washington needed to see an improvement by the Taliban on this front ""if we are to contemplate even more robust humanitarian assistance.""
PRESSURE ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS
While the Taliban has promised to be more inclusive than when it led the country from 1996 to 2001, the United States has repeatedly said it will judge the new Taliban government based on its deeds not its words.
The Taliban drew from its inner high echelons to fill top posts in Afghanistan's new provisional government announced last month, including an associate of the Islamist militant group's founder as premier and a wanted man on a U.S. terrorism list as interior minister. There were no outsiders and no women in the cabinet.
The European Union foreign policy chief said on Sunday its behavior up to now was ""not very encouraging.""
""We will certainly press the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans including women and girls and to form an inclusive government with broad support,"" the U.S. official said.
He added that there were discrepancies between the Taliban's promises of continued safe passage and implementation.
""As a practical matter, their implementation of their commitments have been uneven. It is true that sometimes we receive assurances from certain levels but then follow through on those assurances has truly been uneven,"" the official said.
The United States has directly facilitated the departure of 105 U.S. citizens and 95 lawful permanent residents out of Afghanistan since Aug. 31, when U.S. withdrawal was completed, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday.
He declined to provide a precise figure for those remaining, but said the agency was in contact with ""dozens of Americans in Afghanistan who wish to leave"" but that the number was dynamic and constantly changing.",0
1529,"HER FRIENDS would kill her if they knew she had considered voting for the Free Democrats (FDP), says Marijana, a 39-year-old arts PR consultant. A lifelong supporter of the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD), she had always dismissed the FDP, a small, liberal outfit, as a party for the wealthy few. But Germany’s wide-open election on September 26th is forcing voters to contemplate strange choices. Marijana fears the SPD may join the hard-left Die Linke, which she reckons is unprepared for government, as well as the Greens in a left-wing coalition. Hence the idea of lending one of her votes to the FDP, to bolster the chances of an SPD-Green-FDP “traffic-light” coalition. (Germans get two votes: one for a local MP, and one for a party, apportioned proportionally based on lists.)
If Germany’s election campaign has hardly been fizzing with ideas, the volatility of the polls has provided tremendous sport. Three different parties have led in the past four months. Having long languished in the polls, the SPD has recently surged. The Economist’s election model now puts its chances of coming first at around two-thirds. A big lump of undecided voters, and what may be the largest-ever postal vote, add to the uncertainty. Yet in Germany’s proportional voting system the horse race is only half the story. The coalition wrangles that follow election day will be at least as important, and twice as complex, as the voting that happens on it.

A record 27% of Germans split their votes between two parties at the last election, in 2017. Such “strategic” voting is often done to help lift a smaller party, such as the FDP, over the 5% threshold to enter the Bundestag, or to boost its chances of playing kingmaker in coalition talks. This year the mind-boggling intricacies of the election make the coalition calculus tricky for even the best-informed voter.
This is explained partly by the decline of the Lagerkampf, or “camp struggle”. There was a time when the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavarian ally the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the FDP made up a broad “conservative camp”, and the SPD and Greens a “progressive” one. Many Germans voted accordingly, even if the result was a muddy “grand coalition” of the CDU/CSU and the SPD.
But the big parties have declined, and new ones have emerged. Some of them, like the hard-right Alternative for Germany, are unwelcome in any coalition. With the old camps unable to win majorities, parties are forced into political cross-dressing. (The 16 states have led the way: there are 14 flavours of coalition in them.)
If the first of three televised debates between the CDU/CSU, SPD and Green candidates on August 29th lacked spark, it is partly because at least two of the three parties represented are likely to find themselves yoked together in government. The Economist’s model finds a 60% chance that no two-way government will be possible after election day. And because a continuation of the current CDU/CSU-SPD “grand coalition” seems improbable, Germany seems highly likely to get its first three-party coalition since the 1950s. Four such potential configurations may well emerge from the election result (see table).

The pre-coalition jostling itself influences campaign tactics. The liveliest moment of the debate came when Armin Laschet, the struggling CDU/CSU candidate, lambasted Olaf Scholz, his SPD rival, for failing to rule out a left-wing coalition. Angela Merkel, the outgoing CDU/CSU chancellor, repeated the charge two days later. It is barely conceivable that the moderate-minded Mr Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, would invite Die Linke, which seeks rapprochement with Russia and the dissolution of NATO, into government. But parties are loth to reject potential coalitions ex ante for fear of reducing their post-election leverage and sparking a domino effect of exclusions.
In the end, the choice may boil down to two plausible coalitions: the left-leaning SPD-led “traffic-light”, or a more conservative “Jamaica” government of the CDU/CSU, Greens and FDP (the names derive from the parties’ respective colours). If so, says an insider, that will trigger a “bazaar” of negotiations in which the CDU/CSU and FDP will try to seduce the Greens, who meanwhile will be working with the SPD to pull over the FDP. Ministerial jobs, government policy and even the identity of Germany’s next president, who must be chosen by next February, would all be thrown into the mix. Some party bigwigs expect it could take six months to put a government together. “It’s like ‘Game of Thrones’,” says Constantin Wurthmann of the University of Düsseldorf. “No one knows anything.”
All the confusion may have the paradoxical effect of forcing a simpler choice on voters. With the final outcome impossible to predict, the wiser option may be simply to strengthen the hand of one’s favoured party and hope for the best. Marijana is drifting in that direction. Now that the SPD has a real chance of nabbing the chancellery, she will probably give the party both of her votes. It might not feel as smart as splitting the vote, but at least her friendships will remain intact. ■

1530,"THE JOBS numbers a year ago were grim. Unemployment across the rich world rose from 5% to 9% in April 2020. In America unemployment rose from 4% to nearly 15% in a month, such a rapid increase that some social-security computers broke. In its June 2020 forecasts, the OECD foresaw worse to come. If there were a second wave of covid-19 at the end of the year, it said, unemployment would reach 12.6% before inching downwards, but not falling below 10% until the second half of 2021.
There were good reasons to expect high unemployment to persist. Rather like the price of petrol, it tends to be quick to rise but slow to fall. Fifty years of data from America, Australia, Canada and Japan suggest that increases in unemployment happen 50% faster than declines. A worker can clear her desk in minutes, but searching, applying and interviewing for a job takes time. After recessions bosses are cautious about hiring new workers, as they want to be sure that business has genuinely recovered. Moreover, the pandemic turned out to be even more malevolent than the OECD predicted, with some countries experiencing three waves of infection. Yet unemployment across the club fell rapidly from a peak of 9% in the spring. By the end of 2020 it was 6.9%, half the level that the OECD had feared. 

Some pundits fret that unemployment is now a poor guide to the labour market, because large numbers of people have dropped out of the labour force. Correcting this by assuming that everyone who has left the labour force really wants a job raises “true” unemployment by 1.5 percentage points. That is a big difference, but not enough to change the story of a labour market performing better than expected.

Using official data is tricky for another reason. In many places, including Australia, Japan and especially Europe, governments launched furlough schemes, under which people were counted as employed even though they were not working. There have been efforts to correct for this, including one by UBS, a bank, that analyses economy-wide working hours to estimate a “shadow” unemployment rate. Yet there is evidence of a bounceback. The Economist has adapted UBS’s methodology and finds that Europe’s shadow unemployment rate rose from 7% in 2019 to 20% in the second quarter of 2020, but fell to 10% in the third quarter and has probably fallen further since. 
The idiosyncrasies of a pandemic-induced recession may explain why the labour-market recovery has been faster than expected. The rich world has got better at coping with lockdowns. Restaurants have found ways to offer takeaway and delivery services. Governments have allowed more low-risk activities, such as manufacturing and construction, to continue. Even under lockdown, demand for workers has been higher than it was when covid-19 arrived in early 2020. 

The type of unemployment matters. Last spring the vast majority of unemployed Americans said they were “on temporary layoff”, meaning that they had been told there was no work for them but there might be soon. Returning to an old job is easier than finding a new one, speeding recovery. A big majority of individuals who left unemployment in May and June of 2020 returned to work at their previous employers, according to a paper in February by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. That corporate bankruptcies have been far lower than many people expected also means more workers had jobs to go back to. For many people who had to leave their jobs for good, labour-market “reallocation” has found them new ones. Although demand in leisure, hospitality and travel has plunged, the pandemic has created new needs, from contact-tracers to Zoom trainers. The boom in online shopping has similarly boosted demand for warehouse workers and delivery drivers.
The upshot is that jobs are churning. A recent paper by José Maria Barrero of ITAM Business School and colleagues finds that the rate of employment reallocation (a calculation that accounts for some firms creating jobs and others destroying them) in America is running at twice its pre-pandemic level. In mid-March 2021 American job postings on Indeed, a website, were 9% above the previous baseline. Reallocation in Europe has been slower, in part because furlough schemes have kept workers tied longer to pre-pandemic jobs, but it is happening. In 11 European countries total advertised vacancies fell by 50% in the financial crisis of 2007-09, but by only 25% during the pandemic. In Australia, which locked down hard but is now bouncing back, vacancies are an astonishing 20% above their previous level. 
Extra demand for workers has in part been met by existing companies. But new firms have also entered the market to fill gaps. America has seen a burst of startups. In 2020, 1.5m firms that are likely to end up employing people were founded, according to official data, up by 16% on 2019. Other countries, such as Britain, Canada and France, saw a similarly big rise in business formation in the second half of 2020. A recovery with lots of startups tends to be more jobs-rich than one without, since young firms are typically quicker to expand.
Technology has smoothed reallocation. Compared with the recession after the financial crisis, job-search websites such as Indeed and Monster are now more widely used. This makes it easier for firms to find workers, and vice versa. Yong Kim of Wonolo, a platform for blue-collar workers based in San Francisco, says that in the early days of the pandemic many industries, including fulfilment centres for online deliveries, struggled with labour shortages, but his platform has helped people to fill the gaps. 
The rich world’s job-market recovery still has a way to go. During the northern hemisphere’s winter the fall in unemployment has slowed, reflecting rising covid-19 cases. And much of the remaining joblessness is concentrated among the poor. In America, over 25% fewer jobs paid less than $27,000 a year in January 2021 than in January 2020, even as higher-wage jobs recovered. In Europe unemployment among people with tertiary education is marginally higher than it was before the pandemic, but a lot higher among high-school dropouts. Will vaccines allow poorer folk to find work again—or might they find it hard for years to come?
Consumer habits will partly determine the fate of low-wage workers. Even if the covid-19 threat passes entirely, people may be more homebound than they were, either because they are more risk-averse or because they are more often working from home. As a result, demand for the sorts of low-wage jobs that help people outside their home—such as serving staff, hotel workers or flight attendants—might be lower than it was. 
Yet there is reason to hope that the pandemic will not turn people into hermits. In New Zealand attendance at restaurants, cafés, shopping centres and theme parks is higher than it was before the pandemic. According to OpenTable, a booking platform, in the first two months of 2021 the number of Australian restaurant diners was 65% higher than before the pandemic. Because borders are closed, Australians are spending more locally. “The martinis were so good,” reports one bon vivant in Sydney, “that we ended up not ordering wine with the meal. We just had seven martinis each.”
Even in Australia and New Zealand, though, employment is still somewhat lower than it should have been. And the jobless include many low-wage workers. The covid-19 shock elsewhere was larger, making it more likely that consumers’ preferences have permanently changed and some workers have lost habits that made them more employable. The coming wave of jobs will not catch everyone, at least not for a while. Yet it will be broader and more powerful than even optimistic pundits had predicted. ■

1531,"FEW THINGS spook a prime minister like a petrol crisis. In his autobiography, Tony Blair recalls one in 2000 caused by fuel protests. The Downing Street machine was moving at a glacial pace. Decisive orders were needed. “I would like the army to come in and if necessary drive your tankers,” he recalls saying, “and if they meet with any violence from protesters, I want you the police to deal with them very firmly, and if not, to let the army take care of them. They’re very good at it.”
Where Mr Blair had protesters to rage at, Boris Johnson has had to make do with gummed-up global supply chains. The Petrol Retailers Association, a lobby group, says that fuel is now returning to the pumps. But for the past week many Britons have been unable to fill their cars, and others have wasted hours queuing to do so. Although the crisis is in large part the result of temporary forces beyond ministerial control, it also highlights enduring problems with both British logistics and Mr Johnson’s government.

Global supply chains have been under stress for the past 18 months, thanks to lumpy consumption patterns caused by covid-19. An ageing workforce and grim conditions have created shortages of lorry drivers across Europe. Both problems are, though, especially acute in Britain. Supply chains have been stressed by Brexit-related form-filling. Tax tweaks have cut take-home pay for some lorry drivers, and the number from the EU has fallen by more than 12,000, or 10% of the total.
Throughout, ministers have insisted there is no shortage of petrol. The fact that rumours, which emerged from talks over driver shortages, led to a run on the pumps reflects two issues. One is a frazzled public. Recent weeks have seen surging gas prices and empty supermarket shelves. In the words of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s former adviser, “The stooges who trusted No 10, and those who trusted the stooges, now have no petrol.”
The other is the government’s abject communication. Studying past fuel crises, Eben Upton and William Nuttall of the University of Cambridge find that “unbiased propagation of information about inventory levels can help to reassure consumers”. On September 24th Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, tweeted, in a typical message: “There is no fuel shortage. I repeat, THERE IS NO FUEL SHORTAGE”, followed by a red-car emoji.
The government has propagated precious little information about petrol stocks. Its solutions have twinned the technocratic with the desperate. Migrant flows used to respond to the state of the economy, but under the post-Brexit immigration regime they have responded to ministerial diktat. The government spent the summer resisting pleas to allow in more workers, insisting that firms should improve conditions and raise wages instead. Data from Indeed, a job-listings website, suggests they did. Pay in advertisements for heavy-goods vehicle (HGV) drivers increased by 12.8% from February to August, compared with 1% for all jobs.
Still, problems persisted. Under the new immigration regime, drivers count as “low-skilled workers”, and are not welcome in Britain. In an attempt to reduce the pressure, on September 25th the government announced 5,000 visas for HGV drivers, as well as 5,500 for poultry workers (another industry suffering shortages). Although the extra workers will be welcome, they will not make an enormous difference given the small numbers involved. The visas expire on Christmas Eve.
Other measures kicked in more quickly. Before leaving the EU, officials drew up a “National Emergency Plan for Fuel”, which offers ministers a menu of escalating options. In July Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, increased the number of hours lorry drivers were allowed to work. On September 27th the government activated the “Downstream Oil Protocol”, which exempts firms from competition rules, allowing them to share data on shortages. Combined with the fact that there is only so much petrol that can fit in a car’s fuel tank, this was enough to get the stuff flowing once more.
The army was put on standby, with 150 soldiers preparing to drive tankers, but as The Economist went to press it had not been called into action. Given the difficult circumstances, it may not be the last time it goes on alert this winter. Indeed, Mr Johnson highlighted the possibility of problems until “Christmas and beyond”. There is, however, some reassurance for the government as it faces up to the possibility of festive disruptions. Despite a crisis that was partly created by its flagship policy and was mismanaged by ministers, it is escaping the blame. A poll by YouGov asked who was at fault. Some 23% said the government. Nearly half said the media. ■
Correction (September 30th 2021): A previous version of this article misstated the number of visas offered to lorry drivers, and the date on which they were announced. Sorry.

1532,"A new zebra crossing which lights up as pedestrians approach it is the first in the UK.
The innovative new concept in Portsmouth, Hampshire has LED panels installed in the road surface and illuminates as pedestrians walk towards it.
It was developed to make zebra crossings safer as it makes pedestrians more visible to approaching drivers at night.
The new crossing system will be monitored and the concept could be replicated across other parts of the city if it's successful.  
Portsmouth City Council's cabinet member for traffic and transportation, Councillor Lynne Stagg, said: 'We are always looking for new ways to improve road safety and I'm delighted we're the first place in the UK to use this innovative new technology.
'We chose this crossing because it's very busy particularly at night with all the nearby bars and restaurants, we want to make the crossing more visible and encourage more people to cross there safely.
'We always tell people to make themselves as visible as possible, it's a really simple way to improve safety and lighting up this crossing is a great example of how that can work.'
Road contractor Colas developed the lighting system, which worked with the local council and the Department of Transport.
TIan Gibson, director of asset contracting at Colas, said: 'It is a first in the UK and we are looking forward to sharing the results of this trial within the industry.'",3
1533,"AS TRENDSETTERS GO, Luo Fuxing was an implausible one. A school drop-out, Mr Luo spent his days catching fish and herding goats in a village in southern Guangdong province. Eating pork was a once-weekly treat. At the age of 14, he left home to earn a wage in the province’s sweatshops. He hated the tedium of the work. He read that American criminals had tattoos of spiders’ webs inked onto their elbows to show time spent behind bars. Mr Luo got one too, because “the factory was just a bigger prison.”
He quit for a job in a hair salon. Inspired by Japanese manga and punk fashion, he dyed his hair and styled it into dramatic, gravity-defying spikes. Dark lipstick and eyeliner completed the look. He posted selfies to QQ, a messaging service—and soon hundreds of thousands of factory-town youth were copying his style. Mr Luo called its adopters the shamate, from a Chinese rendering of “smart”. It was “a wild-growing art form among workers”, he says. The trend, which peaked around a decade ago, helped newly arrived migrants from the countryside to bond. They met in parks, roller-skating rinks and online groups, where they shared not just sartorial cues but gripes about migrant life, from low pay and poor conditions to divorcing parents.

China has developed a distinct working-class culture in recent years, of which shamate fashion is only the most garish example. In mainstream media assembly-line workers are commonly shown in serried ranks and drab uniforms, with no hint as to how they spend their time outside factory walls. The stereotype is that workers who migrate to boomtowns and big cities—as 300m have done over the past four decades—are there only to earn a living. They are still commonly referred to as “migrant workers”, on the assumption that they are outsiders who will return to their rural hometowns. Many once did. But today’s working-class youth have no interest in going back to the land; many have lived in the city from a young age. They want to put down roots. Although marginalised in mass culture, workers are expressing themselves, in forms as varied as poetry and short videos shared online.
The government tends to portray migrant workers as patriotic and self-sacrificing. A museum dedicated to them in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, lauds their contribution to China’s economic ascent. Exhibits extol the Communist Party’s efforts to improve workers’ livelihoods and applaud their diligence. A sign at the entry reads: “Guangdong lets migrant workers create proud glories and legends again and again!” The hardship of factory work is glossed over, as are common injustices such as withheld wages.
Elsewhere, workers are often treated as country bumpkins. A “migrant-workers” version of the annual Spring Festival Gala, a big television show broadcast on the eve of the lunar new year, airs on a channel about agricultural news. Workers who began to stage their own unofficial gala some years ago were condescendingly described by state news outlets as offering “a little song, a little dance and a lot of passion”.
Small wonder that a coruscating memoir by Fan Yusu, a domestic worker living in Beijing, was a national sensation when it was published online in 2017. Ms Fan is now the editor-in-chief of New Workers’ Literature, an unofficial bimonthly journal of working-class writing, launched in 2019. One genre winning admiration from the literati is called dagong shige or “labour poetry”. Its most famous practitioner was Xu Lizhi, who worked on an assembly line for Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm that makes most of Apple’s iPhones. Before he committed suicide in 2014, at the age of 24, he had written almost 200 poems about the drudgery of factory work. Among the best known is “I Swallowed An Iron Moon”:
I swallowed an iron moon 
they called it a screw 
I swallowed industrial wastewater and unemployment forms 
bent over machines, our youth died young 
I swallowed labour, I swallowed poverty 
swallowed pedestrian bridges, swallowed this rusted-out life 
I can’t swallow any more 
everything I’ve swallowed roils up in my throat 
I spread across my country 
a poem of shame

Many workers’ poems refer to homesickness, alienation, injuries and powerlessness. A few deliberately evoke beauty, in jarring contrast to their bleak surroundings. In “Sundress”, Wu Xia—a rare female worker-poet, hired by a textile factory at the age of 14—writes of her love for the “unknown girl” with the means to buy the garment she sews. She also thus lays bare the elusive promise of social mobility that drives so many to the assembly line: Ms Wu, now 40 and a published poet, still works at a clothing factory.
The packing area is flooded with light 
the iron I’m holding 
collects all the warmth of my hands 
I want to press the straps flat 
so they won’t dig into your shoulders when you wear it 
and then press up from the waist 
a lovely waist 
where someone can lay a fine hand 
and on the tree-shaded lane 
caress a quiet kind of love...

Some literature is defiant, including towards government policies that make it extremely hard for factory-workers born in rural areas to make use of schools and hospitals in the cities. In “Who Can Forbid My Love”, Ms Wu writes of her adoptive city of Shenzhen: “This kind of love seeps into the pores, skin, cells, blood, bone / Even though there’s no residence permit with my name on it.” Chen Nianxi, a worker in a private mine, speaks of fellow miners who, employed by state-run firms, toil less yet earn more while he must blast “the rocks layer by layer / to put my life back together”. (English translations of these and other poems were published in 2016 in “Iron Moon”, an anthology of labour poetry.)
Such writing is tolerated by the government partly because journals like New Workers’ Literature are written for limited circulation and may not be sold in bookshops. Many poets publish online where, to avoid censorship, they steer clear of “unfiltered representations of the horrors” inside unregistered workshops known as “black factories”, notes Maghiel van Crevel of Leiden University. Some poems are proud or patriotic; many of those who write are motivated by a desire to earn respect. In the visitors’ book at the museum in Guangzhou, a visiting labourer has written: “Migrant workers, working souls, we’re the finest of them all.”
Yet workers’ writing is not fundamentally about political resistance, says Mr van Crevel, who studies labour poetry. Few blue-collar youths today feel they belong to a cohesive working class. That is partly because officials and state media avoid using the word “class”, or jieji, owing to its antagonistic overtones. (“Social stratum”, or jieceng, is preferred.) Many young workers call themselves dagong ren, a word for labourer that connotes temporary and low-status work. Its most extreme display is a subculture in Shenzhen whose members style themselves “Sanhe gods”. These young migrant workers hang around the city’s Sanhe job market to find day work, often as builders or delivery drivers. They reject the grind of the factory; their slogan is: “Work for a day, party for three.” Some even sell their national-identity cards.
Becoming a shamate was also a form of rebellion against the monotony of factory life. In a Chinese documentary released in 2019, “We Were Smart”, 70 former and current shamate shared their views on what it meant to be one. Their exuberant hairstyles turned heads. “People paid attention. It wasn’t positive attention. But they saw you. And the point was to be seen,” says one interviewee. Many felt they were part of a select group, and that cutting their hair would have meant going back to being “just another unknown line worker”. For some, the punk identity became more important than earning a better wage at a big factory, where they would have been forced to cut their hair. For men and women alike, it was a way of seeming tougher in a disorienting new city where many were cheated: “We felt we weren’t safe out there. That we were too honest, and were afraid of being messed with.” The hair, tattoos and clan mentality all helped.

As the fashion spread, its adherents began to be ridiculed by prim, middle-class netizens. A sustained online attack against shamate around 2010 led thousands to lop off their hair and drop out of the group. Police began to round up anyone with the telltale style, to check their papers; anyone without a temporary residence permit would be detained.
Shamate fans still congregate in parts of Guangdong. But the fashion has lost its edge as factory youth have found a new way to express themselves: video-sharing apps. Lorry drivers, construction workers and farmers have built followings and sometimes found stardom—not despite being blue-collar workers, but because of it. In manufacturing hubs, where phones are often banned inside factories, assembly-line workers document their lives outside them. Widely used hashtags include #FactoryLife and #LiftTheBucket. The last refers, often ironically, to quitting a job in search of a better one, with nothing but a bucket of belongings.
Through the videos, workers cheer each other on. They trade information: which factory has higher wages or fairer bosses, say. That is especially useful in a “hostile environment where there is no trade union to tell them about working benefits”, says Aidan Chau of China Labour Bulletin, an NGO in Hong Kong. Some speak of injuries or sexual harassment. Others parody the trendy life of urban middle-class youth. “Their aspiration to live in a city and become an urban citizen grows, even as they realise it is implausible—even impossible,” says Mr Chau.
Whether expressed in poems or through video-sharing apps, a sense of disillusionment seems to be growing. There was once pride in being a worker, says Mr Luo. “Now it’s embarrassing to say you’re one.” Young people working in factories see short videos as an escape: a way to kill time, but also to be part of a wider world beyond their gritty boomtowns. Yet even online, they struggle to gain acceptance. Zhang Yurong is among a handful who have built a wide following by recording life as a worker at Foxconn. Some comments on her videos say factory workers are “people abandoned by society”. That angered her, she says, not because it was wrong but because it was right.
A fellow worker-poet and friend of Xu wrote in tribute after his death: “Another screw comes loose / Another migrant-worker brother jumps / You die in place of me / And I keep writing in place of you.” ■",1
1534," (CNN)The two top leaders in the Senate have opened discussions to find a way out of a looming debt crisis, a sharp departure from the standoff a month ago that took the United States to the brink of a first-ever default. With Republicans buoyed by their chances to take back Congress in next year's midterms, they are eager to avoid another round of brinkmanship -- or potential economic catastrophe -- and are more eager to fight with their adversaries over President Joe Biden's sweeping tax-and-spending agenda and inflation woes hitting the country.  ""We don't want to interrupt our worthy adversaries while they're committing hara-kiri,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas and member of the leadership team, when asked about the different approach. In a shift from their last battle, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made a short trip over to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's second floor suite Thursday afternoon to stave off the crisis and find a deal before a December 15 deadline to raise the debt limit. It was a marked departure from the last battle when McConnell initially insisted that Republicans would not assist with the effort, prompting weeks of angry posturing before the GOP leader ultimately floated a short-term deal. Emerging from the Thursday meeting, McConnell called it a ""good discussion"" and the two agreed to ""keep talking"" about the massive year-end agenda the Senate is struggling to finish, including raising the debt ceiling and avoiding a government shutdown by December 3. Senators briefed on the matter say Republicans are open to a deal that would allow Democrats to easily raise the debt ceiling without GOP support, so long as Republicans don't drag out the process. Cornyn said the deal being discussed would ""expedite the process"" and ""avoid"" some of the time-consuming procedures to allow Democrats to vote on their own to raise the limit .  Without a deal between McConnell and Schumer or 10 GOP senators willing to break a filibuster, Democrats would have two choices to raise the debt ceiling in the 50-50 Senate.Democrats could either use a process known as budget reconciliation, which cannot be filibustered but would open them up to scores of GOP amendments in the Senate and would eat up days of precious floor time. Or they could change the filibuster rules and allow the debt ceiling to be raised by a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than 60 to break a stalling tactic -- something McConnell has been fearful his adversaries may actually do with their backs up against the wall.But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia reiterated to CNN on Wednesday that he flatly opposes going that route, ensuring Democrats would lack the support to do so. ""Absolutely,"" the West Virginia Democrat said when asked if he was still opposed to changing the filibuster rules to address the debt limit. ""Even more so."" With no clear way out of the matter, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, has floated an alternative approach that has been discussed with McConnell and other top leaders. Toomey told reporters he is frustrated that Democrats don't want to take responsibility for the debt of their expensive spending programs. Nevertheless, he wants to find a path forward that will require Democrats vote on their own, but in a less lengthy process. ""I have suggested the Republicans would yield back time, not drag things out, and I'm confident we would do that,"" Toomey said.  In the last standoff, Republicans demanded that Democrats use the budget reconciliation process, a request that Schumer and his party promptly rebuffed. That's because they contended they didn't have enough time to go through reconciliation and argued they didn't want to set a precedent by going that route for future borrowing limit increases. This time, however, Democrats have not taken as hard of a line.Yet some Democrats say they should hold firm again and force McConnell once again to give in and offer a way forward. ""Of course,"" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said when asked if he believed Republicans would supply the 10 votes needed to break a filibuster and advance to a final vote to raise the debt limit. ""Republicans have already shown us the path,"" Murphy said, referring to last month's standoff that ultimately led McConnell to propose a short-term deal. ""In the end, the Republicans weren't willing to crater the economy."" Murphy added: ""All they have to do is allow the vote to proceed. They took that offer a month ago. There's enough of them that aren't suicidal that they'll push this economy off the cliff. So that will happen again."" Sen. Brian Schatz also downplayed concerns about the looming debt limit deadline. ""There's always a lot of drama around the debt limit,"" he said. ""But we always raise the debt limit, and we'll do it again."" The Hawaii Democrat told CNN he doesn't ""want to dare"" Republicans to blink. ""But I do think that the adults will emerge because they have to."" Other Democrats aren't so confident. Senate Majority Whip Duck Durbin added that a better way is to solve the problem for good: Change the Senate's filibuster rules to allow a debt ceiling increase to advance by just a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than 60. ""We need to find a way to stop this perpetual showstopper once and for all,"" Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said Wednesday. ""And I've appealed to my colleagues regardless of how they feel about a yes or no vote to change this system. This is just unfair and it's dangerous for our economy.""Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has set a December 15 deadline to raise the debt limit, something that came after 11 GOP senators joined with Democrats voted to break a filibuster in October, paving the way for Democrats to approve a temporary extension, averting a default.  Republicans argued at the time that offering their assistance was a one-time deal to ensure Democrats wouldn't try pressure members to change filibuster rules, as well as provide them with enough time to raise the limit themselves using reconciliation.  One day after that vote, which McConnell backed, the GOP leader wrote a letter to President Joe Biden warning him that he shouldn't expect help from their party again to avert ""another avoidable crisis,"" sharply attacking Schumer for a partisan speech he delivered on the floor moments after the short-term measure was approved.""I write to inform you that I will not provide such assistance again if your all-Democrat government drifts into another avoidable crisis,"" McConnell said in the October letter to Biden.",2
1535,"The Liverpool suicide attacker who officials suspect converted to Christianity to aid his asylum application was in a mosque 'all day, every day' at the time he began building his bomb to blow up a maternity hospital, it emerged today.
Emad Al Swealmeen, who was baptised and confirmed at the city's Anglican cathedral in 2017, was seen worshipping during Ramadan and praying with a Muslim friend in the week before Sunday's attack, it is alleged. 
The revelation will further fuel suspicion that his conversion to Christianity four years ago was just an act to persuade the Home Office to grant him British citizenship and prevent them deporting him because he had found Jesus. 
Immigration sources said today that Al Swealmeen used a false identity and multiple appeals to 'frustrate' attempts to remove him from the UK before he tried to kill women and babies on Remembrance Sunday. 
Police believe Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months and began buying components online for his suicide vest after he began renting a flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, in April, which he then turned into a bomb factory.
Investigators are said to have admitted that the device would have caused 'damage, death and destruction' on a massive scale, but they were 'lucky' when the unstable device's detonator went off and killed him as he was 'jostled' when the taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.   
Police are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown.
But a security source told the Telegraph: 'Methodology wise this attack is entirely jihadist, but we have an open mind as to what precisely was motivating him. If he built a much more destructive device then the detonation looks accidental. It looks lucky'.
The Church of England was today accused of aiding asylum seekers to 'game' the immigration system by helping hundreds to convert from Islam and 'pray to stay' in the UK as it emerged people smugglers are using Instagram to urge migrants to follow Jesus to help them gain British citizenship. 
Emad Al Swealmeen lost his first bid to stay in Britain in 2014 but appealed again in 2017 after he worshipped at Liverpool Cathedral and his case was still outstanding when he blew himself up in a taxi on Sunday.
He was baptised and confirmed having apparently spoken 'endlessly and passionately about Jesus', but members of the city's largest Anglican church admitted they 'lost contact' with him within months of the ceremony. He was one of around 200 asylum seekers to adopt the faith there over a four-year period.
A clergyman at Liverpool Cathedral previously raised concerns about asylum seekers cynically posing as Christians to boost their chances of being awarded refugee status. Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian admitted in 2016 that 'plenty of people' were lying about their intentions after it emerged that the Church of England had christened hundreds of asylum seekers under a scheme dubbed 'pray to stay'. 
He said: 'There are many people abusing the system... I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault? And who are they deceiving? The Home Office, me as a pastor, or God?'  
MPs are to demand a ­formal Parliamentary probe into whether fake Christian converts are duping the Church of England to avoid being deported back to strict Muslim countries they came from. 
It came as new statistics revealed that between January 2020 and June this year, 29% of all migrants arriving by boat say they are from Iran and 20% say they are from Iraq. 91% of all migrants came from just 10 countries - including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and Yemen. These are also nations named in the top 20 countries where Christians are the most persecuted for following Jesus. 
Priti Patel said last night that Al Swealmeen, who changed his name to Enzo Almeni shortly after finding Jesus, exploited the UK's asylum 'merry-go-round' while a Home Office source said changing from Islam to Christianity is now 'standard practice' among asylum seekers 'to game the asylum system'. 
Pledging to overhaul the asylum system, Home Secretary Miss Patel declared: 'The case in Liverpool was a complete reflection of how dysfunctional, how broken, the system has been in the past, and why I want to bring changes forward. It's a complete merry-go-round and it's been exploited by a whole professional legal services industry which has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day in day out on legal aid at the expense of the taxpayers.'
The newspaper quoted the insider as claiming that the failed asylum seeker, who somehow remained in the UK for seven years, attended the mosque 'all day every day' during Ramadan - and was seen worshipping the week before the suicide attack. 
It also emerged that Al Swealmeen adopted a fake identity, Enzo Almeni, and made repeated asylum appeals and applications, including one in January.
The terrorist has been accused of trying to 'game' Britain's creaking immigration by finding Jesus after his first asylum application failed in November 2014 when the Home Office rejected his claims that he was from Syria saying they believed he was from Jordan. 
Adding to the picture that he was lying to the authorities, following his death his family abroad said that he was actually from Iraq. 
Al Swealmeen launched an appeal within the First Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber which was dismissed on April 16, 2015.
Later that year appeals to both that court and to the Upper Tier Tribunal were also refused.
It is understood that Al Swealmeen made a fresh asylum application to the Home Office in 2017 under his new name, but this was rejected two years later.
The 32-year-old then made a new application to the First Tier Tribunal on January 19 this year which was under review at the time he blew himself.  
Yesterday police found several 'suspicious packages' after raiding a pub and asylum hostel linked to the Poppy Day suicide bomber.
Officers said Emad Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months but have not found any evidence that he conspired with or was inspired by a terror group.  
A Royal Logistics Corp bomb disposal vehicle was seen arriving in Sutcliffe Street, Liverpool along with a fire engine, and the cordon was slightly extended to Boaler Street before ending this evening. 
Residents who had been told to leave their homes have now been warned that they may see explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) officers on Thursday in case further 'suspicious' items are found.
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said several suspicious packages were found, and were examined by EOD officers before being recovered by forensic teams. 
Searches have also been carried out at a property in Rutland Avenue that had been rented by Al Swealmeen since April, and that is the main focus of the police investigation. 
Police earlier said Iraq-born Al Swealmeen had rented a property in Liverpool seven months ago and had started making 'relevant purchases' for his homemade bomb 'at least' since that time. 
Officers are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown. 
One theory is that the bomber was suffering a mental health crisis having been devastated at his continued failure to gain asylum here because the Home Office refused to believe he was Syrian.  
In an update on the investigation ACC Jackson said that the pizza chef who converted from Islam to Christianity began renting his flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool at around Easter. 
ACC Jackson said: 'A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time'.
He added: 'At this time we are not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others'.  
Confirming the terrorist's cause of death he said: 'The post mortem on the deceased has taken place and the cause of death has been described as injuries sustained from the fire and explosion.' 
He also said that the 32-year-old asylum seeker had suffered from periods of mental illness that will 'form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand'.
Mr Jackson added: 'There is much comment in the media about Al Swealmeen and it is clear that he was known to many people. We continue to appeal for people who knew him, especially those who associated with him this year as we try and piece together the events leading up to this incident and the reasons for it'. 
The number of failed asylum seekers being deported from the UK fell to a record low of under 8,000 last year - down almost 40,000-a-year in eight years, MailOnline can reveal today.
Official Home Office figures show that tens of thousands of failed asylum seekers are still waiting to be sent back to the country of their birth - and cases are taking longer to complete because of the number of appeals.
In 2013 around 47,000 failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals were deported. This dropped to a low of 8,000 last year, with covid, in part, being blamed for the record low last year. 
UK Border figures from June show that there are currently 125,000 asylum cases outstanding in Britain. 
Of these 5,900 people, including Almeni until his death, were awaiting the outcome of an appeal. Some have been waiting for years.
Approximately 39,500 people are still waiting to be deported. 
There have between 19,000 and 35,000 new asylum applications a year for the past 17 years. In that period the number of applications rejected has dropped from 74% in 2004 to 46% in 2019. But this jumped back to 70% in 2020.
Around three-quarters of applicants refused asylum at initial decision lodged an appeal and almost one third of those appeals were allowed. 
There are calls for the Home Office to review their policies and practices in the wake of the attack after it emerged suicide bomber Enzo Almeni, 32, had been in the UK for seven years without gaining permanent residency.   

His 1lb bomb went off as his taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital just before the 11am national silence on Remembrance Sunday. 
There have been conflicting reports about what the device was made of. 
Some insiders claimed it was packed with ball bearings and made using homemade TATP explosives. TATP is unstable and known as a 'Mother of Satan' because it is liable to blow up accidentally. It was used by Islamist terrorist in the Paris suicide attacks of 2015, the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017 and the failed Parsons Green Underground station. 
But other experts believe he may have bought his explosives online or on the high street and may have even constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
Detectives are now trying to trace Al Swealmeen's movements to discover whether he bought his explosives online or on the high street. Experts now fear the bomber constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
A former counter-terror official told The Telegraph: 'The white smoke that can be seen billowing out of the cab could indicate the use of gunpowder and there is also a flash within the cab itself which could be powder burning.
'It is possible to construct homemade devices using fireworks, but it still requires a degree of expertise and planning.'
There are suspicions that he might have followed a recipe for the material used by the 7/7 bombers who targeted London in 2005. 
Worryingly, no one who knew him raised the alarm about his behaviour. His local mental health trust said he had previously been receiving help, but was no longer a patient. 
A Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We can confirm Emad Al Swealmeen had previously accessed our services but was not a service user at the time of the incident.'
Friends said Al Swealmeen had wrestled with depression and was sectioned in 2014 after he was rejected for asylum for the first time. 
They recalled how the bomber was so 'car mad' that he nicknamed himself 'GT' and had the initials tattooed on his arm along with a chequered flag. 
He changed his name to Enzo Almeni – after the Ferrari boss – and loved go-karting so much that that he bought his own helmet and got friends to sign it.
He was a regular at the TeamSport Go-karting track, on Liverpool's Brunswick docks, often going with his housemates or on his own to race laps.
Friends said they were astounded that the 'quiet and bashful' young man, who was also a big fan of country singer Johnny Cash, was behind the Poppy Day bomb.
One, who knew Al Swealmeen through his job at a pizza takeaway, said: 'He called himself GT because he loved cars, it was a little nickname he gave himself, he even had it tattooed on his arm.
'He was quiet, but not in a weird way, he was just really shy. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw his picture. Of all the people that worked in the takeaway he would have been bottom of my list to do something so sick.
'He was reserved, but not like he was hiding something, more like he was lacking in confidence. He did speak to me about feeling depressed one time, but didn't really go into it. At the time he lived in a shared house with a few others and all he cared about was go-karting.
'He showed me his helmet that he had bought, he was really excited about it. He went go-karting a few times on his own, he was so into it, and I remember him getting a tattoo and showing it off.
'He also loved Johnny Cash and he told me he wanted to get a Johnny Cash tattoo too.'
Malcolm Hitchcott, 77, a lay pastor and retired Army officer who gave Al Swealmeen a room in his home for eight months in 2017, remembered accompanying him on a trip to the track.
Pictures on social media show him in racing overalls at the karting venue, where he took part in 'Top Gun' marathon karting races and '50-lap' events. 'He got me to sign his helmet, rather like Lewis Hamilton signs helmets [for fans],' 
Mr Hitchcott added: 'He never spoke about a particular driver but he loved Ferrari, he was a Ferrari man. His email address was Ferrari-related too. He was very interested in motor racing.'
The indoor facility boasts 40mph karts and several of Liverpool's sporting greats such as Jamie Carragher, Sam Quek and Tony Bellew on its celebrity leaderboard.
But a source said Al Swealmeen had not been to the track for over a year. Last night the businessman who employed Al Swealmeen at his pizza takeaway for several months in around 2016 said he was a 'nice, polite guy'.
'I was shocked when I saw who it was,' the man, who did not want to be named, said.
'I still can't believe it. He was a nice, polite guy. He wasn't a practising Muslim, he told me he lived with a Christian family, and he definitely wasn't a fanatic.
'I've employed Muslims before, some of them don't like touching ham if it isn't Halal, but he didn't seem worried about that.
'He worked part-time for me, he had a visa and was legit. I paid him about £50 a day.
'Never in a million years would I think him capable of something like that.'
The friend agreed Al Swealmeen was not religious.
'He never really talked about religion,' he added. 
'I didn't think he practised any faith, although I do remember him telling me one time he had been to church and was trying to get to know people there.
'I would love to know what happened to him over the past few years. He must have been manipulated or corrupted. The man I knew and what he did on Sunday – they are like night and day.'",3
1536,"THE PLAQUE beneath a bust of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in his home town proclaims him “the face of hope” and a “tireless fighter for the rights of Mexicans”. That is certainly how the people there see him.
“Andrés Manuel is different,” says Heberto Priego Colomé, a pensioner sitting in the shade in Tepetitán, a settlement of 2,000 souls in Tabasco state in southern Mexico. “He’s normal. He’s sincere. He talks to the people.” He has also “sent lots and lots of help”. The old man gestures to a fancy new plaza with a basketball court and a diving board from which younger folk can plunge into a river. When the president visited, he threw a party on the plaza.

Mr Priego Colomé ticks off other benefits Tepetitán’s favourite son has brought: bigger public pensions, a training programme for the young, a scheme whereby old rural folk are paid to plant trees, and a new refinery that will bring jobs to Tabasco. When the river flooded last year, the president sent every household in the affected areas a fridge, a mattress, a stove, a fan, some pans and a blender, plus 8,000 pesos ($400). Some had received 10,000 pesos after earlier floods.
Mr López Obrador is not a conventionally skilled orator. He rambles and repeats himself. But he connects with Mexico’s have-nots and makes them feel seen and respected. Rarely has a Mexican president attracted such adulation—and loathing. To his supporters, who are largely rural, hard-up or old, he is the first national leader since the 1930s who truly cares about them. To his detractors, he is an incompetent demagogue who could drag Mexico back to its pre-democratic past.
At elections on June 6th Mexicans will have a chance to endorse one or other of these views. Mr López Obrador is not on the ballot—he is not halfway through his six-year term. But they will be voting for the lower house of the national legislature, 15 state governorships, 30 out of 32 state assemblies and thousands of local posts such as mayor. Voters can either boost Mr López Obrador’s party, Morena, or clip its wings.
Mr López Obrador has attracted far less global attention than other populist leaders. But look closer and he appears astonishingly similar to them (see table). In his eyes, Mexicans fall into two groups: the people, whose authentic will he represents, and the elite, who are to blame for all Mexico’s ills. He sees himself as on a historic mission to sweep away the rotten habits of the past and establish a republic of virtue.

If he is on a mission from God, his opponents must be working for the other side, and he lets them know it. Mr López Obrador’s predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, is a “spineless, immoral, unpredictable sycophant”. Others he has called “apprentice pickpocket” or “reverend thief”. In his daily two- to three-hour-long press conferences, he blasts individuals, such as critical journalists. Some have received death threats from his supporters.
He is ostentatiously austere. On assuming office, he halved the presidential salary and put the presidential jet up for sale; he flies economy class. The poor applaud such gestures. But by cutting his own pay, he also cut that of top civil servants; no government employee may earn more than the head of state. Many of the best-qualified quit. “Mexico was building a civil service that was professional and serious. That’s now broken,” says Montserrat Ramiro, a former energy regulator. On May 25th the United States downgraded its rating of the safety of flying over Mexico, citing regulatory laxity. A buyer has yet to be found for the presidential plane.
Few would quarrel with Mr López Obrador’s diagnosis that too much of Mexico’s political class was corrupt and ignored the vast majority of Mexicans. His goals are good: to raise incomes, improve public services, cut crime and eliminate corruption. But criticisms that he selects the wrong policies to achieve them, implements them ineptly and tries to nobble any institution that gets in his way hit the mark.
Not his finest hour
Consider his record on covid-19. The official death toll is 220,000, which is bad enough. The Economist’s excess-death model estimates that as of May 10th, 477,000 more Mexicans had died than would normally be expected—a rate 68% higher than in Brazil, a bungler too.
The toll is partly down to Mexico’s crowded cities and overweight population. But a panel commissioned by the World Health Organisation also found “major deficiencies in decision-making” by the government. Mr López Obrador was slow to act, set aside too little money and slashed research funding. He failed to wear a mask in public and said Mexicans could curb the spread of the virus by not lying or stealing.
The infection rate is falling, but the human cost has been immense. Gregoria, who sells single cigarettes and tamales in Mexico City, says two of her brothers died of covid-19, aged 52 and 62. She adds that the pandemic has driven away her customers; the government has given her no help.
Mr López Obrador has done little to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic because he is terrified of debt. A currency crisis in 1994 taught him that too much debt can cripple the government and let foreign creditors boss Mexico around. So his fiscal response to covid-19 has been among the most parsimonious in Latin America. Mexico’s credit rating remains tolerably firm. But more than 1m Mexican businesses went bust in the past two years. The economy shrank by 8.5% last year.
Even as bars remain open, schools have been closed for 14 months (some are reopening as teachers get jabbed). Teachers’ unions have strained to keep them shut. They are very powerful: in one state, Oaxaca, a union controls the distribution of federal funds to the state government. Mr Peña Nieto tried to curb the unions’ power. Mr López Obrador has restored it.
The president’s policies are an eclectic mix of statism, nationalism and nostalgia for the 1970s. Take energy. Back in the 1970s, oil prices were high and Mexico’s state oil monopoly was a mainstay of the economy, especially in Mr López Obrador’s home state. Like a boutique that stocks bell-bottoms, he is trying to revive a questionable old fashion. He has all but banned foreign investment in Mexican oil and is pouring cash into an $8bn refinery in Tabasco, to be run by Pemex, the mega-lossmaking national oil firm.
Mr López Obrador has ordered CFE, the state electricity provider, to buy state-generated power first, rather than the cheapest option. This is often from dirty oil—so high in sulphur that its use is banned in most ships. Cheaper, cleaner options exist, but these are usually produced by private and often foreign firms, which Mr López Obrador distrusts. His policies have raised questions about $26bn of private investments already made in solar and wind energy in Mexico. This deters investors.
Fed up with bureaucratic delays, Mr López Obrador has turned to the army, which follows orders promptly. It now watches the border, runs ports, helps catch criminals, distributes textbooks and vaccines, and is building 2,700 branches of “the Bank of Wellbeing”, a state-run bank to disburse cash to the needy. Men in uniform are also building a hopelessly uneconomic $7bn railway loop around his home state, paid for by the taxpayer. On completion the army will own it and pocket the income. For now the army is relatively clean—and respected. That may change if its leaders are tempted by the vast sums of money they suddenly control.
Mr López Obrador’s crusade against corruption has been selective. He has imposed tougher punishments for bribe-taking officials and clamped down on firms that sell facturas (bills that can be used for tax deductions). However, fewer government contracts are put out to tender than in the past. Mexicans tell pollsters they are asked to pay bribes as much as before.
The president’s vow to curb violence has proved hollow, too. The murder rate, five times that of the United States, has barely budged. Gangs control huge swathes of territory, corrupt the police and pull the strings of local mayors.
Could try harder
It is not Mr López Obrador’s fault that drugs are illegal in the United States, nor that this generates vast profits for Mexican criminals. Nonetheless, his efforts to stem the mayhem have been limp. He blames poverty for crime, and promises to create more jobs for the young. But at the same time he has replaced the federal police with a more militarised outfit, the National Guard, under command of the army.
Under the slogan of “hugs, not bullets”, he has taken a soft approach to gangs. In 2019 he freed a drug kingpin’s son, hoping to buy a respite from the killing. He did not get one. The implied message to the gangs has been “You can do what you like and we won’t ask for anything in return,” says Jorge Castañeda, an ex-foreign minister.
For many, Mr López Obrador’s gravest flaw is disregard for the rule of law. He cancelled a half-built new airport for Mexico City. After the decision was challenged in court, he called an unlawful referendum, in which a tiny electorate gave him a green light. Claiming that the people had spoken, he pressed ahead.
This has become a habit. He used a similar plebiscite to “approve” a gas pipeline, and another to halt construction of an American-owned brewery. Such shenanigans appal business folk. “We have lost certainty for investment, and for the future of Mexico as a democracy,” says one. Foreign direct investment (FDI) should be booming, as firms scramble to diversify their supply chains away from China. Mexico has a sophisticated industrial base and the world’s biggest national market on its doorstep, where demand for manufactured goods has been strong in the past year and which is starting a post-lockdown boom. Yet FDI has fallen under Mr López Obrador. A rise in the first quarter of this year included few new projects. “Firms are investing only to maintain existing projects,” says Luis Rubio, an economist.
A bad way to run things
Mr López Obrador is trying to inject the “people’s will” into criminal justice, too, proposing a referendum on whether to prosecute five of his predecessors for corruption. He has also pressed an independent-minded judge to resign and signed a law extending the term of the friendly chief justice of the Supreme Court. The court will rule as to whether this is legal—which it plainly is not. Mr López Obrador’s critics fear he is trying to set a precedent. For a Mexican president to stand for a second term is taboo. But what if he were merely to extend his first term, perhaps claiming that the people demanded it?
Mr López Obrador assails institutions as eagerly as children thwacking a piñata. He stifles the media by leaning on businesses not to advertise in critical outlets. He cuts the budgets of recalcitrant agencies. He wants to abolish INAI, the transparency agency, arguing that such a body is unnecessary when the president is an honest fellow like himself. He has threatened the institute that oversees elections, too. Critics fear he will do away with it and have elections run by the presidential office.
His social programmes have done some good. His pensions rises and the minimum wage have helped many. His schemes to support young and rural people are well-meaning. Some 330,000 Mexicans aged 18-29 get 4,310 pesos a month through year-long apprenticeships. Over 420,000 old rural folk are paid to plant trees.
Yet both programmes are badly designed. Some farmers chop down trees so they can be paid to plant more. Some plant species that wilt in the local soil. The youth programme is chaotic. No one checks if the young people receiving cash are actually learning anything. Some employers demand kickbacks. The handouts are portrayed as personal gifts from the president.
His economic record is dismal. Some economists predict real GDP per person will be lower at the end of his term than at the beginning. Mexico should be doing far better. Joe Biden’s stimulus should turbocharge Mexican exports, even as Mexican emigrants send chunks of their stimulus payments back home. The country’s economic sluggishness is the fault of “covid, not our policies”, says Claudia Sheinbaum, the ruling-party mayor of Mexico City. On May 21st Mr López Obrador said he planned to replace the respected central-bank governor with an (unnamed) economist “strongly in favour of moral economics”.

On a collapsed overpass in Mexico City, someone has scrawled: “Was it worth the bribe?” At least 26 people died when a train fell off it in May. Bystanders speculate that someone took a backhander to ignore shoddy construction or maintenance. “It had cracks. You could see them,” fumes Gabriel Gonzáles, a local taco seller. He complains about rising prices, the baleful effect of covid-19 on his business, and the lack of government support. The president’s party, Morena, “is as bad as the rest of them,” he grumbles.
The election on June 6th may not deliver as big a blow to the president’s party as it deserves. To oversimplify, it hinges on whether Mr López Obrador’s personal popularity outweighs his woeful record. His approval rating is a healthy 61%, yet polls show most Mexicans are unhappy about the economy, public safety and corruption.
Morena is less popular than the president. It is ahead of its rivals in the polls, but its lead is slipping. A few months ago its leaders said they expected to win a two-thirds majority of the 500 federal deputies, a dozen of the 15 governor races and the vast majority of the local congresses. Now they are tempering expectations.
The campaign has been dirty. The opposition say it is no coincidence that, when Morena’s candidate for governor of the rich northern state of Nuevo León flagged in the polls, the attorney-general opened criminal cases against the two leading opposition candidates. More than 30 candidates have been murdered.

Nonetheless Mr López Obrador is expected to keep control with the help of allied parties (see chart). The opposition—the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, and the National Action Party (PAN)—are a mess. Given Mr López Obrador’s record, they should be doing far better. But neither has worked out why the president is so popular. (It is because previous regimes were so self-serving and out of touch.) Neither offers a compelling vision. A newer party, the centre-left Citizens’ Movement (CM), shows more promise. It controls Jalisco and may win Nuevo León; together, these big industrial states generate 15% of GDP.
Going rogue
The opposition’s greatest fear has been that Mr López Obrador might win enough power to change the constitution. For that, he would need two-thirds of both houses of the legislature and a majority of state legislatures. That seems unlikely: he does not have a majority in the upper house, whose seats are not in play in this election. But his critics now worry that if he does badly at the polls, he may double down on extralegal means of transforming the country.
His party will dominate the poorer states of the south. The opposition will dominate the richer north. More than ever, there will be two Mexicos: one, a dynamic and integrated part of North America; the other, remote, backward and resentful. And one charismatic politician, sure of his own righteousness, will be stirring up rage for at least three more years. ■",1
1537,"HIS SWIMMING-POOL-turned-prison was known as La Piscine. There, Hissène Habré’s torturers would bind victims’ feet and hands and force them to swallow large volumes of water. Then they would hoist them up and drop them, sending water shooting out of their mouths and noses. They had other methods, too, such as stuffing the exhaust pipe of a running vehicle into a prisoner’s mouth. Across the road from La Piscine were offices used by the American government, which backed Mr Habré’s brutal regime.
The despot who ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990 died on August 24th after contracting covid-19. He was 79, and serving a life sentence in Senegal for crimes against humanity.

The son of a shepherd, Mr Habré showed early promise. He won a scholarship to study in France, where he earned a university degree. But on returning to Chad he joined a rebel group. In 1974 he and his men took three Europeans hostage, then killed a French officer sent to negotiate their release. Later that decade, under a power-sharing deal, he was given the posts of prime minister and vice-president. When the deal broke down, Mr Habré fled to Sudan. Several hundred skeletons were found near the house he left behind in Chad.
He made a comeback in 1982, seizing power with the support of America, which saw him as a bulwark against communism and, in particular, Libya. America helped train Mr Habré’s secret police and sent him copious arms. President Ronald Reagan even invited him to the White House (pictured). France also helped out, sending troops. Meanwhile, Chadian soldiers massacred civilians. In all Mr Habré is thought to have ordered the killing of some 40,000 people.
Rebels led by Idriss Déby overthrew Mr Habré in 1990. For years the exiled leader lived a quiet, luxurious life in a coastal suburb of Dakar, the capital of Senegal. His victims, though, were rounding up evidence. “From the depths of that madness, I swore to fight for justice if I ever got out alive,” said Souleymane Guengueng, a former detainee.
Finally, in 2015, Mr Habré was called before a special court in Senegal where 90 witnesses testified against him. Ten months later the judge found him guilty of crimes such as summary execution, torture and rape. A soft ululation from the widows of victims rang out in the courtroom, then cheering and weeping. It was a rare instance of a court in one country successfully prosecuting the former leader of another for crimes against humanity.
America and France backed the Senegalese court, but in Chad their strategy did not change. Both threw their support behind Déby, who ruled with an iron fist for 30 years. After he was killed by rebels earlier this year, France endorsed his son, Mahamat, who took over in a coup. Stability was the priority, even if it left Chad in the same sorry state.",1
1538,"SOME CONSERVATIVES have been on a mission to remove critical race theory from classrooms. Described by these advocates as any coursework discussing topics through the lens of racial identities (which is well beyond the original definition used by the critical theorists themselves), they argue that this approach to pedagogy is divisive. Eight states have passed laws banning these discussions in classrooms. Six have proposed similar legislation, or plan to. Some teachers claim they now fear discussing race with their pupils. But there is a trade-off here: according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, removing discussions about race from the classroom could disadvantage some low-achieving pupils.
The study shows that San Francisco’s ethnic-studies curriculum, a programme for ninth-graders (who are about 14 years old) that is designed to focus on the history of disadvantaged communities and encourages a focus on social issues, had benefits beyond merely what was learned in the classroom. Sade Bonilla of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and her colleagues show that the programme increased high-school attendance by 6-7 percentage points, course credits earned by up to 15 points (equivalent to about 3 courses) and high-school graduation by 16-19 percentage points.

The researchers were able to study the effect of the programme on low-achieving pupils by comparing children required to enroll (because of earning a grade-point average below 2.0 the previous year) with those slightly at or above the 2.0 grade point average who were not required to enroll. The study follows an article published in 2017 (by two authors of this current study) showing that the same programme improved shorter-term outcomes too: ninth-grade attendance, grade-point average and credits earned all improved.
San Francisco’s school district began its ethnic-studies pilot programme in the 2010-11 school year, with faculty members from San Francisco State University. The majority of pupils in the study (1,405 in total) were non-white: 60% were Asian, 23% Hispanic, 6% black and 5% white. Because of the small sample of black and white pupils, the researchers were unable to draw conclusions about those groups.
The curriculum focused on a variety of topics: race as a social construct, the history of eugenics, federal housing discrimination, and others. It also taught pupils about practices to counter racism and oppression: marching, voting, campaigning. Pupils were encouraged to think of ways to counter racism in their own communities.
The results are encouraging. Improving high school graduation is not a trivial matter. Pupils who graduate from high school enjoy higher wages, greater wealth accumulation and better health outcomes. But these positive results probably will not sway everyone. The programme improved outcomes for low-achieving Asian and Hispanic pupils, but the study was unable to measure an effect on other pupils: higher-achieving or white pupils, for example.
California has decided to require the course for graduation for all, starting in 2030. But there are risks with scaling up pilot programmes, and not just because the curriculum has not yet proved to be effective for all. There are also concerns about quality. San Francisco’s programme was taught by teachers who chose to offer the curriculum and had extensive training. Educators begrudgingly teaching the programme with lesser training would probably not have the same effect.
Yet the programme in San Francisco was clearly successful at motivating low-achievers who were otherwise uninterested in their schooling, explains Ms Bonilla. These at-risk pupils began engaging more deeply with their schoolwork and may have even attended college at higher rates. “The course seems to really engage them and make them lean into school,” she explains. “And not just in their ethnic-studies class, but in science, math[s] and everywhere.” Unfortunately for low-achieving pupils in the eight states now banning critical race theory, such teaching may not be allowed in their schools. ■",1
1539,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",0
1540,"Civil rights activist and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has called Kyle Rittenhouse a 'white supremacist' after the 18-year-old was found not guilty at his murder trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Friday.
'We just witnessed a system built on white supremacy validate the terroristic acts of a white supremacist,' Kaepernick tweeted after the verdict was revealed. 'This only further validates the need to abolish our current system. White supremacy cannot be reformed.'
Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges after pleading self-defense in the deadly Kenosha shootings that became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the US. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26 were shot dead and a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, was wounded by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020, during protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of African-American man Jacob Blake. 
The verdict in the politically combustible case was met with anger and disappointment from those who saw Rittenhouse as a vigilante and a wannabe cop, and relief and vindication from those who regarded him as a patriot who wanted to stop lawlessness and exercised his Second Amendment right to carry a gun and to defend himself.
Kaepernick was not the only athlete to condemn the verdict.
Robert Griffin III, another free agent quarterback, referenced the case of Julius Jones, whose death sentence for murder was commuted in Oklahoma this week. Jones, an African-American inmate, was scheduled to be killed on Thursday for the 1999 shooting death of Paul Howell. His sentence was commuted to life in prison, although many still maintain that he has been falsely accused.
'Kyle Rittennhouse can kill without a sliver of doubt & walk free but Julius Jones is in jail for life without the chance for parole after being on death row for 20 years with all types of doubt in his case,' Griffin tweeted. 'What is Justice? God help us.' 
Chiney Ogwumike, a star player for the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, called on social justice advocates to continue to protest: 'Yet again, a necessary reminder that social justice is not a moment, it is a movement.'  
African-American NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace also weighed in: 'Ha, let the boy be black and it would've been life…hell he would've had his life taken before the bulls*** trial.. sad'
Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant wrote that he was 'not surprised at all.'
Kaepernick has been the face of athlete activism since 2016, when he famously began protesting racism and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games.
He has remained a free agent since March of 2017, sparking accusations that the NFL has colluded to blackball Kaepernick, who has since settled a grievance with the league for an undisclosed amount.
The former University of Nevada star continues to train in hope making a comeback.
Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering for killing two men and wounding a third with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle in the summer of 2020 during a tumultuous night of protests over the shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake, by a white Kenosha police officer. 
Rittenhouse, a then-17-year-old former police youth cadet, said he went to Kenosha to protect property from rioters. He is white, as were those he shot.
The anonymous jury, whose racial makeup was not disclosed by the court but appeared to be overwhelmingly white, deliberated for close to 3 1/2 days.
Rittenhouse could have gotten life in prison if found guilty on the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide, or what some other states call first-degree murder. Two other charges each carried over 60 years behind bars.
Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said his office respects the jury's decision, and he asked the public to 'accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.'",3
1541,"IN JUNE 2020, Jorge Valencia of the Point Foundation started receiving calls and emails from consultants doing due diligence on his organisation, which helps lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) students into higher education. They wanted financial statements and asked questions about how the group was responding to the pandemic. For a non-profit organisation that relies on donations, it was nothing out of the ordinary.
What came next, however, was. Just a few weeks later they received another call, this time with news that MacKenzie Scott, the former wife of Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, wanted to make a large gift. There were no restrictions on how the money was to be spent or plans to monitor the group’s work beyond a short annual report—just a request to keep quiet about the source of the donation for a few weeks. Mr Valencia will not disclose how much money Ms Scott gave. But, in the midst of a pandemic, as many non-profit groups are worried about funds drying up, it has allowed the Point Foundation to more than double the number of young people it helps this year. “It was a godsend,” Mr Valencia says.

Ms Scott is an unusual billionaire. A novelist by trade, she came into a vast fortune when her 25-year marriage to Mr Bezos came to an end in 2019. As a result of the blockbuster divorce settlement she has become the 22nd-richest person in the world, with a net worth of around $60bn. Yet she is, by all accounts, an understated sort. She has married a science teacher at the school her children attend in Seattle and signed the Giving Pledge, promising to devote most of her wealth to giving back. Her only comments on her philanthropy so far are contained in three short blog posts sprinkled with references to poetry by Rumi and Emily Dickinson.
That discretion masks immense power. Over the course of the pandemic Ms Scott has become one of the most generous philanthropists in history, announcing $8.6bn in gifts in the 12 months to June. That is widely thought to be the largest sum anyone has ever given to operating charitable groups in such a short period. Other wealthy people tend to give to foundations, which then disburse grants over time. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest private development foundation in America, for example, dished out $5.8bn in 2020.
Ms Scott is also exceptional for the way she donates. Most “mega donors” today take a technocratic approach. They set up a foundation, put potential grantees through a gruelling application process, fund specific projects and monitor them closely. Ms Scott is giving the way middle-class people do: donating to a bunch of organisations and leaving them to get on with their work. As Benjamin Soskis at the Centre on Non-profit and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute, a think-tank, puts it: “Her fundamental priority is getting money out the door.”

The first big decision rich people make when they decide to give money away is who to give it to. Here Ms Scott has relied on outside advisers, including The Bridgespan Group, a non-profit consultancy spun out of Bain and Company, rather than setting up a permanent bureaucracy of her own. The approach she has settled for involves spraying funds across relatively small organisations working on a wide range of concerns, including racial and gender equality.
A good chunk of Ms Scott’s gifts have gone to local groups in America, such as food banks and YMCAs. Bloomberg News sent a survey to the recipients of all 786 gifts and got responses from 270. They found that half, excluding colleges and universities, have fewer than 50 employees. For nearly 90% of them, Ms Scott’s donation is the largest they have ever received. Contrast that with the Gates Foundation, which has handed about 30% of its total funding over the past two decades to ten big international groups, including the World Health Organisation; Gavi, the vaccine alliance; and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
The second step is deciding how to dish out money. Here, Ms Scott’s decision to make unrestricted grants is particularly popular with beneficiaries. The leaders of non-profit organisations grumble that donors too often tie money to specific projects, leaving them struggling to finance day-to-day operations. One-third of groups that received funds from Ms Scott are using the money to hire more people and over a fifth plan to invest in technology, according to the Bloomberg poll.
Ms Scott likes to fund people with personal experience of the problems they are trying to solve. The Interfaith Youth Core, for example, which received a $6m gift, was founded by Eboo Patel, an Indian-American Ismaili Muslim. The Chicago-based non-profit has decided to use some of the money to launch an online magazine that writes about subjects such as Jewish baseball players and voodoo festivals in Haiti. Implicit in Ms Scott’s unfenced giving, Mr Patel says, is a recognition that the person with the money doesn’t necessarily know best. “It makes the recipient feel honoured and dignified,” he says.
The third step is how to evaluate what organisations do with the money. Ms Scott has said little about this, but here too, grantees say, she takes a light-touch approach. One, the National Centre for Family Philanthropy, has been asked to submit a “simple and brief” report every year for the next three years that lays out what the organisation is up to. There is no template for that report and no effort to advise the organisation along the way. Ms Scott has coined a term for this approach: “seeding by ceding”.
Whether it was her intention or not, Ms Scott has issued a challenge to the bureaucratic, top-down model that has dominated American philanthropy for decades. It already seems to be influencing other rich people. Ms Scott’s ex-husband, for example, is chided for refusing to sign the Giving Pledge and being slow to make donations. But when Mr Bezos landed back on Earth after his first trip into space earlier this year, he announced a £200m gift that was a surprise to the recipients and came in the form of unrestricted grants. “No bureaucracy,” he said.
None of this is to say that Ms Scott has found some magic formula. In pursuit of discretion, she forgoes transparency. She has kept her advisers secret, so non-profit leaders eager to get on her radar have no way to contact her, aside from commenting on her blog. There are so many con artists pretending to dole out cash on her behalf that Ms Scott’s Twitter bio directs victims to a Federal Bureau of Investigation complaints page. And because she is giving as an individual, she doesn’t face the same reporting requirements as a foundation. Rob Reich at Stanford University points out that this opacity is rare among big donors. “It is insulting to democratic citizens because of the kind of power she wields,” he thinks.
Of course, Ms Scott’s strategy could change. She is just getting started with her philanthropy. Even as she announced her first round of grants last year, she vowed “to keep at it until the safe is empty”.
That could be more difficult than it sounds. The source of her fortune is a 4% stake in Amazon she received as part of the divorce settlement in April 2019. Shares in the e-commerce giant have rallied some 95% since then. Ms Scott’s safe is fuller now than it was when she began shovelling money out of the door.■

An early version of this article was published online on November 16th 2021",1
1542,"IN THE 1940s Joseph Biden senior fell from early wealth to near-destitution. He moved his young family in with his in-laws as he scrabbled for work in Scranton, Pennsylvania, before re-establishing middle-class ease as a used-car salesman in Delaware. For all the weight that his son, President Joe Biden, places on the wellbeing of the middle class he also cares deeply about the opportunity to join it, or rejoin it, and to rise through its ranks.
The president’s personal story chimes with something his country sorely needs: increased social mobility. Addressing the essence of his “Build Back Better” series of bills, originally pitched as a $4trn package over ten years but now being haggled over in Congress at half that level of spending, Mr Biden has said it lies in providing people “a fair chance to build a decent, middle-class life to succeed and thrive, instead of just hanging on by their fingernails.”

If his administration has a signal achievement to date, it is the expanded child-tax credits in the American Rescue Plan (ARP), the stimulus package which was passed in March. They appear to have reduced child poverty by more than 25% since they went into effect in July.
The president’s camp sees helping the disadvantaged as a way to boost the economy as a whole. Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, argued that the plans would “support families and enable greater inclusion in the workforce and social mobility—helping the disadvantaged and boosting economic growth”. Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the president’s Council of Economic Advisors, put it plainly in an interview with The Economist: “Most would agree that our current rates of social mobility are too low. There is not equality of opportunity. Kids are not starting at the same place.”
Data show that to be inarguable. America, the avowed land of opportunity, now appears a harder place in which to make it than Canada or western Europe, and this is a fundamental flaw in its economy and society. Ameliorating this through public spending is possible, if exceedingly difficult. And, for Mr Biden, the opportunity to do so is coming to an end.
The idea that social and economic status should be conferred according to effort rather than hereditary privilege was long seen as quintessentially American. In the 1830s Alexis de Tocqueville commended the “continual movement which agitates a democratic community”, arguing that it stabilised democracy.
Karl Marx remarked that America’s potential for class consciousness was sadly limited because “though classes, indeed, already exist, they have not yet become fixed, but continually change and interchange their elements.” The country’s social and economic mobility was only really accessible to white men—African-Americans and women of all colours would have to endure much longer before the American Dream could be theirs, too. But the dream was still there.
A runaway American Dream
Today, however, it is receding. What economists call absolute mobility—the probability that a child will grow up to earn more than their parents—has dropped precipitously. In a paper published in 2016, entitled “The fading American Dream”, a team of social scientists found that Americans born in the 1940s had a 90% chance of earning more than their parents had earned at the age of 30; for those born in the 1980s, the chance of that had dropped to 50% (see chart 1).

That remarkable drop is down to a few long-running trends, especially the emergence of education as the differentiator between economic precarity and success. National statistics show that workers with college degrees now have real wages 86% higher than those of workers without. What is more, those without a degree have seen little increase in real wages since 1979.
Many less-educated men have dropped out of the labour force. In 2016 “only one-in-two less-skilled men in rural America worked, which was 15 percentage points lower than in metro areas,” writes James Ziliak, an economist at the University of Kentucky. Real wages that have not budged and lower work-force participation have gone hand in hand with ill health, which worsens outcomes further. Anne Case and Angus Deaton of Princeton University recently published research showing that the life expectancy of Americans without a bachelor’s degree is falling.
On top of this precipitous decline in absolute mobility there have also been losses in relative mobility, a measure comparing children’s position in the income distribution with that of their parents. Consider the chance for a child born to parents in the bottom fifth of the income distribution to make it to the top fifth. In a society where origins did not matter one would expect the likelihood of such a rags to riches ascent to be close to random chance, or 20%. In America the chance is just 7.5%.
Comparisons with other countries make this look particularly pernicious. The land of opportunity is badly outpaced by European welfare states such as Britain, France and Sweden (where the chance is above 11%) and also by Canada.
Intergenerational disadvantage is especially stark for black Americans—they have only half as good a chance of escaping from the bottom fifth as poor whites do. One in five black Americans is from a family which has been mired in the bottom fifth of income distribution for three generations; for whites it is just one in a hundred.
Those born rich in America, by contrast, are much likelier to stay rich than their counterparts in other advanced countries. Their children see higher incomes, too. Hereditary persistence in incomes is a measure of how much you can predict about two people’s incomes based on a comparison of what their fathers earned. Bhash Mazumder, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, calculates that if an American’s father made twice as much as his neighbour’s father, then he would be expected to make 60% more than his neighbour. That is much higher than if they were French (41%), German (32%) or Danish (15%), though less than if they were Brazilians (70%).
We gotta get out while we’re young
Because children must grow up and enter the labour market before their relative performance can be assessed, findings like these are inevitably backwards looking; the most recent data provided by studies of intergenerational mobility come from adults born in the 1980s and entering the labour market in the 2000s. Few experts, though, imagine that the trend to lower social mobility will turn out to have reversed for later cohorts. At best it may have plateaued; it could well have worsened.
The returns to higher education—and, conversely, the penalties for low education—show little sign of declining. And highly educated people are likely to be married to each other, to raise children in stable marriages, to live near excellent schools and to invest a lot in supplementing their children’s education. Miles Corak, an expert on social mobility, argues that rising inequality along these dimensions “will most likely lower the degree of intergenerational earnings mobility for the next generation of Americans coming of age in a more polarised labour market”.

One way of trying to see whether things are merely bad or getting worse is to look for a leading indicator of social mobility. Some economists think that this can be provided by inequality levels, though the matter is far from settled. A chart known as the Great Gatsby curve (see chart 2) shows an empirical link, with countries where income inequality is high going on to have low rates of social mobility. The same pattern has been observed within America, too. States with high levels of inequality also have worse mobility outcomes.
The most innovative recent research on this comes from Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline and Emmanuel Saez. They used data from millions of tax returns to produce a high-resolution image of mobility outcomes (see map). This uncovered wide variation within cities; the amount of social mobility can depend on the neighbourhood, or even the block, where people live. But it remained inversely related to inequality. Other factors—such as more stable family structure, better schools, lower segregation—were correlated with higher upward mobility.

Inequality is, unsurprisingly, particularly persistent among black Americans. In September the Census Bureau reported that the typical income for white households in 2020 was 61% higher than for black households—a gap which has barely changed since 1967, when the data series began. The black-white wealth gap is unchanged as well, at a ratio of one to ten.
If the relationship between inequality and social mobility is causal, rather than just correlational, it augurs ill for today’s young Americans. Since 1989 the Federal Reserve has put out quarterly data on the distribution of national wealth. Its most recent release, for the second quarter of 2021, showed for the first time that the top 1% of earners held more wealth than the middle 60%. Data from the Congressional Budget Office show that the share of national income taken home by the middle 60% of earners in America has fallen, and that taken by the top 20% of earners has risen. In 1979 the middle 60% took home 50.8%, after taxes and transfers. In 2018 that share had fallen to 45.1%—and the top 20% had gone up to 49% of the take.
No country can realistically aspire to the absolute equality of opportunity that would lift social mobility to its theoretical maximum. But America could at least aspire to a less imperfect distribution of opportunity. Several tranches of policy that are especially influential on rates of social mobility are in areas in which America happens to lag behind its rich peers.
The most obvious missed opportunity is the lack of investment in early-childhood education programmes, and as well a welfare state that does little to reduce income poverty among children. Those already about to enter the labour force would benefit from better tailored education and training. A system of progressive taxation can pay for it all. It can also lower potentially unhelpful wealth inequality, particularly through levies on inheritances.
Even a president with huge sway in Congress would have to take his time pursuing such reforms as far as they might go: Denmark was not built in a day. Mr Biden is no such president. Six months ago, when the ARP provided for $1.9trn in new spending, he seemed to labour under the illusion that a Democrat-controlled Congress would give him all he wished. The subsequent strength of internal dissent has shattered that illusion. That does not mean a social-mobility agenda is off the table. It does mean making a series of choices.
Together we could break this trap
Start with the youngsters. “We have pretty unambiguous evidence that more financial resources [for families with small children] have lasting impacts on health and well-being and intergenerational mobility,” says Maya Rossin-Slater, a Stanford economist. But before covid-19 America had one of the highest rates of child poverty in the OECD—almost triple Poland’s.
The reason for this is not a mystery. The typical OECD country spends 2.1% of GDP on child and family benefits; America spends only 0.6%. As originally pitched, Mr Biden’s “Build Back Better” agenda featured a suite of policies intended to make America much less of an outlier, including a generous child-tax credit that mimicked the child allowances many Western countries use to reduce poverty, universal pre-kindergarten and child-care subsidies.
This pillar of spending is not looking as grand as advertised in the framework put out by the White House on October 28th. The expanded child-tax credits which have already reduced child poverty were part of a stimulus package passed in March; as things stand they will be extended for only one more year. Universal pre-kindergarten would be funded for six years, according to the latest negotiations, as would a child-care subsidy programme. Universalist programmes, including the child-tax credit received by most families, were appealing when the Biden administration was working with an effective blank cheque. Choosing a universal but short-lived programme over a targeted and permanent one is harder to justify. As it is, more will probably be spent subsidising care homes for the elderly than on children.
Measures which might have improved social mobility for those already in the workplace are being pared back to something much less consequential. The president had originally envisaged two years of tuition-free community college to every American; spending $80bn on worker retraining; and the creation of a scheme for paid family and medical leave (which America is almost alone in the developed world in lacking). All three proposals have been jettisoned because of the objections of some Democratic senators. There is now roughly as much spending proposed for higher-education and workplace-training ($40bn) as there is on expanding Medicare so as to better cope with deafness ($35bn).
The supports that remain in place are helpful, but comparatively modest and time-limited. The expanded earned-income tax credit, which tops up the wages of working-class Americans, would persist for just another year. Subsidies that allow workers to buy health insurance through the exchanges set up by Obamacare would persist for another four years.

This is not the stuff of the GI bill, the vaunted legislation which offered generous education benefits to soldiers returning from the second world war (though in ways that worked to the disadvantage of black veterans) and helped create the high social mobility of Joe Biden’s youth. Nor is it the stuff of the New Deal, an example the administration reached for when it suggested that massive public-works projects on climate-change mitigation and infrastructure building could provide a new kind of stable job to the working classes. Mr Biden promised that 90% of these jobs would not require a four-year degree. As the spending available for these proposals has shrunk, so too has their chance of instigating a Rooseveltian mobilisation.
Convoluted as they are, the Democratic spending plans look crystal clear compared with their plans to raise revenue. European-style welfare states require European levels of taxation. But Mr Biden has promised that no family with an income of less than $400,000 will pay more taxes. And the 50-50 split in the Senate means that Kyrsten Sinema, a Democratic senator from Arizona, has been able to veto conventional alternative ways of raising revenue, like increasing rates of tax on capital gains and corporate profits.
No place left to hide
Gone too is a sensible proposal to eliminate a loophole allowing inherited assets to escape capital-gains tax (which might have raised $204bn). And some Democrats are also threatening to kill the whole proposal unless a tax break allowing the deduction of state and local taxes is reinstated. That $90bn annual break overwhelmingly benefits the rich; (54% of benefits go to the top 1% of earners).
As a result the president’s stalwarts have grasped at more exotic revenue-raising schemes of a sort which should not be designed on the fly, as they have been, and which risk distorting incentives for investment. Among these are a new minimum of 15% of tax on accounting profits for corporations, a penalty for stock buy-backs, and newly created levies of 5-8% on households earning more than $10m.
Bringing together all the president’s ambitions in a single package would have been hard enough even if the original $4trn had been forthcoming. At half that, it is impossible. And besides, very few Americans understand what the unwieldy whole is really meant to achieve. The White House might profitably pare its ambitions down to the investments most suited to equalising opportunity for America’s children. If it did so, it could at the same time clarify its message. The president could claim that the thing he had at least started to build back better was the American Dream itself. ■",1
1543,"THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS thronged the streets on July 11th. Some stoned the police and looted posh shops. Such outbursts are unprecedented in Cuba since the communists secured their hold on power in the 1960s. “Freedom!” and “Down with the dictatorship!” they chanted, and “Patria y Vida!” (Fatherland and Life), quoting an underground reggaeton song that mocks Fidel Castro’s tired slogan of “Fatherland or Death”.
All this poses an extraordinary challenge to the dull bureaucrats who rule Cuba, after the death of Fidel and the retirement of his younger brother, Raúl, earlier this year. The regime has responded with repression. “Revolutionaries, to the streets,” urged Miguel Díaz-Canel, the president who this year took the helm of the Communist Party, unleashing troops, police and loyalist mobs wielding baseball bats. At least one person was killed. Scores have been detained and the government has sporadically cut access to the internet.

Repression may work in Cuba, as it has elsewhere. But something there has snapped. The tacit contract that kept social peace for six decades is broken. Many Cubans used to put up with a police state because it guaranteed their basic needs, and those with initiative found a way to leave. Now Cubans are fed up. When Mr Díaz-Canel blames the protests on “American imperialism”, all he shows is how out of touch he is. The protesters are young, mainly black and dismiss the Castros’ revolution of 1959 against an American-backed tyrant as ancient history.
They have plenty to complain about. The pandemic has shut off foreign tourism, aggravating the economy’s lack of hard currency. Raúl Castro launched economic reforms, but they were timid and slow, permitting only minuscule private businesses. It was left to Mr Díaz-Canel to take the most momentous step, by ordering a big devaluation in January. Without measures to allow more private investment and growth, that has merely triggered inflation. As its sanctions-hit oil industry collapses, Venezuela, Cuba’s chief foreign patron over the past 15 years, has curbed its cut-price oil shipments, prompting power cuts during the heat of summer. Chronic shortages of food and medicine have become acute. Despite Cuba’s prowess at public health and its development of its own vaccine, the government has failed to contain the pandemic. The sick are dying, abandoned at home or on hospital floors.
Two other factors explain the outburst. One is the change of leadership. The Castros commanded respect even among the many Cubans who abhorred them. Mr Díaz-Canel, without a shred of charisma, does not. And the internet and social media, allowed only in the past few years, have broken the regime’s monopoly of information, connecting younger Cubans to each other and the world. They have empowered a cultural protest movement of artists and musicians. Its message, in the unanswerable lyrics of “Patria y Vida”, is “Your time’s up, the silence is broken…we’re not scared, the deception is over.”
Mr Díaz-Canel faces a choice: to turn Cuba into Belarus with sunshine, or to assuage discontent by allowing more private enterprise and greater cultural freedom. That could weaken the army and the Communist Party, but it would eventually salvage some of the revolution’s original social gains.
Curiously, many Republicans in the United States echo Mr Díaz-Canel’s description of America’s role in the protests. President Donald Trump tightened the economic embargo against Cuba, barring American tourists, curbing remittances and slapping sanctions on state firms, largely reversing Barack Obama’s opening to the island. Like Cuba’s president, Republicans argue that the unrest proves the embargo is working at last.
Not so. True, the embargo has made life harder for the Cuban government. But its restrictions mainly hurt Americans. The regime can still buy American food and medicine and trade with the world. The causes of Cuba’s social explosion lie at home.
Open the windows
Joe Biden should draw the obvious conclusion. So far he has left Mr Trump’s Cuba policy intact, so as not to annoy hawkish Cuban-Americans. Instead he should return to Mr Obama’s approach. The big threat to a closed regime is engagement with the world, especially the United States. Mr Biden should lift the embargo and deprive the regime of an excuse for its own failures. ■",1
1544,"IT IS CALLED Colorado’s last boom town. Ten thousand people stampeded into Creede in the late 1800s in search of the silver hidden within the San Juan Mountains. The town was the epitome of the Wild West, a hangout for outlaws and conmen. But more than the shoot-outs and gamblers, it was the mines that made Creede. For nearly 100 years its prosperity was tied to the price of silver. The town’s last mine closed in 1985 and only about 300 people remain. Ghost towns and the creaky remnants of old mining camps litter the mountains. Now environmentalists and residents are looking to another sparkly resource to revive the economy: the stars.
Headwaters Alliance, a local non-profit organisation, wants to create a “dark-sky reserve” in aptly named Mineral County, which includes Creede. The campaign is not unique to southern Colorado. Dark-sky communities are cropping up around the American West. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), based in Tucson, wants towns to curb their light pollution, which harms nocturnal wildlife and obscures the stars. The IDA has certified more than 130 dark-sky places globally since 2001; 14 of them are in Colorado.

Creede may have an easier time dimming the lights than other towns. Around 95% of Mineral County is public land. The Rio Grande National Forest and the jagged cliffs of the San Juans envelop visitors in darkness. Alex Handloff, who is leading the effort to create the reserve, has equipped volunteer “Astro-rangers” with meters to measure the light emitted in different parts of the county.
In addition to the environmental benefits of darkness, Creede residents hope their pristine night skies will draw more tourists to help prop up the town’s post-mining economy. Campers and hikers visit in the summer, but the rest of the year is lonelier, says Jan Crawford, one of the first supporters of the reserve. “There is a joke”, Ms Crawford offers, that “there’s a $50 bill that floats around Creede and just goes from one place to another all winter long.” But floods of people are not wanted either. Mineral County’s population has grown by 22% in the past decade, though locals suggest that is due, in part, to better people-counting. As more Americans move West, small towns are puzzling over how to encourage economic growth without sacrificing their rural charms. Focusing on dark skies, Mr Handloff suggests, is the kind of “low-impact” tourism that might strike the right balance.
Some residents are still wary. Many small-town Coloradans share a libertarian aversion to being told what to do—even with something as small as the kind of porch light they install. More than anything else, though, preserving the night sky means getting comfortable with near-total blackness. “There’s wonders out there,” says Ms Crawford, “so don't be afraid of the dark.”",1
1545,"WHEN IT COMES to tackling climate change, the British government lacks neither ambition nor self-regard. In 2019 it enacted a law committing itself to reaching net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. A medium-sized country that accounts for 1% of global emissions believes it can pull the rest of the world along at a UN climate conference next month in Glasgow. But is Britain serious about keeping its own promises? A flurry of government plans released this week suggest not.
The net-zero strategy contains many bold targets, which often come with caveats. By 2035 Britain will be powered entirely by green electricity, “subject to security of supply”. By the same year, every new home-heating system installed should be an efficient electric-heat pump or a hydrogen boiler, so long as the costs of such things fall to a reasonable level. Tree-planting will more than double in speed.

Wisely, the government recognises that there are many ways to reach net-zero emissions. Britain may move quickly away from fossil fuels and to electricity provided by wind turbines and new nuclear-power stations. Alternatively, it could rely on hydrogen, capturing the carbon released when it is created from natural gas. The government will spray money at lots of tech—hydrogen production, small nuclear reactors, devices that take carbon from the air—in the hope that some work cheaply.
“It’s more detailed and ambitious than anything you’ll find elsewhere in the world,” says Chris Stark, chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, an official watchdog. Inevitably, some government departments (such as business and transport) have bolder, more detailed plans than others (such as agriculture). But it is useful to know which are the laggards. Encouragingly, most political critics of the plans argued that the government should do more, not less.
Yet getting to net zero, or even close, is so difficult that Britain must do everything right. And there are two weak links in the chain that connects dreams to accomplishments. Unfortunately, these are the two strongest institutions in the government.
The first is the Treasury. The problem is not so much that it might have provided more money to speed the green transition, although that is true. A much-touted £450m ($620m) subsidy scheme for heat pumps may cover only 30,000 installations a year, for example. The larger problem is what Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official who now works at the Institute for Government, a think-tank, calls the department’s “wholly owned, proprietorial approach” to tax.
The Treasury sees its job as collecting money from the public and distributing it to other departments, to be spent (often unwisely, it fears) on their projects. It does not regard taxes as devices to help departments achieve their objectives. So the transport department must try to decarbonise the roads by subsidising electric cars and banning the sale of petrol- and diesel-powered ones. The more obvious (and economically efficient) route of taxing fuel more highly is out of the question.
The second weak link is the prime minister, Boris Johnson. This week he shilled for his government’s green plans with typical bonhomie. He cheerfully misquoted Gordon Gekko from the film “Wall Street”, likened himself to Moses and assured readers of the Sun newspaper that the “greenshirts of the boiler police” would not “kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet” and seize their gas-fired devices.

Political salesmanship and cheer are good things. The trouble with Mr Johnson is that he cannot bear to deliver bad news. The government’s net-zero strategy contains soothing words about working with the grain of consumer choice. There is, as the prime minister puts it, not “a hair shirt in sight”. But if Britain is to reach net zero, many noses must be put out of joint.
Especially noses belonging to people on whose votes Mr Johnson depends. The old have bigger carbon footprints than the young, largely because they tend to live alone or with one other person. Their consumption patterns will have to change. Yet the Conservative government relies on older voters (see charts). Nasty geographical patterns exacerbate the problem. Installing a heat pump costs around 7% of average net housing wealth across the Midlands and north of England, where the Conservatives won many new votes at the general election in 2019, but less than 3% in London, where the party has given up.
Mr Johnson could be bolder. A poll for The Economist by Ipsos MORI finds not only that 83% of Britons are concerned about climate change, but also that 51% believe the cost of tackling it will, in a year’s time, be larger than any savings from things like lower heating bills and cheaper petrol. Only 9% think the savings will be higher than the costs. People expect the trade-off to be more favourable in ten years’ time. Britons seem to be prepared for hair shirts. They just don’t want to wear them forever.■

1546,"THE LINGYIN temple in Hangzhou, a lovely, tree-shaded place, has long drawn those seeking the blessings of a good marriage or children. Pilgrims may still be glimpsed today. On a recent afternoon Chaguan watched a mother and daughter leave a tour group to pray, incense sticks held aloft, to a statue of Guanyin, a Buddhist immortal, before hurrying back to their guide.
In centuries past, praying was all that many Chinese, especially women, could do, for they were powerless about much in their lives. Marriage was a transaction between families, not a love match. It led, almost invariably, to a woman moving into her husband’s home. There, her role was to give birth to heirs, meaning sons, and to care for his parents in their dotage. A woman could not own property and, once bridal payments and dowries had been exchanged, brought so few benefits to her birth family that married daughters were likened to “sprinkled water”. In cruel consequence, girls were often killed at birth.

A few marriages were different. Since the Qin dynasty in the third century, a family without adult sons might recruit a poor but healthy man to “lend his strength” to their household as a live-in son-in-law. Some signed contracts agreeing to give their children their wife’s surname and to look after their parents-in-law before their own father and mother. Shocked by such breaches of filial piety, officials in the Yuan and Ming dynasties (between the 13th and the 17th centuries) banned men who were only sons from entering into such unions. Men who did faced widespread scorn. They were called zhuixu, or “mortgaged sons-in-law”, or, more politely, shangmen nuxu—“gate-entering sons-in-law”.
Modern China is becoming more open-minded about what constitutes a good family, and with good reason. A national census unveiled on May 11th showed that China is ageing fast and has one of the world’s lowest fertility rates, so its population will soon be shrinking. Though the one-child policy became a two-child policy for most urban residents in 2016 and is set to loosen further, its malign effects will endure. Lone children must care for elderly parents without any help from siblings, which is one reason why many of them do not want offspring of their own. Because China is missing millions of women, lots of young men will never marry. Years of illegal, sex-selective abortions skewed China’s birth ratio. The census finds that 111 boys are born for every 100 girls.
With fewer women, an optimist might imagine they would gain more power over whom they marry. There are other reasons why chauvinist traditions may fade. China is an increasingly urban, mobile country. Some 376m people live in a different city or town from the place named on their hukou, the household registration papers that limit where Chinese may live, work and obtain public health care or schooling. China is better educated, with over 200m university graduates. What is more, women students have outnumbered men on college campuses since 2009. In another change, families that own homes in larger cities have become wealthy after a decades-long property boom, especially if they bought apartments 20 or more years ago. Lots of those newly rich families have one child, a daughter, and—quite properly—are ambitious for her. The Beijing College Students Panel Survey, a big study, found that women students are more likely than men to come from affluent big-city families (and to study liberal arts). Male students are more likely to hail from poorer, provincial families and to study sciences or engineering, reflecting family hopes that they will land well-paid technical jobs.
Predictably, it is not hard to find educated, urban women demanding more say over their lives. At the Hangzhou temple, Chaguan meets a fresh-faced couple emerging from the Guanyin shrine, and asks what they wished for. “I prayed we’ll endure the test of time, I don’t know about him,” replies Chen Jiajia, shyly scrutinising her boyfriend, Chen Jingsheng. Now 25, they met at high school in the southern province of Guangdong and have been together for seven years. Most women expect a man to own an apartment before marrying, Mr Chen said. That is a big pressure in a city as expensive as Guangzhou, where he works in information technology. A native of a small city, Meizhou, he lacks a Guangzhou hukou, another obstacle to buying property. Ms Chen has Guangzhou papers, and her family helped the couple to buy a flat. “They see potential in him, they think he is driven. If he weren’t, our parents would not support us in this way,” explains Ms Chen, who works in e-commerce.
Less predictably, such social trends are bringing new attention to an old tradition, that of zhuixu. Li Jiyan, a matchmaker from Xiaoshan, a district of Hangzhou, specialises in finding graduates from poorer provinces to marry property-owning women from his city. His file-choked office is lined with framed photographs of him being interviewed by Chinese television stations and newspapers about the 1,000 marriages he has brokered since 1999. Men on his books must be graduates of vocational college or university, earn 100,000 yuan ($15,540) a year and be taller than 1.70m. Crucially, they do not need to own property in Hangzhou.
Never mind love, let’s talk apartments
Mr Li is busy, fielding telephone calls from potential clients and turning away a young man who walks in but lacks a college degree. “Don’t give up,” he calls after the crestfallen youth. By taking in a poor outsider, families gain a biddable son-in-law and children bearing their mother’s name, he enthuses. He adds approvingly that “non-local boys” will take humble jobs, like riding delivery scooters, if graduate work dries up. Though he praises self-made men, Mr Li’s business model is really founded on inequality, a scourge of ancient and modern China alike. In a moment of candour, his wife once remarked that no home-owner would become a gate-entering son-in-law. The couple charge 15,000 yuan for two years’ matchmaking. If that fails, there is always prayer.■",1
1547,"LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The standard setter for global trade finance flows has proposed a new set of rules to define sustainability in the trade finance arena, worth some $5 trillion a year, an executive told Reuters.
While governments and business sectors move quickly to set guidelines for some types of sustainable finance, there are no standards for trade finance. Those rules would apply to a third of global trade.
Agreeing on a common rulebook could help direct more trade flows toward efforts that reduce climate-warming emissions and that also meet the United Nations' development goals, said Andrew Wilson, policy director at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
While others have begun to set definitions for parts of the sustainable finance industry, such as green bonds, ""none of those frameworks can be easily or reliably applied to the financing of trade,"" Wilson said on the sidelines of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.
A framework for trade finance is considered more complicated as more parties are involved and entire supply chains need to be monitored, he said.
Banks and companies are assessing the sustainability of their trade deals in different ways that can be hard to reconcile.
On Wednesday, the ICC released a position paper that it expects to be formalised as guidelines in 2022. The paper was produced with the Boston Consulting Group based on input from more than 200 companies and banks including HSBC (HSBA.L), Santander (SAN.MC) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE).
More input would be sought, including with civil society and governments, before the framework is finalised to ensure support and consistency between the banks in how they classify transactions.
If the framework is considered workable, the ICC would look to develop sectoral standards for specific types of transactions, Wilson said.
While the ICC rules are not compulsory, the group is a recognised standard-setter, Wilson said, noting that its decisions are often referred to in court decisions.
He said he expected the framework to be under consultation until the second quarter of 2022, when a more detailed framework would be delivered. Final rules would then come in the third quarter.",0
1548,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",0
1549,"Migrants evicted from their squalid Dunkirk camp by French police have set up a new encampment in a field next door, MailOnline can reveal.
Others have erected their tents in woods less than half a mile away from their demolished camp to keep alive their dream of finding a place on a boat to the UK.
The crowded camp on an area of abandoned industrial land and was home to 1,500 migrants until it was closed down by police at Grand-Synthe near Dunkirk.
Residents of the camp were given the option of being taken by coach to shelters across France in return for going through the French process for asylum seekers.
But most of them chose to continue living rough and refused to accept the offer out of fears that it would hinder their long term aim to reach the UK. 
Small groups of migrants today returned to their old camp and broke through the fences erected by police in a half-hearted bid to seal off the entrance.
MailOnline today witnessed pitiful scenes as former camp residents rummaged through stinking piles or rubbish left behind after the mass eviction. 
Migrants piled up old clothing, bedding, tents and pots and pans into supermarket trolleys which they wheeled away to their new camps.
Others chopped up pallets and other construction material from flattened makeshift shelters to get fuel for their camp fires.
Many of the migrants including families with children had only a short distance to travel to their new home in the field next door to their old camp.
They included Iraqi Kurdish mother Kazhal Rzgar, 46, and her two daughters Hadya, 22, and Hasta, seven, and her and her two sons who put up their old tent in a corner of the field.
The family have been surviving largely on food hand outs from charities since they arrived 16 days ago at the Grand-Synthe camp after landing in Italy on a migrant boat.
Her son Mubin, 16, said: 'We are staying here because we want to come to England. We think England is so nice. You can get a job, go to school and have good weather.'
Mubin admitted that his family had paid 'so much money' to people smugglers to reach Europe, but he refused to say how much.
His family left his father behind five-months-ago in Darbandikhan in the Kurdish administered area of Iraq so they could head to the UK and make new lives.
Mubin said: 'It is hard living here in the cold and rain with no toilets and no money. But when I get to England, I want to go to school and then get a job as a barber.
'France is good, but my mum doesn't like France. The language is so hard. English is easier and we have family in Birmingham as well.'
He said that his family faced borrowing at least 2,500 euros each to get a place on a boat across the English Channel.
Mubin added: 'It is so dangerous on the boats, but we have to go.'
  Hadya, a former art student at a Kurdish university, said: 'In Iraq we have no money and no life. People are not good. Life is good in England. You have a home and everything is good.
'When I get there, I want to be an artist or an actor in a film'.
Accounting student Harem, 28, who has also set up his tent in the field, said: 'We want to go to England, of course, but I don't know how. You have to pay for a boat, but I don't have any money.'
He admitted that life was intolerable in the old camp, saying: 'We lived here like monkeys. The police just turned up and told everyone to leave. They destroyed my food and they took my everything.'
Harem said he had saved up for eight years working as a building labourer to pay for his passage from the Kurdish capital Irbil in Iraq.
He flew to Dubai and then on to Belarus before he got over the border to Poland and then caught a train to Germany as part of a travel package he purchased in Kurdistan.
But he said that the 1,050 euros that he had were stolen by corrupt Polish border guards in return for them letting him into the country.
He confirmed he was an economic migrant, saying he wanted to leave for the UK because he was 'unable to get a proper job' at home.
Iranian migrant Mohammed, 19, said he was among around 100 people who had defied the police by spending last night back in their old camp.
He said: 'This was a horrible place to live because of all the rubbish. Everyone was always hungry. But I am going to live in one of the new camps now.'
Police and local council officials have so far made no effort to clear up the piles of rubbish left at the old camp.
The abandoned debris includes scores of trollies taken from the Auchan superstore opposite the camp as well as broken up tents mixed up with rubbish including used nappies, blankets, sleeping bags, odd shoes, mattresses, bottles, cans and other food containers.
Most of the debris was piled in heaps around the open tarmac area where migrants had setup their hundreds of pop up tents.
Other shelters were left inside one of the old warehouse buildings on the site.
The camp which had been dubbed the 'New Jungle' in reference to the notorious Jungle camp in Calais which closed in 2017 was closed after trebling in size in recent weeks.
Officers with riot shields faced little opposition as they entered the camp which is believed to have been managed by gangs of people traffickers.
The closure was ordered French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin after he
spoke with British counterpart Priti Patel about migrant crossings in the Channel.
But his office insisted on Tuesday that the clearance was not a direct result of the call between the politicians, and had been pre-planned.",3
1550,"KISHIDA FUMIO, Japan’s new prime minister, has voiced no opposition to the corporate-governance reforms of Abe Shinzo. His predecessor’s efforts to make Japanese companies more focused on shareholder returns and less beholden to insider management were central to his economic reforms. But nor has Mr Kishida said much in their favour. Proposals for tax breaks for companies that increase wages have made it into the manifesto of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as have references to the importance of stakeholders over shareholders. That will worry those who think Japanese shareholder capitalism has not yet gone far enough.
A new test will provide more evidence of Mr Kishida’s attitude to changing the behaviour of Japan Inc. In September SBI Holdings, a financial conglomerate, made an unsolicited takeover offer which would raise its holding in Shinsei Bank, a regional lender, from around 20% to 48%. SBI has ambitions to create a Japanese megabank through alliances and acquisitions. The consolidation of the country’s multitudinous small banks is precisely the sort of change the corporate-governance reforms were implemented to facilitate. Shinsei Bank opposes the offer as it stands, making it a hostile bid, still an extremely rare event in Japan. It is willing to defend itself using a “poison pill” which would dilute SBI’s holding, subject to shareholder approval in a meeting on November 25th.

That puts the government in a tricky position. It holds around 22% of voting shares in Shinsei Bank through the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan and the Resolution and Collection Corporation. These institutions are involved as the result of a bail-out long ago of Shinsei’s former incarnation. The government cannot sell the stake because rules prevent making a loss on Japanese taxpayers’ investment, but it can vote on the poison pill.
Approval, rejection or an abstention would offer some fresh insight into the government’s appetite to press ahead with reforms that have brought a number of welcome changes. The prevalence of cross-shareholdings has declined. Among non-financial companies listed on the Topix 100 Index, the total number of shares held in this way dropped by around 20% between March 2013 and March 2020. The proportion of all listed firms adopting anti-takeover measures has also fallen from 19% in 2012 to 8% last year. Over the same period, the portion of companies without a single outside director went from 45% to 1%.It seems to have worked. Profits (measured by a common Japanese accounting standard) as a proportion of sales reached 6% shortly before the pandemic, the highest level since records began in 1950s.
There is still room for improvement says Nicholas Benes of the Board DirectorTraining Institute of Japan. He regards disclosure as a crucial area where a change of policy could yield significant results. In June the country’s corporate-governance code was revised to require listing the skills and experience of directors as well as broadening disclosure requirements for large listed firms in fields such as environmental policy. “This is a jungle of largely unreadable, sometimes encrypted [documents], written with a variety of different formats,” says Mr Benes. Standardising such publications and making them machine-readable would be a simple way of improving investors’ access to information.
Greater scrutiny can yield results. In June Toshiba’s chairman, Nagayama Osamu, was ousted by shareholders following a report that alleged that the firm’s management and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry had colluded to put pressure on big investors to back management at an annual general meeting. (He expressed his regret at the “unacceptable events”.) But efforts at reform often get bogged down by Japan’s bureaucracy. The Ministry of Finance, the Financial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Ministry of Justice all play a part in introducing and enforcing new regulations.
Clear leadership by Mr Kishida might help to set a path through the swamp. The outcome of the takeover attempt at Shinsei will show whether there is still enough momentum to improve corporate governance or whether old impulses run deep. ■

1551,"TO PREVENT THE next pandemic, it would help to know how this one started. However, the answer to that question might embarrass China’s rulers. So they have obstructed investigations into how the virus emerged, and promoted far-fetched theories about it having originated somewhere else. The world thus has only a shaky understanding of what happened in Hubei province in the second half of 2019.
American spooks are about to finish a 90-day review of covid-19’s possible origins, on President Joe Biden’s orders. It is unlikely to reach a firm conclusion. Yet it is clear that the answer China least wants to hear—that the virus could have leaked from a lab in Wuhan, or been picked up by a researcher collecting samples in the field—is plausible. And it would not be the first time this has happened. The flu pandemic of 1977, which killed 700,000 people, is now believed to have begun with a lab leak in north-east Asia—possibly in China, possibly in the Soviet Union. With new laboratories being built all the time to handle dangerous pathogens, and with the era of synthetic biology just around the corner, the task of tightening lab biosafety has become urgent.

People who work with deadly pathogens do so with scandalously little transparency or supervision. Rules in some places are not legally binding or subject to independent oversight. That has to change. The world needs to know who is working with which pathogens, where, and under what sort of safety protocols. (Intelligence agencies do not see this as part of their remit, but they should.) International standards are needed, and a global body to advise on the most dangerous kinds of work. This will be hard to accomplish, but there is a precedent. A committee of the World Health Organisation (WHO) monitors and inspects the two labs that hold smallpox, a deadly virus that was eradicated in the wild through vaccination, and reviews proposed research.
America, which could be leading the way, is not. Researchers who receive federal grants to study pathogens have to follow federal rules. Private labs are not so constrained. This will not do. Ideally there would be an agreed set of basic rules, enforced by a watchdog that is independent of the bodies that fund research. The backers of a project cannot be neutral arbiters of its safety.
Many other countries follow America’s lead on biosafety. So if it improves its rules and procedures, others will, too. That could be a step towards a proper set of global norms. And it would be in every country’s interest, even China’s, to abide by such norms. Meetings this year to discuss a pandemic treaty offer a chance to harmonise rules on lab biosafety. Organisations such as the WHO, the G7 and the OECD could also do more to promote transparency and security.
Governments need to ask whether certain kinds of research are too risky to be allowed. Gain-of-function research, which genetically alters organisms such as viruses in ways that can make them more dangerous, deserves special scrutiny. So does viral collection in the wild.
New tools are needed as well as new rules. Real-time genomic surveillance at border crossings could catch novel pathogens as they emerge. Sewage and air could be sampled more widely. Ways to create vaccines even faster should be explored.
And if some scientists complain that all this will make their work costlier and harder, there is an obvious rejoinder. Perhaps 15m people have died directly of covid-19, and the resulting economic damage has impoverished many millions more. If better biosafety reduces the chance of another pandemic even slightly, it will be cheap at the price. ■

1553,"THE TAGLINE for the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association (APSA) held in Seattle last weekend read “Promoting Pluralism.” Under the sunny geometric windows of the city’s convention centre, and through the poorly lit rectangles of Zoom rooms, scholars met to discuss, among other things, the various threats to American democracy, and whether the country’s polarised political parties could peacefully coexist. Like experts on the use of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, the spectre of some disastrous future hung over the discussions and was made only slightly less alarming by the technical language used to describe it.
Scholars of American politics are particularly dismayed by rising levels of “affective polarisation,” the political science term for the hostility one person feels towards members of the other party relative to the feelings they have towards members of their own party. Levels of affective polarisation have risen more than two-fold since the 1970s when the American National Election Studies, a quadrennial academic survey started at the University of Michigan, began asking citizens to rate how they felt about members of either major party. In 1978, according to the survey, the difference between Americans’ ratings of members of their own and ratings of members of the other party on a 100-point “feeling thermometer” scale was 27 points. The gap had widened to 56 by 2020.

Lilliana Mason of Johns Hopkins University calls this phenomenon “identity-based” polarisation. In her 2018 book “Uncivil Agreement” Ms Mason crunched a mass of survey data to reveal how ideological, religious and racial identities have become “sorted” into overlapping mega-identities captured almost entirely by the words “Democrat” and “Republican.” One result, she concludes, is that isolated and warring tribes have become “relatively unresponsive to changing information or real national problems.”
That problem—that people’s political affiliations determine what information they absorb, rather than the other way around—is bad enough. Yet the degree of contempt partisans have for each other is even more troubling. In a paper Ms Mason presented at the conference alongside Nathan Kalmoe and Julie Wronski, two of her frequent co-authors, the researchers conducted a series of experiments to gauge the extent to which Americans thought certain groups deserved life-saving aid if they were infected with covid-19; if the economy should be reopened even if it would hurt certain groups; and whether disproportionate deaths among the opposing party were deserved or not. They found that respondents were much likelier to say disproportionate deaths among supporters of the other party were more acceptable than deaths among their own.
Discounting suffering on the other side destroys the empathy that liberal democracies require. In a 2019 paper, Mr Kalmoe and Ms Mason studied the extent to which voters rationalise partisan violence against their opponents or express outright support for it—what they call “moral disengagement” and “lethal partisanship”. They also found that 60% of partisans said the opposition was “a serious threat to the United States”, and 40% said opponents were “downright evil”. People with strong attachments to either political party were more likely to exhibit such views.
Between 5% and 15% of Americans in either party endorse violence depending on the circumstances. Mr Kalmoe and Ms Mason are updating their work on partisan violence for an upcoming book, “Radical American Partisanship”. According to new data, Americans of both parties have become more morally disengaged and more likely to endorse violence since the authors’ first study in 2019. They also find that since the 2020 elections Republican voters have become more likely to hold these views, and to endorse violence against political leaders—presumably because their champion lost.
Even though the strength of these feelings is striking, polarisation is such a familiar problem that merely mentioning it can act as a mental sedative. Suggestions as to how to lessen polarisation sometimes have the same quality, though the assembled political scientists deserve credit for trying. Erin Rossiter, of the University of Notre Dame, has found that even imagining a conversation with an opponent can cause at least a temporary reduction in hostility to supporters of the other party. Ms Mason and Mr Kalmoe find, in a final set of experimental studies, that telling Republican voters that Mr Trump had asked them to abstain from violence decreased the share of them that thought it was acceptable in pursuit of political goals. What party leaders say, and how they conduct themselves, really matters.■",1
1554,"CALL IT “Zoom face-envy”. Because of the rise of video-conferencing during the pandemic, legions now spend hours staring at their own faces and, inevitably, comparing them with those of others. Poor lighting and the skewed angles of laptop cameras are rarely flattering. Nor is “lockdown face”, brought on by stress, or a dearth of sunlight and exercise. For Kim, a 57-year-old actress in New York City, Zoom seemed to add ten pounds and a “crepey” look to her skin. After seeing “way too much” of that, she got a facelift last summer. She is delighted with the result. Similarly, Michèle Le Tournelle, a 62-year-old retiree near Nantes in France, said the “horrible” confinement turned into “a revelation”: it spurred her to undergo a slimming procedure and a facelift with which she has been “very, very, very” pleased.
Many cosmetic surgeons had expected the pandemic to hammer business. Instead the industry is enjoying a Zoom-boom. The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery reckons that the pandemic has led to a 10% increase in cosmetic surgery countrywide. In France, despite limits on elective procedures during the pandemic, cosmetic surgeries are up by nearly 20%, estimates the French Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. For Ashton Collins, the boss of Save Face, a firm in Cardiff that refers people seeking minimally invasive cosmetic treatments to the 852 (and counting) practitioners it has accredited across Britain, business is “through the roof”. In Italy, Pier Andrea Cicogna of Studio Cicogna, a plastic-surgery clinic in Treviso, says his revenue has risen by nearly a third despite more than three months of closure.

Every day can be Christmas
Apart from face-envy, other forces are at play. In the age of teleworking, patients can recover inconspicuously at home as bruises and swelling fade. It helps that professionals, the biggest clients for pricey cosmetic surgery, are more likely to work from home than many others. In normal times finagling time off work is a big hurdle (which is why Christmas breaks have traditionally been the high season for cosmetic surgery). Recuperation is made easier by the widespread use of face-masks, which neatly hide away the signs of surgery to the nose, chin, cheeks and jawline, as well as the “resurfacing” of facial skin and lip-plumping.
Money not spent on clothes, evenings out and travel has financed much of this. Gains in the stockmarket have also helped, says Alan Matarasso, whose clinic in New York is “being stretched” by requests for surgery. Intriguingly, Dr Matarasso, a former president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, thinks a more ethereal force is also at work: by casting light on “the fragility of life”, the pandemic is imbuing people with greater desire to squeeze more out of whatever time they have left.
Covid-19 has highlighted our helplessness, concurs Richie Chan, the head of cosmetic surgery at an OT Healthcare clinic in Hong Kong, which has enjoyed a roughly 15% rise in procedures; as a result people have become keener to exert control over their bodies through elective surgery. Pierfrancesco Cirillo, head of the Italian Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery in Rome, points to previous increases around the world in minimally invasive procedures following the 9/11 attacks (about 6%) and the global financial crisis (10%). The pandemic, he says, has coincided with a record rise in cosmetic surgery of about 12% in Italy.
Surgeons marvel at another recent change: before the pandemic, one in ten of Studio Cicogna’s surgery patients were men. Now it’s one in five. Most operations are for eyelids, noses and “love handles” liposuction. For minimally invasive skin rejuvenation, the proportion of male clients has risen from roughly one in eight to nearly half. In Britain men now account for about 40% of skin rejuvenations, says Save Face.
Zoom gloom
By highlighting her defects when she made calls for her PR job, Zoom had become demoralising, recalls a 47-year-old single mum in Milan: “I felt uglier.” Being stuck at home without occasion to dress up didn’t help. “I really needed to do something to feel better,” she says. Eyelid surgery wiped “ten years off my face”, she reports; the operation was “psychologically therapeutic”.
Such satisfaction is common, but it is not universal. Some psychologists fear that the boom in beauty treatments is encouraging an obsessive-compulsive disorder sometimes called dysmorphia. Sufferers obsess over an imagined or exaggerated body flaw. This can be magnified by a morose mood and a lack of normal social interaction—not to mention more time spent comparing oneself to others. As a result, Dr Cirillo says, cosmetic surgeons must work harder to turn down those with a pathologically confused self-image.
A less acute but more common problem is that a growing share of those asking for surgery seek an unattainable appearance. Dr Cirillo worries about the emergence of a “sort of supermarket” for aesthetic surgery in which less-principled surgeons accept patients with unhealthy or unrealistic aspirations. As they cash in, surgeons would be wise to avoid would-be patients who show up with photos of an envied celebrity. Success is more likely with those who, less ambitiously, present pictures of their younger selves.",1
1555,"MANUEL SUFFERED two serious brain injuries as a child in Denver, Colorado. The first was the result of a fall. The second occurred when someone threw a rock at his head, causing him to lose consciousness. He made it the short distance home before blacking out. On both occasions he received brain scans but he does not remember getting any other treatment.
As a teenager, Manuel was sent to a school for disruptive children. In his early 20s he tried to strangle his stepfather who, he says, was violent towards his mother. He was sent to prison. Last year he suffered a third brain injury when he fell out of a pickup truck travelling at high speed. He spent six days in a coma. When he woke up he had no recollection of what had happened. He was later jailed yet again for violating his parole.

Manuel’s story is far from unusual. Brain injuries affect about 8.5% of the general population but rates among prisoners are far higher. Kim Gorgens, a neuropsychologist at the University of Denver, reckons that between 50% and 80% of prisoners and those on parole in America have brain injuries. A review of research in America, Australia and Europe suggests that the average reported rate is around 46%. Research conducted in 2010 by Huw Williams of the University of Exeter put the rate among men in British prisons at 65%. A study published in 2017 found that nearly half of all prisoners in New Zealand had been hospitalised for a traumatic brain injury before committing their crime. Researchers suspect that the numbers may be even higher in poorer countries because road-traffic accidents and violence are generally more common.
People who sustain brain injuries are more likely to go on to commit crimes, including violent ones. They are more troublesome while in prison and more likely to reoffend on release. This is especially true for those, like Manuel, who are injured as children. Adrian Raine, a psychologist and criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, is pretty convinced that there is a causal link. He points to research that follows people over time, as well as natural experiments in which otherwise law-abiding individuals suffer a brain injury and then display antisocial behaviour. “It’s a bit like saying smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” Dr Raine explains. “Most people do not get lung cancer. We will never do a randomised controlled trial for it. But do we act on it? Sure we do.”
For many the damage is done early. Brain injuries are particularly common among boys and young men, whose brains are still maturing. Those from poor backgrounds who live in cities are especially at risk. A curious child who is rarely supervised is more likely to fall and seriously hurt himself. A reckless adolescent who thinks he is invincible is more likely to crash his car or get punched in the head. They are then far more likely to drop out of school and end up in prison. Brain injuries are one of many risk factors for crime which disproportionately fall on poor people (though most lead law-abiding lives).
People tend to associate traumatic brain injuries with sports such as American football, boxing and rugby. In fact they are more usually caused by falls, road-traffic accidents and fights. The front of the brain, where the frontal and temporal lobes are located, is often damaged. Higher emotions, such as compassion, seem to be concentrated there, as does conscious decision-making. Long-term memory formation is mediated by the hippocampi, which are in the temporal lobes. Broca’s area and Wernicke's area, both important in the development of language, are located in the frontal and temporal lobes respectively.
The longer a person is unconscious, and the more injuries they sustain, the more severe the effects. People become forgetful. Many find it hard to concentrate. They may struggle to manage their emotions and to understand the feelings of others. Their behaviour and personality may change, although many sufferers fail to recognise this in themselves.
Brain injuries seem to make a minority of people more violent. Paul (not his real name) had a number of minor convictions when he was involved in an accident which caused a bleed on his brain and left him in a coma. After that his crimes became more violent. Since his accident he has done things that were “out of character”, he says from a prison in Wales. He knows that he has hurt people but he does not remember his crimes. “When I get told later on what I’ve done and what’s happened, I’m gutted.”
Seena Fazel of the University of Oxford has made cross-references between Swedish health-care and crime records. He found that people who had gone to hospital for a brain injury were more than three times more likely then to commit violent crimes than the rest of the population. They were also twice as likely to do so as their siblings. Damage to the prefrontal cortex, which seems to increase aggression and impulsiveness, may explain this. Another Swedish study found that almost half of a sample of (mostly old) patients with frontotemporal dementia exhibited criminal behaviour. The figure for those with Alzheimer’s in the same study was 15%.
Michael has a scar on his head where he was hit by a car at the age of seven. None of his six siblings has ever been in any serious trouble, but he started stealing cars and motorbikes and breaking into factories when he was a teenager. Drugs made his problems worse. He also suffered from anxiety and depression. Michael is now in his 50s. He reckons that he has spent more than 20 years in prison over the course of his life.
His experience fits with what Dr Gorgens has found studying inmates and probationers with traumatic brain injuries in Colorado. Some 96% had problems with substance abuse and 79% suffered from some kind of mental illness. It is a vicious cycle, says Dr Gorgens. Substance abuse is more likely in people who have suffered brain injuries, and people with brain injuries are more likely to develop addictions. Separate research shows that after suffering a brain injury, people with mental-health problems were four to seven times more likely to commit a crime than before. When you are dealing with so many problems at the same time, it is easy for them to spiral out of control, explains Dr Gorgens. This is especially true for those who have alienated their family and friends, as people with brain injuries tend to do. They are more likely to end up homeless, unemployed and to commit suicide.
Addressing the problem head-on
Michael has turned his life around. He and other campaigners want officials to acknowledge the problem of brain injuries among prisoners. Some are beginning to do so. The British and Australian governments are carrying out reviews of how they treat such offenders. They are also looking at a broader set of “neurodiverse” conditions which are disproportionally common among inmates, including learning and intellectual disabilities and autism. Criminal-justice systems need to work better for those whose brains work differently. That might also reduce crime.
In New Zealand, a pioneer in this field, the focus has been on reforming courts. Andrew Becroft, a judge who used to run the Youth Court, was shocked by how many young offenders had neuro-disabilities. “History will judge us very harshly,” he says. The court now screens defendants for brain injuries and has tried to adapt its procedures to take account of their needs. So does the Young Adult List court, which deals with 18- to 25-year-olds. Officers of the court talk to defendants in clear English instead of legal jargon, and provide handouts to those who struggle to understand what is being said. “It’s fundamentally a matter of fairness,” says John Walker, the court’s founder and chief judge. “If a person came into the court who couldn’t speak English, they would be given an interpreter.” He argues the same should be true for those with neuro-disabilities.

Philippa Birch works for The Disabilities Trust, a British charity that trains people to go into prisons to raise awareness of brain injuries among inmates and staff. People working in prisons often think those with brain injuries come across as aggressive or rude, says Ms Birch. They stand too close or do not pay attention to instructions. She explains the effects of brain injury and reassures prisoners about how they can manage them. Prisoners find lessons in controlling their emotions and anger particularly helpful. Overworked prison staff are grateful for the smoother interactions.
TBI in Criminal Justice, a collaboration between the University of Denver, various charities and the Colorado courts and sheriff departments, is helping prisoners with brain injuries adapt better to prison and prepare for the world beyond. Some learn how to use a diary to get to appointments on time. Others master breathing techniques to help them stay calm under pressure. These cheap but effective strategies can be the difference between someone avoiding a needless parole violation and going straight back to prison. The team hopes the project will reduce the state’s recidivism rates which, at 50%, are among the highest in the country.
Some could benefit from better medical treatment. That might mean medication: antidepressants for anxiety or stimulants for fatigue and improved cognitive function. But in the long term most treatments for brain injuries are largely therapeutic. Neuro-rehabilitation relies on recognising that the brain is to an extent able to adapt its structure and function, a process known as neuroplasticity. Physical and speech therapy can help people regain lost function. Computerised “brain training” games can improve recall and attention. The earlier and more intense the intervention, the better the prospects of recovery. But coping strategies can be taught at any stage after an injury.
Identifying those who need support could prevent people from drifting into crime. Mr Becroft, now New Zealand’s children’s commissioner, argues that children should be screened for brain injuries and other neuro-disabilities when they start secondary school to ensure that those who need help get it. Campaigners are also keen to prevent more brain injuries from happening in the first place. That might mean teaching parents about the risks, or encouraging people to wear helmets.
A report in 2016 by the Centre for Mental Health estimated that in Britain the cost of traumatic brain injury in a 15-year-old who goes on to offend is around £345,000 ($475,000). The cost to those affected—and society more widely—is incalculable. ■",1
1556,"Editor’s note: On August 26th, shortly after this article was published, two explosions outside Kabul airport killed dozens, including both Afghan civilians and American troops. This followed warnings that a group affiliated to Islamic State might carry out bombings at the airport. Our report on the explosions and their implications for the evacuation from Afghanistan can be found here. In this article we look at how the jihadist threat could spread around the world.
WHEN A NEW American president takes office, the leaders of other countries compete to be the first to speak to him. When the Taliban took over Kabul, there was a similar rush to speak to Abdul Ghani Baradar, the public face of the Afghan militant group’s leadership. The winner was Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, the Islamist group which controls the Gaza Strip. The read-out of the call posted on Hamas’s website has Mr Haniyeh congratulating Mr Baradar on his victory against the “American occupation” of Afghanistan. It would, he said, be “a prelude to the demise of all occupation forces, foremost of which is the Israeli occupation of Palestine”. Mr Baradar responded in kind, wishing Hamas “victory and empowerment as a result of their resistance”.
Such diplomatic niceties were matched with an outpouring of celebration from other jihadists. In the Idlib province of Syria, occupied by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group thought to have ties to al-Qaeda, the organisation which launched the attacks of September 11th 2001, fighters held a parade and handed out baklava on street corners. Three days of celebration were announced in the districts of southern Somalia controlled by al-Shabab, another al-Qaeda affiliate (pictured, training, above). On social media jihadists from all over the world shared memes celebrating the Taliban’s victory, notably a pastiche of Joe Rosenthal’s famous picture of American marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.

America and its allies invaded Afghanistan on October 7th 2001. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, was living there under the protection of the Taliban, who were also providing his al-Qaeda followers with training facilities. America demanded that the Taliban hand him over; they refused. Within weeks anti-Taliban forces had driven them from Kabul with the help of American air power and ground forces.
Since then America has not suffered a terrorist attack on anywhere near the same scale. And as an organised, and organising, force, al-Qaeda is a shadow of what it was. Osama bin Laden is dead, killed in Pakistan, to which he had retreated, in 2011. The fear of a similar end, delivered by drone or special forces, forces his successors to live in hiding, thus hugely complicating their operations. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian who became al-Qaeda’s leader after bin Laden’s death, has not been seen in almost a year—either through fear of death or because he has actually died. Though affiliates like al-Shabab have celebrated the Taliban’s victory, al-Qaeda’s central organisation has not said a word.
But the violent jihadist Islamism it pioneered has not been defeated. Al-Qaeda affiliates and other jihadist groups are active in conflicts not just in Pakistan and the Middle East but across the African Sahel and in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Not all those who embrace the label truly see themselves as part of a global struggle; many are more focused on their “near enemies” than the “far enemy” of America and its Western allies. But struggles with near enemies still bring about suffering, destroy livelihoods and force people to leave their lands, becoming refugees. They breed instability.

The ability to mount outrages like that of September 11th has apparently been curtailed by better intelligence, pressure on finances and a drumbeat of raids and drone strikes. But jihadist doctrines continue to inspire attacks by loner jihadists in America and Europe, though currently not at the rate seen in the mid-2010s. And the fight against jihadism entails, or acts as a pretext for, all manner of human-rights abuses—most notably in western China, where it is used as justification for the systematic oppression of the Uyghur and other largely Muslim groups.
As jihadist ideology has been espoused ever more widely, Western countries have sent troops, advisers and money to more and more places. Counter-terrorism and “countering violent extremism” have become worldwide industries. In 2020 America had 7,000 active troops stationed in a dozen or so African countries, plus training missions in 40 more, with militant Islamism the predominant focus.
The Taliban’s return to power is undoubtedly the most trumpetable moment for jihadists since Islamic State (IS) took advantage of Sunni disaffection to create a “caliphate” in western Iraq and eastern Syria in 2014. That inspired terror attacks in Europe and Indonesia. This victory is in some ways a greater one. For the first time since the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in 1989, Islamists have taken a country from a superpower. “Everyone else is saying, wow, if those guys can do it, so can we,” says David Kilcullen, a former soldier and counter-terrorism expert at UNSW Canberra, the military academy of the Australian Defence Force. “They’re dazzled, amazed and impressed by what the Taliban have achieved,” says Mina Al-Lami, who follows media used by violent and non-violent Islamists alike for BBC Monitoring.

What that means in practice will depend on how things play out in Afghanistan, how well the morale boost is transformed into victory on the ground, and how the countries the jihadists are targeting respond.
It’s cold outside
Militant Islamism did not start with the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Its intellectual origins go back to the 1950s and 1960s, when radicals in Egypt began to develop a new ideology based on the rejection of socialism and capitalism and the secular, nationalist regimes in thrall to them. Sayyid Qutb, a leader of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, became the movement’s great theorist. In America, to which he had fled to escape the attention of the Egyptian secret police, he was radicalised by his disgust at the natives’ morals and sexual mores, which represented “the nadir of primitiveness”. His driving motivation was the idea that Muslims were being brutalised by the regimes in their own countries which aped the materialism of such irreligious others.
Qutb was executed by the Egyptian authorities in 1966; the Muslim Brotherhood which he had reshaped continued in various countries, often underground. But in the Soviet-occupied Afghanistan of the 1980s his ideas took on a new form, going beyond resistance to individual regimes to become a worldwide armed struggle sometimes known as Salafi jihadism.
The Soviet Union’s invasion in 1979 had prompted hundreds of fighters from across the Muslim world to head to Afghanistan to join the mujahideen, or “holy warriors”. Bin Laden, a young Saudi who had inherited a fortune from his father’s construction firm and who studied under Qutb’s younger brother Mohammed, was one. So was Aden Hashi Farah Aero, one of the founders of al-Shabab. Abdelmalek Droukdel, one of the founders of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a group that fights in Niger and Mali, was there too, as was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the founders of what became IS. In Afghanistan they saw the beginnings of a jihad that would eventually lead to a truer, purer existence in submission to God.
Their common origin and faith, and their shared espousal of a lofty goal and barbarous tactics, does not make the world’s jihadis a united front. The fighters in Iraq who founded IS did so because they thought al-Qaeda too soft: the Afghan branch of IS has been in a bitter war with the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan for years. It was one of the few Islamist groups not to express admiration after the fall of Kabul, instead denouncing the Taliban as, in effect, American lackeys. The group’s newsletter, al-Naba, sneered that “Supporting Islam does not pass through the hotels of Qatar nor the embassies of Russia, China and Iran”, referring to the Taliban’s political offices in Doha and its relations with infidel states. As The Economist went to press, there were warnings that an IS-affiliated group was planning an attack on Kabul airport.
The animosity is reciprocated. The only execution the Taliban have admitted to since taking over was of Abu Omar Khorasani, IS’s leader in South Asia. But IS is an outlier. Mr Kilcullen is not alone in fearing that the Taliban may again allow Afghanistan to become a base for other jihadis. In the deal negotiated with America in Doha in 2020 the Taliban promised to disavow al-Qaeda and its international mission. They never did so. According to a UN estimate there may be between 400 and 600 members of al-Qaeda in the country, many sheltered by the Taliban.
Sirajuddin Haqqani, the Taliban’s deputy leader, runs a particularly brutal semi-autonomous outfit called the Haqqani network which, among other things, used to serve as Mr al-Zawahiri’s connection to the Taliban. (If the al-Qaeda leader is still alive it may well still do so.) Members of the Haqqani branch of the Taliban have been prominent in patrolling Kabul since it fell to the militants.
Such connections do not mean that al-Qaeda will be able to swank about with impunity rebuilding its operations. The Taliban are unlikely to want anyone to start planning attacks on America or Europe, certainly not straight away. “For now al-Qaeda is lying low due to instructions from the Afghan Taliban,” says Asfandyar Mir of Stanford University. But the Afghan regime change could nonetheless spread jihad to targets closer by.

A particular concern is Pakistan. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a jihadist group commonly called the Pakistani Taliban, waged a savage war there from 2007 until around 2014, when they were for the most part pushed back into Afghanistan. Having licked its wounds and regrouped, the TTP, many members of which are affiliated to al-Qaeda, has recently been stepping up its activities, with 120 attacks in Pakistan last year and 26 last month. The return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan has already emboldened the TTP, and could well see it better supplied.
The Pakistani government has long backed the Taliban in various ways. It will welcome the weakening of Indian influence in Afghanistan heralded by their return to power. Militants it supports in Indian-administered Kashmir may well get a boost from Afghan fighters flowing back over the Hindu Kush. On Pakistani television on August 23rd the chairman of the party of Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, said that “the Taliban say they're with us and they will come and liberate Kashmir for us.” Though a renewed TTP poses a problem, Pakistan probably thinks it can be kept in check by diplomatic and economic pressure. Afghanistan depends on Pakistan for a lot of imported goods. That said, now that the Taliban are back in power, they may feel they need Pakistan less.
A direct flow of materiel or soldiers from Afghanistan to conflicts beyond South Asia seems less likely. The al-Qaeda affiliates in Africa and the Middle East may have been founded by men who fought in Afghanistan, but they have fewer direct links to the country today. Travelling to and from Afghanistan is harder than it was in the 1990s, says Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute, an American think-tank, and harder than it was to travel to Syria when IS was in its pomp.
Dunes and dooms
Even if it does not lead to direct support from the Taliban, though, America’s departure from Afghanistan will be a huge morale boost to jihadis. This may be especially true in conflicts where outsiders are involved on the government’s side. Keep on fighting, the lesson runs, and eventually the foreigners will give up and leave—even if they have been there for decades. And then you will win.
That may be right. In June Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, promised that French forces in the Sahel, the region defined by the southern edge of the Sahara desert, would not remain there “eternally”. The deployment of the country’s force there, a mission known as Operation Barkhane, began in 2013 after jihadists seized the northern half of Mali. The Sahel’s jihadis have kept the force, which now numbers 5,100, busy ever since.

America has been part of the same fight. It built a huge military base in Agadez in Niger, another of the “G5” countries in the Sahel facing jihadist insurgents. (The other three are Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania.) It also deployed around 800 fighters in its special forces to Somalia, where they carried out raids on al-Shabab and co-ordinated more than 200 drone strikes.
Last December Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of most American troops from Somalia. Drone strikes were also stopped, though in July they started up again, under tightened rules of engagement. European funding for African troops in Somalia has been cut; Ethiopia, which has occupied parts of Somalia since 2009, is pulling its soldiers out to fight its own civil war in Tigray. France has begun a process by which Barkhane will have be halved in size and focusing more on killing terrorists than on protecting towns and cities. “As Africans, we face our day of reckoning just as some sense the West is losing its will for the fight,” wrote Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria, in the Financial Times on August 15th.
The Western withdrawal is not from a position of success. What happened in Kabul could be re-enacted in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab has been using Taliban-like tactics for some time, says Samira Gaid, the director of the Hiraal Institute, a security think-tank in Mogadishu. They undermine the government and international forces with terrorist attacks, while running a shadow government, even in government-controlled areas, to pay their fighters.
Much like the Taliban, they thrive on providing residents with a modicum of security beyond the gift of a failing state. Their violence is not popular, says Hussein Sheikh Ali, also of Hiraal, but their efficiency is admired. “If there is a man with a checkpoint and he gives you his word, you get it; if there’s a judge in their court and he says something, it will be enforced.” By contrast, the internationally recognised Somali state is repeatedly ranked as the world’s most corrupt.
In the Sahel over 700 people have been massacred by al-Qaeda and IS so far this year. The latest attack, in a Malian village near the border with Niger on August 8th, killed 51. This somewhat undercuts the opinion of Marc Conruyt, the French general who commanded Barkhane until July, that “the Sahelian forces are [today] able to cope with the armed terrorist groups.”
Worse than the old boss
Since the militants tend to recruit among the Tuareg and Fulani minorities from the north of Mali, men from those groups are often crudely profiled by soldiers from the south of the country, where the militants are less pervasive. Ethnicity is not the only thing which can lead to an attack. So can wearing underpants (most Malians do not, so this is seen as evidence of having been in Libya). “People I know who have had fathers, brothers and sons killed then joined the militants,” says Corinne Dufka, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a charity based in New York.
The response to Islamist terrorism promoted by the West has often focused far too tightly on training security forces, says Michael Keating, a former British diplomat who has worked in both Somalia and Afghanistan and is now the director of the European Institute of Peace, a think-tank. It would be better to provide political space for them to operate in. “There’s this tremendous focus on training, comms, all of the technical stuff,” he says. But “actually if you’re going to build a sustainable institution, you’ve got to make sure that the institutions are extremely well grounded.”

In Somalia, where British and Turkish troops have been training the security forces, getting them to fight is not only a question of their technical abilities. It is a matter of building up local institutions worth fighting for. The same is true of the defence forces fighting in the G5 countries.
So what happens if the jihadists succeed? Few Islamist militants anywhere in the world have got as far as being able to govern much more than villages and rural districts. When they spread more widely, popular support is often vital. When IS took over the Iraqi city of Mosul they were initially welcomed by mostly-Sunni residents, who saw them as an alternative to the violence and corruption of the Shia-dominated Iraqi security services. Governments supported by America or Europe tend towards corruption as their officials look to make money from the spending being pumped in long-distance.
The new bosses provided services long neglected by the government, such as streamlined electricity bills and rubbish collection. And their installation saw a welcome fall in terrorist violence, since they had been responsible for much of that which had been going on before.
Nevertheless, they were also committed to a caliphate run along what they took to be the lines of the earliest Muslim civilisation. They quickly banned women from travelling outside alone, cracked down on vices such as smoking and drinking and started persecuting religious minorities. The level of popular dissatisfaction with those in power soon surpassed that which had originally seen them welcomed.
Money matters, too. While fighting, jihadists are able to extort revenue by taxing traffic on the roads and illicit industries; the Taliban have done well from opium production. In power they typically need more revenue and cannot raise it in the same ways without delegitimising themselves. In Syria and Iraq IS developed a lucrative taste for ransoming foreigners. In Mozambique the jihadists who took over Cabo Delgado in early August have subsequently relied on looting banks and running extortion rackets on businesses. This means that they can pay their fighters, procure arms and continue the struggle. But the money gathered by looting or hostage-taking dries up. Foreign currency ceases to flow. Things get desperate.
Some of the same fate may await the Taliban. Before Kabul fell, the teachers who worked in schools and the doctors in clinics in Taliban-occupied territories were still paid by the central government in Kabul—and in turn by foreign donors. Taxing the transport of, say, fuel only works if there is foreign currency to pay for it. Afghanistan’s reserves, which are largely held with the Federal Reserve in New York, are now frozen; it is not clear whether bilateral aid to the government will continue. There will still be ways to bleed the economy. But those giving the blood are liable to resent doing so.
Pen and sword
Jihad is not, in principle, the only way to get the strict Islamist states its followers desire. They could in theory be voted for. Governments with significant Islamist representation have had success in parts of Asia. But attempts to institute fully Islamist governments in the Arab world have proved strongly susceptible to backlash when their initial popularity wanes. The Muslim Brotherhood ruled Egypt for less than two years before a coup returned them to powerlessness, jail and worse. Last month, Tunisia’s president sounded the death-knell on Islamism’s participation in politics by dissolving the parliament in which an Islamist leader was speaker.
Tempting, then, to see the sword as mightier than the pen. Islamists who recall Egypt’s former Muslim Brotherhood leader, Muhammad Badie, appealing to his followers to face down tanks with peaceful activism say such ideas are now mocked and denounced online. “The Taliban is capturing the popular imagination. When you express your thoughts against this violence, many attack you. It’s a bit worrying,” says Osama Gaweesh, an Egyptian journalist exiled in London. With poverty soaring and politics constrained in many Middle Eastern states, frustrations crave an outlet. Some speak of a renewed faith in mass action, this time carrying guns modelled on the Taliban. “They’ve given up trusting bankrupt and elite Islamist parties and organisations,” says Naim Tilawi, a Jordanian Islamist who fought in Syria. “They want mass jihadism instead.” ■",1
1557,"“THE WORLD wants you to be typical …Don’t let it happen,” Jeff Bezos warned in April in his last annual shareholder letter as CEO of Amazon. Hence bewilderment that his e-empire is to adopt a retail format that is very typical indeed: the department store. Having helped drive many chains out of business, it is now eyeing the format to boost its own retail fortunes.
As a company, Amazon is entering a more mature phase. Now with a new chief executive, Andy Jassy, it is being forced to recognise that pure e-commerce has limits. It is also facing fresh competition from conventional retailers like Walmart and Target that are belatedly showing that they, too, can do the internet well.

Amazon’s high-street presence is small. Since 2015 it has opened 24 bookshops in America. Its 30 “4-star” shops, which stock items customers rate highly, function like a walk-in website. Whole Foods, an upmarket grocer it bought in 2017, contributes the bulk of its physical-store revenues, which accounted for just 4% of Amazon’s total sales in the most recent quarter. Its new Amazon Fresh grocery chain and Amazon Go cashierless stores barely chip in.
So the new 30,000-square-foot (2,800-square-metre) retail spaces it is reportedly envisaging mark a departure. Amazon has neither confirmed nor denied its plans. But leaked details on the stores’ size and locations suggest substance behind the reports. The first are to open in California and Ohio. If they go well, Amazon is expected to roll out more.
Why invest in the high street just as covid-19 has lifted e-commerce? The growth rate of sales on Amazon’s platforms, including third parties, had slowed before the crisis, from nearly 30% a year to below 20%. The trend reasserts itself as people return to shops. In the past quarter Amazon’s own online sales grew by only 16%, short of investors’ (muted) expectations.
In future customers will want “omnichannel” retail that combines online and physical shopping, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a broker. As for Amazon’s move into department stores, he has one question: “What took them so long?” The firm’s motive is also defensive. Walmart has made omnichannel work well during the pandemic by melding its formidable physical network with its website and offering a same-day “click-and-collect” service.
Getting more physical may not be easy. Amazon’s bricks-and-mortar performance has been ho-hum. Whereas most other big American grocers’ sales have doubled or even tripled in the pandemic, those of Whole Foods have barely budged, notes Sucharita Kodali of Forrester, a research firm. Amazon’s total physical-store revenues last year were 6% lower than in 2018.
Making Amazonmarts appeal to shoppers may be harder than Amazon anticipates. It reportedly wants them to sell its cheap private-label garments and gadgets, which is at odds with its aspirations for the stores to offer high-end fashion, where it has struggled online. It is unclear if the outlets will mimic existing examples of the department-store canon, as Amazon Fresh shops resemble conventional grocers, or if Amazon plans to shake things up.
Another question is how the move will affect returns for shareholders. Amazon should be able to rent or buy locations cheaply—bankruptcies have left many department-store properties up for grabs. Yet investors may be disappointed that Amazon will devote ever more resources to retail. Many prefer its faster-growing, vastly more profitable and techier businesses: digital ads and cloud computing. “Why tackle a dying industry?” asks Ms Kodali, suggesting that Amazon could have another crack at making smartphones.
Amazon’s share price is down by 8% since its latest results. As well as posting slower online sales for the second quarter it forecast slowing total sales in the next. It also warned that costs will rise sharply in the future as it ramps up investing. Physical retail would claim some of the dosh. The irony would not be lost on Sears and other defunct department stores. ■

1558,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",0
1559,"ON OCTOBER 8TH two journalists, Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov, won the Nobel peace prize for their “efforts to safeguard freedom of expression”. The Kremlin congratulated Mr Muratov for being “brave”, which he is. Six of his colleagues at Novaya Gazeta, the Russian newspaper he founded in 1993, have been murdered.
Ms Ressa is brave, too. Her news organisation, Rappler, started as a Facebook page in 2011. It is one of very few in the Philippines that criticises Rodrigo Duterte, a president who urges the police to kill suspects without trial. At least ten journalists have been murdered since Mr Duterte came to power. In 2016, when he was president-elect, he said: “just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you’re a son of a bitch.”

The Nobel award recognises a sad truth. Globally, freedom of expression is in retreat. The bluntest methods of silencing dissent are widely wielded: autocrats and criminal gangs often use the sword against the pen (or bullets against bloggers). Many governments also lock people up for peacefully expressing their views.
But these old-fashioned forms of repression are increasingly reinforced with or replaced by newer techniques. Freedom House, a think-tank, reports that in the past year efforts to control speech online escalated in 30 of the 70 countries it monitors, and receded only in 18 (see map). Many autocrats and would-be autocrats look with envy at China, where the Communist Party has overseen the construction of a walled-off information sphere, within which criticism of those in power can barely be seen or heard. None can copy it exactly, but many are deploying digital tools to curate the information that reaches their citizens.

Some autocrats still believe that suspending internet services completely is a good way to stymie critics, particularly in an emergency. In 2020 there were at least 155 regional or national internet shutdowns in 29 countries, according to Access Now, an NGO. More than a hundred of those took place in India. But shutdowns batter economies and make strongmen look crude. In 2011 a panicked Hosni Mubarak, Egypt’s dictator, tried to quash a revolution by switching off the internet. Outrage—and boredom—spurred even more Egyptians onto the streets. Mr Mubarak was ousted.
China’s model is more sophisticated. Its national firewall blocks access to foreign social media and a host of other sources of information. Armies of human censors scan Chinese websites. Controls are constantly refined. In 2009 the government suspended internet access almost entirely in Xinjiang, a western region, following riots there. Now the internet is up again but police force Uyghurs, an oppressed minority, to install mobile apps that spy on all their online activity. They can be locked up for downloading a foreign product such as Skype, or software that lets them visit foreign sites such as Facebook.
Any government can order an internet service provider to blacklist sites it doesn’t like. Turkey blocks nearly 470,000 sites. It added 59,000 to the list last year. But creating a firewall even remotely like China’s is hard, even for governments willing to spend billions. One reason is that China’s internet infrastructure was built, from the outset, with these kinds of controls in mind. The party was blocking sites as early as 1996, when only about 150,000 Chinese were online.
Another reason China’s controls have proven so effective is that it has a domestic market big enough to support home-made alternatives to every major international website. There is plenty of content inside the firewall to keep Chinese web users entertained, so it chafes less. The sheer size of the Chinese market also reduces the economic costs of walling off the national web. Meanwhile, the Communist Party has extraordinary powers to boss domestic web firms around. Companies such as Tencent, a social-media giant, and Baidu, a search engine, have to hire, train and manage most of the censors who keep China’s internet spotless.
China also exports software and hardware that help other regimes build a more authoritarian internet. Iran is a happy customer. Officials there cite China’s “great firewall” as a model to emulate. Iran already blocks popular foreign services such as Twitter and Telegram. But its pious leaders think it has not gone far enough. The government has been working to create an alternative internet known as the National Information Network. The idea is that all its services would be hosted on domestic servers, with access linked to national identity cards.
Virtual insanity
Russia’s plans for purging the domestic internet of free thought are among the most ambitious. Vladimir Putin claims that the global internet is a tool of the CIA. In 2019 he signed an “internet sovereignty” law with the proclaimed goal of protecting Russia from online threats to its security. That law ordered all providers to install technology that allows the Kremlin to track, filter and reroute traffic.
Gregory Asmolov of King’s College London says that although Russia is ramping up its controls years after China began doing so, it is benefiting from being able to plug in much more modern kit. Roya Ensafi at the University of Michigan says the government is growing keen on tools that make websites slow to load, instead of completely unreachable. That renders them useless for distributing photos and video (the kinds of content the Kremlin finds most troublesome). It is more difficult for clever web users to get around than old-fashioned methods of blocking sites, and more difficult for organisations that monitor and publicise cases of online censorship to detect.
The Russian government is also trying to nudge its citizens to stop using big websites headquartered abroad. It is throwing money at Rutube, an alternative to YouTube owned by Gazprom, the state gas giant. Blocking YouTube is not yet feasible; ordinary Russians would be outraged if they could no longer watch cooking shows and celebrity tittle-tattle on it. But if enough content is herded onto Rutube, it might one day be possible to shut down YouTube without too much backlash.
Meanwhile, all new mobile phones sold in Russia must be set to use Yandex, a Russian search engine, by default. The government plans to require all public-sector workers, including teachers and university professors, to use only Russian email and messenger services while doing their jobs.
Other governments are also trying to persuade users to ditch foreign sites. The United Arab Emirates steers residents towards messaging apps with murky origins (at least one is connected to a government-backed firm). When members of India’s ruling party fell out with Twitter earlier this year they began encouraging their supporters to use Koo, a local alternative. In January spin doctors working for Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said they would no longer communicate using WhatsApp, a messaging service owned by Facebook. They encouraged people to sign up for Bi P, a product of Turkcell, a big Turkish telecoms company.
Autocrats reckon that having more citizens on domestic services will make it easier to police what they say. They are also using new software to spy on citizens no matter which devices they own or which websites they visit. Freedom House says 45 countries in its sample were found to have used such “spyware” at some point in the past 12 months; it calls this a “crisis for human rights”.
In July investigators for more than a dozen newspapers said they had obtained 50,000 phone numbers of people who they believe were being considered for surveillance by clients of NSO Group, an Israeli firm that helps governments snoop on mobile devices. The governments included those of Mexico, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. The list of people who may have been surveilled included journalists, politicians and human-rights activists. A British judge ruled in May that Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, even used spyware to monitor his ex-wife. Snaffling personal data from people’s devices not only helps governments smear critics. It also discourages whistle-blowers and other people with important stories from speaking to journalists, for fear their identities will leak.
All this whizzy technology is increasingly combined with new laws to chill speech. Last year police in at least 55 of the 70 countries monitored by Freedom House investigated, arrested or convicted someone because of posts made on social media. That was the highest number of any year since the index was launched 11 years ago. They include a woman in Thailand who was sentenced to 43 years in jail for sharing clips from a podcast that criticised the monarchy (her initial sentence, of 87 years, was reduced because she pleaded guilty). Thailand is among several countries which have used “computer crime” laws to greatly expand the types of speech that can be considered criminal.
Lately web firms, not users, have been the target of most new rules. One increasingly common requirement is that they must store user data in the country in which it is generated, where governments can more easily get at it. China has required this since 2017. Other jurisdictions that have passed or are drafting similar legislation include Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Bangladesh.
India’s government is especially keen to tame digital firms. It is demanding that WhatsApp identify who first sends any message on its platform, which would require removing the end-to-end encryption that protects its users’ privacy. New rules which came into effect in February require big social-media firms to establish offices within India’s borders, and appoint local representatives. These people face up to seven years in prison if their employers do not comply with local rules. These include taking down within 36 hours content the government deems threatening to public order, decency, morality or national security. To say that such vaguely worded statutes are open to abuse is putting it mildly.
In Turkey Mr Erdogan was accusing journalists of spreading “fake news” long before Donald Trump made it fashionable. Now his ruling Justice and Development party is considering making the publication of “disinformation” on social media a crime punishable by up to five years behind bars. The government doubtless hopes it will help keep a lid on dissent. Kerem Altiparmak, a human-rights lawyer, notes that the government has already succeeded in taming Turkey’s press. He says if authorities can now subdue social media “the free flow of information will end.”
Last year Turkey gave individuals and companies the right to demand that tech firms delete some information about them. This supposedly emulates the “right to be forgotten” held by citizens of the European Union, but safeguards against abuse of the new system are weak. By the end of 2020 nearly 40,000 news reports had been blocked or removed from the web by court order. These include a story about an adviser to Mr Erdogan who forged his high-school diploma, messages posted to a forum about the president’s wife’s luxury handbag, and articles about a wrestling champion who was convicted of rape. The web censors have occasionally ended up chasing their own tails. Earlier this year, after one court blocked access to a story concerning a tender secured by a friend of Mr Erdogan’s son, a second court blocked access to news reports about the first court’s decision.
In a few cases new rules aim not to delete speech, but to ensure that governments’ own propaganda stays put. Leaders of all stripes took fright when, in January, big social-media sites suspended Donald Trump’s account for inciting insurrection. In September Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, signed an update to internet rules narrowing the circumstances under which firms can remove posts that they believe breach their in-house moderation policies. Mexico’s senate majority leader has proposed a law that would allow the country’s internet regulator to restore posts and accounts that social media firms have decided to take down. In June Nigeria began blocking Twitter after it deleted a message from the president, Muhammadu Buhari, alluding to Nigeria’s civil war, in which perhaps 1m people died, and warning modern secessionists that they would be treated “in the language they understand”.
Autocracies will doubtless continue to combine high- and low-tech ways of suppressing online speech. During tense times in Egypt police have sometimes stopped people on the streets and demanded they unlock their phones, to see if they have shared anything subversive. Soldiers in Myanmar have been carrying out similar duties since the army launched its coup in February. Freedom House finds that last year people in 41 countries were beaten up or killed because of things they had said online. In a speech in 2019 Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, warned online critics outside the country that they risked reprisals. His words carried especial menace, since Rwandan dissidents abroad have often met untimely ends. “Those making noise on the internet do so because they’re far from the fire,” he said. “If they dare get close to it they will face its heat.” ■",1
1560,"SHEREZADE, A YOUNG widow, needs cash to pay for her son’s leukaemia treatment. She accepts $150,000 in return for sleeping with her boss Onur, a balding misogynist who advises his friends not to trust women because “perfidy fills them like the weave of their beautiful garments”. Unexpectedly, the pair fall in love. But—plot spoiler—it takes two failed engagements, one divorce, the appearance of illegitimate children, a miscarriage caused by poisonous tea, a few assassinations and one suicide for the couple finally to commit to one another in episode 179 (the son survives, too).
When the Turkish soap opera “1001 Nights”, loosely based on the classic collection of Middle Eastern folk tales, first aired on Chilean TV in 2014, it broke viewing records. Mega, the ailing broadcaster that bought the rights, was the only channel to make a profit that year. It has bought the rights to 26 other Turkish shows since then, and remains one of the country’s most popular channels.

The largest market for Turkish shows used to be the Middle East. But recently Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have boycotted or banned Turkish shows because of the country’s embrace of the Muslim Brotherhood and its support for Qatar (the relative freedom of Turkish female characters does not help, either). Latin America has filled the gap. Turkish production companies say that a third of revenue from foreign sales comes from there, more than any other region. Somewhat conservative themes resonate with many Latin Americans. “We like big families, big dinners, and we value things like respect for elders,” says Ozlem Ozsumbul of Madd Entertainment, a distributor.
From Ecuador to Mexico, prime-time slots are now filled by Turkish shows. “Kara Para Ask” (Black Money Love) counts Lionel Messi, an Argentinian footballer, as a fan. In 2018 Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, visited the set of “Dirilis: Ertugrul” (Resurrection: Ertugrul), where he tried his hand at blacksmithing, wore a traditional hat, and is said to have compared himself to the show’s hero, the father of the founder of the Ottoman Empire.
But the biggest fans of Turkish telenovelas are señoras of a certain age. They like them because they are less raunchy and gory than local shows, with their gun-toting drug lords. It takes 28 episodes before Sherezade and Onur share their first kiss, which even Argentina’s leading conservative newspaper complained lacked “fervour”. Norma, an 82-year-old in Buenos Aires, likes Turkish shows because “they are so decent, so romantic.” Her carer, Karina, adds: “Argentine telenovelas are too extreme, on the first date they already have sex!” They watch Turkish shows every day from 4pm until Norma goes to sleep.
It also helps that, in contrast to Turkey, where dramas are shown once a week and can run for over two hours, in Latin America these shows are chopped up into shorter chunks. This makes them far easier to watch; it also helps boost the ratings of the TV channels, which can spin out the tales over hundreds (if not thousands) of episodes. The formula may feature few besos, but it brings in plenty of pesos.■",1
1561,"Washington, DC (CNN)Westport, Connecticut police chief Foti Koskinas would love it if his patrol cars could drive themselves, but his department isn't buying Teslas equipped with ""full self-driving.""  Local governments like Westport and businesses big and small sing the benefits of electric vehicles like Teslas. Westport has saved thousands on fuel and maintenance since purchasing a Model 3 in 2019. Police departments are among the fleet operators that are increasingly turning to electric vehicles for the economic and environmental benefits. Koskinas said he's received more than 500 inquiries from departments around the world asking about Westport's use of electric vehicles.  Westport has saved nearly $7,000 a year on fuel and maintenance costs, he said. There could be more savings coming. Westport expects to save $5,000 a vehicle if it can use Tesla's on-car computer, rather than installing its own for critical features like scanning license plates, controlling lights and sirens, and radioing colleagues. Discussions are on-going between Westport and Tesla, Koskinas said. But for all their Tesla enthusiasm, there's one feature they overwhelmingly aren't touching — ""full self-driving."" Some say the technology isn't ready yet.  The $10,000 optional software feature includes driver-assist features that Tesla hopes will one day allow the cars to drive themselves. (The price is likely to increase, as it has in the past, so the best time to buy is likely now, for those who believe in the technology's future.) Not all Teslas have ""full self-driving."" Currently, ""full self-driving"" is available in Beta form and has only been released to a limited group of people. It can change lanes in some cases, respond to most traffic signals and steer the car.  The technology is far from perfect and requires an attentive driver behind the wheel to take control at a moment's notice. It ""may do the wrong thing at the worst time,"" Tesla warns.  Koskinas can envision the benefits if his department's cars could be trusted to drive responsibly, always doing the right thing. He said officers responding to incidents sometimes end up riding in an ambulance to a hospital, to offer support. But they must leave their patrol car behind.  ""How great if that vehicle drives itself to the hospital and meets the officer there?"" he said.  If Teslas could do that, he might buy ""full self-driving,"" he said.   ""We're just not there,"" Koskinas said of the technology today. The ""full-self driving"" option can be added to Teslas in the future even if it is not purchased at the time of sale.  Westport, Connecticut is one of six police departments that told CNN Business that they have purchased at least one Tesla, but not the ""full self-driving"" feature.  Police departments aren't the only ones taking a pass. Hertz announced in October it will purchase 100,000 Teslas, but not ""full self-driving."" Brightline, the private train operator in Florida, has a Tesla fleet of nearly 50 vehicles to give passengers rides to its train stations, which reopened this month. Revel, a mobility startup, started using Tesla Model Ys to offer rides in Manhattan this year.  Most of the Tesla buyers decline to say why they are not buying ""full self-driving."" But the technology's limits appear clear and are likely a factor. Thilo Koslowski, a consultant at AutoDGTL focused on automotive technology, told CNN Business that ""full self-driving"" is not currently a good value for fleet operators, given the technology's limits and its cost. ""They're not gaining the benefits they're looking for,"" Koslowski said. ""It's not full self-driving. It becomes a question of if it's worthwhile to spend the money."" Fleet operators want safer driving and more productive vehicles, according to Koslowski. He said there is no objective data proving that ""full self-driving"" is safer than a human driver. ""Full self-driving"" has not been shown to make Teslas today more productive, he said. Fleet operators could theoretically face liability risks if ""full self-driving"" would be active during a crash, according to Koslowski. ""That risk overshadows any potential benefits you could get from this,"" Koslowski said. ""It's such a murky gray area that I think the risk is way too high for rental companies to do that.""  The technology's limitations have been documented. Tesla drivers testing ""full self-driving"" have described it as inconsistent, sometimes impressing them, other times alarming them. Videos shot by drivers using Teslas with ""full self-driving"" show that it can brake and turn unexpectedly, and sometimes drive down the middle of the road rather than making space for other drivers.  Several Teslas using ""full self-driving"" have crashed into curbs, damaging the cars' wheels. A person who identified themselves as a Tesla owner reported to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration this month that their Tesla had been severely damaged after crashing into a vehicle while using ""full self-driving."" The agency is seeking more information about the crash, according to spokesperson Lucia Sanchez.  Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has alluded to the limits of ""full self-driving.""   ""We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition,"" he said on a Tesla earnings call this summer.  At the time he also questioned the merits of paying for a subscription version of ""full self-driving."" Then drivers with ""full self-driving"" were receiving a limited set of features, like automated lane changes.  ""Like right now, is it -- does it make sense for somebody to do [full self-driving] subscription? I think it's debatable. But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear,"" Musk said.  Tesla has repeatedly missed deadlines on when it expects its autonomous system to be widely deployed and has not issued a recent estimate for a broad deployment of ""full self-driving.""  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.  ",2
1562,"THE NEW Elizabeth Line section at Whitechapel station is austerely beautiful. Descend the escalator and sharp angles meld into sinuous curves; move towards the platform and the light shifts from cool to warm, the better to entice commuters speedily towards their trains. A sleek new one hisses to a halt—and its doors fail to line up with those separating the platform from the rails. Construction started in 2009 and should have finished in 2018, but completion is now expected only in 2023. With each delay the price tag has risen, from an estimated £14.8bn ($23bn at the time) to £18.9bn.
Rising costs and overruns are hardly unheard of in ambitious infrastructure projects: costs for HS2, a high-speed rail link, have ballooned far more and it is now at risk of being scaled back. The challenges for Crossrail were different, but it too was highly ambitious. Measuring 118km end to end, it runs beneath London from Reading, a commuter town to the west, to Shenfield, an eastern suburb. At its heart are two 21km-long tunnels, at depths of up to 40m. Each train can accommodate 1,500 passengers, not far off double capacity on older lines, and the platforms are long enough to allow carriages to be added in future. Once it is fully operational, central London’s rail capacity will increase by 10%.

The main source of difficulties was not tunnelling, as many had predicted before work started. That finished in 2015. The toughest challenge, says Mark Wild, the project’s boss, has been integrating a tangle of signalling systems. A modern interoperable one covers the whole line. Another, dating back to the 1950s with 1990s additions, covers above-ground sections that share older tracks with existing services. Finally, radio-signalling covers the underground sections. All need to work in harmony with other systems, from fire control to ventilation. In total, these involve more than 16m components, some physical and others virtual, which have generated 250,000 quality-assurance documents and are supplied by dozens of contractors.
Construction in the capital poses further difficulties. “London is both a mega-city and very old,” says Mr Wild. “You have to deal with archaeology and skyscrapers.” The renovation and expansion of Whitechapel station had to be squeezed in round sections of the Tube that date from 1876. British safety regulations are also unusually stringent by international standards.
Crossrail’s former management failed to appreciate how complex all this would be. A government spending watchdog found in 2019 that it had “no realistic plan” to deliver the programme, had designed the commercial contracts poorly, and was unaware of how delays were mounting up. Recruitment also proved tough. A follow-up report last month concluded that the new team was doing better, but new risks are still being spotted.
As the end date comes into view, however, so does an awkward question: will the commuters come? Before the pandemic most of London’s rail network was over capacity at peak times. Yet the boom in working from home puts predictions about commuting into doubt. Transport for London’s central planning scenario is for rail travel to be 18% lower by 2031 than previously forecast. The line’s managers brush off such worries. On the timescale of the Tube, says Mr Wild, the pandemic is a blip. Crossrail was designed to last 120 years, but he thinks it could survive for 300. ■",1
1563,"AFTER THE first two full days of COP26, the UN climate-change summit under way in Glasgow, Boris Johnson, the prime minister, was cautiously optimistic. He highlighted a new global pledge to tackle deforestation and suggested that the number of countries working to bring their net carbon emissions down to zero had trebled since Britain started to plan the event. Meanwhile delegates rehearsed a litany of complaints. A railway strike was averted at the last minute, only for both train lines from London to Glasgow to go down on the peak day for arrivals. Local bin-men have walked out, leaving rubbish to decay on the streets. Queues for security and covid-19 checks snaked back for hours. Social-distancing rules meant many delegates were turned away from meetings.
Even without a pandemic, running a COP summit is stressful. In Copenhagen in 2009, when 45,000 delegates descended on a space fit for 15,000, the queues were epic (and the talks broke down). In The Hague in 2000 America’s lead negotiator was hit in the face by a cream pie thrown by a protester angry at his country’s reluctance to cut emissions. The main upside for the host is the chance to burnish its environmental and diplomatic credentials.

For COP26, that means finding new niches where post-Brexit Britain can display leadership. Greenery is an obvious opportunity, says Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, an independent forum. Britain has cut its carbon emissions faster than any other rich country since 1990. Greenery plays well domestically, too, being popular with all demographic groups—and backbench Tories. The Conservative government also spies opportunities in what Mr Johnson has dubbed a “green industrial revolution”. Britain is the world’s largest generator of offshore wind power, and is investing heavily in clean-hydrogen technology. It wants to export products and know-how, and to lead the way on green finance.
Such considerations create a tension between COP as a public-relations exercise for the host, and COP as an imperfect but essential way to speed up action on climate change internationally. After the G20 summit in Rome that led into COP26 concluded with an uninspiring statement on climate change, Mr Johnson sought to position Britain as far ahead of other countries, whose promises are “starting to sound hollow” when “the solution is clear”. He touts a simplistic recipe for achieving COP26’s unofficial goal of keeping alive the stretch target agreed at COP21 in Paris in 2015, which was to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The solution, he says, is “coal, cash, cars and trees”.
Though the host of COP can make a difference by keeping everyone talking even if consensus seems distant, skilful summitry is not merely a matter of getting everyone else to do what it asks. Nor does COP26 aim to produce a concrete deal, as COP21 did. Dividing actions into discrete areas blurs the needs and grievances of poor countries, for which climate change is an urgent threat. And adaptation and mitigation depend on support from the rich countries who emitted most of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. The summit’s logistical embarrassments will be for the British government to bear alone. But success or failure—which will be quantifiable only with difficulty, and in hindsight—will belong to everyone. ■

1564,"SPEAKING IN PARLIAMENT on October 12th, Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, grappled with a problem facing countries across the world: how to contain a resurgence of the coronavirus, without imposing a national lockdown. Like other governments, his has responded so far with a patchwork of varying local rules for England (which differ somewhat from those set by the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). So he said the government was “simplifying, standardising” them, into a three-tier hierarchy of restrictions. In areas with a “very high alert level”, pubs will be shut and indoor social mixing will be banned. The government will “work with local government leaders on the additional measures which should be taken”. That may not be easy. In England, as elsewhere, management of the pandemic has frayed relations between central and lower levels of government almost to breaking-point.
From northern England to the Mediterranean, local politicians are in revolt. In Manchester, the mayor has complained that the lack of discussion and consultation makes the government “impossible to deal with”; in Marseilles, the deputy mayor has grumbled that decisions from Paris “come like a stone dropped from a bridge”; a battle between the Spanish government and the local authorities in Madrid ended up in court. All three cities were aghast at new local lockdowns imposed by the central government.

Some tension is inevitable. Worldwide, the number of new coronavirus cases is spreading faster than ever, with more than 200,000 infections reported each day on average. Governments have neither the economic resources nor the political backing to sustain another national lockdown. Yet local ones bring local objections.
Arguments over jurisdiction, process and central-government high-handedness cannot disguise a real conflict of interest between local and central politicians. It seems both unjust and unnecessary for a government to impose nationwide rules when infection rates can vary widely from place to place. In England, in the seven days ending on October 9th, the city of Nottingham in the Midlands had 834 covid-19 cases per 100,000 people. In the West Country, Cornwall and the Scilly Isles had 29. But when central governments enact lockdowns in the most severely affected areas, local politicians face intense pressure from their constituents and businesses to resist harsh measures that are not imposed elsewhere. In the parliamentary exchanges following Mr Johnson’s announcement on October 12th, Jeremy Hunt, a Conservative former health minister, pointed to China, Italy and South Korea as evidence that strict early local lockdowns are the best way of avoiding national ones.
Some of the direct problems in the fight against the pandemic have come in countries with highly centralised decision-making. In India, for example, a national lockdown imposed in March later led tens of millions of unemployed casual workers to head for their home villages, spreading the virus to uninfected parts of the country. In England, to a lesser extent, poor management of the virus has been blamed on overcentralisation. Many critics point to places such as Germany, one of the European countries admired for its handling of the pandemic, which has a public-health system embedded in local government. But even there in the early days of the pandemic tensions arose as the federal government, which has very limited competences in this area, struggled to impose any sort of consistency across the 16 states, the leaders of which would sometimes squabble in public over their approaches to covid restrictions. In Italy, parts of which suffered terribly in March and April, responsibility for health rests almost entirely with regional governments (Rome sets overall guidelines, though that includes the power to declare lockdowns in “red zones”).
Devolving decision-making does not eliminate disgruntlement. There can also be rows between two sub-national levels of government. In Italy Luigi de Magistris, the mayor of Naples, accused Vincenzo De Luca, the governor of its region, Campania, of impoverishing small-business owners by ordering the closure of bars and restaurants. Or in New York, the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, has bickered with the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, over how to handle the virus. And citizens themselves can object to policies, whichever level of administration imposed them. In New York itself, for example, angry ultra-Orthodox Jews have staged protests against restrictions on houses of worship.
Spain has perhaps suffered the worst of both worlds. Having centralised too much in the spring, it then went to the other extreme. Health services are devolved to the 17 regional governments. When the pandemic gathered force in March the national government imposed a national lockdown and centralised authority over health services and policing. Spain is still suffering proportionately the worst covid-19 numbers of any large country in Europe, with 258 cases per 100,000 people in the past 14 days and more than twice that in Madrid. The left-wing national government of Pedro Sánchez is at loggerheads with the conservative regional administration of Isabel Díaz Ayuso in Madrid. On October 9th Mr Sánchez decreed a 15-day state of emergency in the capital, to re-impose restrictions on entering or leaving the city that a court had knocked down at Ms Díaz Ayuso’s request. Spaniards have discovered that their political leaders are much more interested in squabbling with each other than in protecting their health.
And politicians everywhere are interested in their own careers. In most countries, they say they do not want the response to the pandemic to be politicised. But it always is, which is another dynamic that complicates local-centre relations. For local politicians with national ambitions, covid-19, the burning issue of the day, is a stick with which to beat incumbents. In Indonesia, for example, rivalry between the president, Joko Widodo, and Anies Baswedan, the governor of Jakarta, the capital, who is assumed to have presidential aspirations, has manifested itself in a tussle over lockdown policy. The coronavirus has interrupted many aspects of everyday life. But not politics.",1
1565,"FOR OLIVER MAYERS, a native of Montreal, living in a bilingual city is special. “It’s ‘bonjour-hi’,” he says, referring to the local hybrid greeting. Around two-thirds of people in Montreal regularly use English at work. “You can do both.”
Others say you should not. On May 13th Coalition Avenir Québec, the conservative party in charge of the Quebec national assembly, put forward a bill to bolster French as the province’s sole official language. It is likely to come into force later this year.

The bill mandates that businesses must have their signs mostly in French. Companies with 25 or more employees, moreover, will have to form “francisation committees” to monitor the use of written and spoken French. Staff who misuse the subjunctive will not be referred to human resources. At least, not yet.
New immigrants will have six months to learn the language; after that, all the government’s letters to them will be in French. The bill also seeks to add clauses to the parts of the Canadian constitution that refer to Quebec, declaring it a “nation” within a unified Canada.
It is not the only attempt to boost French. On June 15th the federal government proposed a bill to safeguard the language nationwide. On June 20th Nathalie Roy, Quebec’s minister of culture, announced that most music heard when calling a government agency, or when in a government building, should henceforth be made in Quebec and be in French. (When unveiling the policy, according to the Montreal Gazette, Ms Roy spoke of a terrible injustice: “I was on hold with the culture ministry’s phone line and I was taken aback to hear an American singing a little song in English to me.”)
Few Quebeckers are pushing for independence. After two referendums, most Canadians consider the matter closed. But if the Supreme Court rejects the attempt to declare Quebec a nation, it could rekindle a desire for autonomy, thinks John McGarry of Queen’s University in Ontario. Like Quebec, the Spanish region of Catalonia tried to define itself as a “nation” in regional statutes, but the constitutional court argued that the term had no legal force.
Meanwhile the bill has been criticised by indigenous peoples and Anglophones. Marie-Claire Lafrenière, an English-speaking mother in Terrebonne, complains that recently at a drive-thru she was told to speak French. “I feel as though I’m living under a dictatorship,” she says, showing the sense of proportion for which Quebec is increasingly renowned. ■",1
1566,"WHEN SATYA NADELLA became the third boss of Microsoft in 2014 one photograph captured the moment. It shows him flanked by Bill Gates, the co-founder and chairman, and Steve Ballmer, Mr Gates’s successor as chief executive. The two white tech tycoons strike a confident pose in casual dress. Mr Nadella, an Indian-American, skulks in a suit, smiling awkwardly.
He had a reason for that awkward smile. The company was in a ditch. While it hunkered down at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, Apple invented the iPhone, and Google and Facebook rose from Silicon Valley. Its share price barely budged for years. When he took over, says Mr Nadella, outsiders questioned if Microsoft will “make it to the other side”.

It did—with aplomb. Mr Nadella dethroned the Windows operating system as its core product. He brought Microsoft’s software and services to other operating systems, including “open source” Linux, as well as Google’s and Apple’s. Most important, he put Microsoft’s cloud-computing arm, Azure, launched in 2010, at the heart of the business. The result has been double-digit revenue growth and a market capitalisation of $1.6trn. Only Apple and Saudi Aramco, an oil colossus, are more valuable.
Microsoft succeeded in its reinvention where other tech firms seeking a second life, such as IBM and Oracle, have not. But nothing lasts for ever in the fast-changing world of technology. The old personal-computer (PC) business has slowed. The firm’s products are not always the best or most popular. Azure is considered by many experts to be technologically behind the market leader, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which the e-commerce giant launched four years earlier. Many users prefer to make video calls on Zoom and chat on Slack rather than use Microsoft’s Teams. This year Microsoft failed to buy TikTok, which might have boosted its consumer-facing business that includes the Xbox games console and (less interestingly for TikTokers) LinkedIn, a careers network; the popular Chinese-owned short-video app inked a nebulous technology partnership with Oracle instead. And Microsoft has to square up not just to Amazon but to younger tech giants such as Alphabet (Google’s parent) and China’s Alibaba and Tencent.
The pressure to succeed is immense. The firm’s shares have more than quintupled in value since Mr Nadella took over (see chart 1). They now trade at 37 times earnings, a higher multiple than those of Alphabet, Apple or Facebook (though far below Amazon’s ratio of 123). The company is priced for perfection, says Mark Moerdler of Bernstein, a research firm. And for further expansion.

Mr Nadella acknowledges the challenge. “This is not some linear transition,” he says. “When the first hockey stick plateaus the question is: have you got the other things?” In an effort to live up to the hype he is dusting off old weapons—bundling and licensing—the aggressive use of which got Microsoft in trouble with antitrust authorities from the late 1990s and earned it the moniker “evil empire”. An insider since 1992, he remembers those days, when the firm narrowly avoided a forced break-up. Can it continue to grow while steering clear of the old pitfalls?
Until 2014 Microsoft had five different business areas. Most of the profit came from three of them: Windows, its Office software (spreadsheets, word-processing, PowerPoint and the like) and programs to run the servers used in data centres and corporate networks. Entertainment and devices, including the Xbox, made a bit of money. Online services such as the Bing search engine and MSN web portal did not.
Mr Nadella reconfigured this structure. Today Microsoft’s 20 or so businesses fall into three big buckets: cloud, productivity software and business processes, and personal computing. Each contains one of the lucrative stalwarts—servers, Office and Windows—alongside lots of others such as Surface PCs and digital whiteboards, or Dynamics business software. Many of the businesses revolve around Azure, which has grown into the internal computing backbone for Microsoft’s applications, as well as a product to sell to customers. Forays into futuristic quantum computing or virtual and augmented reality stand on their own, while boosting Azure’s capabilities. So do artificial-intelligence (AI) algorithms, trained on data from Bing, LinkedIn and other places.
If any of those whizzy bets succeed at scale, they would sharpen Microsoft’s innovative edge, which looks blunter than either Amazon’s or Alphabet’s. Even if they do not, Microsoft may succeed by commercialising products rather than inventing new ones. As insiders quip, the firm is never first to market and often not second, but “man, we will make all the money”.
That has certainly been true of Office. Excel was not the first spreadsheet (remember Lotus 1-2-3?). But it is deemed by many software engineers to be the most consequential program ever written, in part because it has been so widely adopted. Around 1.2bn workers use Office or Office365, a web-based version served up through Azure. Here, too, Microsoft lagged behind Google’s G-suite software, which, among other things, enabled multiple users to work on one document at the same time. Googlers make digs at what they see as Microsoft’s offline, “save as” mentality.
Still, managers prise Office—and especially Excel—from desk-jockeys at their peril. As a result, Microsoft controls 87.6% of the market for such software, to Google’s 11.5%, according to Gartner, a research firm. To boost Teams, Microsoft has started bundling it with Office365 free of charge; by April Teams had 75m daily users. Unfair, rivals say; in July Slack launched an antitrust suit against Microsoft. It calls Teams a copycat product aimed at killing it—just as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer vanquished Netscape, a rival web browser, which led to its battle with trustbusters.
Critically, Microsoft has been a superfast follower in the cloud. In Mr Nadella’s book about the firm’s transformation, “Hit Refresh”, he described how, by the time he took over, AWS had built a vast cloud business with no competition. “Amazon was leading a revolution and we had not even mustered our troops,” he wrote.
The stakes are huge. Over time most of the world’s companies are expected to move computing to the cloud. The share of IT spending going to the cloud is approaching 10%. But that already amounts to an annual market of $240bn. Given expected annual growth rates of nearly 20% it could reach $1trn before long.

In the cloud Azure faces two big rivals—AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)—and two others—Oracle and Alibaba Cloud. Its market share has risen steadily, to 18% (see chart 2). Again, Microsoft’s rapport with firms’ IT departments has served it well. It still dominates parts of business software and nearly four in five personal computers run on Windows, as do 72% of all servers. It can offer corporate clients a single price that bundles Azure with Office and other software. That way Azure can end up costing only a fifth as much as AWS, Microsoft claims (AWS disputes this). And it is easier to use than Amazon’s offering, whose advanced features overwhelm even some IT professionals.
It is also easier to swallow for many clients than Amazon products. When Microsoft pitched for business, recalls a former executive, Azure would lose the technical evaluation but win out of customers’ fear that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s insatiable boss, might use their money and data to invade their turf. Suspicion of Mr Bezos may explain why AWS lost a $10bn Pentagon cloud contract to Microsoft, despite being tipped to win. Amazon believes Microsoft benefited from Donald Trump’s feud with Mr Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper the president does not like. Amazon has legally challenged the award, unsuccessfully so far.

Azure aims to match or overtake AWS in the cloud. Yet in Gartner’s closely followed ranking of cloud providers Azure comes in well behind AWS and has lately slipped down (see chart 3). The way Microsoft has built its global cloud infrastructure, covering more geographical ground than AWS but more thinly, may make it less reliable. Gartner cites insufficient redundant capacity to deal with data centres knocked out by bad weather or other problems. Even without disruptions, capacity has proved problematic. As demand has surged in the pandemic, with millions of remote workers switching to the cloud, Azure has at times been unable to keep up. Microsoft Teams suffered a blackout in March. That month Microsoft put in place temporary resource limits on new Azure subscriptions. AWS has not needed to.
Azure blues
Microsoft cannot afford to get Azure wrong. It is what drives its share price. Azure is estimated to make up only a tenth of Microsoft’s $53bn in annual operating profit. But every quarter Wall Street fixates on how fast the cloud is growing, notes Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Recently analysts have been disappointed to see growth slow, from 59% year on year in the first three months of 2020, to 47% from April to June. (It is some comfort that AWS’s growth has also slowed in recent quarters.)
Azure is sure to get a fillip from new licensing rules, just as Teams has from bundling. Up to now Microsoft let customers use its software on dedicated servers run by AWS or any cloud provider under a practice called “bring your own licence” (BYOL). That freedom enabled easy switching; of all cloud-based Windows software, 57% runs on AWS, nearly twice as much as on Azure.
Last summer Microsoft did away with BYOL and introduced restrictions for customers wishing to put its software on certain big clouds. If a client wanted to run desktop and server programs on those clouds after October 1st, it would have to buy a new subscription, rather than a one-off licence. Not to offend antitrust rules Microsoft put Azure on its list alongside AWS, GCP and Alibaba Cloud. But it separately offered customers a better deal to move to Azure, offsetting the extra cost.
Amazon said Microsoft was trying to restrict what clouds companies can use. Several neutral observers concur. “Microsoft is taking its arsenal of Windows Server, a massive installed software base, and using it punitively against competitors,” says Raj Bala, Gartner’s main cloud-infrastructure expert and author of its cloud ranking. It is the antithesis of Mr Nadella’s more open strategy, adds Wes Miller of Directions on Microsoft, a research firm. After all, he had eased Office’s move to non-Windows devices such as Apple’s iPad. “Satya wants to make people think he’s different, but he’s old-school Microsoft, just with a little softer exterior,” sums up an executive at a rival.
Microsoft is the only big cloud provider which also sells lots of programs that clouds host. “Is there a piece of software that Amazon or Google has built that runs on Azure? Zero,” Mr Nadella says. That also gives Azure a big advantage to exploit. Mr Nadella does not intend to repeat the mistake of letting Windows workloads all migrate to Amazon’s cloud, as happened early on. “We were stupid, not realising what was happening,” he says. “We will absolutely monetise our intellectual property on their clouds.”

Since the licensing changes went into effect Gartner has received several hundred inquiries about them. An executive from a Fortune 500 health-care company that had picked AWS as its cloud provider says that the new rules meant an extra annual cost of $100m, forcing the firm to slow down its transition to the cloud. “They are writing licence terms to get customers to believe their only choice is Azure,” complains a vice-president of a medium-sized firm in Wisconsin that felt forced to switch from AWS. “There is no law against it but it removes choice,” he adds. An IT chief at another midwestern firm likens the new rules to a long lease on a car where “the lessor says you can only use Chevron gas, not BP or Exxon”. Two of the three customers are set on writing Microsoft software out of their stacks over time.
Avoiding defenestration
That points to a risk for the tech giant. By tugging reluctant customers onto Azure too aggressively Microsoft may put a lot of them off Windows—or, possibly, provoke mass flouting of rules, daring the software giant to enforce them. Takeshi Numoto, chief marketing officer of Microsoft’s commerical business, says the feedback Microsoft is receiving on cloud choice after the new rules is positive, adding that “We want to hear from all customers if there are ways we can improve our partnership and support of their businesses.”
How closely is Microsoft flirting with the kind of behaviour that got it in trouble in the late 1990s? After its bruising antitrust battle it is likely to proceed cautiously. If Europe proves sympathetic to Slack, the messaging firm could bring a similar case in America. If that happens, Microsoft may offer concessions to make it go away.
Mr Nadella resists the idea that Microsoft is overstepping the mark. “Look at the number of enterprise SAAS [software-as-a-service] and infrastructure firms,” he says—hardly suggestive of “a monopoly company collecting monopoly rent”.
In its defence Microsoft can certainly argue that Azure has brought competition to cloud computing, which AWS might otherwise have cornered. Tellingly, Mr Nadella was spared the indignity of testifying in front of a congressional antitrust subcommittee, which recently grilled his opposite numbers at Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook. A congressional report on big tech’s digital dominance did not finger Microsoft. America’s trustbusters have gone after Google instead (see article). Google denies wrongdoing.
Microsoft’s rebuffed $25bn-30bn bid for TikTok could have been a boon to competition. Had it succeeded, Microsoft would have challenged Google and Facebook in digital advertising in short order. TikTok’s reams of data on its teenage users would have fuelled Microsoft’s AI, which competes against algorithms being developed by all its big tech rivals in America and China. The purchase of ZeniMax Media, a games developer, for $7.5bn to bolster its flourishing cloud-gaming platform does not make up for the failed bid.
Google’s antitrust troubles could offer consolation. The case may shake up internet search, helping Bing. It is a tiddler despite having a quality of search results that is not all that different from Google’s. In a hint that Microsoft might want to revive its search engine, this month it was rebranded as “Microsoft Bing”.
Mr Nadella is confident about future growth, his early awkwardness long since replaced by a justified and resolute assuredness. “We’re lucky enough to be in the tech business, and IT spending is going from 5% of GDP to 10% over the next ten years,” he says. But competition for those IT dollars is white-hot. Microsoft’s response—leaning heavily on customers not to defect—may work in the short run. But as the pace of change in the technology industry accelerates, thanks to abundant brainpower and oodles of capital, customers may put innovation ahead of loyalty to long-standing providers. One successful reinvention is unlikely to be enough. ■
Clarification (October 23rd 2020): Microsoft's claim that Azure can cost a fifth as much as AWS is disputed by AWS",1
1567,"Oct 25 (Reuters) - Members of Sudan's cabinet and a large number of pro-government party leaders were arrested on Monday in an apparent coup after weeks of tension between the military and a civilian government, political sources said.
Here is some background to the events.
WHO IS IN CHARGE IN SUDAN?
Sudan began a transition to democracy after a popular uprising and the ouster in April 2019 of President Omar al-Bashir, an Islamist shunned by the West who had presided over the country for nearly three decades.
Under an August 2019 agreement, the military is sharing power with officials appointed by civilian political groups in a ruling body known as the Sovereign Council, meant to lead the country to elections by the end of 2023.
HAVE THERE BEEN TENSIONS BEFORE?
Although the military's role is supposed to be largely honorary, civilians have repeatedly complained of military overreach in foreign policy and peace negotiations.
The military has accused civilian parties of mismanagement and monopolising power. A coalition of rebel groups and political parties have aligned themselves with the armed forces and have sought to dissolve the civilian cabinet.
Authorities said in September they had foiled an attempted coup, accusing plotters loyal to Bashir.
WHAT ARE THE DISAGREEMENTS OVER?
One point of tension is the pursuit of justice over allegations of war crimes by the military and its allies in the conflict in Darfur from 2003. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking trials for Bashir and other Sudanese suspects. The cabinet has signed off on handing over suspects, but the Sovereign Council has not.
Another is an investigation into the killings of pro-democracy protesters on June 3, 2019, in which military forces are implicated. Activists and civilian groups have been angered by delays in making the investigation's findings public.
Civilians have also pushed for oversight and restructuring of the military, particularly through the integration of the powerful, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which military leaders have resisted.
WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY?
A worsening economic crisis that sent the currency plunging and created frequent shortages of bread and fuel was the trigger for Bashir's downfall.
The transitional government has implemented harsh, rapid reforms monitored by the International Monetary Fund in a successful bid for debt relief and to attract foreign financing.
In the wake of the reforms, inflation rose to historic highs of more than 400% and many Sudanese complain of struggling to get by. There have been occasional protests over economic conditions.
HOW ARE RELATIONS WITH THE NEIGHBOURS?
Sudan is in a volatile region, bordering the Red Sea, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa. Several of its neighbours, including Ethiopia, Chad and South Sudan have been affected by political upheavals and conflict.
Since late last year, conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region has pushed tens of thousands of refugees into eastern Sudan and caused military tensions in disputed agricultural lands along the border.
Sudan is pushing, with Egypt, for a binding deal over the operation of a giant hydropower dam that Ethiopia is building near the Sudanese border. Talks have stalled but Ethiopia has started filling the reservoir behind the dam, which Sudan says could put its citizens, dams and water facilities at risk.",0

1569,"“CUBANS HAVE always been resourceful,” says Ana, the owner of a private farm-to-table restaurant near Havana. “But now we need to be magicians and acrobats.” The communist island is facing its worst shortage of food since the 1990s. Finding ingredients was never easy in a place which imports around 70% of its food. Over the past year it has become nearly impossible. When grocery shops are empty, as is so often the case, Ana tries the internet or the black market, only to find that prices are prohibitively high. Farmers no longer want to sell produce to her, she says, as they need to eat it themselves.
The government blames the shortage of food mostly on sanctions imposed by the United States—sanctions which, on June 24th, the UN General Assembly voted to condemn, as it has done nearly every year since 1992. But since 2001 the sanctions have exempted food. Indeed, the United States is the largest exporter of food to Cuba, though last year those imports were at their lowest level since 2002.

Some external factors have affected the food supply. The jump in global food prices, which in the year to May surged by 40%, the largest increase in a decade, has made imports more expensive. But the main problem is the government’s lack of hard currency. Tourism, normally 10% of GDP, has atrophied because of the pandemic: whereas 4.2m people visited in 2019, just over 1m did last year, nearly all in the first three months of the year. Remittances have also suffered. Before covid-19, commercial airlines would operate as many as ten flights a day between Miami and Havana, all packed with cash-toting mulas. But now only a handful of flights go to Havana each week. In addition, this year’s harvest of sugar—one of Cuba’s main exports—was the worst in more than a century, as a result of drought (the dollar shortage also sapped supplies of fertiliser and petrol).
The government is trying desperately to eke out dollars and skimp on imported goods. Cubans can no longer buy greenbacks from state-operated exchanges at the airport. State-owned bakeries are replacing a fifth of the imported wheat flour they use in bread with substitutes made from home-grown corn, pumpkin or yucca, much to the dismay of consumers, who have complained that bread now tastes like soggy corn. The sale of biscuits has been limited in certain cities to cut back even more on imports of flour.
Since February, in a desperate attempt to collect hard currency, the government has required that foreigners pay for their seven-day mandatory stay in a state-owned quarantine hotel in dollars (since June, this has even applied to some Cubans). To earn more from its diaspora, the state also operates e-commerce sites through which Cubans abroad can pay in dollars or euros for food and gifts to be delivered to people on the island.
Indeed many Cubans abroad are trying to help their family members stave off hunger by sending their own care packages. But even these have become harder and more costly to post. Goods from the United States that once took two weeks to deliver can now take up to four months to arrive, as shortages of fuel and trucks in Cuba make the final leg of the delivery trickier.
Bungled policy responses have made things worse. On June 10th the Cuban central bank announced that, from June 21st, Cubans would not be able to deposit dollars into their bank accounts for an undisclosed amount of time. This is despite the fact that, in order to buy goods in state-owned shops, Cubans need to have a prepaid card loaded with dollars. They will now have to exchange their dollars for euros or other currencies, which involves a fee. Emilio Morales, the head of the Havana Consulting Group in Miami, thinks this was a way to scare people into depositing more before the deadline.
Rather than stabilise the economy, the policy is likely to do the reverse. Some exchange houses in Miami soon ran out of euros. Cuban banks were overwhelmed by queues of panicking people trying to deposit the dollars they needed to buy groceries. “Cuba has 11m hostages and is expecting Cuban exiles to pay their ransom,” says Mr Morales. Ricardo Cabrisas, the deputy prime minister, was recently in Paris negotiating another extension on the roughly $3.5bn of loans owed to foreign governments—the island has been in arrears since 2019. An ultimatum from creditors may help explain the government’s desire to hoover up greenbacks.
Despite making some attempts to liberalise the economy, the government is bafflingly poor at boosting agricultural production or wooing foreign investors. Firms producing food in Cuba earn only pesos, which have little value internationally, but must buy almost all their inputs abroad in a foreign currency. The government requires farmers to sell their harvest to the state at uncompetitive prices and imposes draconian rules on livestock management.
Up until last month it was illegal to slaughter a cow before it had reached an advanced age, as determined by the state. Now farmers may kill them either to sell the meat or to eat it themselves. But before they do so, they must jump through a series of hoops, including certifying that the cow has produced at least 520 litres of milk a year. They are also not allowed to let their herd shrink overall, and so can only slaughter one cow for every three calves they add to it—a tall order in the long run, mathematically. As it is, Cuba is having trouble maintaining its existing cattle herd: last year, in the province of Las Tunas alone, more than 7,000 cows died from dehydration. Farmers have to complete paperwork and wait a week for approval, too. “The process of applying to eat a cow is enough to make you lose your appetite,” says a farmer in Bahía Honda.
Cubans are no strangers to difficult times. Eliecer Jiménez Almeida, a Cuban filmmaker in Miami, was a child during the “special period” of hardship after the fall of the Soviet Union, and remembers how his grandmother sold her gold teeth in exchange for soap, just so that he and his siblings could take a bath. For him and for many Cubans, the question is not how many more of the same indignities their people can endure, but how much longer.
Discontent was slightly less likely when Fidel Castro was in power. He had charisma and mystique that neither his brother and successor, Raúl, nor Cuba’s current president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, can replicate. What is more, the Cuban diaspora is larger and wealthier and the internet has shown Cubans that many of their economic difficulties are created by their leaders, not the United States. The best way to stave off popular discontent would be to implement more and bigger economic reforms, at a faster pace, starting with farms and small businesses. It is a measure of Cubans’ disillusionment that the old revolutionary cry of “Hasta la victoria siempre” (On to victory, always) has largely been supplanted by the longsuffering “¿Hasta cuándo?” (How much longer?) ■",1
1570,"IF THE PROPAGANDISTS of the Taliban had scripted the collapse of America’s 20-year mission to reshape Afghanistan, they could not have come up with more harrowing images. As insurgents swept into Kabul, desperate Afghans, terrified about what the victorious zealots might do, chased departing American cargo planes down the runway, trying to clamber into the landing gear and inevitably falling to their deaths. The American-backed government had surrendered without a fight—something that American officials were insisting would not happen only days before. Afghans were left in such a horrifying bind that clinging to the wheels of a hurtling aircraft seemed their best option.
America has spent $2trn in Afghanistan; more than 2,000 American lives have been lost, not to mention countless Afghan ones. And yet, even if Afghans are more prosperous now than when America invaded, Afghanistan is back to square one. The Taliban control more of the country than they did when they lost power, they are better armed, having seized the weapons America showered on the Afghan army, and they have now won the ultimate affirmation: defeating a superpower.

The insurgents have made a show of magnanimity, pledging that they will not take revenge on those who worked for the toppled government and insisting that they will respect women’s rights, within their interpretation of Islamic law. But that interpretation kept most girls out of school and most women confined to their homes when the group was last in power, in the 1990s. Brutal punishments—floggings, stonings, amputations—were common. The freedoms that urban Afghans took for granted over the past 20 years have just gone up in smoke. It is an appalling outcome for Afghanistan’s 39m people, and deeply damaging for America.
It is not surprising that America failed to turn Afghanistan into a democracy. Nation-building is difficult, and few imagined that it could become Switzerland. Nor was it unreasonable for Joe Biden, America’s president, to want to draw the conflict to a close. America has spent 20 years in a place of only modest strategic importance about which most American voters have long since ceased to care. The original reason for the invasion—to dismantle al-Qaeda’s main base of operations—was largely achieved, though that achievement could now be reversed.
The claim that America is showing itself to be a fickle ally by allowing the Afghan government to fall is also overblown, given the duration, scale and expense of the American deployment. The defunct regime in Kabul was not an ally in the way that Germany or Japan is. It was far weaker, more corrupt and completely dependent on America for its survival.
But none of that absolved America of the responsibility to withdraw in an orderly fashion. Mr Biden failed to show even a modicum of care for the welfare of ordinary Afghans. The irony is that America had a plan to do just that, which had been in the works for several years. It had hugely scaled down its garrison, from around 100,000 troops in 2011 to fewer than 10,000 by 2017, along with a similar number from other NATO countries. They were not supposed to defeat the Taliban, but prevent the Afghan army’s collapse, largely through air power, and so force the Taliban to the negotiating table.

Apologists for Mr Biden argue that his predecessor, Donald Trump, had already scuppered this plan by trying to rush it to a conclusion before last year’s presidential election in America. It is true that Mr Trump was so desperate to strike a quick deal that he accepted preposterous terms, agreeing to end America’s deployment without even securing a ceasefire, let alone a clear plan to end the civil war. He had already reduced the American presence to little more than 2,000 soldiers by the time Mr Biden took office, and had promised to get the rest out by May 1st.
But Mr Biden did not have to stick to this agreement. In fact, he didn’t entirely, refusing to keep to the original timetable. The Taliban were clearly not holding up their end of the bargain, pressing their advantage on the battlefield instead of negotiating in good faith with the Afghan government. That could have been grounds to halt or reverse the American withdrawal. There was little political pressure within America to bring the war to a speedy conclusion. Yet Mr Biden was working to an arbitrary and flippant deadline of his own, seeking to end the war by the 20th anniversary of 9/11. Although the speed of the Afghan government’s implosion surprised most observers, including this newspaper, America’s soldiers and politicians were among the most naively optimistic, insisting that a total collapse was a vanishingly remote prospect. And when it became clear that the Afghan army was melting away, Mr Biden pressed on intransigently, despite the likely consequences.
As a result, America’s power to deter its enemies and reassure its friends has diminished. Its intelligence was flawed, its planning rigid, its leaders capricious and its concern for allies minimal. That is likely to embolden jihadists everywhere, who will take the Taliban’s victory as evidence that God is on their side. It will also encourage adventurism on the part of hostile governments such as Russia’s or China’s, and worry America’s friends. Mr Biden has defended the withdrawal by arguing that Afghanistan was a distraction from more pressing problems, such as America’s rivalry with China. But by leaving Afghanistan in such a chaotic fashion, Mr Biden will have made those other problems harder to deal with.

After the fall
The shambolic withdrawal does not reduce the obligation of America and its allies to ordinary Afghans, but increases it. They should use what leverage they still have to urge moderation on the Taliban, especially in their treatment of women. The displaced will need humanitarian aid. Western countries should also admit more Afghan refugees, the ranks of whom are likely to swell, and provide generous assistance to Afghanistan’s neighbours to look after those who remain in the region. The haste of European leaders to declare that they cannot take in many persecuted Afghans even as violent zealots seize control is almost as lamentable as America’s botched exit. It is too late to save Afghanistan, but there is still time to help its people. ■

1571,"NOT LONG before the Beijing Olympics of 2008, the Chinese government carried out a vicious crackdown on demonstrations in Tibet. Foreign media drew attention to it, and people outside China held protests. A Chinese academic popularised the idea of “three afflictions”: two that China had faced in the past (“being beaten” by foreign powers and “being starved” by poverty) and a third that it faces now: “being scolded” by the rest of the world. Later President Xi Jinping adopted the concept, arguing that China faces a “fight for international discourse”.
On no subject has China been more scolded than Xinjiang, where it has interned some 1m Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group, for such things as being too pious or talking to relatives overseas. Media in democracies uniformly portray this as a grotesque abuse of human rights. The Communist Party is pushing back, in an effort to break what it calls the “discourse hegemony” of the West. To treat the “third affliction” it has marshalled vast resources, including official media, think-tanks, diplomats and security organs, and spent billions of dollars over the past decade.

A notable feature of recent propaganda about Xinjiang has been relentless attacks on China’s critics. In March the government imposed sanctions, such as bans on visiting or doing business with China, on elected officials, researchers and think-tanks in Europe and North America that had caused offence. Chinese officials also stirred up online nationalist boycotts of Western firms that had acknowledged the possibility of Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang’s cotton industry.
Since then authorities have made Uyghurs in China make videos begging their dissident relatives overseas to shut up; announced a lawsuit against Adrian Zenz, a prominent researcher into the abuse of Uyghurs; and harassed a BBC journalist, John Sudworth, into leaving China.

The campaigns are getting personal. In April Xinhua, the official news agency, called Mr Zenz a “puppet of anti-China forces”. An entity called the Xinjiang Development Research Centre issued a report titled “Slanderer Adrian Zenz’s Xinjiang-related Fallacies Versus the Truth”. Global Times, a party tabloid, denounced Vicky Xu, an Australian researcher who has written about forced labour. It accused her of stoking sentiment that puts Chinese people in Australia “in peril”, and quoted a Chinese student who said she was “bewitched by the anti-China forces in the West”.
In the past, when the party was accused of specific abuses, its propagandists would issue general denials. They would also try to recast repressive policies as examples of the party’s wisdom and munificence, producing what a vice-president of Xinhua once called “fairy tales”. And they have long tried to change the subject by playing up human-rights abuses in America. State media still produce fairy tales about happy Uyghurs doing traditional dances. But now, at almost any critical mention of Xinjiang, China pushes back hard.
David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong, says this verbal ferocity is partly aimed at a nationalist audience within China, which likes to hear the motherland robustly defended (as does Mr Xi). That helps explain a blustery performance by Yang Jiechi, China’s top diplomat, at a summit in Alaska in March with America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken. After Mr Blinken raised the subject of Xinjiang, among other concerns, Mr Yang unleashed an 18-minute tirade about the virtues of “Chinese-style democracy” and the effrontery of those who try to “smear” it.
A fragmented global media landscape makes it easier to spread disinformation. Conventional outlets are struggling financially, and conspiracy theories proliferate on social media and YouTube. China has spent hundreds of millions of dollars annually over the past decade to take advantage of this, expanding its media footprint abroad under a “Great Foreign Propaganda Campaign”, says a working paper for the Brookings Institution by Rush Doshi (now a China specialist on America’s National Security Council). He notes that, since 2009, Xinhua has doubled the number of its foreign bureaus to 200; China Radio International, a state broadcaster, has more than tripled its hours of programming in 65 languages; and China Global Television Network (CGTN) has established itself as a new brand overseas, with 24 channels in five languages.
Equally important have been state media’s deals to place content in other media outlets around the globe—what propaganda officials call “borrowing the boats to reach the sea”. China Daily paid handsomely to place inserts in such newspapers as the Washington Post and The Economist (though both ended the arrangement in 2020). Since 2018, Xinhua has struck content-exchange deals with print, radio and television outlets in Australia, Egypt, India, Italy and Nigeria, to name just a few, writes Sarah Cook of Freedom House, a watchdog. She adds that many consumers of these outlets may not know that some of their news (especially about China) comes from Chinese state media.
The authorities in Beijing recognise that the most persuasive voices are not their own. They prefer to “borrow a mouth to speak”—promoting online the voices of useful foreigners, some of whom have made YouTube videos about their travels in Xinjiang, challenging reports of Uyghur suffering. A particular favourite is the Grayzone, an outlet that has sought to discredit the Western narrative on Xinjiang as a product of American imperialism.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the propaganda push does not appear to have won hearts and minds in rich democracies. But bullying critics may work in a way that is hard to measure—that is, in future silence. Many firms were quiet in the wake of the online boycott in China. The Better Cotton Initiative, a global apparel-industry consortium, took down an online statement of concern about Xinjiang cotton. In 2019, after an executive of a National Basketball Association team tweeted in support of protests in Hong Kong, China’s main broadcaster stopped showing NBA games. Since then, players and executives have been almost completely silent on China.
“Not only Adrian Zenz, but all anti-China forces who attempt to inflict pain on Xinjiang through slanders must pay the price,” Xinhua wrote on April 30th. Such threats may cow some critics, but others will be emboldened. The new scold war could last a while. ■",1
1572,"MALARIA IS ONE of medical science’s most formidable foes. The search for a vaccine has been going on for decades. Dozens of candidates have been tested in recent years. But so far only one, a jab called RTS,S, made by GlaxoSmithKline, has proved effective in the final stages of clinical trials. On October 6th the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended RTS,S for use in childhood vaccination in places with transmission of Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of the five parasites that cause malaria, and the most common in Africa.
The WHO reached its decision after reviewing results from Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, where more than 800,000 infants were vaccinated with a four-dose regimen. In these countries RTS,S was included among the routine childhood vaccines distributed by primary health-care centres. This implementation programme, in which RTS,S reduced by 30% the number of cases of severe malaria which led to hospital admissions, therefore measured what kind of efficacy can be expected if the vaccine is rolled out widely across Africa.

Some may think that 30% efficacy is not much. But in parts of sub-Saharan Africa children contract malaria six times a year on average. Each year more than 260,000 African children die of it before their fifth birthdays. Those who survive often suffer lifelong harm, including stunting, a form of impaired growth that affects the ability to learn. The impact of RTS,S will thus be huge.
Crucially, the WHO says that the vaccine was found to be safe after more than 2.3m doses had been administered—clearing the air on three “safety signals” that had popped up in an earlier trial. It also says the jab is highly cost-effective. The next step is therefore for GAVI, an international organisation that buys vaccines for poor countries, to decide whether it will add RTS,S to its portfolio.

1573,"NEITHER POPULISTS in general, nor Boris Johnson in particular, are known for tackling difficult problems if they can be left to future governments. Yet Britain’s prime minister did just that on September 7th when he unveiled a plan to break an election promise and raise taxes by an annual £12bn ($17bn), or 0.5% of GDP. The money will go to the National Health Service (NHS) and social care, including residential care for the elderly. Taxes could be raised more fairly. The government nonetheless deserves praise for taking on an issue that had seemed intractable.
Britain, like many rich countries, is ageing. In 2011 there were four 15- to 64-year-olds for every person aged 65 or over; by 2028 there will be fewer than three. The consequences include a strained NHS and more households discovering the inadequacies of the existing social-care system, which exposes the elderly and their heirs to huge financial risks. Today the government helps to pay for care only for those with assets worth less than about £23,000. But around one person in seven will spend more than £100,000—sometimes much more—on care during their lifetime. The result, which is not unique to Britain, is a lottery in which unlucky households must liquidate most or all of their assets.

Mr Johnson’s attempt to solve these problems—and also to help the NHS clear the massive queue of patients that has accumulated while it has fought the pandemic—is welcome. To reform care, he will cap care costs per person at £86,000, beyond which the state will foot the bill. The main beneficiaries will be elderly homeowners and their heirs. Although they may not seem like the most deserving beneficiaries, helping people share uninsurable risks is a worthy goal for governments. The NHS is not means-tested, and it is reasonable to move social care in this direction, too.

But this necessary expansion of the welfare state is being paid for in the wrong way. A measure that insures the estates of the elderly against catastrophe should have been funded by levying an insurance premium on older people in the form of higher taxes on property or inheritance. The government instead decided to raise all the new money by lifting national insurance (a payroll tax) and taxes on dividends. Outrageously, income from pensions and property will escape higher levies, meaning many well-off elderly voters will be spared from paying anything for a reform of which they are major beneficiaries.
Had the government raised income tax instead, every generation would have contributed. Mr Johnson says that national insurance is preferable, because firms pay part of the cost. This is a fiction. In the long run the burden of payroll taxes, even those paid by companies, falls on workers, whose wages fall as their employers’ tax bills rise.
The reform is not Mr Johnson’s only breach of an election pledge. His government also announced on September 7th that it would temporarily suspend the “triple lock”, which has ensured since 2010 that the state pension rises by the minimum of earnings, inflation or 2.5%. The pandemic has distorted the official measure of earnings growth, partly because employment has fallen in the lowest-paying industries. Maintaining the triple lock, as the Conservatives had promised, could have pushed the increase in the state pension above 8%. Instead, this year it will be set with reference only to inflation and the 2.5% floor.
The government should go further and abandon the triple lock. The savings should go on working-age people, thus helping to offset the unfairness of higher payroll taxes. Mr Johnson’s reinvention as a politician willing to take an unpopular but necessary decision is welcome. Many more will be needed. ■",1
1574,"A report by a group of investigative journalists and Amnesty International claimed that the phone numbers of human-rights activists, journalists and politicians were on a list of 50,000 potential targets of unscrupulous governments for hacking using Pegasus software, which is made by NSO, an Israeli spyware firm. Emmanuel Macron, Cyril Ramaphosa and Imran Khan, the leaders of France, South Africa and Pakistan, were reportedly on the list, along with the wife of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist murdered by agents of the Saudi regime. NSO said the report was based on a misleading interpretation of the data, and that it sold its software only to law-enforcement agencies of “vetted governments” for the prevention of crime and terror acts.

The Biden administration accused the Chinese government of being directly behind the cyber-attack on Microsoft’s email system in March, which compromised the communications networks of companies around the world. Using blunt language, Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said China had “fostered an ecosystem” of cyber-criminals who work for the state as well as personal gain. But he did not announce any sanctions as retribution.

1575,"IN THE HENGDUAN mountains of Sichuan province, swollen brown rivers and trees heavy with ripe mangoes do not evoke digital wizardry. Yet until recently, there were buildings here with rack upon rack of specialised computers. They were often near hydropower plants that supplied them with electricity from dams. They needed lots of power. Their machines were used for “mining”, a process that involves validating transactions conducted in bitcoin and other digital currencies by solving cryptographic puzzles. In return, they received newly minted coins. The buildings were recognisable by their huge cooling systems: usually a wall on one side covered in giant fans to draw in air.
But across Sichuan, the fans have stopped whirring. In May, a government committee tasked with promoting financial stability vowed to put a stop to bitcoin mining. Within weeks the authorities in four main mining regions—Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Yunnan—ordered the closure of local projects. Residents of Inner Mongolia were urged to call a hotline to report anyone flouting the ban. In parts of Sichuan, miners were ordered to clear out computers and demolish buildings housing them overnight. Power suppliers pulled the plug on most of them.

The clampdown has had a global impact. Bitcoin’s “hash rate”, a measure of the computational power being used by the world’s mining machines, has fallen by half in recent weeks. Its “difficulty rate”, which rises and falls as computers join or leave the mining effort, last week fell to an all-time low. China had accounted for about 65% of bitcoins earned through mining, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. But analysts think about 90% of its mining has now ceased. Chinese miners are selling their computers at half their value.
China’s mining boom began in 2017, after a surge in the price of bitcoin caught the attention of local entrepreneurs. The country was already making most of the machines that mine bitcoin globally, as well as the tailor-made chips on which they run. It also had the capacity to produce more power than it needed. In 2018 this excess amounted to 70 terawatt-hours (TWh), equivalent to Switzerland’s total energy production. Rather than let the surplus go to waste, plants sold it to mining farms. The seasons would determine where those farms operated. After the end of Sichuan’s drenching summer rains, when prices there would rise, miners would drive their machines to somewhere near a cheaper source, usually coal-fired power plants thousands of kilometres away in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. (Energy from solar and wind power is not reliable enough to power non-stop mining.)
In 2017 China, fearing a loss of financial control, banned cryptocurrency trading. But local governments still welcomed the miners: they were a source of taxes and other levies. In June a state-run zone in Ya’an, a city in Sichuan, had been set to open in time for the start of the rainy season. It was offering cheap power for mining and other digital activities. “It was a win-win,” says Kirk Su, a miner who had been planning to put some of his machines in the zone. “China was leading in mining in all respects: cheap power, cheap labour, fast and easy access to kit,” he says.

Then came the clampdown. It was targeted in part at the cryptocurrency traders. The mining industry itself has little to do with the volatile business of trading. But miners could not function without converting their new bitcoins into yuan. For this they used exchanges that had moved offshore after the trading ban, but still targeted Chinese users. The government may have decided that to rid China of crypto transactions, “mining had to go”, says Bobby Lee, who co-founded China’s first cryptocurrency exchange (it was forced to shut in 2017). He now runs Ballet, an app that lets users manage their digital currency.
Another aim may have been to reduce emissions. The Cambridge numbers suggest that Chinese miners used around 83TWh of electricity a year, similar to Belgium’s total power consumption. (Still, China could have chosen to ban mining only in its coal-belching north, says Mr Lee.) Officials may also have worried about collusion between local governments and mining operations, some of which had been getting subsidies earmarked for innovative big-data firms.
The central government said it wanted to “resolutely prevent the transmission of individual-level risks to broader society”. That may, in part, have been a reference to the activities of some mines that had been setting up Ponzi-like schemes, promising big returns to investors. Other scammers have been masquerading as cryptocurrency traders. Last year over 100 people were arrested for running two such operations, PlusToken and WoToken.
To evade the clampdown, big miners have sent their machines overseas. Mr Su, who also runs a logistics business that transports mining machines, has been chartering Boeing 747s to get used ones out swiftly. Most are going to Russia and Kazakhstan, which together account for about 13% of the world’s bitcoin mining. But there are few data centres abroad with space for lots of new machines, including in America, the second-biggest miner. Building a farm there costs between five and ten times what it does in China, says Mr Su. That is too much for most Chinese miners. More than half of their computers will stay put for now, he says.
Some smaller miners are still finding ways to operate. One says he is lucky to have teamed up with a privately owned hydropower station that is loth to forgo the extra revenue (it risks being fined by the grid or booted off it). While meeting your correspondent, he struck a deal to buy a farm from a fellow miner for 5m yuan ($770,000), powered by a plant that is off the grid. If his machines can function there for 15 days, he will have earned his investment back in bitcoin.
In an abandoned school in southern Sichuan, Mr Su has stored 10,000 machines from some of his shuttered farms. For every day they spend there, unplugged and stacked to the ceiling, he says that 1m yuan in potential profit is lost. ■",1
1576,"HONG KONG’S universities are on summer holiday. Among the few students who remain on campuses, the mood is gloomy. On July 16th police raided the offices of the student union at the University of Hong Kong (see picture). The city’s police chief said some of the union’s leaders may have breached the national-security law that China imposed on the territory in 2020 following months of student-led unrest in the previous year. After Britain ceded control of Hong Kong nearly a quarter of a century ago, its universities remained free-spirited bastions of liberalism. Now they are gripped by fear.
The pretext for the raid was a resolution issued by the union expressing gratitude for the “sacrifice” of a man who had stabbed a police officer before killing himself. The government said the statement was “no different from supporting and encouraging terrorism”. The union apologised and its leaders resigned. But the authorities did not let the matter rest: police seized files from the union building and banned some of the former leaders from leaving the territory.

Student groups in Hong Kong were at the forefront of the upheaval in 2019. They are in the Communist Party’s sights. During the protests, mainland officials visited Hong Kong to conduct extensive interviews with academics and other residents. They asked questions about how student unions were funded, how their leaders were elected and their connections with the unrest. The mainland’s state-controlled media accused union officers of supporting independence for Hong Kong (a crime that later became punishable by life in prison under the security law) and spreading anti-party sentiment.
To avoid arrest, many students now stay clear of campus politics. During the just-completed academic year, most universities in Hong Kong did not hold student-union elections because of a dearth of candidates. Campus authorities are also treating the unions warily. In February the Chinese University of Hong Kong severed ties with its union because of concerns that the manifestos of some candidates for posts in the student body may have breached the vaguely worded national-security bill.
Academic freedom had started to suffer well before the law was enacted just over a year ago. In 2010 Hong Kong’s universities were rated A, meaning they were among the world’s freest, on the Academic Freedom Index, a ranking developed by several universities and think-tanks in Europe. By 2018 they had fallen to the middle band, C. They are now in the D category, only slightly better than mainland China’s, which have the lowest grade, E. In the past five years the decline in Hong Kong has been sharper than in most other countries.
One reason for this is self-censorship. Some lecturers now avoid sensitive topics, worrying that their colleagues or students will report on what is said in the classroom. Scholars who teach and write about subjects such as Hong Kong, China, civil disobedience and democracy are particularly cautious. “It’s impossible to guess where the red line is anyway, because there is no clear one,” says an academic who teaches modern Chinese history. She says the security law has created a problem for those who specialise in such areas: how to encourage objective study of sensitive issues while protecting students and other faculty members from becoming victims of the security law.
University administrators are also responsible for Hong Kong’s plummeting ratings. Many reports tell of outspoken academics being denied tenure, refused promotion or unable to get their contracts renewed. “They never say it is political,” says Ip Iam-Chong, who taught at Lingnan University for 18 years before its management rejected his application for tenure in 2020, despite support from his department, and refused to renew his contract, which expires in August. Mr Ip believes his difficulties are related to his forthright political views (he founded a pro-democracy news platform, InMediaHK).
Johannes Chan, a prominent supporter of pro-democracy causes, recently ceased full-time work at the University of Hong Kong, where he had served as a law professor. A two-year extension of his contract beyond retirement age (60) had expired. In the past, a five-year extension would have been routine; his application for one was turned down in 2018.
Many academics were disheartened last year when five university presidents signed a letter expressing support for academic freedom but saying they could “understand” the need for a national-security law (its draconian contents were not yet public). “It is upsetting to be part of an institution proactively participating in stifling dissent,” laments one academic, referring to the repressive climate at her university. She says she and many colleagues are looking for jobs in other countries.
Some believe that the chill on campuses is a sign that the Communist Party—which does not operate openly in Hong Kong—has infiltrated academia. Party members have long been secretly gathering information about activities on campuses, says John Burns of the University of Hong Kong. Last year the university’s governing board sacked Benny Tai, a tenured law lecturer who had encouraged student protests in 2014. Mr Tai, who is now in jail, said before his imprisonment that the decision was not made by the board, “but by an authority beyond the university”.
There is another threat to academic freedom that is not directly related to the security law. Mr Burns says the central government in Beijing, as well as the authorities in Hong Kong, have put “huge pressure” on universities to open campuses on the mainland. Such ventures often involve compromises: the subsidiary campuses must observe China’s political taboos. In recent years at least two universities in Hong Kong have opened mainland campuses. Another five, including the University of Hong Kong, say they will follow suit. The territory’s universities risk becoming increasingly similar to their mainland counterparts, where liberal thinkers know they must keep their mouths shut. ■",1

He said: 'These guys are good for putting the area on the national map as well as bringing more visitors into the pubs here.'
At the local butchers Kitchens of Abergele, store assistant Dawn Williams said: 'I think it is wonderful they are back here.
'Most people love them and the attention it brings. We have put their faces in our window as well as those of the 10 contestants. It is going to be a great celebration of our castle and our market town.'
Butcher Darren King added: 'Everyone here has the programme on their lips and wish them luck. '
Retired tax consultant Sarah Frost, 82, said: 'These are lovely people who exude such charm on our television sets. It is wonderful to think that Ant and Dec are in our town.
'I just wish they would take a walk down the High Street and meet everyone. They couldn't last year because of Covid restrictions. I do hope they can this time round.'
But she added: 'I would rather like to meet the footballer David (Ginola) though. He has such beautiful Gallic eyes. They are eyes that can easily seduce…but I must be getting along.'
The barmaid at the George and Dragon Clare Stanton ,48, who is originally from Kent, added: 'I would love Ant to come here and pull a pint for the regulars. It would make their day.
'The show is very popular around here. It is good for everyone that people around the country get to see Abergele filmed and talked about.
'We are all trying to find out who put that banner up on the bridge. I think it might have been a prank and somebody trying to have a laugh. It wasn't remotely funny. We love Ant and Dec. They are national institutions.'
Conwy councillor Goronwy Edwards, said: ' it has been a very difficult year for the businesses here.
'They are keen to take advantage of the new trade that this show will bring to the area and good luck to them. It should boost the local economy.
'There have been some worries about traffic. But we are better prepared this year as we have had more time.
'There has been a few people who do not agree with having the show here and all the attention that it brings. But I think the attention that it does bring is very positive.
'People have been coming here from all over Britain to have their pictures taken outside the castle. They want to be part of the show and so do the local people.'",3
1578,"PERHAPS THE most remarkable characteristic of General Electric (GE) over its 129-year history has been how thoroughly it reflected the dominant characteristics of big American business. Most of its history was a chronicle of boisterous expansion, then globalisation—followed by painful restructuring away from the now-unloved conglomerate model. On November 9th Lawrence Culp, its chief executive, announced that GE would split its remaining operations into three public companies.
Each of these entities will be large, essential and very modern. One will make jet engines, which GE reckons already power two-thirds of all commercial flights. Its power business will provide the systems and turbines generating one-third of the world’s electricity. The health-care division will continue to be the backbone of modern hospitals. Yet it speaks to GE’s remarkable role that this is a modest reach given its past sprawl. From the late-19th to the late-20th century its products lit dark streets; provided the toasters, fans, refrigerators, and televisions (along with the stations beamed to them), which transformed homes; delivered the locomotives that hauled trains; and then built a huge business financing all that and more.

The ambition to be everything was enabled by the perception that it could manage anything. The 21st century punctured that perception. Jack Welch, an acquisitive chief executive reputed to be a managerial genius, retired in 2001 after receiving a mind-boggling $417m severance package. Ever-better results during his tenure beguiled investors and sent the share price soaring. But problems soon arose. The structure Welch left behind was in effect bailed out during the financial crisis. Losses at GE Capital, the sprawling financial unit he fostered, were blamed, though the company’s industrial core turned out to have plenty of problems, too.

Recent years have been spent spitting out one notable business after another. The timing of the break-up announcement was determined by the sale of a large aircraft-financing unit. The transaction reduced debt by enough to provide the three soon-to-be independent companies with an investment-grade credit rating. Mr Culp, the firm’s boss since 2018, speaks of the “illusory benefits of synergy” to be traded for the certain benefits of focus. “A sharper purpose attracts and motivates people,” he says.
Having boasted of its management nous, it now seems that poor management is what did it for a unified GE. The contest to replace Welch was widely seen as pitting the best global executives against one another, with the losers hired to run other big firms. But his successors struggled. Jeffrey Immelt, Welch’s hand-picked replacement, retired under a cloud in 2017. John Flannery, once seen as a wizard behind the rise of the health-care division, took over but was fired after little more than a year. Mr Culp was brought in from outside, a step last taken in the 19th century.
During much of Welch’s tenure and its immediate aftermath GE was the most valuable company in the world, reaching a peak market value nearly five times its current $121bn. It is tempting to conclude that GE’s failure illustrates the demise of the conglomerate. That is refuted by the diversification of today’s most valuable companies: tech firms that have branched out into driverless cars, cloud computing and so on. Rather, GE’s story reflects how even the most valuable American companies may be flawed—and if flaws emerge, may be thoroughly transformed.■

1579,"OPTIMISTS LONG hoped that welcoming China into the global economy would make it a “responsible stakeholder”, and bring about political reform. As president, Donald Trump blasted that as weak. Now Joe Biden is converting Trumpian bombast into a doctrine that pits America against China, a struggle between rival political systems which, he says, can have only one winner. Between them, Mr Trump and Mr Biden have engineered the most dramatic break in American foreign policy in the five decades since Richard Nixon went to China.
Mr Biden and his team base their doctrine on the belief that China is “less interested in coexistence and more interested in dominance”. The task of American policy is to blunt Chinese ambitions. America will work with China in areas of common interest, like climate change, but counter its ambitions elsewhere. That means building up the strength at home and working abroad with allies that can supplement its economic, technological, diplomatic, military and moral heft.


Much about Mr Biden’s new doctrine makes sense. The optimistic case for engagement has crumbled under the realities of Chinese power. Led by President Xi Jinping, China has garrisoned the South China Sea, imposed party rule on Hong Kong, threatened Taiwan, skirmished with India and has tried to subvert Western values in international bodies. Many countries are alarmed by China’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy.
But the details of the Biden doctrine contain much to worry about—not least that it is unlikely to work. One problem is how Mr Biden defines the threat. Because politics in Washington is broken, he seems to feel that he needs the spirit of Pearl Harbour to help rekindle a sense of national purpose. That is a miscalculation.
It is true that Republicans jump on anything they can portray as soft on China (even though every time they say that the presidential election was stolen, they do the work of Chinese propagandists). However, Republicans are unlikely to start backing Mr Biden’s domestic agenda just because it has the word “China” stamped on the cover.
Worse, the more Mr Biden uses strident rhetoric to galvanise Americans, the harder he makes his task of galvanising allies and big emerging powers like India and Indonesia. By framing the relationship as a zero-sum contest, he is presenting them with a Manichean struggle between democracy and autocracy, rather than the search for co-existence. Alas, in this he is overestimating America’s influence and underestimating how much potential allies have to lose by turning their back on China.
By many economic measures China will become a dominant force, whatever America does. It will have the world’s biggest economy and it is already the largest trading goods partner of almost twice as many countries as America. Germany, Europe’s export powerhouse, aims to sustain commercial links with China even as political links buckle. In South-East Asia many countries look to America for their security and China for their prosperity. If forced to choose between the superpowers, some may pick China.
Rather than imposing a decision on other countries today, Mr Biden needs to win them around. And his best chance of that is for America to demonstrate that it can thrive at home and be the leader of a successful and open world economy.
Here, too, the details of Mr Biden’s scheme are troubling. Rather than build on America’s strengths as the champion of global rules, the administration is using the threat of China to further its domestic agenda. Its doctrine is full of industrial policy, government intervention, planning and controls. It is uncomfortably like the decoupling being pursued by China itself.
For a glimpse of what this could entail, look at the administration’s report on four crucial supply chains—for semiconductors, batteries, rare earths and vital pharmaceutical ingredients—published last month. The report does not just make the national-security case for government intervention in these industries. It also embraces union representation, social justice and pretty much everything else. More such reports will come later. If this one is a guide, Mr Biden will propose to use subsidies and regulation to ensure that jobs and production remain within America’s borders.
Inevitably, Mr Biden’s plans have trade-offs. Central to his attack on China is its abuse of human rights, especially of the Uyghurs, subject to internment and forced labour in Xinjiang. Central to his policy on climate change is to shift to renewables. Yet the two are entangled, at least in the short term, because Xinjiang is the origin of 45% of the silicon used in generating solar power.
A more fundamental problem is the China doctrine’s soft protectionism. This favours incumbents over competitors and is likely to weigh down the economy rather than supercharge it. The country’s new Moon programme is popular largely as a way to show that America has an edge over China. Yet it is vibrant precisely to the degree that it allows the sort of competition in which private firms such as SpaceX and Blue Origin can shine.
A third problem is that Mr Biden’s doctrine will make America’s allies even more wary. If the purpose of cutting ties with China is to create good union jobs in America, allies will ask themselves what is in it for them.
Mr Biden’s plan is a missed opportunity. If America wants to stop China from rebuilding the global order in its image, it should defend the sort of globalisation that always served it well. At the centre of such an approach would be trade and the multilateral system, embodying the faith that openness and the free flow of ideas will create an edge in innovation.
If America really wanted to counter China in Asia, it would join the pan-Asian trade deal it walked away from in 2016. That is highly unlikely now, but it could seek fresh agreements on the environment and digital trade. It should also put money and clout behind new ideas that reinforce the Western order, such as a vaccine programme for future pandemics, digital payment systems, cyber-security and an infrastructure scheme to compete with China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Rather than copying China’s techno-nationalism, a more confident America should affirm what made the West strong. ■

1580,"FEW IN PAKISTAN would deny that something needs to be done to improve its education system. The country is well behind Bangladesh, India and Iran, and just barely above Afghanistan, in UN education rankings. Less than 60% of people over 15 can read and write, having attended school on average for 5.2 years. In Bangladesh, by contrast, the literacy rate is 74%, with 6.2 years of education.
The headline figures hide as much as they reveal. In the country’s elite schools, the children of the wealthy study in English for international exams and set their sights on the world’s best universities. At the other end of the spectrum, 23m children are not in school at all, with girls much less likely than boys to be enrolled. Government schools, where available, have a reputation for rote learning. Private schools of varying quality fill the gap. Many poor families send their children to madrasas, which tend to skip subjects like science and maths. Some are vehicles for extremist ideologies. Imran Khan, the prime minister, calls this divide “educational apartheid” and has vowed to get rid of it.

Such an aim is admirable, but the tool of choice has come in for criticism from academics, educators and parents. Earlier this year the government began rolling out a single national curriculum (SNC) for all schools, including madrasas. This set of minimum standards is meant to improve the quality of teaching and boost the prospects of pupils. But its ambitions are wider still. Among the objectives listed by the education ministry is to increase “social cohesion and national integration”.
The new curriculum has so far been rolled out only in primary schools, but already some of its dictates are causing a backlash. The SNC has increased the number of subjects, such as general knowledge, which must use textbooks in Urdu or other local languages rather than English. Mr Khan, himself an old boy of Aitchison College, the country’s most prestigious school, makes his case in punchy post-colonial terms. “When you acquire English-medium education, you adopt the entire culture,” he argues, adding that “you become [a] slave to that particular culture.”
Yet the resistance to the SNC’s imposition of local-language learning is not just an elite phenomenon. There have been reports of schools unwilling to implement it. And there is huge demand for English from parents who see it as a way for their children to stand out in the job market, according to teachers. Mariam Chughtai, the director of the national council drawing up the curriculum, says the aim is not to drop English but to elevate local languages. “When we think ‘multilingual’, we think French, German and English. But when you say bilingual in Urdu and English, the elites look down upon it,” she says. Still, “no one is denying the importance of English. It’s here to stay.”
A bigger complaint is that conservatives are using the curriculum to increase religious teaching in schools. Rather than turning madrasas into schools, it will turn schools into madrasas, charge critics. Indeed, the education ministry’s list of “key considerations” in drawing up the curriculum puts the teachings of the Koran at the very top. Non-Muslims need not take classes on Islam, but religious content is seeping into other subjects, such as Urdu-language lessons that include passages on Muslim caliphs. The government argues that there is nothing wrong with teaching religion in a religious country.
The third criticism may be the most pertinent. Pakistan’s abysmal learning outcomes are not so much the result of content as of access, says Jasir Shahbaz, an educationalist in Lahore. A new curriculum will do little to fix that. “The issue is not so much what the kids are studying, so much as how many kids are actually studying, or are actually understanding what they are studying,” he says.
The battles are likely to intensify as older pupils start the new curriculum next year. Ms Chughtai says it will take time for results to show. But the furore, she says, is because the changes affect even the elite: “Any time you try to bring a major policy change, for the small minority of people for whom even the broken system was working, they are going to get scared.”■",1
1581,"THE NOTION that the modern economy lacks “good jobs” is as uncontroversial as saying that Lionel Messi is good at football. Pundits decry the disappearance of the steady positions of yesteryear, where people did a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay. “Where have all the good jobs gone?”, wonders one recent book, while another talks about “the rise of polarised and precarious employment systems”. President Joe Biden takes after Donald Trump in promising to bring good jobs “back”. But what if the whole debate rests on shaky foundations?
It certainly lacks historical awareness. Compare the current discussion with the one during America’s postwar boom. Few people back then believed that they were living in a golden age of labour. Commentators were instead full of angst, worrying about the “blue-collar blues”. They said that unionised factory jobs—the very sort that today’s politicians yearn to restore—consisted of repetitive, dangerous work which involved all brawn and no brain. Others fretted over pay. Workers “are getting increasingly frustrated by a system they think is not giving them a satisfactory return for their labours”, proclaimed a high-ranking official at America’s Department of Labour in 1970.

In fact the notion that the world of work is in decay is as old as capitalism itself. Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, a Swiss writer who inspired Karl Marx, said that factories would turn people into drones. John Stuart Mill worried in the mid-19th century that the rise of capitalism would provoke social decay. People would focus on nothing other than earning money, he feared, turning them into dullards (just look at Americans, he warned). The rise of big business and white-collar work in America provoked a new set of anxieties. It was soon predicted that the self-made men of yore would be replaced by effete company drones who did what they were told.
This is not the only reason to question today’s pessimistic narrative. By any reasonable standard work is better today than it was. Pay is higher, working hours are shorter and industrial accidents rarer.
It is harder to tell whether workers enjoy their work more than they did. Gallup, a pollster, has kindly supplied Bartleby with a smattering of job-satisfaction surveys from the 1960s and 1970s. Certainly there is little to suggest that workers back then were any happier than they are today. More comparable data, also from Gallup, from the early 1990s onwards show gradually improving job satisfaction. Last year 56% of American employees said they were “completely” satisfied with their job, an all-time high. A growing “precariat” of insecure workers gets a lot of headlines. But 90% of American employees said in 2020 that they were completely or somewhat satisfied with their job security, up from 79% in 1993.
If the jobs-are-bad narrative falls down on the facts, why is it so pervasive—and so intuitive? Partly it is because no one has bothered to look at the evidence. Other observers just don’t like the constant change and churn which has always been part and parcel of capitalism. More still may subscribe, perhaps subconsciously, to what Friedrich Hayek, a philosopher, called an “atavistic” view of markets. The very notion that people must sell their labour, for cash, in order to survive may violate some deeply held notion that humans are a fundamentally co-operative species, rather than a competitive one.
Yet perhaps the most important reason is that people dislike acknowledging trade-offs. Mill seemed unable to square his concern about the stultifying effects of capitalism with his argument that the division of labour had massively increased living standards. People often make similar errors today. The decline of trade unions may have hurt some workers’ wages; but it is less commonly acknowledged that this has also made it easier for less “traditional” workers, such as ethnic minorities and women, to enter the labour market. Sedentary office jobs can make people fat; but people are far less likely to die on the job than they once were.
A relentless focus on the problems of labour markets still has its uses. It encourages people to think about how to make improvements. The evidence suggests that on average managers have got better in recent years but clearly some firms have a long way to go. Many people are still exploited by their employers. Today’s world of work is far better than its critics would like to admit. But there is every reason to try to make it better still.

1582," (CNN)Pete Buttigieg is such a smooth political operator that even the fly-on-the-wall access to his 2020 presidential run granted the makers of ""Mayor Pete"" only produces so much insight into his historic campaign. Mostly, the documentary premiering on Amazon serves as a social-studies lesson in how campaigns operate, with the most candid moments coming from those other than the candidate.Seeking to become the first mayor to graduate directly to the White House, Buttigieg always appeared to be running for national attention and some intermediate position, given the hurdles that the mayor of South Bend would face winning a statewide race in deep-red Indiana. Yet his long-shot campaign captured the imagination of many and caused brief flickers of hope that he could actually go the distance.Directed by Jesse Moss, ""Mayor Pete"" captures all of that, including Buttigieg's status as gay man and his decision to openly discuss that, as he says, ""without it swallowing who I was and what our campaign was about.""Still, Buttigieg speaks in such perfect sound bites that it's difficult even in these casual moments to penetrate those barriers. As a consequence, some of the most telling insights coming from his husband, Chasten Buttigieg -- who recalls that ""Nobody was out"" when he was in high school -- and campaign communications director Lis Smith, who peppers her dialogue with expletives as she bluntly lectures the candidate for being too clinical in answering questions that call for displays of passion or emotion.For all that, some of the behind-the-curtain glimpses are fascinating, from a friendly exchange with Joe Biden, his current boss, as the two run across each other on the trail to the strategizing with staff, from messaging to debate prep.""It's not even a debate,"" Buttigieg corrects them at one point. ""It's a media opportunity.""The filmmakers also catch the group briefly (and comically) stranded in an elevator, dealing with a crisis involving a police shooting in South Bend and at the moment when Buttigieg accepts that his improbable pursuit of the Oval Office has reached its end. ""That's how you end a presidential campaign,"" he says, with a tilt toward the camera, before opting to endorse Biden.Currently serving as Secretary of Transportation at the ripe old age of 39, Buttigieg clearly has plenty of runway ahead of him in terms of pursuing future political ambitions.Depending on where that leads, ""Mayor Pete"" is perhaps most significant as a snapshot of a very specific moment, and potentially a road map for the journey to come.""Mayor Pete"" premieres Nov. 12 on Amazon.",2
1583,"WHEN CHLOÉ ZHAO won Best Director for her film “Nomadland” at the Golden Globes in February, film buffs in China, the land of her birth, were ecstatic. State media proclaimed she was the pride of China. “Congratulations,” gushed Zhang Ziyi, star of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”, on social media. “Look forward to the Oscars.” Two months on, however, as Ms Zhao became the first woman of colour to win an Oscar for Best Director, and “Nomadland” scooped Best Picture, her name was nowhere to be seen.
What happened? The answer is a form of nationalist backlash that is increasingly common. Soon after Ms Zhao won the Golden Globe, internet-users dug up comments she had made in 2013, saying China is “a place where there are lies everywhere”. Censors pounced, removing any mention of her from the Chinese internet.

Nationalist trolls have long been intolerant of speech they deem critical of China. The government is now endorsing these attacks, perhaps for fear of looking weak if it doesn’t. It has intervened to cancel the distribution of “Nomadland” in China.
Ms Zhao is not the first to be dealt with in this way. In June last year Hao Haidong, a Chinese footballer who is the country’s top scorer and now lives abroad, said that the Communist Party’s rule “has caused horrific atrocities against humanity”. Chinese websites swiftly deleted his name.
In 2020 Fang Fang, a writer who kept a diary throughout Wuhan’s lockdown, was read by tens of millions across the country. But once it was announced that an American publisher was translating her diary into English, she was labelled unpatriotic and faced an online onslaught. Her writing has been shunned by Chinese publishers and media outlets. “This is the trolls winning,” says Michael Berry, who translated Ms Fang’s work. “These attacks can escalate to the point they result in actual political decisions.”
China also has a broader agenda: to promote homegrown movies and weaken American cultural dominance. The era of seeking validation from Hollywood may be over, says Ying Zhu of the City University of New York. And an increasingly rocky relationship with America is causing the Communist Party to be less obsessed with international awards. Nine out of China’s ten top-grossing films this year were Chinese. The Oscars, argued a recent newspaper editorial, are “still dictated by Western tastes and standards”. China, it said, should have its own awards ceremony.
That may already be under way. Since 2019, China has banned all mainland film-makers from attending the Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan, formerly the leading Chinese-language festival, after one award winner called for Taiwanese independence. It even scheduled its own version, the Golden Rooster awards, on the same night, forcing film-makers to choose.
The party’s treatment of Ms Zhao is a missed opportunity for the country to promote its soft power. As the relationship between America and China has worsened, bicultural, bilingual artists such as Ms Zhao could be providing an important bridge. In her acceptance speech, she spoke warmly about memorising Chinese poetry with her father as a child, and she switched into Mandarin to quote a famous line from classical Chinese.
But the authorities have a long history of censoring Chinese artists, including “Fifth Generation” film-makers, such as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige. Mr Zhang’s latest film, “One Second”, was withdrawn at the last minute from the Berlin Film Festival in 2019 for “technical reasons”.
In the end, as with all good movies, there may be room for redemption. After the Oscars, Global Times, a nationalistic newspaper, published an English-language commentary praising Ms Zhao for her warmth towards her Chinese roots and saying she could have a “mediating role”.
Ms Zhao’s next film as director is “The Eternals”, a superhero movie from the Marvel franchise. Its producers will be hoping the film also does well in China, now the biggest market in the world. The fact that Ms Zhao is Chinese may have been part of her attraction to them. She is now looking more like a liability.■

1584,"IN THEORY THIS should be a good time to be Walmart, the doyen of American retailers that came of age in the stagflationary era of the 1970s. Inflation is back, yet no one knows better than the Beast of Bentonville how to use the power of the growl to convince suppliers to lower prices. Supply chains are buckling, yet such is Walmart’s heft that it has chartered ships and bypassed rail services to deliver Halloween and Christmas goods early this year. Workers are in short supply, but it managed to add 200,000 jobs to its 2.3m global payroll in the three months to September. “There’s a level of excitement in the air, you can feel it,” enthused Doug McMillon, its chief executive, as Walmart raised its year-end sales and profit targets after solid third-quarter earnings on November 16th.
There’s a puzzle, though. Investors are not buying it. In the past year Walmart’s share price has lagged behind not just Amazon, the e-commerce giant, but other big-box American retailers, such as Target and Home Depot. On November 16th its shares fell a further 3%, as investors fretted over what Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley described as slightly “squishy” profit margins. Is the stockmarket, so enamoured of all things new, missing the turnaround story of the decade? Or is there something else to worry about, namely the hot breath of Amazon on Walmart’s neck?

There are few more engaging advocates of the turnaround story than Felix Oberholzer-Gee of Harvard Business School, who co-hosts a weekly podcast with two of his fellow professors called “After Hours”—a “Seinfeld”-like dose of bonhomie for business enthusiasts. The trio, who interchange high-brow discussions on companies with topics ranging from Scandinavian crime drama to cocktail-making, might not be regulars in the aisles of Walmart. But they are cheerleaders. “Walmart is on fire,” Mr Oberholzer-Gee exclaimed in a recent episode. He acknowledges that investors have not yet caught on. But that might just be because their mindsets are hardened against legacy retailers, he argues.
The turnaround story has two parts. First is the customer. Since lockdowns ended, shoppers have returned to Walmart’s stores, though not yet in sufficient numbers to prove that its almost-800m square feet of American retail space—more than the size of Manhattan—is worth cherishing. The company claims it is. It says having stores within ten miles of 90% of Americans is vital for an “omnichannel” strategy that encourages shoppers to buy in-store, online or a combination of the two.
But with footfall still subpar, its challenge is to attract online shoppers without cannibalising the ones who visit the stores. It is having some success. Surveys suggest its new Walmart+ subscription service—a lower-cost rival to Amazon Prime—is attracting young, urban and affluent online shoppers who might not be seen dead in a Walmart store (a partnership with American Express’s platinum card reinforces the impression of upward mobility). According to Mr Oberholzer-Gee, Walmart.com has also started to display “edgy” brands such as Ray-Ban that typically shunned Walmart’s physical stores, which further appeals to this cohort. Moreover, Walmart is rolling out Uber Eats-style home delivery to 900 cities through its Spark network of gig-economy drivers. It makes for an intriguing gambit. Walmart, the emblem of suburbia, is moving tentatively into Amazon’s metropolitan heartland.
The second part of the story is profit. Unlike Amazon, whose e-commerce business is not a big contributor to earnings, Walmart needs to justify returns on everything it does. That encourages it to think laterally, since online profit margins are meagre. As a result, it is seeking to defray the cost of its e-commerce distribution network by attracting third-party merchants, rather than just selling Walmart stuff. It is building a fast-growing advertising business, called Connect, which Mr Gutman reckons could generate $2bn of operating profit—8% of last year’s total—by 2025. And it is delving into fintech, specifically placing bets on customer-supporting financial services ranging from bill-paying to cryptocurrencies. All of these could bolster the bottom line without detracting from physical-store sales.
The twist in the tale, though, says Marc Wulfraat of MWPVL, a logistics consultancy, is Amazon. While Walmart may be encroaching on its urban territory, Amazon is on the counterattack across the suburban hinterland. Its weapons are distribution centres, the vast warehouses from which retailers ship goods around the country. In 2018, Mr Wulfraat says, the size of Amazon’s distribution network in America overtook Walmart’s. Since then, Amazon has sought to double it again, building what Mr Wulfraat reckons will be another 140m square feet of distribution centres—as much as Walmart has built in America in its entire 59-year history.
It is a daunting operation. Mr Wulfraat says that each week Amazon builds what some retailers construct in a decade. “It’s almost like a war effort,” says Ken Murphy, of abrdn, an asset manager that invests in Amazon. He reckons the logistics blitzkrieg is part of Amazon’s effort to shrink delivery times so sharply that people will have little incentive to go to stores. That makes Walmart, with its vast store network in America, vulnerable.
Banana armies
Defeat is not inevitable. More than half of Walmart’s domestic sales are groceries, which people are still hesitant to buy online. That gives it some protection from the Amazonslaught. So far Amazon’s ownership of Whole Foods, an upmarket grocery chain it bought in 2017, and its Fresh supermarket formats, have been half-hearted attempts to take on its Bentonville rival.
But if Amazon masters the art of cashierless shopping, as it is trying to do, it could change the buying of groceries as it has everything else, from bookselling to cloud-computing. So far Walmart can pride itself on keeping Amazon at bay while reinventing itself for an omnichannel world. And yet the grocery wars have barely begun. And the size of Amazon’s arsenal is growing. ■",1
1585," (CNN Business)Activision Blizzard confronted its second employee walkout in less than six months after a report raised new questions about CEO Bobby Kotick's knowledge of longstanding and widespread sexual harassment and discrimination allegations at the video game company.More than 100 Activision Blizzard employees staged a walkout on Tuesday calling for Kotick to step down as CEO, according to the group organizing it. The walkout came in response to a Wall Street Journal investigation published earlier in the day, which cited internal company documents and people familiar with the matter indicating that Kotick was aware of those issues for several years. In a video message to employees on Tuesday that was transcribed and posted on the company's website, Kotick claimed that the Journal story ""paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership."" He added that ""anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn't really appreciate how important this is to me.""While the report prompted renewed tension with some employees, Activision Blizzard's board of directors reiterated its support of Kotick. ""The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick's leadership, commitment and ability"" to address the company's longstanding and ongoing issues with harassment and discrimination, it said in a statement Tuesday. In a statement, the organizers behind the walkout said: ""The board is just as complicit if they let this slide. It's past time for Bobby to step down.""Activision Blizzard (ATVI) — which owns hugely popular titles such as ""Call of Duty,"" ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Candy Crush"" — has been roiled by a sexual harassment and discrimination scandal for months and is currently under scrutiny from multiple government agencies. A lawsuit filed in July by California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged a ""frat boy"" work culture where women were subjected to constant discrimination and harassment. (The company told CNN at the time that it had addressed past misconduct and criticized the lawsuit as ""inaccurate"" and ""distorted."") The lawsuit and the company's initial response kicked off a storm of dissent from Activision Blizzard's workforce that ultimately led to hundreds of employees staging a walkout at the company's offices in Irvine, California. Kotick subsequently acknowledged that the company's initial response was ""tone deaf.""The company is also facing a complaint from the National Labor Relations Board filed in September accusing it of unfair labor practices, as well as an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company has said it is cooperating with. Those actions are all still pending, and Activision Blizzard said it ""continues to productively engage with regulators.""The company also agreed to pay $18 million to settle a separate lawsuit by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that accused it of subjecting female employees to sexual harassment and retaliating against them for complaining about harassment. The company also ""discriminated against employees due to their pregnancy,"" the EEOC alleged.In a statement accompanying the EEOC settlement announcement, Kotick said he remained ""unwavering in my commitment to make Activision Blizzard one of the world's most inclusive, respected, and respectful workplaces.""Kotick, who has been Activision CEO since 1991, including at the time of the 2008 merger with Blizzard, has been in damage control mode for most of this year. Last month, he announced an intention to slash his controversial $155 million pay package — one of the largest in corporate America — to the ""lowest amount California law will allow"" until the gaming company fixes its issues with gender discrimination and harassment. If the board approves, Kotick will be paid $62,500, he said.",2
1586,"AS AN ICY wind rattles the windows of his office, Sergei Shapkin dips a biscuit in honey and ponders the art of survival. He is the mayor of Pavlopil, a village in eastern Ukraine. When Vladimir Putin started grabbing Ukrainian territory in February 2014, Mr Shapkin knew his village was in danger. On one side were pro-Russian separatists, armed by the Kremlin. On the other were loyalist forces. If they fought over Pavlopil, villagers would die.
So Mr Shapkin, a cardigan-wearing former history teacher, talked to the men with guns. His village was of no strategic value, but it had shops. He suggested that the separatists enter in the morning, unarmed and on foot, to buy food and cigarettes. The Ukrainian army could do the same each afternoon. That way, they would not bump into each other and start shooting. It worked—there was no fighting in Pavlopil, and the locals stayed alive, apart from one whose tractor hit a mine.

Ceasefires have come and gone since September 2014, and sporadic shooting continues in eastern Ukraine. Just on October 12th, the day of an EU-Ukraine summit in Kyiv, monitors counted nearly 300 ceasefire violations, including 77 explosions. “Everyone has a shelter,” says Mr Shapkin. “We’re all prepared with candles, hammers and torches. And we all have bags packed in case we suddenly have to move.”
Mr Putin wrote an essay in July expanding his argument that Russia and Ukraine are a single nation. Since he has already annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula, and sponsored the takeover of a big chunk of eastern Ukraine by ethnic Russian separatists, Ukrainians take his threats seriously. In March and April he massed more than 100,000 troops on the border, before pulling them back. Now, as winter approaches, Ukrainians have another worry: that Russia will turn off the gas again.
In 2009 it shut off the flow of gas through Ukraine for two weeks. This cost Russia a fortune, since its gas needs to pass through Ukraine to reach customers in Europe. Soon, though, it may be able to pump gas to Germany via a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, that bypasses Ukraine. Once it opens—which could be soon, though it is subject to legal and diplomatic challenges—Mr Putin will be able to choke off supplies to Ukraine almost at will.
Technically Ukraine does not buy gas directly from Russia, but from downstream countries such as Hungary. In reality, it takes Russian gas in the east and substitutes its own gas, which is produced in the west of Ukraine, for transmission onwards. So if the flow through Ukraine were to stop, the east of the country would be in trouble. “We’re gas hostages,” says Vadim Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, a port city 25km south of Pavlopil.
On October 12th in Kyiv Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, assured Ukrainians that Europe would protect their energy independence. They are not reassured. President Volodymyr Zelensky seeks shelter for his country inside NATO and the EU. But this is a non-starter. NATO members do not want to extend their principle of “an attack on one is an attack on all” to a country Russia has already attacked. And the EU has enough trouble integrating corrupt ex-communist states such as Hungary without admitting a grubbier, bigger one like Ukraine.
Trust is lacking on both sides. Mr Zelensky’s first taste of geopolitics was when President Donald Trump urged him to supply dirt on Joe Biden, with a veiled threat that American support for Ukraine’s security might depend on it. President Biden has not been much better, from a Ukrainian perspective. To cement relations with Germany, in May he waived sanctions that might have blocked Nord Stream 2.

The West would like to support reform in Ukraine, but it is not easy. Corruption is rife. Oligarchs dominate the economy, control two of the bigger political parties and put other lawmakers on retainer. The IMF hesitates to throw money at a state from which billions have been stolen with apparent impunity.
The oligarchs are entrenched in public life in complex ways. Consider Mariupol, which nearly fell to pro-Kremlin forces during the war. The conscripts who were supposed to defend it were about to flee. The city was saved when the local steel baron, Rinat Akhmetov, urged his staff onto the streets and another oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky, armed a militia. Seeing that the militiamen were ready to fight, Ukrainian soldiers stayed, too. Since then, Mariupol has become a haven for fugitives from the fighting: 100,000 out of a population of 540,000. The city looks far nicer than it did in 2014. Hefty investment has improved its buses, roads, parks and rubbish collection. A new airport and university are planned.
Public opinion has shifted, too. Before the war two-thirds of people in Mariupol supported a pro-Russia political party. That share has fallen by half. Mr Putin’s aggression has alienated the people he claims to defend. So the kind of “hybrid warfare” that worked in Donbas, where Russia stirred up local ethnic Russians to demand secession, will not work in Mariupol, says Mr Boichenko. Yet Russia still has a hand on Mariupol’s throat. The amount of cargo processed in its port has fallen by half since 2012, first because of the war, then because Mr Putin made it harder for big ships to reach it from the Black Sea. Critics wonder if it is healthy for a city to depend so much on one tycoon. Mr Akhmetov is said to be Ukraine’s richest man.
Mr Zelensky, a former comedian, has vowed to cut Ukraine’s oligarchs down to size. He is expected to sign a new law soon that would allow a panel he appoints to label as “oligarchs” anyone who is very rich, finances a political party and controls media assets. This would make it harder for anyone so labelled to raise capital.
Critics note that Mr Zelensky has close ties to Mr Kolomoisky, one of the most controversial oligarchs, whose television channel hosted the show that propelled the president to stardom. They worry that the law might give Mr Zelensky too much discretion to cow his enemies and force them to sell their television channels to his friends. “It’s to make oligarchs behave, politically,” says Daria Kaleniuk of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, an NGO. “Not to stop them from being oligarchs.”
One illustration of how oligarchs weaken Ukraine is the retail market for gas. Many homes get their gas from companies controlled by Dmitry Firtash, a tycoon with Russian ties who is living in Vienna and fighting extradition to America for alleged corruption. His firms have huge unpaid debts to Naftogaz, the state wholesale supplier. This is money that could have been invested to increase domestic gas production. Meanwhile, a new Naftogaz CEO appointed by Mr Zelensky agreed to pay the state a fat dividend out of the firm’s frosty-day fund. This will help Mr Zelensky build roads, which are popular, but will leave less in the kitty for Ukraine to buy emergency supplies should Mr Putin ramp up his pipeline power politics. ■

1587," (CNN)Netflix didn't make ""Tiger King 2"" available in advance, and zapping through it, it's easier to understand why.Adding relatively little to the story, and jumping all over the place, the project is mostly defined by how self-referential it is, with almost all roads leading back to the impact of the original docuseries, which was, let's face it, 19 months ago. If you're feeling nostalgic for the the early days of the pandemic for some reason or eager to see what Joe Exotic (as well as several lawyers) are up to, the five-episode season of ""Tiger King 2"" is streaming now on Netflix.The docuseries picks up where the first season left off, with Joseph Maldonado-Passage serving a 22-year prison sentence for violating the Endangered Species Act and an attempted murder-for-hire plot against rival big cat sanctuary owner Carole Baskin.Baskin and her current husband, Howard, have said they felt betrayed by their portrayal in the first season of the show and declined to participate in the second. The series revisits the disappearance of Baskin's first husband, Don Lewis, but doesn't shed new light.The rest of the returning cast of colorful characters seem to be enjoying the notoriety ""Tiger King"" has brought them.The timing of ""Tiger King's"" initial release in March of 2020, in hindsight, couldn't have been better. The timing now feels like a bit of a snooze. Assuming that counts as the concept's second life, let's hope nobody's planning on seven more.",2
1588,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",0
1589," (CNN)What's that we hear? Is it the sound of prominent conservatives and Trump allies openly rebuking former President Donald Trump? Are these the early murmurs of a conservative backlash against Trump? And is it possible a political lane is opening for another Republican presidential candidate in 2024?It's too soon to know, of course, and there's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.The statements from Rupert Murdoch -- who controls a media empire that includes, among other properties, the shamelessly pro-Trump Fox News -- and from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- an adviser who worked with the former president and helped him prepare for the presidential debates during the 2020 election -- may serve as a test for Republicans who understand just how harmful Trump's dominance of the GOP is, and how it could ultimately sink the party.It was startling when Murdoch, addressing his company at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said that the United States faces a number of major political decisions that conservatives will fail to shape unless Trump moves on. ""The current American political debate is profound,"" he said, citing education, welfare and economic opportunity. ""It is crucial that conservatives play an active, forceful role in that debate,"" he added, ""but that will not happen if President Trump stays focused on the past.""Murdoch is not alone in arguing that Trump is a threat to conservatives. Christie, who has just published a new book that looks very much like his unofficial entry into the 2024 presidential race, is making the same case, only more forcefully.Consider the title of Christie's book -- which effectively labels Trump a threat to the GOP: ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Notice that Trump fits two of the three reasons the party needs saving (by Christie, presumably).Murdoch and Christie are not the first Republicans who have stood up to the former president --  but their rebukes of Trump are markedly different. Trump's early critics, like Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and others, melted into passionate defenders once their criticisms proved perilous to their own standing. Their reversals bring to mind a quote often attributed to Groucho Marx: ""Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others."" Christie says many in the GOP are frightened of Trump, whose ""conduct is meant to instill fear."" Conservative Republicans who refuse to fall in line, such as Rep. Liz Cheney, are being hounded out of a party that is increasingly remade into the former president's raging, iconoclastic and intolerant brand.Sure, it's possible Murdoch and Christie's words may also fail to change the course of the GOP, but their criticism is different. They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party -- and the rest of the country -- that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.Coincidentally or not, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, finally acknowledged Biden's win on Thursday, more than a year after the 2020 vote. ""Painfully,"" she said, ""Joe Biden won the election and it's very painful to watch. He's the President. We know that."" Murdoch and Christie undoubtedly have their own personal motives for speaking out against Trump in this moment, and there's plenty of evidence to warrant accusations of hypocrisy. Murdoch, whose Fox News -- home of Tucker Carlson, a purveyor of harmful lies and propaganda about everything from the Covid vaccine to American democracy -- is still serving Trump's goals. But Fox News now faces billion-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by two voting technology companies that allege the network spread false claims of election fraud. Murdoch might be driven by a fear of liability and the potential damage additional lawsuits could inflict on his bottom line if Fox News continues to follow Trump down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and baseless claims. There is, also the possibility that he cares about the future of conservative politics, and genuinely fears the GOP might get trampled if Trump doesn't let up.Christie, for his part, is trying to promote his book and his prospects of occupying the White House.Still, it is remarkable that they have done the calculus and decided they can benefit from speaking out against the former president, even after other Republicans have been badly hurt by doing the same thing. I think their calculation makes sense. With President Joe Biden's ratings sinking, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are doomed. But it is Republicans who may be doomed if they continue to stick with the former president.There's no doubt the Biden administration is terrible at messaging. The economy is booming and yet consumers are feeling pessimistic. Meanwhile, Biden is making important legislative progress, and the inflationary pressures that are creating the false impression that the economy is failing could be resolved in time to boost Democrats' fortunes.Even if Democrats are still in the doldrums in 2024, it's hard to imagine that voters will be yearning for another four years of Trumpian chaos. Biden may look uninspiring now, but the former president, who had the most consistently poor approval ratings of any president in the modern era, remains highly unpopular and controversial. Do Republicans want a candidate embroiled in endless -- and serious -- legal troubles? According to the New York Times, prosecutors are likely to impanel a grand jury in Georgia in the criminal investigation of the former president's attempt to overturn the 2020 election (In September, he suggested he was being unfairly targeted, saying, ""Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me."") Meanwhile, prosecutors in New York have convened a second grand jury to hear evidence about Trump Organization's business practices, according to the Washington Post. (The first grand jury, which convened this spring, charged two Trump companies and an executive with tax evasion. Trump, who was not charged, blasted the indictment and called the investigation a ""political witch hunt."")A Pew poll conducted in September found that two-thirds of Republicans want Trump to remain a major force in the party, but only 44% want him to run again. One-third of Republicans and 92% of Democrats don't want him to be a major national political figure going forward. That's not the arithmetic of victory. There's the potential for a post-Trump Republican Party to gain ground. It still seems like a long shot at this point, but if his critics are successful in persuading the GOP to move in a different direction, there's a chance American democracy can return some semblance of normality, where political leaders debate what policies are best for the country, without fear of upsetting the tender, explosive feelings of a very bad loser.",2
1590,"ON A RECENT weekday in Perm, an industrial city of 1m people on the edge of western Siberia, patrons packed Toropomodoro, a popular pizza restaurant. “We were back to pre-pandemic levels of customers by June, and they’ve remained at that level since,” says Maxim Minin, the owner. Russia’s economy shrank by just 3% last year, leaving it in better shape than many. That is in part because the government did not reimpose a national lockdown after a second wave of covid-19 in the autumn. (Russia’s excess-mortality rate—313 per 100,000 people, far beyond that of America—suggests the human toll was enormous.) But it is also because the Russian economy has long experience of isolation.
Since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin has commanded the economy like a fortress under siege, building up reserves, decoupling from the world economy, and preparing for the potential impact of Western sanctions or fluctuations in oil prices. This fortress is effective at protecting against outside shocks. But inside its walls it breeds stagnation and malaise, which fuel Alexei Navalny’s opposition movement and the protests against Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. “It’s about stability, not development—or more specifically about control,” says Natalia Zubarevich, an economist and geographer. “They won’t let the economy die, but in this system development isn’t possible.”

The foundations of the fortress are high reserves and low debt. For Mr Putin, the Russian government’s default in 1998 was a formative trauma. When he became president a little over a year later, he set out to build up the country’s reserves. When the global financial crisis sent oil prices plummeting in mid-2008, Russia had $570bn on hand, equivalent to almost a third of GDP. This proved handy. The government burned $220bn refinancing banks and defending the rouble. But after the crisis it kept spending on the armed forces, public-sector salaries and pensions. Firms went on a borrowing spree of their own. When the West slapped Russia with sanctions and the oil price crashed in 2014, the economy spiralled out of control.

Russia has since rebuilt and restructured its reserves. At the end of 2020, it had $183bn in its rainy-day National Welfare Fund (NWF), the most since 2009. Russia’s overall international reserves stood at $596bn, equivalent to nearly two years of imports. To hedge against sanctions, the central bank has also shifted its holdings away from American banks and out of American dollars: the share of its international reserves held on American territory fell from 30% in 2013 to just 7% now. It has more of its overall reserves in gold (24%) than in dollars (22%) (see chart 1).

Both the corporate sector and the state have paid down their debt. Squeezed by sanctions, Russian firms shed liabilities: since 2014, non-financial firms have reduced the amount of debt owed to foreign creditors by 25%. Banks cut theirs by 65%. The government ran budget surpluses in 2018 and 2019. Even after some deficit spending during the pandemic, its debt is equivalent to around 20% of GDP; only one-fifth is held by foreigners. Fresh American sanctions barring financial institutions from buying new Russian bonds were calibrated to limit their impact; but even a wider ban on the secondary market may merely lead to more debt being held domestically. Russian banks buy most of the new bonds: during the most recent bond issuance earlier this month, state-owned VTB Bank scooped up some 70% of the offerings.
Russia has also cut its dependence on dollar invoicing. The share of its exports handled in dollars has fallen from 80% in 2013 to less than 60% last year (see chart 2). Less than half of Russia’s trade with China is settled in dollars. In trade with the EU, the euro has almost overtaken the dollar.

The Kremlin would like to see cyber-decoupling, too. A law passed in 2019 is intended to give the government the ability to cut the Russian internet off from the rest of the world. It follows earlier data-localisation laws designed to force foreign companies to store Russian users’ data in Russia. Home-grown Russian technology firms already compete with Western giants in many sectors. Yandex runs head-to-head with Google in the Russian search market; it beat Uber to dominate ride-hailing. Two Russian companies, Wildberries and Ozon, sit atop the nascent e-commerce market, where Amazon does not operate.
Yet Russia has neither the breadth of home-grown technologies nor the technical capabilities at the state level to erect a Chinese-style firewall. Although the Kremlin frets about the reach of foreign social networks, such as YouTube, where Mr Navalny broadcasts, their wide audiences and a lack of local alternatives make banning them unpalatable. An attempt to block the messaging app Telegram in 2018 ended with Pavel Durov, the firm’s Russian exile founder, outfoxing the Russian regulators and racking up millions of new users.
An attempt this year to slow down Twitter using new filtering tools was swiftly followed by the Kremlin’s own site crashing. Despite directives to ditch outside IT, in 2019 the government’s audit chamber found that 96% of state institutions still use unapproved foreign software. Eschewing Western technology has often meant using more Chinese stuff, a prospect less abhorrent for the Kremlin than relying on America, but still uncomfortable.
Russia’s economy remains highly dependent on hydrocarbons. Despite years of promises, no meaningful diversification has taken place. Hydrocarbons still account for more than 60% of exports, and some 40% of government revenues. Though China has been buying more Russian oil and gas in recent years, the EU remains Russia’s biggest customer and Russia the EU’s biggest supplier, accounting for 30% of the bloc’s crude-oil imports and 40% of its natural gas. That would make any embargo on Russian energy exports too disruptive for the West to stomach.
No future in the fortress
As resilient as Russia’s fiscal fortress may be, preserving it means tight limits on spending. Russia’s covid-19-related stimulus measures amounted to just 4% of GDP, according to the World Bank. The pandemic, in Mr Putin’s eyes, is not the proverbial rainy day the NWF was intended for: the fund actually grew in 2020. The limited stimulus was instead financed by borrowing. Most of the stimulus came through tax breaks and loan guarantees, rather than direct support to small- and medium-sized firms or households. As Tatiana Maksimenko, director of a children’s centre in Perm, says, “For the government, I don’t have much value. My business is small and my taxes into the budget aren’t huge.”
Real incomes fell by 3.5% in 2020, leaving the average Russian’s income 10% lower than in 2013. One survey showed that after a six-week lockdown at the start of the pandemic, nearly half of households had no savings or only enough to cover a month of expenses. Food prices have risen by 7.7% since February 2020. The cost of basic products such as sunflower oil and sugar has grown by 27% and 48% respectively. Some of the hottest businesses in Russia these days are discount retailers, such as Svetofor, a Siberian chain that forgoes shelves and displays its cut-price products in cardboard boxes on the floor.
The future looks no brighter. Russia will struggle as the world moves away from fossil fuels. Little has been done to prepare for a greener future. Renewable energy currently accounts for less than 1% of Russia’s power generation. Investments in clean energy between 2014 and 2019 amounted to just $5bn, one-sixth of Brazil’s over the same period and one-tenth of India’s, according to BloombergNEF, a data provider. Some economists are alarmed. “The rents that we enjoyed for the last 20 years will never come back,” a former finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, wrote last year. “That’s a huge challenge for all of economic policy.”
The petrodollars stopped generating growth long ago. In 2000-08, amid an oil boom, Russia grew by 6.6% a year; in 2012-19, GDP growth averaged just 1%. That pace leaves Russia trailing not only other countries at a similar level of development, but even rich countries, which tend to grow more slowly. It amounts to just half the rate the Soviet Union saw from 1977 to 1985, the latter part of the era known as “Stagnation”.
In the late 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev tried to resuscitate a moribund economy, launching reforms that helped lead to the Soviet regime’s collapse. Mr Putin is determined not to repeat that. Boosting growth would require embarking on reforms that would challenge his grip on Russia’s politics. Yet without structural changes, the IMF reckons that Russia’s growth in the coming years will remain below 2%.
If the Kremlin hoped that stagnation would mean social stability, growing discontent is proving otherwise. According to the Levada Centre, an independent polling group, the number of people who expect economic protests in Russia has risen from 26% a year ago to 43%. For Artyom, a 30-year-old stock trader who protested in Perm in the wake of Mr Navalny’s arrest in January, demonstrating was not just about the “lawlessness” of the Kremlin’s treatment of a critic. His frustration had been building for other reasons: “the inability to provide future prospects and improve people’s quality of life”. A slice of pizza at Toropomodoro is a poor substitute for a vision of the future in Russia. ■

1591," (CNN)Suspended South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh has been indicted on more than two dozen new financial crimes by a state grand jury, which alleged schemes to ""defraud victims of and thereafter launder"" nearly $5 million in five different counties.South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson's office announced Friday a state grand jury issued five indictments with a total of 27 charges against Murdaugh.The indictments include four counts of Breach of Trust with Fraudulent Intent; seven counts of Obtaining Signature or Property by False Pretenses; seven counts of Money Laundering; eight counts of Computer Crimes; and one count of Forgery.The majority of the indictments center on cases and victims not previously known to the public, like a highway patrolman injured in the line of duty, from whom prosecutors allege Murdaugh stole settlement money for ""his own personal use, for expenses including but not limited to overdraft fees, cash, and checks written to associates.""""Altogether, Murdaugh is charged with respect to alleged schemes to defraud victims and thereafter launder $4,853,488.09,"" said the Attorney General's office in a release Friday.According to the indictments, state attorneys alleged Murdaugh defrauded and laundered $792,000 in Bamberg County, $125,000 in Orangeburg County, $70,000 in Colleton County, $383,056.14 in Allendale County and $3,483,431.95 in Beaufort County. The multi-million-dollar sum in Beaufort County is related to the previously reported wrongful death settlement with the family of the Murdaugh family's housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield. Murdaugh is currently being held without bond in a Columbia, S.C. jail on two earlier charges of obtaining property by false pretenses related to the Satterfield family wrongful death settlement. In a statement sent to CNN, the attorneys for the Satterfield family addressed the new indictments, saying, in part, ""The Satterfield family is grateful to law enforcement for their continued efforts in the investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Gloria Satterfield and the egregious breaches of trust and theft committed upon her sons. The additional indictments brought today in connection with the crimes committed against Gloria and her sons as well as apparently others are welcome, long overdue and were appropriately brought.""Attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Ritcher continued in the statement, ""Of course, Mr. Murdaugh is entitled to his presumption of innocence and to his rights under the criminal process.  For now, however, it seems the statewide grand jury was as unimpressed with his opioid defense and other explanations given as we have been.  As always, we are steadfastly in the Satterfield corner and committed to seeing these matters to the end.  Ultimately, we will entrust a judge or jury to let us know when the Satterfields have received their full cup of justice -- not Alex Murdaugh or his attorneys.""CNN has reached out to Murdaugh's attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, for comment but has not received a response.He is also facing several lawsuits in civil court, including one from his former firm.Murdaugh, a once prominent South Carolina attorney, was shot in the head on a roadway September 4, but survived. He later admitted to authorities he conspired with former client Curtis Smith to kill him as part of a fraud scheme so his only surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance payout.Murdaugh has since been charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false police report.The shooting followed the June deaths of Murdaugh's wife, Margaret, and son, Paul, who were fatally shot outside their home in Islandton, South Carolina. The case remains unsolved. Murdaugh has denied responsibility in the killings.",2
1592,"THE MOB that rampaged through the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 6th would acknowledge little in common with the pro-democracy activists who invaded Hong Kong’s Legislative Council (LegCo) in July 2019. They were trying to overturn a free and fair democratic election—which was precisely what the Hong Kong protesters wanted to be granted. But the two sets of malcontents were similar in at least one way, which they shared with most of the protest movements that swept the world in 2019 and early 2020: they relied heavily on digital media for organisation, publicity and communication; and that reliance has made them easier to trace as the authorities seek retribution.
From demonstrations against police brutality in Nigeria to anti-mask activism in America, protests around the world have had different catalysts and ambitions, fallen on different sides of the political spectrum and occurred under wildly differing forms of government. But they have often been leaderless, horizontally structured and heavily reliant on digital media. In many places, though, they share another similarity: they are struggling to sustain momentum as coronavirus restrictions continue to constrain activism and as incumbent governments get better at countering the 21st-century digital tools used by protesters.

The internet and, in particular, social media have opened new vistas for protesters and have transformed street activism. An adage of Bruce Lee, a martial-arts star—“Be formless, shapeless, like water”—defined young Hong Kong protesters’ tactics in 2019. They eschewed the immobile sit-ins of the past for fluid, nimble-footed provocations, communicating on encrypted apps such as Telegram. They confounded authorities with their flash-mob tactics, rapidly mobilising in thousands to shut down the city airport or sing their anthem in shopping malls. Extinction Rebellion, an environmental movement, embraced similar techniques to bring British cities to a halt during their climate protests.
These movements, though typically dominated by the young, have been multi-generational, multi-class and multi-ethnic. Most lacked obvious leaders (or are, as many prefer it, “leaderful”). Rather than following a charismatic figurehead, they have united around icons as diverse and bizarre as milk tea; a rubber duck; and a “pussy” hat (a pink design, with cats’ ears, inspired by notorious recorded remarks by President Donald Trump). This has enabled them to survive despite the arrest of prominent campaigners. Wong Yik-mo, of Hong Kong’s Civil Human Rights Front, currently in exile in Taiwan, says that if China arrests 1,000 “leaders”, “another 1,000 will emerge to take their place”. The Hong Kong authorities, who, also on January 6th, rounded up dozens of pro-democracy activists for their involvement in an unofficial virtual “primary election” last year, seem ready to test the hypothesis.
Digital dexterity also provided protesters with a degree of protection. Warnings can be pinged instantly to thousands. In Hong Kong, HKmap.live tracked the real-time movement of police, vehicles and tear-gas through crowdsourced data (though, under pressure from the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, Apple removed the app). This matters: consequences can be dire. Protesters have been tortured in Belarus and shot in Nigeria, Chile, Iraq, Egypt, and elsewhere.
In 2020 the global wave of protests crashed into two big barriers. One was covid-19. Social-distancing measures helped governments squash the huge street demonstrations of 2019. Some movements persisted and some—in Belarus, for example—were launched. Activists devised novel, creative ways to continue campaigning, such as doing so on the multiplayer Nintendo game “Animal Crossing” or waging “editing wars” on Wikipedia. Yet most activists agree that online campaigns are not enough to bring change.
The second barrier is more enduring and more fundamental: the concerted resistance of many of the targets of protest—often using the activists’ own tools, and deploying them with ever-increasing sophistication. As Piyanut Kotsan, director of Amnesty International Thailand, comments: “Both sides are using social media. Facebook pages, press meetings, even Telegram, can be compromised by the government.” In Hong Kong, as in Thailand, protesters were arrested before actions started—clear evidence, says Mr Wong, that online-messaging groups were infiltrated by “spies”.
During the protests, China allegedly tried to create splits between non-violent and radical elements, pumping out huge amounts of propaganda in an attempt to tar protesters as rioters or stooges of foreign powers. In August 2019 Facebook and Twitter blocked hundreds of accounts they said were connected to China’s state-backed misinformation campaigns. In this, China is not an outlier. In an inventory it compiles annually, the Oxford Internet Institute, a department of Oxford University, found the number of countries with organised misinformation campaigns had risen to 81 in 2020, up from 28 three years ago. Social media can also be used to trace activists. In Egypt, for example, after a flurry of small anti-government protests in September the government blocked social-media platforms and arrested hundreds for their activity online.
Curbing online access is a common tactic. In Belarus mobile signal was cut off for a few days amid the widespread protests after the presidential election in August; in India, Iran and Egypt, internet access was severed during demonstrations in 2019. Like protesters, “authoritarian regimes learn from each other and duplicate each other's tool kits,” says Philip Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute. “In last year’s inventory, we found the first evidence of training sessions…Learning how to rent tens of thousands of fake users from a troll farm, then how to use those trolls to go after a particular target.” Demonstrators have in turn found innovative ways to stay connected despite internet and app shutdowns, turning to offline applications that use Bluetooth like Bridgefy and Firechat, or even organising through Tinder, a dating app, or “Pokemon Go”, a game.
Twenty-first-century protesters may be technologically adept and globally connected, and therefore hard to repress, yet governments, too, are increasingly run by digital natives; and they have resources and manpower the embattled protesters do not. As Hong Kong has just shown, when their opponents use digital media in ways they find threatening, such as holding an election, they can simply criminalise the activity. In many places, neither side looks ready to back down. But the contestants do not seem evenly matched.",1
1593,"THAT IT TOOK almost a quarter of a century of diplomatic wrangling, setbacks and innovation for the world to put Paris’s numbers and procedures to Rio’s remarkable ambition makes it unsurprising that, as yet, little has been done to meet its goals. In 1992, according to figures from Our World in Data, 78% of the world’s primary energy—the stuff used to produce electricity, drive movement and provide heat both for industrial purposes and to warm buildings—came from fossil fuels. By 2019 the total amount of primary energy used had risen by 60%. And the proportion provided by fossil fuels was now 79%.
Over the same period the share of primary energy provided as electricity by modern renewables—wind turbines and solar panels—rose from nothing to 3%. The share provided by nuclear power, which is also generated without fossil fuels, fell from 5.4% to 4%. Hydroelectricity was more or less stable at 6%.

Luckily, not all trends are linear. The highly subsidised growth in renewables that began to take off in the early 2000s has not yet made a big dent in global energy consumption, but it has vastly reduced the cost of wind turbines and solar panels. In many markets renewable-electricity projects can now match or undercut the price of fossil-fuel infrastructure—at least if their developers borrow at the same rates as fossil-fuel developers. In 2020 the share of the world’s energy generated by solar panels grew by 21%, which points to a doubling every four years. Wind, which now supplies twice as much energy as solar, is growing more slowly, by 12% a year. But that is still a six-year doubling. The 3% penetration achieved in the past two decades might prove the basis for 30% or more over the next two.
The process can be speeded up further by the simple expedient of making fossil fuels more expensive. Carbon pricing has not, so far, had the traction that economists would wish for it. Most fossil-fuel users do not pay a carbon tax; nor are they subject to a cap-and-trade system of CO2 emission permits. But in one of the world’s largest economies, the European Union, electricity generators and an increasing number of other businesses face real costs for burning fossil fuels. Over the first half of this year, emitting a tonne of CO2 under the EU’s permit scheme cost, on average, €44 ($53).

The more the world’s generators face similarly significant carbon prices, the more completely renewables will triumph over existing fossil-fuel plants and the more attractive low-emission approaches to heavy industrial processes will become. And the cleaner the grid becomes the more helpful it will be to electrify consumer activities which used to depend on the burning of fossil fuels, such as the driving of cars and the heating of homes.
Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas. Human activities also emit methane (from the natural-gas industry and rubbish heaps, but also from livestock), nitrous oxide (mostly from agriculture) and chlorine-bearing industrial gases. That these boost the rise in temperature is a problem, but is to some extent more tractable. Big reductions in agricultural emissions of methane and nitrous-oxide emissions will take time (though marginal improvements would come quickly if beef consumption fell). But other approaches to methane reduction, including plugging holes in the natural-gas infrastructure, might happen faster. Slashing methane emissions in half could, other things being equal, knock 0.2-0.3°C off the world’s temperature.
Brimstone, too
Other “short-lived climate forcers”, as they are known, are more problematic. Sulphur-dioxide emissions, which are mostly associated with burning coal and heavy oils, produce small airborne particles of sulphate which reflect sunlight back into space, offsetting greenhouse warming. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) these particles cool Earth roughly as much as methane warms it. As the use of coal declines, so will the levels of sulphate, exacerbating global warming.
Cheap renewables and the willingness to pay for their installation; the electrification of ever more aspects of daily life; the clear efficacy of carbon pricing; a new seriousness about short-lived climate forcers: they all make action on climate change look easier today than it did 12 years ago, when the meant-to-be-momentous Copenhagen climate summit ended in disarray and disagreement, and also a good bit easier than it did six years ago in Paris. The new round of “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) that countries are volunteering under the rules of the Paris agreement reflect that progress.
Yet the increased ambition in the NDCs should not be mistaken for anything like victory; at best it shows that the world is just about staying in the game. As the collapse in Copenhagen made clear, the UNFCCC, despite being a treaty that was signed by almost all the countries in the world, cannot be used to force those countries to take action. The Paris agreement worked around this impotence with a sort of cognitive dissonance. Together, the member countries set demanding temperature targets; individually, they committed themselves to voluntary NDCs that offered far too little by way of emission reductions for those targets to be met.

So although the NDCs being offered at Glasgow—the Paris agreement calls for a new set every five years—are more ambitious, they always had to be. To come even close to achieving the temperature goals requires a lot more progress, much of it in areas where alternatives are less well developed than renewables were at the time of Paris, and a lot of it already assumed in this round of NDCs. There is still a lot of fundamental work to be done on how to decarbonise things which cannot be electrified. Nor is turning the easy deployment of cheap renewables into stable, reliable electricity grids a problem that is anything like fully solved.
Even if progress does continue, it is not going to produce emission reductions that are deep enough to meet the target of keeping overall warming as low as 1.5°C. The inclusion of efforts towards meeting that goal in the Paris agreement was a central demand for climate-vulnerable countries. For some low-lying island states, it was an existential issue: “one point ﬁve to stay alive,” as the chant had it. More generally it was seen as a way of ratcheting up the ambition of the whole UNFCCC process. Its supporters were willing to give ground on other things in order to see it adopted. It would be going too far to dismiss the limit’s inclusion in the text of the agreement as “the tribute vice pays to virtue”, the pithy deﬁnition of hypocrisy by La Rochefoucauld, a 17th century aphorist. But it was easier to accept the less than stellar NDCs on offer from many large countries in the context of the increased long-term ambition of the 1.5°C limit.
The biggest problem with this is that, even in Paris, it was clear that the 1.5°C limit could not be met by emission reductions alone. They would have to be supplemented by something else: the withdrawal of CO2 from the atmosphere by means of “negative emissions”. In a few years CO2 removal went from a largely sidelined topic to a central one. But substance has not kept up with increased salience; mechanisms which can provide lots of reliable CO2 removal remain, at best, embryonic.
At the same time, the amount of work that negative emissions may be required to do is getting ever greater. Analysis in the World Energy Outlook published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in the run-up to Glasgow finds that the pledges so far made in the NDCs are too small to provide a good chance of staying under 2°C, let alone 1.5°C. And this is despite some ambitious pledges with significant negative emissions built in: a net-zero America by 2050, a net-zero China by 2060.
Stabilising the climate will always be challenging; but the lower the residual emissions, the better the odds of meeting the challenge. Unfortunately, decarbonisation at a rate anywhere close to that required by Paris still looks highly unlikely to happen. To see why, this report turns next to the region where most emissions now come from, and where the largest share of cuts in future will be needed: Asia.■

1594,"Police in Portland were forced to declare a riot after protestors turned violent, clashing with officers and smashing windows, as looting and protests erupted overnight in major cities following Kyle Rittenhouse's not-guilty verdict. 
Masses of people gathered coast-to-coast Friday night to decry Rittenhouse's acquittal in protests that reflected the divisiveness and anger stoked by the high-profile case. 
Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on August 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Hours after the verdict, police in Portland were forced to declare a riot after about 200 protestors turned destructive, damaging the front gate of the Multnomah County Justice Center and clashing with officers.   
'Due to violent, destructive behavior by a significant part of the crowd, the gathering in downtown Portland is a RIOT. All participants are instructed to proceed away to the WEST,' the Portland Police Bureau wrote on Twitter.
According to police, rioters threw objects at officers, smashed the rear window of a police car as well as windows from the city print shop and spray-painted the justice center building with graffiti that read 'all cops are Kyles, no justice, no peace', FOX 12 reported.  
Protestors were warned they would be arrested and were subject to force if they remained in the area. 
In total, one person was arrested for a warrant and five citations and 17 warnings were issued, FOX 12reported.   
The high profile case has riled the nation and led to Republican senator Tom Cotton to call on President Joe Biden to publicly apologize to Rittenhouse for suggesting the teen was a white supremacist during his presidential campaign. 
Biden tweeted a video where he featured an image of Rittenhouse alongside footage of white supremacist groups. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' Cotton tweeted.
In Chicago looters broke into a Neiman Marcus and a Game Stop on the Southside as protest went on in the downtown area.  
FOX 32 reported that 15 males stormed into a Mag Mile Neiman Marcus store, stealing merchandise and escaping in three separate vehicles. 
Overhead footage shows a South Side GameStop store with broken glass and merchandise on the ground, but police did not confirm if it was a looting, FOX 32 reported.
In New York City, hundreds gathered outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to express their fury in the verdict as similar events unfolded across the nation.
Scores of people were seen marching through New York about 7 p.m. carrying signs that branded Rittenhouse as a 'racist killer' and the judicial system as biased.
'The message is that when you stand up for black liberation, when you stand up for black lives, no matter who you are you automatically become a target of the system,' Na-Lakan Masego, a protester, told CBS New York. 
Another speaker at the rally said the jury's verdict was a blow to the entire nation.
'By allowing Kyle Rittenhouse to walk away, this entire country – this government – has slapped us all in the face for the millionth time,' he told the crowd. 'We cannot allow them to continue treating us like we do not exist because they hurt us.' 
 
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. 
Kenosha itself remained largely quiet as the night wore on.
A crowd of around 40 people gathered at the courthouse but remained peaceful. Many carried signs, including one saying 'Welcome to AmeriKKKa.'
A middle-aged man, wearing a Stars and Stripes hat tried to provoke the crowd with a sign saying 'Rittenhouse Rules!' 
One young woman was arrested after she scrawled the words 'White supremacists are cowards' and 'Judge Schroeder must go' on the courthouse steps. She was referring to the trial's judge, Bruce Schroeder.
Police, who had largely stayed out of sight as the crowd grew, swooped in quickly and hauled her away. 
President Joe Biden has urged peace, saying the country must abide by the jury's verdict. 
New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said the issue revolves around the definition of self-defense, which Rittenhouse claimed to be acting in when he shot the three men.
'It also depends who has a gun, and it also depends on what they're actually fighting for,' he told CBS New York. 'It seems if you are trying to say something about Black Lives Matter or something about justice and equity, it doesn't have the same weight.'
Others chanted 'no justice, no peace,' and 'these racist cops have got to go' as they marched.
One event speaker called on attendees to continue participating in such events as long as it remains necessary, despite the approaching winter.
'Black lives are still mattering and they're still going to be shot down,' she said. 'And when we call on you to show up, I need you to f***ing show up.' 
In Los Angeles, the Coalition for Community Control Over the Police called on its supporters to step up in protest.
'Kyle walked,' the group said on its Facebook page.
It invited protesters to meet Friday afternoon at Florence and Normandie, where outraged masses gathered in 1992 after a jury acquitted four police officers in the brutal beating of Rodney King, sparking the LA riots.
'Bring water and mutual aid items if u want to continue that work.'
Dozens of people gathered at Chicago's Federal Plaza carrying signs that said 'reject racist vigilante terror' and chanting 'lock him up,' the Chicago Tribune reported.
'He is part of a whole fascist movement that is gaining ground around the country and it will not stop until we recognize it and take matters into our own hands nonviolently refusing to accept a racist America,' event speaker Jay Becker told attendees during the peaceful event.
Some shouted: 'The whole damn system is guilty as hell. Indict, convict, send Rittenhouse to jail.'
In Northern California, businesses were boarding their windows and police were erecting barricades to prepare for planned protests, ABC News 7 reported.
About 100 people participated in an Oakland protest.
Portland Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell said during a Friday press conference that it was 'reasonable' to expect protests in that city as well.
'Here in Portland especially, it's reasonable to expect there will be some type of reaction to the verdict,' Lovell told reporters. 'Like we've said many, many times, we're supportive of peaceful protest, people exercising their First Amendment rights.'
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers also called for calm in a statement released Friday afternoon.
'I echo the calls of local Kenosha community leaders and join them in asking everyone who might choose to assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights in any community to please only do so safely and peacefully,' the governor said.
'We must have peace in Kenosha and our communities, and any efforts or actions aimed at sowing division are unwelcome in our state as they will only hinder that healing.'",3
1595,"FOR A MAN who wants to live for ever, Peter Thiel has already done enough in his 53 years to leave mere mortals exhausted—and mostly frustrated. The venture capitalist, techno-Utopian and scourge of the liberal left is a myriad of contradictions.
He co-founded PayPal, a payments platform that, as a young libertarian, he hoped would undermine the world’s monetary system. Instead it gave him the money to bestride Silicon Valley, a place he disdains. He was the earliest outside investor in Facebook, a tech giant on whose board he remains, though he mocks social media. As a hedge-fund manager, he bet on an economic meltdown in America ahead of the financial crisis of 2007-09, but called the bottom of the market too soon. He was one of the most prominent financiers to throw his weight behind Donald Trump’s bid for the presidency in 2016. Yet his efforts to populate the Trump administration with radical-thinking acolytes failed.

Max Chafkin, who trawls through this litany of inconsistencies in a new book, “The Contrarian”, writes fluently. But he fails to find an explanation that ties the threads together. At his most charitable, he praises Mr Thiel as a creator of immense wealth because of the tech firms he has backed (besides PayPal and Facebook, they include sharing-economy giants such as Airbnb and Lyft, plus a host of other blitzscaling platforms). At his most damning, he portrays his subject as a tax-avoiding “nihilist” whose right-leaning ideology is mostly aimed at increasing his wealth and power.
And yet strangely Mr Chafkin, a business writer, only obliquely refers to the most intriguing business story. Between the lines, a picture emerges of an erratic visionary whose work, however creepy, isn’t done. Mr Thiel is applying the radicalism that inspired PayPal to cryptocurrencies and decentralised payment platforms. The “Make America Great Again” schtick that drew him to Mr Trump has led to investments in military, surveillance and space technology that have helped double his net worth in the past year. His yearning to reclaim Silicon Valley from software-loving peaceniks and return to its roots in the cold-war military-industrial complex is bearing fruit—and spreading beyond California.
In short, his peculiar brand of libertarianism appears to have a new lease of life. With one hand, he wants to free individuals from government shackles by enabling them to create their own currencies. With the other, he is selling technology to a strong security establishment so that it can protect them from potential enemies. It is enough to make Silicon Valley’s mixture of hippies and yuppies hyperventilate on their yoga mats.
It is not the first time a man described by Mr Chafkin as socially awkward has built a movement of like-minded people bent on shaking up the tech industry. The PayPal mafia that he helped bring together at the turn of the century continues to flourish. Besides him, its best-known member is Elon Musk, whose SpaceX rocket company is backed by Mr Thiel’s Founders Fund, a venture-capital (VC) firm. Last valued at $74bn, on September 18th it returned the first-ever civilian crew from orbit. It is in the vanguard of America’s re-energised aerospace industry.
Others, too, have stuck by Mr Thiel for decades and share his security obsessions. Palantir, a data-analytics firm worth $52bn, is used by the American armed forces, immigration authorities and numerous police departments. It was co-founded by Mr Thiel in 2003 and is run by an old friend, Alexander Karp (who used to sit on the board of The Economist’s parent company). In the run-up to its initial public offering last year, Mr Karp told potential investors the company, though born in Silicon Valley, shared few of its values. “Our software is used to target terrorists and keep soldiers safe…we have chosen sides,” he said.
Anduril, a startup defence contractor also backed by Mr Thiel, is building pilotless drones for military surveillance. Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, a VC firm (who is also a Facebook director), has written of the emergence of a new generation of Silicon Valley-style defence companies. “There are some in our industry who view serving such agencies and missions as controversial. We do not,” he wrote in 2019, announcing a co-investment with Mr Thiel’s Founders Fund in Anduril. It was last valued at about $4.6bn.
Even without Mr Trump, Mr Thiel continues to mix business and politics. This year he joined forces with Narya, a vc fund led by J.D. Vance, the author of “Hillbilly Elegy”, to invest in Rumble, a video platform popular among right-wingers. He is backing Mr Vance in the Republican Senate primary in Ohio. Blake Masters, Mr Thiel’s co-author on “Zero to One”, a bestseller published in 2014, hopes to represent the Republicans in the Arizona Senate race. The New Yorker has speculated that “The Rise of the Thielists” could provide the Republican Party with a post-Trump ideology.
The cryptoking
If that is the case, it would probably involve continued pillorying of big-tech firms, especially Google, which Mr Thiel has long accused of being a monopoly. The new ideology would be anti-China, a country Mr Thiel portrays as using artificial intelligence (AI) to centralise control over the economy. “If AI is communist, crypto is libertarian,” he wrote last year. It would look favourably on cryptocurrencies and blockchains. He is a big backer of Block.one, a blockchain-software company whose crypto unit, Bullish, is planning to go public via a $9bn reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company.
All this takes tech investing beyond Silicon Valley into new realms, some of them menacing to many observers. That will not worry Mr Thiel. Palantir is named after a “seeing stone” most often used by Sauron, ruler of J.R.R. Tolkien’s evil empire of Mordor in “The Lord of the Rings”. Evidently Mr Thiel, ever the contrarian, does not view Mordor as harshly as most Tolkien fans do. As he once told a friend: “I’d rather be seen as evil than incompetent.” ■

1596,"THE MORNING after the September 11th attacks, as exhausted first-responders looked for survivors in rubble still wreathed in smoke, New Yorkers braced themselves for more attacks. The final death toll came to 2,743 people, almost all New Yorkers. America would later launch two long, costly wars in response and squander its moral authority in prisons in Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. In some ways the country is worse off now than it was on September 10th 2001, more anxious, more polarised, less trusting. New York City, though, is better. The resurrection of Lower Manhattan acted as a catalyst for rebuilding and rethinking well beyond the area destroyed on that terrible day.
The smoke, ashes and dust radiated outwards from the site of the attack. But so, more gradually, did the construction boom, which spread from Tribeca, up to Chelsea and eventually across the five boroughs to long-neglected neighbourhoods like Jamaica and Flushing in Queens, to Staten Island’s St George and along Brooklyn’s waterfront. New York City ended up “greater than ever”, says Dan Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor. Few would have predicted this outcome while a 16-acre pit burned for months. But for New Yorkers staggered by the shock of 9/11, rebuilding became a rallying cause, a way of not letting the terrorists win.

What followed was the reimagination of Lower Manhattan, one of America’s biggest business districts. Before, just 23,000 people lived in the area. It emptied out each evening, as office workers, who mainly worked in finance, insurance or property, went home. The World Trade Centre, now remembered with wistfulness, was not loved when it still stood. The complex around it blocked streets, cutting off the surrounding neighbourhood. Its underground shopping centre, popular with commuters, siphoned punters from street stores. “It was very rare to see anybody walking a dog and pushing a baby carriage,” recalls Robert McKay, a lawyer who worked in the area.

Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire media mogul, then a Republican, was elected mayor two months after the attacks and partly because of them: Republicans tend to win mayoral elections only when the habitually Democratic city is in crisis. He called on businesses to do their part by staying. “This is no time to leave the Big Apple,” he said in his inaugural speech. Some moved to nearby midtown, including Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 658 people—every employee at their desk on the 101st to 105th floors of the North Tower. Its new office was no higher than the fire department’s highest ladder. Only a few businesses left the city altogether. Some only threatened to go, among them the New York Stock Exchange.
It became an act not just of patriotism, but of self-interest, to operate downtown. As it turned out, the timing was fortuitous. Other American cities would revive their urban cores in the next 20 years as well. Yet that was not knowable at the time. Many companies that stayed in Manhattan availed themselves of new financial incentives. The federal government authorised $8bn in Liberty Bonds, a sort of tax-exempt financing. It also gave New York a $20.5bn aid package. George Pataki, the governor, appointed John Whitehead, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, to lead the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which was charged with guiding the revival of the area, including the rebuilding on the World Trade Centre site. At times, the task seemed hopeless. Almost everyone agreed that the area needed to be rebuilt, but they also seemed to have different ideas of what should be built where, by whom and with whose money.
Disagreements among insurance companies, developers and politicians delayed the project for years. The reconstruction had to navigate round a dozen subway lines and a New Jersey commuter line, as well as the feelings of victims’ families. But in 2006 the first office building, 7 World Trade Centre, was finished, along with an electricity substation in its lower floors. The memorial opened in 2011, and One World Trade Centre—built to the patriotic height of 1,776 feet—was finished in 2014. The Oculus, a gravity-defying train terminal and shopping centre, was completed in 2016. Two more skyscrapers and a performing arts centre are in the works. A Greek Orthodox church, which was also destroyed that day, will reopen next year.

The years after 9/11 proved to be an era of municipal ambition the like of which New York had not experienced in two generations. The subway was expanded for the first time in decades. Other projects, such as the High Line (an obsolete freight track converted to public space) and Hudson Yards (a massive redevelopment project on Manhattan’s West Side) might well not have happened without the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. To stimulate development, Mr Bloomberg re-zoned 40% of the city, something which would have been harder if not impossible without the crisis and subsequent sense of solidarity. Encouragement to other industries, such as tech and biotech, further diversified and boosted the city’s economy.
Lower Manhattan is now less dominated by finance. Before 9/11 financial services and property accounted for 60% of private-sector employment. Its share was down to one-third before covid-19 scrambled the data. “A different type of worker is there, and certainly is not running off to the suburbs at 4.30pm,” says Jessica Lappin, head of the Downtown Alliance, which advocates for the district.
And not only business moved in. The residential population of Lower Manhattan more than doubled between 2001 and 2020, as did the number of residential units. Some new residents were enticed to the area with months of free rent, but the district quickly became fashionable. Many of the old office buildings have been converted to condominiums. Children, rarely glimpsed below Canal Street in 2001, now make up 17% of the population. New schools were built to accommodate the new families. Tourists came too. Before 2001, only six hotels served the district. At least until covid-19 arrived, 37 hotels operated in the area.
Perhaps none of this would have happened if the feeling of safety, which disappeared so swiftly on 9/11, had not returned. The NYPD, which added 1,000 officers to its counter-terrorism division and worked closely with the FBI and the CIA to develop new capabilities, must take some credit for this. When London and Madrid suffered terrorism attacks, NYPD officers were soon on the scene. The department now has intelligence officers in 18 other cities. Ray Kelly, who was Mr Bloomberg’s police commissioner for 12 years, reckons the NYPD thwarted 16 attacks on his watch. Crime also declined, though the causes of that improvement are disputed.
For the past 18 months, as covid-19 has spread through the city, politicians and pundits have all said versions of: “We got through 9/11. We’ll get through the pandemic.” It would be unwise to dismiss that as mere New York bluster, given how unexpected the city’s revival looked when Lower Manhattan was coated in ash. Yet there are more dismal precedents to consider too. New York took far longer—25 years—to recover from the white flight and manufacturing decline of the 1970s. Then, 1.3m people and dozens of Fortune 500 companies left the city. “The question is,” says Mr Doctoroff, “is it going to be like 9/11, or is it going to be like the 1970s?” ■",1
1597,"ANNA KUZMINYKH, a 27-year-old film director, is also a member of Pussy Riot, a punk-rock-and-performance-art group that has been protesting against Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian government for the better part of a decade. In July, along with four other members of the group, she was arrested (twice) for “disobeying police orders”.
After 30 days in jail, Ms Kuzminykh was released this month. Then the real trouble began. As she recounts, “My phone started ringing off the hook, 50 numbers at once were calling me.” The messages were littered with threats like “Slut, we will kill you and your whole family.”

Ms Kuzminykh’s ordeal is not by any means unusual. Russian women with non-traditional views are increasingly being harassed by reactionary groups, whose targets include feminists, gay activists, women who work in the porn industry and those who dare to have romantic partners who are not ethnic Russians.
One group that has been organising such bullying campaigns is Male State, which describes its ideology as “national patriarchy”. It was founded by Vladislav Pozdnyakov, a bodybuilder, in 2016. In 2018 he was convicted on a charge of inciting hatred of women; his group had harassed many of them individually. A year later Mr Pozdnyakov fled to Poland.
Exile, however, has not stopped him from revving up his angry male fans. Male State says it opposes Russia’s current leaders for being too pro-women. It has around 83,000 followers on its Telegram channel. Its members search for people—usually women—who express feminist or gay-friendly views on social media, or are part of the porn business, and then use online tools to track them down.
When they succeed, they get nasty. Many victims are sent photos of their homes or their relatives. The threat is not hard to discern. Ms Kuzminykh says the tipping point for her was when someone sent her a photo of her little sister over WhatsApp, a social-media service.
Many activists suspect that Male State has ties to the Russian authorities, especially the police. Members of Socfemalternativa, a leftist group, were harassed by Male State and became the subject of a report prepared by the Interior Ministry on feminists who attend protest rallies. The report included photos, addresses, social-media accounts and other private information. Much of this had appeared earlier in Telegram channels run by Male State. “It’s not just that they know my address or my apartment number—they even know the floor I am living on,” says Ms Kuzminykh.
Some victims have changed cities; at least a dozen have fled Russia. Among those who stay, many fear to go outside; some have become suicidal. Ms Kuzminykh is planning to leave Russia. She wonders if a western European country, or America, might recognise her as a political refugee. She doubts that Russian cops will protect her. On the contrary, she fears they may be helping her tormentors. ■",1
1598,"IT WAS AN inauguration like no other in Peru’s recent history. Pedro Castillo, the new left-wing president, took office on July 28th following the narrowest of electoral victories in a bitterly divided country. But he delayed naming his cabinet until the following days, leaving Peru temporarily without a government. His inaugural speech was generally moderate in tone, promising “responsible change” in the economy and more money for health care and education. But he insisted that he will seek to install a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution—the device used by left-wing populist strongmen such as Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia to concentrate power and hang on to it. For his inauguration he wore a collarless indigo jacket, seemingly copied from Mr Morales, as well as his trademark hat of cream-coloured palm fibre.
Mr Castillo’s inauguration took place on the 200th anniversary of Peru’s independence from Spanish colonial rule. In a populist gesture, he said he would not govern from the presidential palace, built on the site of the house of Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador of Peru. Instead, his office will be in Lima’s convention centre. A farmer, schoolteacher and union leader from Peru’s northern Andes, Mr Castillo is for some a symbol of those often ignored in the country’s political life.

In fact he is not the first mestizo (mixed-race) president, nor is he the first political outsider to secure the role. But of all Peru’s presidents, he was elected on the most left-wing platform, is the least experienced and has the weakest mandate, having won just 15% of the total vote in the election’s first round in April. He won a run-off election on June 6th by just 44,000 votes out of 17.5m, and only because many centrist Peruvians could not bring themselves to vote for his opponent, Keiko Fujimori, a conservative whose father Alberto ruled Peru as an autocrat in the 1990s.
It was not Mr Castillo’s fault that he was not declared the winner until July 19th. The delay was because Ms Fujimori cried fraud; her allegations were eventually dismissed by the electoral tribunal. But Mr Castillo has known for weeks that this was a near-certainty. He could have moved far more quickly to offer the country reassurance about his plans. He has said little in public since the election, and avoids media interviews. He appears mistrustful by nature. His closest aides are members of his large extended family and comrades from the teachers’ union.
The delay in naming a cabinet suggested Mr Castillo finds it hard to take decisions, and pointed to infighting between him and Vladimir Cerrón, the Marxist-Leninist political boss who runs Perú Libre, the hard-left party for which Mr Castillo stood. Everything suggests that Mr Castillo is drawing from a shallow talent pool.
He takes over in difficult circumstances. Peru has suffered greatly in the pandemic, with more officially recorded deaths as a share of population than any other country. Its feeble health system was overwhelmed. The economy shrank by 11% last year, while the official poverty rate rose from 20% to 30%. That fuelled rage against the political establishment, and was a factor in Mr Castillo’s victory.
Francisco Sagasti, the caretaker president since November, has laid the foundations for recovery, organising vaccinations. The economy may this year regain most of the lost ground. But the foundations remain fragile. “We have political polarisation instead of political leadership,” says Liliana Rojas-Suarez, an economist. The private sector is suspicious, especially of the idea of a constituent assembly.
The biggest question-mark is over the influence of Mr Cerrón, a Cuban-educated doctor. Only because he was prevented from running by a conviction for corruption when he was a regional governor did Perú Libre turn to Mr Castillo. More than half of Perú Libre’s 37 legislators in the 130-seat Congress answer to Mr Cerrón.
Mr Castillo has made some gestures of moderation. He has said he would retain the central-bank president, a respected professional. Pedro Francke, the probable new economy minister, is a moderate. Mr Cerrón has criticised him for sounding like “a Chicago boy—those who have failed for decades”. In fact Peru’s free-market economy delivered rapid growth, though political instability has eroded this since 2016. The poverty rate fell from over 50% in 2001 to 20% in 2019. The failures have been an unreformed state and public services.
To govern effectively Mr Castillo “needs to moderate in every way and Cerrón doesn’t let him”, says Gino Costa, an outgoing legislator for the centrist Morado party. Two polls this month found that only around 30% of Peruvians want a new constitution and radical changes in economic policy. Right-wing and centre parties have a majority in the new Congress. Mr Castillo said he would obey the existing constitution, which requires a majority in Congress and a referendum to amend it. It is not clear how he would reconcile this with his proposal for a constituent assembly.
Many on the right reject Mr Castillo’s presidency. Ms Fujimori said she would accept the election result but in the same breath that her supporters would work “to re-establish legitimacy”, a veiled threat to bring down the new government. The previous Congress had a taste for impeachment, trying it four times in three years. It forced the resignation of one president and impeached another. The opposition is not far from the 87 votes required.
Will Mr Castillo survive or self-destruct? His chief assets are plausible populist rhetoric and an image of honesty and authenticity in a country crying out for these qualities. “If he lasts a year he can probably last five” and complete his term, ventures a former minister. But that, and what those years would mean for Peru, will depend on the choices he makes in the coming weeks. ■",1

1600,"AS THE AUGUST 31st deadline to conclude the evacuation of Afghanistan loomed, the drumbeat of warnings grew louder. On August 24th President Joe Biden warned of an “acute and growing risk” of a terrorist attack, by the local branch of Islamic State (IS), against Kabul’s airport, thronged by thousands of Afghans desperate to escape the Taliban’s rule. On August 25th several governments told their nationals to keep away from the airport. On August 26th a British minister warned that intelligence pointed to “a very imminent, highly lethal attack”. Alas, it came later that afternoon.

At least 13 American troops and at least 60 Afghans were killed in two suicide-bombings, which the Pentagon described as a “heinous” and “complex” attack. General Kenneth McKenzie, head of America’s Central Command, which has responsibility for Afghanistan, said that the Pentagon was “still working to calculate the total loss”. One attack targeted the Abbey gate into Kabul airport, where many would-be refugees had gathered in a sewage canal (see map). The other struck the Baron hotel, 200 metres away, where British officials had been processing Afghan claims. Gunmen opened fire after both incidents.

The American casualties were the country’s first military deaths in combat in Afghanistan since February 2020 and the heaviest in that country since a Chinook helicopter was shot down a decade ago, killing all 38 people on board, of whom 30 were American military personnel. In a press conference held hours after the attacks, a visibly emotional Mr Biden described the victims as “heroes...engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others”.
General McKenzie blamed the Kabul attacks on Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), a branch of the IS group that established a short-lived caliphate in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2018. IS claimed responsibility for the attack in a report by Amaq, an IS-linked news agency, which pictured the alleged suicide-bomber. General McKenzie said that more attacks were expected.
The bombings came as the American-led evacuation effort was entering its final, frantic days. Several countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have wound up their flights; France is preparing to do so. Speaking after the attack, Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, struck a defiant tone, insisting that his country would press ahead with evacuations. “What this attack shows is the importance of continuing that work in as fast and as efficient a manner as possible in the hours that remain to us,” he said. “We will get our Afghan allies,” promised Mr Biden, “and our mission will go on. America will not be intimidated.”
Yet there were signs that Kabul’s airport was turning into an impenetrable fortress for the Afghans crowded outside. The MilitaryTimes, a website, reported that troops inside the airport were welding its gates shut. In the coming days, America may be forced to rely on CIA and military helicopter flights out of the airport to recover the remaining American citizens who wish to leave. On August 25th the State Department estimated that these people may number a few hundred.

America may also be hastening its departure. After further large explosions were heard around the airport on August 26th, a Taliban spokesman clarified that America was destroying equipment. Many thousands of vulnerable Afghans, who had once worked with coalition forces, were already bound to be left behind; even more may now miss out. “I know of no conflict, as a student of history,” said Mr Biden, “where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out.”
That ISKP would seek to mount such an attack was all too tragically predictable. “It has positioned itself from the outset as a Taliban rejectionist movement,” says Asfandyar Mir of Stanford University. Whereas the Taliban is rooted in the Hanafi sect of Islam, ISKP—like al-Qaeda—draws its inspiration from the Salafi tradition, which is strong in Afghanistan’s eastern provinces. “Its go-to strategy has been outbidding violence,” says Mr Mir. “The fundamental premise of the group is that there are all these other organisations which don't punish non-believers...and they need to be punished”.
That has led it to unleash unmatched savagery, much like its parent organisation did in Syria and Iraq. In May 2020, for instance, the group is thought to have attacked the maternity ward of Kabul's Dasht-e-Barchi hospital, killing 24 people, including two children. In May this year it allegedly targeted the Sayed Al-Shuhada school in a part of the capital populated by the Shia Hazara minority, killing some 90 people, most of whom were schoolgirls. A month later it killed ten humanitarian workers removing mines in Baghlan province, to the north of Kabul. Though the group lost almost 12,000 operatives between 2015 and 2018 in the face of intense counter-terrorism pressure from America and the former Afghan government, recent UN reports suggest that it still has somewhere between 500 and 1,500 fighters in the country.
America is now in the curious position of making common cause with insurgents whom it fought for 20 years, against a shared enemy. General McKenzie said that there was no evidence that the Taliban had “let this happen”. He said that America had supplied the group with intelligence—Bill Burns, the CIA chief, met a senior Taliban leader in Kabul on August 23rd—and that the Taliban had thwarted earlier attacks on American troops. “They want to reclaim the airfield,” he added. “So we share a common purpose...they've been useful to work with.”
Mr Biden argued that the attack vindicated his determination, opposed by allies, including Mr Johnson, to hold firm to the August 31st deadline, which was shortened from an earlier target of September 11th. This, he said, is “why I’ve been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.” Mr Biden has long been leery of committing American troops overseas, and his White House reckons that because leaving Afghanistan is popular (though less popular than it was before troops actually started leaving), he will not pay a political cost. Mr Biden threatened ISKP with retribution, saying that he had asked commanders for a list of potential targets: “We will not forgive, we will not forget, we will hunt you down and make you pay”.
Yet his critics will see the attack as a repeat of past American fiascos, from the hostage crisis in Iran in 1979 to the assault on America’s consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Ben Sasse, a Republican on the Senate's intelligence committee, described the bombings as the “nightmare we feared” and demanded that Mr Biden ""rip up the August 31st deadline and defend evacuation routes”. Kevin McCarthy, the top-ranking Republican in the House, demanded that Congress “prohibit the withdrawal of our troops until every American is safely out”—a condition that the Taliban has already rejected. Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services committee, said that “President Biden alone made a strategic decision, and that decision led to the tragic events today.”
For Afghans, reeling from the Taliban’s lightning victory 11 days ago, the attacks heaped tragedy upon tragedy. The Islamists’ inability to secure the city against another massacre suggests that they may have no stronger a grip on things than the government they toppled. “Kabul is hidden in the noise of ambulances,” wrote Ziar Khan Yaad, a journalist at TOLONews, a news channel. “Jets are flying in the sky and there is blood on the ground. The families of the victims shed tears in front of the emergency hospital.”",1
1601,"FRESH FROM victories in Tokyo, Russian Olympic medalists were preparing for a reception with Vladimir Putin earlier this month when they were told they would spend a week in quarantine before meeting the president. “I still can’t believe I’ll have to sit in one room for seven days,” Angelina Melnikova, a gymnast, wrote on social media. But the requirement wasn’t new: senior officials, journalists and even veterans of the second world war have had to self-isolate before coming within breathing distance of the man who has stood at Russia’s helm for over two decades, and who next week turns 69.
When Russia first recorded a surge in coronavirus cases in March last year, Mr Putin donned a yellow hazmat suit to visit Moscow’s main covid-19 hospital. State TV cameras captured him taking selfies with staff and shaking hands with the hospital’s chief physician, Denis Protsenko. “No head of state has so far dared to come so close to the infected,” gushed the Kremlin’s chief propagandist, Dmitry Kiselyov, on his Sunday night news show. All par for the course for a strongman who has built his reputation on action-man stunts.

But in the months since then, perhaps no world leader has been as shielded from the virus. Days after Mr Putin’s hospital visit, Mr Protsenko announced that he himself was sick with covid-19, and Mr Putin holed up in his residence outside Moscow, haranguing officials by video-link as his approval ratings sank. Special tunnels were installed at the residence to douse visitors in disinfectant. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s main opposition figure, who is now in jail, coined a new nickname for his political foe: “grandpa in a bunker”.
In March, the BBC reported that the Kremlin had spent $85m on quarantine accommodation for staff and visitors coming into contact with Mr Putin and other measures to ensure his well-being. That figure is all the more startling when you consider that Russia has had a working vaccine since last August, when the president approved the Sputnik V jab. On September 14th Mr Putin announced he was going into self-isolation after covid cases were detected in his inner circle, less than three months after he revealed he had been vaccinated. He emerged two weeks later, to be seen meeting Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan on September 29th. But Muscovites are not expecting to see him around the place.",1
1602,"NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Indian retailers demanded a government probe of the company after a Reuters investigation showed the e-commerce giant had copied products and rigged search results in India.
The Reuters report, reviewing thousands of internal Amazon documents, found that the U.S. company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in India, one of the company’s largest growth markets.
Wednesday's report showed that, at least in India, manipulating search results to favour Amazon’s products, as well as copying other sellers’ goods, were part of a formal strategy at Amazon – and that at least two senior executives had reviewed it.
The Reuters investigation drew bipartisan criticism of Amazon from U.S. lawmakers.
Linking to the story on Twitter and Facebook, Warren, a long-time critic of Amazon, said ""these documents show what we feared about Amazon’s monopoly power — that the company is willing and able to rig its platform to benefit its bottom line while stiffing small businesses and entrepreneurs.""
""This is one of the many reasons we need to break it up,"" she said.
Warren, a prominent Democrat, advocated the breakup of Amazon and other tech giants in 2019 when she was running for president. Since then, as a senator from Massachusetts, she has continued to apply pressure on companies like Amazon.
Ken Buck, a Republican on the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee, also shared the story on social media, saying, ""These documents prove Amazon engages in anticompetitive practices such as rigging search results and self-preferencing their own products over competitors.""
""More concerning, it contradicts what Jeff Bezos told Congress,"" the Colorado lawmaker said. ""Amazon and Bezos must be held accountable.""
Asked for comment on the reactions, Amazon issued a statement similar to one it provided for the Reuters investigation.
""These allegations are incorrect and unsubstantiated,"" it said. ""We display search results based on relevance to the customers, irrespective of whether such products are private brands offered by sellers or not.""
Amazon said it ""strictly prohibits the use or sharing of non-public, seller-specific data with sellers, including with sellers of private brands,"" and investigates reports of its employees acting contrary to that policy.
The company did not comment on the criticisms by U.S. lawmakers or Indian retailers.
INDIA RETAILERS, START-UPS CONCERNED
In sworn testimony before the subcommittee last year, Amazon founder Bezos said the company prohibits its employees from using data on individual sellers to help its private-label business. In 2019 another Amazon executive testified that the company does not use such data to create its own private-label products or alter its search results to favour them.
The Amazon documents reviewed by Reuters showed how the company's private-brands team in India secretly exploited internal data from its India unit to copy products sold by other companies, then offered them on its platform.
The company promoted sales of its private brands like AmazonBasics by rigging search results on its platform in India so that its products would appear, as one 2016 strategy report put it, “in the first 2 or three … search results.”
A group representing millions of India's brick-and-mortar retailers said on Thursday the country's government must launch an investigation into Amazon.
""Amazon is causing a great disadvantage to the small manufacturers. They are eating the cake that is not meant for them,"" Praveen Khandelwal of the Confederation of All India Traders told Reuters. The group says it represents 80 million retail stores in the country.
Indian retailers say foreign e-commerce businesses like Amazon and Walmart Inc's (WMT.N) Flipkart indulge in unfair business practices that hurt smaller firms, allegations the companies deny.
The Alliance of Digital India Foundation, a nonprofit representing some of India’s biggest startups, said the practices detailed in the Reuters report were ""highly deplorable"", calling into question ""the credibility of Amazon as a good faith operator in the Indian startup ecosystem"".
In a blog post, the group urged the Indian government to take action against “Amazon’s predatory playbook of copying, rigging and killing Indian brands”.
A top official in the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, urged consumers to shun the company on Thursday.
""I call upon people of this country to #boycottAmazon,” Ashwani Mahajan, co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, said on Twitter.",0
1603,"AMERICAN OFFICE workers of an envious disposition must avoid emailing colleagues in Europe this month. The inevitable “try me again in September” automatic rejoinder is unlikely to improve the mood of those spending most of their summer toiling. Perhaps one consolation is the knowledge that holidays are not what they used to be. Rare is the employee who leaves all their work behind these days. Plenty of people will at least furtively scroll through emails while on the beach. Everyone has occasionally shirked work. Now many workers are shirking holidays, too.
In the olden days, office life used to be binary. Establishing whether Bob from accounting was on annual leave was as simple as checking whether he was at his desk. Then BlackBerrys—the executive status symbol of the early 2000s—were granted to those who implicitly agreed to use them outside office hours.

Now everyone has smartphones tethering them to their inbox, and the pandemic means Bob has probably not visited the corporate headquarters for several months or more. Whether he is on holiday or not might be immediately clear only to him, his line manager and the buggy HR computer system logging his days off.
Bosses are mostly mindful not to demand that their underlings do anything while on statutory leave. In Europe policymakers talk of a “right to disconnect”, which allows employees to leave their day jobs behind during holidays (as well as evenings and weekends). But the right is not an obligation. And some individuals might find a small dollop of work a respite from their time off. Even the most petulant colleagues can be more relaxing to deal with than one’s own children.
A few workers find ways to delete the work email app from their phones. And there are arguments for being a holiday hardliner. Time away from work serves to clear the mind. Plenty of jobs now require a measure of inspiration. A stretch away from the office helps, all the more so if it is an actual break, complete with a change of scenery away from home. French workers, many of whom live up to the stereotype of taking much of August off, are expected to fizz with ideas come September.

Severing all links to your quotidian tasks can be salutary for employers too. Refreshed workers are less likely to burn out. Fraudsters inside companies are known to be reluctant to take vacation days, lest colleagues covering for them unveil the mischief. After Jérôme Kerviel, a holiday-dodging French trader, blew a €5bn ($7.4bn) hole in the balance-sheet of Société Générale, a big lender, in 2008, regulators insisted that some bankers be forced to be away for two consecutive weeks so as to make future fraud harder. Even if no one is cooking the books, enforcing a more complete cut-off lets tasks be passed to someone else in the organisation. That builds resilience.
What is the right balance? Nobody suggests toiling on leave at the same pace as in the (home) office. But most people will conclude that if a few minutes spent answering emails can save a stranded colleague hours of work, it would seem churlish not to step in. If nothing else, keeping even a distant eye on things can make a return to the job—whether after a week off or even a month—less daunting. Who wants to deal with thousands of unread emails on their return?
And plenty of professionals quite like what they do for a living, even when they aren’t meant to be doing it. Staying loosely connected might encourage people to take their full entitlement of holidays: in America, more than half of workers reported not taking their share even before the pandemic roiled their working lives.
An intriguing possibility is that the rise of remote work will spawn a new type of holiday. Among his European contacts Bartleby has glimpsed some exotic Zoom backgrounds of late. Some people are “working from home” in what look to be pretty swish holiday destinations. One executive admitted that, having decamped to a Greek island for a couple of weeks in the past, he is now spending most of the summer there. He is toiling a touch less than full whack during the weeks he is meant to be working—but putting in a few hours a day during what is meant to be time off.
Thus the binary nature of holidays—either you are working or you aren’t—may yet become another casualty of covid-19. Plenty of thought has been given to how the pandemic has changed how people work. It may end up altering how they don’t work, too.

1604,"THOUGH AMERICAN and Chinese tech platforms started the e-commerce gold rush, one Canadian company realised early on what money was to be made from selling shovels. That was Shopify, which supplies tools such as software, logistics and payments to allow firms to set up their own online stores rather than selling via giant platforms like Amazon. Its value, at $175bn, is only about a tenth that of Amazon. But in the past five years its share-price rise has outstripped that of “The Everything Store” more than tenfold.  
Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, is an evangelist for small retailers. Shopify’s more-than-1m merchants range from $1bn-plus brands like Allbirds to tiny startups that make their first sale on its platform every 52 seconds. Yet he believes that consumers will be the big winners from the transformation of retail, giving them more influence over how and what they buy. Not since John Wanamaker set up one of America’s earliest department stores in 1876, he says, has there been such a shift in favour of the customer.

Shopify may be the biggest e-commerce firm that most people have never heard of. Mr Finkelstein says it is “arming the rebels” by enabling independent retailers to survive and thrive via multiple sales channels, from Amazon to social media to bricks-and-mortar stores. Yet it is not the only fifth columnist. Across the world, regional platforms are competing fiercely to avoid American and Chinese dominance.
In Japan Amazon and Rakuten, a local e-commerce veteran, are in a battle for market leadership, but Softbank also plans to merge Yahoo Japan, an online shopping site in which it has a big stake, with Line, a messaging app, to make it a three-horse race. Amazon also has designs on South Korea via a partnership with 11street, owned by a local telecoms giant. But the market, led by Coupang, an online platform, is highly competitive. The South Korean affiliate of eBay, a big American platform, may be up for sale soon, making the contest fiercer still.
The Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have e-commerce stakes in South-East Asia via holdings in Lazada and Tokopedia, and Sea, respectively. In India, though the bulk of retailing still takes place in corner shops called kirana, e-commerce is a battle between Amazon, Flipkart (owned by Walmart) and JioMart, owned by Reliance, a conglomerate, with backing from Facebook, the American social-media giant. The Western firms are not just vying for a share of India’s vast retail market. They also want to learn how best to entice new smartphone users in emerging markets to shop online. That means more voice search, because of the plethora of local languages, as well as more video, says Leigh Hopkins, Walmart’s head of international strategy.
In Europe Amazon dominates, but marketplaces selling other people’s goods such as Berlin-based Zalando and Manchester-based Boohoo are mounting challenges. In Latin America Alibaba is the model, not Amazon. Buenos Aires-based Mercado Libre, the market leader in the region, does not sell its own products, unlike Amazon. Like Alibaba, it has a strong digital-payments arm. Yet Amazon is strong in Mexico, where it goes head to head with Mercado Libre, and competition between the two is growing in Brazil. Amazon is named after the country’s longest river. So far its business in Brazil does not live up to the name. But that is a rare exception.",1
1605,"WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - The United States will not lift any existing travel restrictions ""at this point"" due to concerns over the highly transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant and the rising number of U.S. coronavirus cases, the White House confirmed on Monday.
The decision, which was first reported by Reuters, comes after a senior level White House meeting late on Friday. It means that the long-running travel restrictions that have barred much of the world's population from the United States since 2020 will not be lifted in the short term.
""Given where we are today ... with the Delta variant, we will maintain existing travel restrictions at this point,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday, citing the spread of the Delta variant in the United States and abroad. ""Driven by the Delta variant, cases are rising here at home, particularly among those who are unvaccinated and appear likely continue to increase in the weeks ahead.""
The announcement almost certainly dooms any bid by U.S. airlines and the U.S. tourism industry to salvage summer travel by Europeans and others covered by the restrictions. Airlines have heavily lobbied the White House for months to lift the restrictions and some say the industry may now have to wait until September or later for a possible revision.
The United States currently bars most non-U.S. citizens who within the last 14 days have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without internal border controls, or in Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.
The extraordinary U.S. travel restrictions were first imposed on China in January 2020 to address the spread of COVID-19. Other countries have since been added, most recently India in early May.
Last week, the U.S. Homeland Security Department said U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico will remain closed to nonessential travel until at least Aug. 21 - even as Canada said it would begin allowing in fully vaccinated American tourists starting Aug. 9. 
Asked on July 15 at a joint appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about when the United States would lift European travel restrictions, U.S. President Joe Biden said he would ""be able to answer that question to you within the next several days - what is likely to happen."" 
Merkel said any decision to lift restrictions ""has to be a sustainable decision. It is certainly not sensible to have to take it back after only a few days.""
Since that news conference, U.S. cases have jumped.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walensky said on Thursday the seven-day average of new cases in the United States was up 53% over the previous week. The Delta variant, which was first found in India, now comprises more than 80% of new cases nationwide and has been detected in more than 90 countries.
Psaki also cited the fact that last week, the CDC urged Americans to avoid travel to the United Kingdom, given a jump in cases.
The restrictions have brought heavy criticism from people prevented from seeing loved ones and the White House has acknowledged a desire to reunite separated families.
The Biden administration has refused to offer any metrics that would trigger when it will unwind restrictions and has not disclosed if it will remove restrictions on individual countries or focus on enhancing individual traveler scrutiny.
Reuters reported last week the White House was discussing the potential of mandating COVID-19 vaccines for international visitors, but no decisions have been made, sources briefed on the matter said.  read more  That idea remains under active discussion, they said.
The Biden administration has also been talking to U.S. airlines in recent weeks about establishing international contact tracing for passengers before lifting travel restrictions.",0
1606,"OF ALL CHINA’S achievements in the past two decades, one of the most impressive is the rise of its technology industry. Alibaba hosts twice as much e-commerce activity as Amazon does. Tencent runs the world’s most popular super-app, with 1.2bn users. China’s tech revolution has also helped transform its long-run economic prospects at home, by allowing it to leap beyond manufacturing into new fields such as digital health care and artificial intelligence (AI). As well as propelling China’s prosperity, a dazzling tech industry could also be the foundation for a challenge to American supremacy.
That is why President Xi Jinping’s assault on his country’s $4trn tech industry is so startling. There have been over 50 regulatory actions against scores of firms for a dizzying array of alleged offences, from antitrust abuses to data violations. The threat of government bans and fines has weighed on share prices, costing investors around $1trn.

Mr Xi’s immediate goal may be to humble tycoons and give regulators more sway over unruly digital markets. But as we explain, the Communist Party’s deeper ambition is to redesign the industry according to its blueprint. China’s autocrats hope this will sharpen their country’s technological edge while boosting competition and benefiting consumers.
Geopolitics may be spurring them on, too. Restrictions on access to components made with American technology have persuaded China that it needs to be more self-reliant in critical areas like semiconductors. Such “hard tech” may benefit if the crackdown on social media, gaming firms and the like steers talented engineers and programmers its way. However the assault is also a giant gamble that may end up doing long-term damage to enterprise and economic growth.
Twenty years ago China hardly seemed on the threshold of a technological miracle. Silicon Valley dismissed pioneers such as Alibaba as copycats, until they leapt ahead of it in e-commerce and digital payments. Today 73 Chinese digital firms are worth over $10bn. Most have Western investors and foreign-educated executives. A dynamic venture-capital ecosystem keeps churning out new stars. Of China’s 160 “unicorns” (startups worth over $1bn), half are in fields such as AI, big data and robotics.

In contrast to Vladimir Putin’s war on Russia’s oligarchs in the 2000s, China’s crackdown is not about insiders fighting over the spoils. Indeed, it echoes concerns that motivate regulators and politicians in the West: that digital markets tend towards monopolies and that tech firms hoard data, abuse suppliers, exploit workers and undermine public morality.
Stronger policing was overdue. When China opened up, the party kept a stifling grip on finance, telecoms and energy but allowed tech to let rip. Its digital pioneers used this near absence of regulation to grow astonishingly fast. Didi, which provides transport, has more users than America has people.
However, the big digital platforms also exploited their freedom to trample smaller firms. They stop merchants from selling on more than one platform. They deny food-delivery drivers and other gig workers basic benefits. The party wants to put an end to such misconduct. It is an ambition that many investors support.
The question is how? China is about to become a policy laboratory in which an unaccountable state wrestles with the world’s biggest firms for control of the 21st century’s essential infrastructure. Some data, which the government says is a “factor of production”, like land or labour, may pass into public ownership. The state may enforce interoperability between platforms (so that, say, WeChat cannot continue to block rivals). Addictive algorithms may be more rigorously policed. All this would hurt profits, but might make markets work better.

But make no mistake, the crackdown on China’s unruly tech is also a demonstration of the party’s untrammelled power. In the past its priorities often fell victim to vested interests, including corrupt insiders, and it was constrained by its need to court foreign capital and create employment. Now the party feels emboldened, issuing new rules at a furious pace and enforcing them with fresh zeal. China’s regulatory immaturity is on full display. Just 50 or so people staff its main anti-monopoly agency but they can destroy business models at the stroke of a pen. Denied due process, companies must grin and bear it.
China’s leaders have spent decades successfully defying Western lectures on liberal economics. They may see their clampdown on the technology industry as a refinement of their policy of state capitalism—a blueprint for combining prosperity and control in order to keep China stable and the party in power. Indeed, as China’s population starts to decline, the party wants to raise productivity through state direction, including by automating factories and forming urban mega-clusters.
Yet the attempt to reshape Chinese tech could easily go wrong. It is likely to raise suspicion abroad, hampering the country’s ambitions to sell services and set global tech standards worldwide in the 21st century, as America did in the 20th. Any drag on growth would be felt far beyond China’s borders.
A bigger risk is that the crackdown will dull the entrepreneurial spirit within China. As the economy shifts from making things towards services, spontaneous risk-taking, backed by sophisticated capital markets, will become more important. Several of China’s leading tech tycoons have pulled back from their companies and public life. Wannabes will think twice before trying to emulate them, not least because the crackdown has jacked up the cost of capital.
Startup slowdown
China’s biggest tech firms now trade at an average discount of 26% per dollar of sales relative to American firms. Startups, such as the minnows taking ride-hailing business from Didi with mapping apps, have been nibbling at the government’s main targets. Far from being emboldened by the crackdown, they are likely to feel exposed. Economic development is largely about creative destruction. China’s autocratic leaders have shown that they can manage the destruction. Whether this tech tumult will also foster creativity remains much in doubt. ■",1
1607,"Colombia's President Ivan Duque apologised on Friday after police cadets dressed up as Nazis for a 'cultural exchange' event in honour of Germany.
Photos of the ceremony were shared Thursday on an official police Twitter account.
In it, students are seen dressed in the grey-green uniform of the Wehrmacht, one of them sporting a small, Adolf Hitler-style moustache.
Others are dressed in the black uniform of the SS, complete with the red swastika armband.
The black, red and yellow German flag and balloons in the same colours decorated the venue that also featured a replica Luftwaffe plane, copies of Nazi firearms, and swastikas on the table cloths.
Two police officers in Colombian uniforms inaugurated the event by cutting a ribbon, the pictures showed.
'From the SimonBolivar police academy in the city of Tulua, we are organising an #InternationalWeek with guest country #Germany. 
'With these cultural exchanges, we are strengthening the knowledge of our police students,' proclaimed the police Twitter account.
The photos were met with a mixture of anger and incredulity on social media, provoking deep embarrassment for the authorities.
'Any apology for Nazism is unacceptable and I condemn any demonstration that uses or refers to symbols referring to those responsible for the Jewish Holocaust that claimed the lives of more than 6 million people,' Duque said on Twitter on Friday.
The police dismissed the head of the academy.
The Defense Ministry, under whose umbrella the Colombian police falls, said in a statement that its training guidelines 'do not envisage in any way an activity such as the one which took place yesterday.'
The German and Israeli embassies in Bogota issued a joint statement expressing 'total rejection of any form of apology or demonstration of Nazism.'
Under fire internationally for its brutal suppression of anti-government protests earlier this year, the Colombian police has embarked on a 'transformation' campaign to improve its image, which will include a uniform change.",3
1608,"“IT LIES PROTECTED behind its rampart mountains, insulated from the stormy physical and intellectual weather of both coasts,” Wallace Stegner wrote of Salt Lake City. The novelist associated his adopted hometown, where he spent much of the 1920s and 30s, with an “isolationism” and “provincialism” afforded by its Mormon heritage and its snug seat between the Wasatch Range and the Great Salt Lake. These features remain; but gaze upon the city’s bustling downtown today from a perch in the nearby foothills and Salt Lake looks far from provincial. There are few places in America that can crow louder about their successes in the past decade than the City of the Saints.
Utah’s population grew faster than that of any other state between 2010 and 2020. Salt Lake City has the lowest jobless rate among all big cities, at 2.8%, compared with a national rate of 5.2%. That the state has rebounded so well from the downturn caused by the covid-19 pandemic is thanks to the Wasatch Front, an urban corridor that includes Salt Lake and Provo, home to Brigham Young University. The four counties that make up the Wasatch Front account for at least 80% of Utah’s economic activity, reckons Juliette Tennert, an economist at the University of Utah.

In many ways Salt Lake’s success mirrors what is happening in other cities in the Mountain West, such as Boise, Idaho, and Denver, Colorado. What makes Utah so exceptional? For starters it has the most diverse economy of any state, according to the Hachman Index, which measures each state’s mix of industries against that of the nation. In fact, Utah has ranked in the top two for the majority of the past two decades, says Ms Tennert. The Wasatch Front boasts a blossoming tech sector—christened “Silicon Slopes”—several research universities and an international airport.
Utah’s ability to attract new businesses is helped by its Republican zeal for low corporate taxes and little regulation. But putting Salt Lake City on the map also required some myth-busting. Gary Herbert, the former governor, points to 2002 when Salt Lake hosted the Winter Olympics, as a pivotal moment. “That was kind of our coming­ out party,” he says. People realised that, “we are not the Wild West here in Utah.”
Researchers also note Utah’s relative homogeneity as a reason for its success. It may be easier for people to get along when they share a religious and cultural background. But the state is changing fast. Although about 61% of Utah’s population is Mormon, that number is shrinking all the time. About 48% of Salt Lake County residents identify as Mormon; the city itself—which is more diverse—probably has fewer still. Utah is the youngest state in the country, but its fertility rate is decreasing faster than the national average, says Emily Harris, a demographer. Attracting and retaining new Utahns will become ever-more important as births decline.
Three things threaten Salt Lake City’s ability to entice and keep new residents. The first is environmental problems. Americans may move to Salt Lake for its proximity to hiking trails and posh ski resorts, but the Wasatch Front is plagued by pollution. Wildfire smoke, heavy traffic and dust from the drying lake bed dirty the air. Utah is also reckoning with shrinking reservoirs due to the megadrought that has dehydrated most of the West.
Second, Salt Lake City is becoming unaffordable for many long-time residents. House prices have surged by nearly 25% since August of 2020, according to Zillow, an online-listings platform. (Across the country home values increased by nearly 18% on average.) Erin Mendenhall, the Democratic mayor of Salt Lake, offers high housing costs as proof that rapid growth doesn’t benefit everyone.
Third, Utah consistently ranks among the worst states in the country for gender equality. An annual index from WalletHub, a consumer website, found that Utah’s gender-pay gap was larger than most other states’. Women in Utah are also less likely to graduate from college or be elected to political office. That Utah is such a laggard is probably down to the lasting influence of the Mormon church and believers’ tendency to marry young and have large families. Yet the future looks brighter: as the state diversifies, and begins to look more like America, women should benefit.
Utahns are not at all surprised that their state is booming. “Salt Lakers generally love to fly under the radar,” says Ms Mendenhall. “Part of the personality of our city is knowing that we’re the best kept secret.” That may historically be true, but the ever-expanding Wasatch Front suggests that the secret is out. ■",1
1609,"TOM MAPLES spent five days and almost $7,000 getting home to London from Tanzania in May. Many African countries are on the English “red list”, meaning anyone who has visited one in the previous ten days must quarantine in an expensive airport hotel before entering England. Eager to avoid that bill, Mr Maples bought a ticket via New York, where he could crash with friends for a few weeks.
Officials squabbling over paperwork barred him from his first flight. He booked a second but was stopped on his layover in Germany. America’s borders were open to non-Americans travelling from Tanzania, he was told, but not to those coming from Europe. After hours of pleading and searching for alternatives, he resigned himself to flying straight home. But he had another setback: officials demanded he pay the $2,400 quarantine bill before being allowed on board. By then he had maxed out his credit card and had to ask a relative to lend him money. The experience left him “emotionally devastated”, he says.

Governments have succeeded in taking the joy out of travel this summer (see chart 1). Britain has introduced rules of tooth-grinding complexity. In theory its traffic-light system rates countries by covid-19 risk and sets travel rules accordingly. In practice it is arbitrary, unpredictable and constantly changing. Facing pressure from the travel industry and voters keen to venture beyond Britain’s sodden beaches, Boris Johnson, the country’s prime minister, has advocated a “balanced policy”. He did not explain what that meant.

Policies in America are equally baffling. The Biden administration has failed to adapt restrictions in line with vaccination and infection rates overseas. All around the world, a jumble of rules causes confusion, chokes tourism and leaves businesses struggling to work out who can do what and go where.
All of this means travel will remain out of reach for many and messy for all for some time. The chaos is unlikely to subside soon, as new outbreaks emerge and governments struggle to co-ordinate policy. Travellers must scour myriad ministry and airport websites to piece together the rules. Even as the EU begins to reopen, the average member state has 330 restrictions on international travel, according to UBS, a Swiss bank, up from five in March 2020. Timatic, a database of visa and entry regulations compiled by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade body, was updated 200 times in one day last year.
The confusion is made worse by governments taking very different approaches to travel. East Asia and Australasia are largely locked down. The poorest regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, are largely open. America and Europe are somewhere in between.
The most hermetically sealed countries, which are typically either islands or dictatorships, have kept cases under control by shutting borders and aggressively stamping on outbreaks at home. Australia’s government recently halved its cap on overseas arrivals to 3,000 people a week, even though 38,000 Australian citizens wish to return home. Tough rules can work. In the first week of August, in the midst of its latest surge, the country had just 1,800 new cases. Britain had 100 times that figure. According to a survey by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 80% of Australians agree the border should remain closed until the pandemic is “under control globally”.
With only 18% of people fully vaccinated, Australia relies on the bluntest of policy instruments: locking people up to quarantine in government-approved facilities. Pete McGregor, who flew in from London to visit his ailing father in February, felt lucky to be placed in former labourers’ digs outside Darwin rather than an airless hotel. Residents held virtual quiz nights and celebrated a fellow inmate’s birthday. Mr McGregor still describes the trip as “hell”. For such countries, the only way to reopen safely is to vaccinate most people first and then experiment, as Singapore is considering. New Zealand had to scrap that plan this week when a labour shortage prompted the government to say it would reopen borders a bit despite a low vaccination rate.
A second group of governments is asking people to live with the virus. By June only 13% of countries in Europe remained closed to international travellers, compared with 70% in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the UN’s World Tourism Organisation. Widespread vaccination makes opening easier. Pent-up demand for travel makes it popular. Back in February searches for international flights by people in France were just 30% of what they had been two years earlier; now they are at 76% of pre-pandemic levels, according to Kayak (see chart 2), an online travel agency. Meanwhile in China flight browsing remains stuck at around a fifth of pre-pandemic levels.

Rich countries that are trying to open up are devising systems to reduce the risks. Last month the EU launched a Digital Covid Certificate, which people can use to prove they have been vaccinated, tested or recently recovered from covid-19. But policies are often inconsistent. America remains closed to visitors from Austria and Germany but not Colombia or Thailand, where vaccination rates are lower and covid-19 infections more widespread. And airline crews struggle with the different forms and passes, often giving a cursory glance and waving people through rather than scanning QR codes. Lufthansa, a German carrier, says staff will be able to scan documents only if test and vaccine certification is standardised globally.
Careful planning and reams of paperwork are distant concerns for globetrotters from a third group of countries: the poorest. Most such places are struggling to get jabs in arms, yet cannot afford to shut their borders. They remain cut off. Because rich countries impose some of the toughest quarantine and testing requirements on poor countries, travel has become unaffordable for an emerging middle class that was just getting a taste for it. Even those who have been jabbed often received vaccines made in India or China, which may not be recognised by rich-world authorities. “It seems like they have found another way to discriminate against us here in Africa,” says Itunu Kuku, a Nigerian living in Senegal.
Overseas trips will continue to be a hassle well beyond the northern summer. If air travel returns to 75% of pre-pandemic levels and airline staff have to continue to cross-check a spaghetti-spill of apps and forms, passengers will spend an average 5.5 hours waiting to be processed at airports, estimates Nick Careen of IATA, up from 1.5 hours before the pandemic.
Get your motor runnin’
International travel could come to feel exclusive, much as it used to in the middle of the 20th century. Those worried about tough checks at airports or catching the virus on a packed flight are already choosing to travel by road or rail. Some will fly again as rules are streamlined and fear of germs fades. But expensive tests and rising airfares mean two-day bachelor parties in Budapest could become less common (to the relief of some) whereas once-in-a-lifetime safaris in Zambia will still appeal to those who can afford one. George Kipouros, editor of Wanderlust, a travel magazine, says it would be a good thing if people began to see travel as something special again, and so appreciated it more.
But for most would-be travellers, a less open world means less freedom. The loss is made more galling by rules that often make no sense. A year and a half into the pandemic, policymakers finally acknowledge what epidemiologists have long known: there is no straight line between curbing travel and curbing infections. Because the virus spreads exponentially, ten imported cases and a hundred lead to a similar-sized outbreak after just a few weeks, notes Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist. “Anything but very strict travel restrictions will just delay things,” he adds.
Border rules cannot prevent outbreaks unless they are paired with strict domestic rules. People moving within a country spread the virus, too. The highly contagious Delta variant is now spurring fresh outbreaks even in countries that closed their borders. Australia has had to extend local lockdowns and deploy the army to enforce stay-at-home orders. China has launched mass-testing drives and introduced new curbs on domestic travel.
Many of the safety measures that accompany partial reopening are flawed. Asking someone to isolate at home cuts their contact with the outside world by 75%, compared with 90% for hotel quarantines, reports the Lancet. Another study suggests that a costly polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test before a flight is worse than a cheaper alternative. It is more accurate than an antigen test, but slower. So travellers have more time to get infected between clinic and boarding gate. A negative antigen test taken on the day of a trip, as many EU states accept, reduces the number of infected people who make it over a border to 24% of levels without any testing compared with 33% for a PCR test taken two days before a flight.
Temperature scanners are also unreliable. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, Canada spent millions on them, yet failed to detect a single case. Initial research suggested about half of travellers infected with covid-19 would be caught; recent analysis found the young in particular slip through, as most never develop a fever.
Head out on the highway
At this stage of the pandemic governments’ wishes for a balanced approach to travel are understandable. But evidence of the benefits of many restrictions is murky, whereas the costs are clear. In America only 6% of the workforce were in the travel business in 2020, but they suffered a third of total job losses. Globally, nearly one in five jobs supported by tourism was lost in 2020. Poor countries, especially, rely on it for work. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that the size of the international travel and tourism industry halved from 10.4% of global GDP in 2019 to 5.5% in 2020, a $4.5trn loss.
Only when the world is adequately vaccinated will travel start to feel as it did before the pandemic. That may not be until 2024, by some estimates. Even then, daft rules could stick. America’s ban on travellers with HIV was introduced in the 1980s and abolished only in 2010. Likewise, airlines could be asking for covid-19 papers for years to come. Britain’s transport minister, Grant Shapps, says Britons who venture abroad will need to be fully vaccinated against covid-19 “for evermore”.
Vaccine certification may well make sense in the long run. But bans on visitors from certain countries or caps on international arrivals do not. The risk is that these rules and regulations may outlive their purpose not because governments cannot undo them, but because no politician wants to be the first to try. ■

1610,"THE WEATHER in Brighton was decidedly blustery as the Labour Party gathered for its annual conference between September 25th and 29th. The handful of hardy souls who braved the sea were repeatedly flattened by the waves. But the wind turbines off the coast also whirled furiously, providing an energy-starved country with much-needed power. The mood inside the conference centre matched the squalls outside.
Sir Keir Starmer’s carefully charted attempt to introduce himself to the party he leads (and to Britain; last year’s affair consisted of little more than a speech to camera) was repeatedly blown off course. The big news on the first day was Angela Rayner, the deputy leader, calling Tories “scum”. On the second, it was a fight over the rules for electing the party leader. Then came the resignation of the shadow employment minister, Andy McDonald, over Sir Keir’s refusal to back an hourly minimum wage of £15 ($20), a policy supported by delegates, but with no chance of becoming law.

The squalls were powered by a combination of an ideological battle over the party’s direction and a more subtle one over succession. Labour’s hard left made a great deal of noise in fringe meetings and on the pavement outside. After his departure Mr McDonald, the last remaining fellow traveller with Jeremy Corbyn, Sir Keir’s hard-left predecessor, in cabinet, was welcomed by some as a hero. Ms Rayner and Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, competed to become heir-apparent, Ms Rayner by giving her best impression of La Pasionara and Mr Burnham by presenting himself as a problem-solver (and football-lover).
All the squabbling inspired criticism of Sir Keir’s leadership style. The left accused him of picking an unnecessary fight with the party’s heart and soul. The right worried that he was washing dirty linen in public. One frontbencher described him as a “caretaker”; another dismissed the conference as a “total disaster”. But just as the salty breeze blew the turbines around outside, so the bluster and blasts inside powered the party towards renewal.
The Labour left has been significantly weakened. Sir Keir did not succeed in returning to the electoral-college method of choosing leaders, as he had hoped. But by increasing from 10% to 20% the share of MPs from whom a prospective candidate must gather support, he all but ruled out another hard-left takeover. And by scrapping rules that force MPs to endure periodic reselection by local party activists every year, he further weakened the party’s lunatic fringe. “We’ve nailed the hard left into their coffin,” said one shadow cabinet member. “There’s a lot of kicking and screaming because they know they’re not coming back to life.” A senior adviser gloated: “Job done.”
The conference also saw the outlines of a new Labour philosophy: more mainstream than Corbynism but also more communitarian than Blairism. It is aimed at the just-about-managing in provincial towns, rather than the socially liberal affluent types who formed the core of New Labour. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, focused on what she called “the everyday economy”—that of collapsing high streets rather than lines on a graph. She promised to spend £28bn a year on the green transition, an ambitious figure, but one that is broadly in line with centre-left administrations elsewhere. And she said her party was on the side of workers against companies that don’t pay their taxes and contractors who don’t come up with the goods.
Sir Keir’s speech was too long and his delivery too slow (coming days after a 12,000-word Fabian pamphlet, it suggests that he struggles to self-edit). But it succeeded in advancing his most important aims—to detoxify his party and to define Starmerism. He used his background (a factory-worker father and a mother with a rare, and awful, type of inflammatory arthritis) to lay claim to traditional values such as hard work and aspiration, as well as to more obviously left-wing values such as care and community. He praised the armed forces for defending the country, and the Crown Prosecution Service (which he ran from 2008 to 2013) for tackling criminals. He also praised Tony Blair, the Labour prime minister the Labour left loves to hate, for delivering the “levelling up” that the Tories only talk about. The left played into his hands by heckling after words like “patriot” and gave him a chance to taunt them with his best line—“shouting slogans or changing lives?”—which was taken up by the largely sympathetic audience.
Above all, Sir Keir made it clear that he is serious about winning power. “We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government,” he proclaimed: cue Corbynista fury. He spouted endless detail about policies such as setting up an office to make sure taxpayers get value for money (hence the speech’s inordinate length). He criticised the prime minister, Boris Johnson, not because he is “Tory scum”, as Ms Rayner put it, but because he is a “trivial man”. In tumultuous times, he said, Britain deserves a leader who is dedicated to public service rather than one who treats it as a game.
Batten down the hatches
Among the Labour Party’s biggest weaknesses is a habit of underestimating the Tories, and Mr Johnson in particular. But the Tories may now be doing the same with the man they like to call “the nasal knight” (Sir Keir’s voice is not his best feature). Both are pursuing the same swing voters: the just-about-managing who feel short-changed by globalisation and the 40% of young people who leave school without essential qualifications. They are offering similar policies: higher taxes and bigger government. But Sir Keir’s seriousness and centre-left values may be more suited than Mr Johnson’s bluster to darkening times. The winds of political change have blown left-of-centre parties into power in two of the West’s biggest countries, America and Germany. With Sir Keir fixing the hull and patching the rigging, the same winds might yet do the same for the good ship Labour. ■
An early version of this article was published online on September 29th 2021",1
1611,"AFGHANISTAN’S PRESIDENTIAL palace has seen its fair share of bad-tempered quarrels between politicians. In recent years the castle-like building in the centre of Kabul was the site of bitter spats between the irascible former president, Ashraf Ghani, and his rival, Abdullah Abdullah. Mr Ghani is said to have taken anger-management classes. At one point he and Dr Abdullah held rival inauguration ceremonies as they disagreed over who should rule. Yet even by those fractious standards, the Taliban’s recent bust-up seems to have been heated.
The trouble kicked off in mid-September, just days after the Taliban announced the make-up of their interim government. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the group’s founders and now a deputy prime minister, is said to have been dismayed that the cabinet was stuffed with conservatives from the old guard and military hardliners from the Haqqani network, a leading faction in the Taliban’s tapestry of allegiances. Khalil Haqqani, minister for refugees and a senior member of the Haqqani clan, countered that it was those very military hardliners who had delivered victory and should therefore be rewarded. Most accounts concur that the disagreement descended into angry words. Some suggest it went further: coming to scuffles, punches and even gunfire as the leaders’ retinues brawled. Mr Baradar, who is seen as one of the movement’s moderates, relatively speaking, lay low in Kandahar for a few days, leading to speculation that he had been wounded.

The Taliban deny there was ever any clash. Mr Baradar is now back in Kabul conducting official business and apparently unhurt, though he seems to have lost the argument. But the reports shone fresh light on the internal politics of a group whose leadership has for decades operated in the shadows, and whose dynamics could be outlined only imperfectly by intelligence agencies and Talibanologists.

Disputes like the palace row should come as no surprise considering the diversity within the Taliban, says Antonio Giustozzi of King’s College London. As the group prospered and grew beyond its roots, it swallowed, attracted or co-opted all sorts of militant networks and commanders, of which the Haqqani clan is only the best known. That resulted not in a Maoist-style centrally controlled insurgency, but a coalition of commanders bound by some core beliefs.
The Taliban’s secrecy during their 20-year insurgency hid some of this disagreement, but a notable flare-up occurred in 2015, two years after the death of the movement’s original leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. The appointment of his successor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, who has since been killed, was rejected by several senior figures including Omar’s son. The Taliban were briefly in turmoil as competing factions jockeyed for power. There are also continuing ideological divisions. These vary from how heavy-handed the group should be in enforcing its social policies to whether to cut ties with foreign jihadists such as al-Qaeda, whom many fighters consider comrades. Whether to work with other domestic political forces is also a thorny topic.

Given these differences, what is perhaps most remarkable is not the Taliban’s feuding, but their cohesion. “Their greatest skill,” says Mr Giustozzi, is to “keep all of this together despite constant friction and constant argument.” That stems from hard work, says Haroun Rahimi of the American University of Afghanistan. The group might be known for issuing authoritarian edicts to Afghans, but it goes out of its way to seek consensus internally. There is deference to clerical seniority and battlefield experience, but controversial matters are laboriously debated in large councils known as shuras. Factions such as the Haqqanis have been allowed some latitude in how they operate. Pakistan’s security forces are also thought to have mediated on occasion.
Such deliberation may salve tensions, but it can also make the organisation conservative and indecisive. Policies are pitched at the group’s lowest common denominator to preserve concord. That makes it difficult for the Taliban to change. Indeed early policy moves appear to show no great evolution, despite vows that the Taliban had moved on from the repressive regime they ran in the 1990s. Harsh sharia punishments such as public hanging and chopping off thieves’ hands are back. Women are being purged from the workplace. Such policies may explain why even Pakistan, which formally recognised the Taliban the last time around, has not yet done so again (see box).
Power has brought new challenges to the Taliban’s internal order. During the 1990s, lingering domestic resistance, which they never completely vanquished, helped maintain unity. But the Taliban now rule the entire country, almost uncontested. Thousands of fighters steeped in a culture of militancy are twiddling their thumbs. Not every commander will win a position in the new government. There is little money for those who do. “I think that disagreements within the top leadership are distracting us from the pressure that the Taliban movement is under from below, from their fighters,” says Mr Rahimi.

Tamim Asey, who heads the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a think-tank in the Afghan capital, describes what he calls “jihadi anarchism”. The Taliban’s branches in some provinces show signs of questioning the writ of Kabul. “The transformation from a militia to a government is costing them, and it appears to be painful,” he says. Some fighters are returning to civilian life. Others appear nostalgic for their campaigning days and admit peace is a bit of a drag. “Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to become a martyr,” moans a Talib guarding the shuttered British embassy.
The new defence minister recently rebuked fighters for their indiscipline, complaining of reprisals, which are forbidden under the Taliban’s declared amnesty for officials of the former regime. He also admonished footsoldiers for inadvertently giving away secrets as they pose for selfies in ministries. “Such hanging out and taking snaps and videos will not help you in this world, or in the hereafter,” he said.
Hints of splits within the Taliban might once have gladdened the hearts of the Western spooks and soldiers arrayed against them. No longer. Serious divisions could pitch the country into civil war, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis and prompting a surge in refugees. A rift would also encourage defections to other militant groups and embolden terrorists like Islamic State. For now, at least, even the Taliban’s erstwhile enemies are hoping the group can keep it together.■",1
1612,"“PICTURE THIS,” said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, on October 4th, before describing a young family keen to provide the best for their children. “Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?” The response “no” was implied in his speech and demonstrated by his government’s actions, as just two days later it cut universal credit, a benefit for low-income households, by around £20 ($27) a week.

A welfare state is supposed to insure against shocks such as job loss, to shuffle cash from rich to poor and to smooth income between youth and old age. In recent years Britain’s government has been least concerned by the first of these. Spending on pensions has risen, but out-of-work benefits—jobseeker’s allowance until 2013 and universal credit thereafter—have stagnated (see chart). Across the mostly rich countries of the OECD, a typical childless, single person who became unemployed in 2019 saw up to 55% of earnings replaced by benefits. In Britain, that figure was just 12%.

A report in 2019 by Laura Gardiner of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, considered other trends in welfare spending. Non-cash support, such as free school meals, grew. Benefits became increasingly linked to recipients’ outgoings, such as those related to disability or child care. Eligibility rules were tightened, and more support was offered to help people back into work. Meanwhile benefits for middle-income households were trimmed. In 2013, for example, child benefit became means-tested. All this, on top of a rising state-pension age, meant that whereas in 2005 the share of people receiving a benefit or tax credit was 72%, by the eve of the pandemic that had fallen to 62%.
Changes to working-age benefits were largely the consequence of a desire to cut costs, not a thought-through strategy. But taken together, they imply that Britain’s welfare state envisages middling and higher earners insuring themselves against joblessness by saving. The pandemic revealed that system’s inadequacies. When covid-19 hit, ministers in the Department for Work and Pensions wanted to provide specific help for people whose income was affected. But civil servants were unable to distinguish between those who were already receiving universal credit and new claimants.
So the £20 increase went to everyone, and a furlough scheme acted as targeted pandemic support. It replaced previous income at an average rate of over 90%, compared with just 53% if claimants had had to rely on universal credit. As furlough ends and universal credit returns to its previous level, redistribution is being unwound. And the insurance role of the welfare state is returning to its former Cinderella status, too.",1
1613,"THE GAP between astrology and European politics is alarmingly narrow. Both are more art than science, to put it charitably. Both involve professed experts making wildly inaccurate predictions, with metrics that turn out to be nonsense. Because of the peculiarly nocturnal habits of EU leaders, both require work at night.
What astrology and EU-watching most have in common is the need to wait for mysterious bodies about which they know little to align. Where astrologers look to the heavens, Eurologers consult electoral calendars to see their prospects. Just as a person’s future is written in the stars, so the EU’s destiny is shaped by the order of its national votes.

Elections provide the political constellations from which EU officials divine their future, with as much say over the outcome as a pensioner reading a horoscope. Germany, the club’s most important member, heads to the polls on September 26th. Coalition negotiations are predicted to drag on for months, perhaps until January or even spring. At that point, the French presidential election hoves into view with the first round in April 2022, throwing the European zodiac into flux once more.
The EU is often criticised for having a democratic deficit. At the moment it has a democracy surplus. If Brussels truly were a bureaucratic bulldozer, smashing through the wishes of national capitals, officials would not be twiddling their thumbs waiting for a new German government to be formed. Progress on the EU’s most substantial legislation, such as its spending rules, has paused while Germans vote. National politics and European politics may appear far apart, yet they are linked to each other, just as the Moon pulls the oceans’ tides.
But a Copernican revolution is under way in European politics. The EU’s centre of gravity is shifting. For the past 16 years the EU’s grandees have revolved around Angela Merkel. The chancellor, for all her faults, leaves office a remarkably popular politician at home and the dominant force on the continent. Whoever replaces her will not be either. Mrs Merkel’s party won 33% of the vote in 2017. Her successor, whether a Social or Christian Democrat, will be lucky this time to hit 25%. That successor will be so much less experienced than the battle-hardened Mrs Merkel that a vacuum could open up in European politics.
Jupiter is rising to fill it. Emmanuel Macron once promised a “Jupiterian” presidency, resembling not just any god, but the king of the gods. Events dragged him back to Earth. Still, if Mr Macron wins, he becomes the most powerful leader in the club. He would be the first second-term French president in almost 20 years. Jacques Chirac was re-elected mainly due to French disgust at the idea of electing the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen, who sneaked into the final round of voting. This disgust has since waned, but not to a point where it would trouble Mr Macron.
The more optimistic Eurologers see a perfect alignment. Mr Macron is the most ambitious leader when it comes to European reform. If re-elected, his clout may match that ambition. The most likely successor to Mrs Merkel now appears to be Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat who is receptive to the idea of more spending, in coalition with a Green party set on further European integration. In Italy Mario Draghi, the former boss of the European Central Bank, runs a government wedded to overhauling the country’s economy in exchange for some €190bn ($225bn) of EU funds. For the first time in years, governments in the EU’s three biggest countries would see the continent’s future in a similar way.
Much depends on whether Mr Draghi will stay in office long enough. Mr Draghi and Mr Macron are natural allies. A recent one-on-one dinner in Marseilles dragged on well past midnight, with the pair discussing European policy and a Franco-Italian treaty, along the lines of similar agreements between Paris and Berlin. An Italian prime minister with the ear of governments in Germany and France is a rare thing.
Some forecasters are glum. Nationality trumps politics when it comes to finance, warns one commission official. A German Social Democrat may have more in common with his Christian Democrat counterpart than with, say, a centre-left Italian MP. After all, Mr Scholz is campaigning as “continuity Merkel” in a bout of political cross-dressing. Circumstances of birth count for a lot in both European politics and the zodiac.
When you wish upon 12 stars
With so many moving bodies in the political firmament, it is little wonder that Eurocrats wait for a crisis to pursue bold reform. Rather than wait for the perfect moment when action is easy, wait for a terrible moment of dark and deadly portents, when action is necessary. The impression it leaves—that the EU is a body that springs to life only when things go wrong, rather than another level of everyday politics—is an unhealthy one.
But the idea that the EU can be bold only in crisis is a myth. It is sometimes so when the stars are peaceably positioned. During the 1990s and 2000s, when things were comparatively benign both economically and politically, the EU went through a bout of revolutions. It expanded east, introduced the euro and ripped up and rewrote its treaties every few years. It was only in the wake of the financial and covid-19 crises, when panicked constitutional reforms were shunted through by exhausted leaders before markets opened, that the crisis model truly came to the fore.
A political conjunction between Paris, Rome and Berlin is a rare thing. It may not come again soon. Indeed, it may not come at all. Italian politics may revert to its volatile mean. More than 40% of Italian voters look set to back hard-right parties at the next election, due no later than 2023. Mr Macron could bungle the French election, while anything could now happen in Germany. But another asteroid will be along soon enough. Astrologers and Eurologers alike rarely see them coming. ■",1
1614," (CNN)A mother's depression and anxiety from conception through the first year of the baby's life is associated with negative developmental outcomes through adolescence, according to a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.That could affect a lot of women: About 15% to 23% of women worldwide experience anxiety during pregnancy, while 15% deal with anxiety after childbirth. Depression through pregnancy is estimated to affect 10% of women, and 15% face postpartum depression. The burden is greater for women who are experiencing poverty or are teen parents, according to Postpartum Support International. For the baby, the perinatal stage — which is defined as the time from conception through pregnancy (antenatal), birth and the first year of the baby's life (postnatal) — is ""a time of unprecedented growth and sensitivity,"" the study said. That's when exposures and early life experiences may modify development starting from when he or she is in the womb to that critical first year as a growing child and onward. A mother experiencing depression and anxiety before and after birth was moderately linked with her child's deficits in language and cognitive and motor development in infancy. All of these children were more likely to exhibit behaviors that either internalized negative feelings or targeted them toward others. These kids experienced and reacted with more negative emotions and were temperamentally difficult through adolescence as well. ""In light of the pandemic, these are particularly concerning results,"" said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University, who wasn't involved in the study. ""Since risk factors for perinatal depression include life stress and lack of social support, pregnant and postpartum women may be particularly vulnerable right now.""These data that suggest that this poses risks not just for the mother, but also for her child, not just now but into adolescence, is a stark reminder that the indirect effects of Covid-19 may be long-lasting,"" Jamieson added. Researchers have conducted reviews of studies on the relationship between a woman's mental health during this time and her child's development — but they hadn't previously evaluated the long-term effects of depression and anxiety at different stages of motherhood on a range of developmental functions from infancy through adolescence, the study said. The authors of the current study analyzed the association of perinatal depression and anxiety with social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor and adaptive behavior development in their offspring from infancy up to age 18. They also examined whether the timing of depression and anxiety, type of mental illness and offspring age affected the findings. Mental health before and after birthParticipants included 195,751 otherwise healthy mother-child pairs from 191 studies based in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Norway. These women had either reported their symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or had diagnoses, while later information about their children's development was also self-reported. Depression and anxiety in the perinatal period had small-to-moderate associations with deficits in social-emotional behavior development through adolescence, such as peer problems, a lack of prosocial behaviors and attachment and emotional dysregulation. How maternal mental health might influence a child's growth How a mother's mental health might influence her offspring's development could hinge on what happens to the baby while in the womb and interactions after birth. Anxiety and depression during pregnancy could expose the fetus to increased concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, leading to changes in brain function and reducing the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients, the study said. The neurocognitive changes that prepare mothers to be able to sensitively respond to their infants could also be hampered by experiencing depression and anxiety during pregnancy, the study said. A mentally taxed mother may be less able to quickly, carefully and thoughtfully respond to her baby's cues — potentially reducing the chances of attachment between a mother and her baby.""During the first year of life, infants are unable to sooth themselves when they become upset — they rely on sensitive caregivers to respond when they are distressed,"" said Dr. Alison Stuebe, a professor of maternal and child health at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, who wasn't involved in the study.""With support from these caregivers, infants gradually learn how to cope with fear and frustration,"" Stuebe, also a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the UNC School of Medicine, added.The authors lacked details about individual, family and social factors that could have affected the mothers' mental health and their children's development, said the study's senior author Delyse Hutchinson, an associate professor in the school of psychology at the Centre for Early Social and Emotional Development at Deakin University in Australia. Additional studies are necessary, Jamieson said, but ""the large numbers of studies in this systematic review begin to paint a fairly consistent pattern."" 'When parents struggle, kids struggle'For mothers to recover from birth and transition to their role as parents, and for growing families to thrive, they need support, Stuebe said. ""But in the United States, 23% of mothers are back at work within 10 days postpartum,"" Stuebe added. ""We are (the) only industrialized country without paid parental leave. Women lose pregnancy Medicaid coverage at 60 days after birth, losing access to psychotherapy and medical treatment for depression and anxiety."" If parents lack access to treatment because they're uninsured, can't take time off from work or face some other barrier, Stuebe continued, ""it's likely that their children will be exposed to food and housing insecurity, poorly funded schools, lack of safe spaces to play and other stressors.""When parents struggle, kids struggle."" Maintaining well-being through new chaptersSince families now ""have to balance the urgent need for hands-on help with deciding who can be part of their 'bubble' in the first weeks after birth,"" the pandemic has made building a village more challenging, Stuebe said. Some solutions can be found at New Mom Health, a resource for postpartum women. Expecting and new mothers concerned about their mood should seek help from their physician and/or psychologist early, Hutchinson said. ""Perinatal difficulties are often overlooked,"" Hutchinson said, ""and many women do not seek help because they think it is expected that mothers feel down, tired or worried or because they are concerned about the stigma related to mental health."" Staying connected with supportive family, friends and other mothers is also important, Hutchinson said — as is doing activities that bring you joy and regularly practicing self-care, ""whether it involves going for a walk or other exercise, reading a book, speaking to a friend, relaxation or simply catching up on some sleep."" While these tools alone may not prevent depression and anxiety, they can help mothers navigate challenges. If mothers are concerned that their children have any of the developmental deficits the study highlighted, they should talk with their pediatrician, Hutchinson said. ""If difficulties are recognised and help is sought,"" Hutchinson said via email, ""this risk may be reduced, potentially leading to improved health and wellbeing outcomes for both mother and child.""

1615,"Chris Daughtry's wife Deanna denounced reports that her late daughter Hannah Price's tragic death was being investigated as a homicide.
The 48-year-old grieving mother penned a lengthy Instagram statement on Friday where she tried to clear up any assumptions about the 25-year-old's cause of death which echoed statements given by district attorneys in Tennessee.
'The news floating around that we said our daughters death is being investigated as a homicide is false!,' she wrote in excerpt alongside a photo of her late daughter as a child.
Hannah was found dead at her home in Fentress County, Tennessee on November 12, and the manner of death continues to be under investigation, despite early reports indicating that detectives told family members it was homicide.  
'The news floating around that we said our daughters death is being investigated as a homicide is false! We were not told that and never said that to anyone!,' Deanna began. 
'The day Hannah was found I shared some concerns I had with some ppl I know and said we won’t know anything for sure till after they complete the investigation. Someone took that and went running with it or they talked to some else who then made assumptions and went running to the press with it. 
'None of us can go jumping to conclusions. Having questions & concerns is one thing but harassing someone and calling them a murderer before all the facts are in is wrong on every level regardless of their history,' she continued to say but did not specify outright who she was referring to. 
'I lost my child and I’m having to now also deal with rumors and assumptions about her. The people who loved her are in pain and we are mourning they are not talking to the press, they are not spreading rumors and they sure as hell are not making this about themselves. So everyone please just stop! 
'Let the investigating officers do their jobs and please remember snippets of someone’s life does not define who they really are as a person. Hannah was on this earth with us for 25 years there is so much more to her story then what you are reading. 
'I loved my daughter so much & I am experiencing the deepest emotional pain I have ever felt! Please stop making it worse for those of us who love her by spreading rumors & saying disgusting things about our family. We are real people! Just because my husband has a public job does not mean this is OK to do,' she pleaded. 
'To the beautiful humans who are sending us their prayers, love, and kindness during this time, we thank you. We are not able to reach out to you all individually as I’m sure you understand but please know we are thankful for people like you,' Deanna said in conclusion. 
In line with Deanna's statements, prosecutors in Tennessee said this week that it would be 'premature' to rule the death of Chris Daughtry’s step daughter as a homicide, which refuted reports indicating that detectives told family members it was. 
Jared Effler, the district attorney of Tennessee’s 8th Judicial District, gave a statement to DailyMail.com on Monday indicating that no arrests have been made in connection with the death of 25-year-old Hannah Price.
Price’s boyfriend, Bobby Jolly, 25, was reportedly booked into Fentress County Jail on Friday - the same day her body was found in her home in Nashville, Tennessee. Authorities have not said whether Jolly is a person of interest, or publicly stated why Jolly was arrested. 
'This is a death investigation and any attempt to classify it as a homicide investigation at this time is premature and irresponsible,' the DA said on Monday. 'Further, no one has been arrested pertaining to the death of Ms. Price.' 
A medical examiner at the Regional Forensic Center in Knoxville has yet to reveal the cause or manner of her death, and the family is still awaiting for autopsy results. 
TMZ had reported over the weekend that detectives informed Price’s family that the probe into her death was a homicide investigation, which seemed to prompt Deanna's lengthy statement. 
Hannah's stepfather Chris (who first found fame on American Idol)  posted an emotional statement on his Instagram page following the news of her death which revealed he was struggling.  
'I am still processing the last 24 hours. I am absolutely devastated and heartbroken. I just recently lost my mother to cancer but I was blessed with the chance to say goodbye and I was processing it privately. 
'We never got to say goodbye to our precious Hannah and it's another huge hit to our family. Thank you all for your kind words and condolences. They are truly felt and appreciated. I am now taking time be present with my family as we attempt to heal from this devastating loss.'
 The singer-songwriter was in the middle of his Dearly Beloved Tour at the time of Hannah's death, and has now postponed several of his upcoming tour dates. 
Chris and Deanna have been married for over two decades. The couple share 10-year-old twins Adalynn and Noah and 23-year-old Griffin, with Hannah being from Deanna's previous relationship. ",3
1616,"IT HAS BEEN a summer of unpleasant surprises for the world economy. America, Europe and China are growing more slowly than investors had hoped. Consumer prices are rising uncomfortably fast, especially in America. Even in the euro area, used to tepid inflation, prices in August were 3% higher than a year earlier, the most in a decade. Economies are troubled by shortages of parts and labour, slow and expensive shipping and the bewildering variation of lockdown measures.
The spread of the Delta variant is to blame, but the way the pandemic is affecting the economy is shifting. The world had become accustomed to the virus battering growth, as waves of infection caused a sudden stop in activity, and prices moderated or even fell. Delta, by contrast, looks like a stagflationary force that is sapping growth less dramatically but firing up inflation.

Delta is weighing on consumer spending in the rich world but not causing a collapse. In countries with lots of vaccine, cases are no longer doing as much to stop consumers from moving around. Europe’s service sector has reopened amid its Delta wave.
Consumers seem less scared of the disease even if there are enough unvaccinated people to fill up hospitals. A year ago the number of diners in American restaurants was nearly half the level in 2019. Now service is about 10% down, even though hospitals are three times fuller. In Japan a state of emergency covering Tokyo does not seem to be keeping consumers away from the shops. Only in countries with draconian policies aimed at eliminating the virus are people stuck at home. Australia and New Zealand face new recessions as a result of their lockdowns and China’s service sector appears to be shrinking.
Meanwhile, the spread of Delta continues to interfere with the global supply of goods just as consumers, especially Americans, are intent on buying more cars, devices and sporting gear than ever. Outbreaks in South-East Asian countries with low rates of vaccination are causing production plants and logistics networks to shut down temporarily, prolonging the disruption to supply chains. In America retailers, including Gap and Nike, have lobbied the White House to donate more vaccines to Vietnam, so crucial have its factories become to their businesses. Shortages are driving up prices.

The changing relationship between the virus and the economy has implications for policymakers. They will not be able to repeat the trick from earlier in the pandemic of restricting people’s movement as a way to contain the spread of the virus, while at the same time unleashing stimulus to create a compensating boom in demand for goods.
A service-sector revival is now the only quick route to fast growth because that is where the slack is. In the second quarter of the year spending on services by American households was about 3% below its level in 2019 in real terms. Should the spread of Delta interfere with service industries such as leisure and hospitality, more stimulus will only create more inflation.
It is also harder to argue that fear of the virus scares consumers off spending, and that government restrictions to slow the spread of disease therefore have little extra economic cost. A weaker link between cases and people’s movement, and the necessity of service-sector growth, raise the cost of lockdowns. If pressure on hospitals causes even highly vaccinated countries like Britain to restrict services over the winter, the economic damage will be large and the benefits smaller. The Delta wave may subside soon, easing the pressure on the world economy. If it does not or another variant takes its place, the trade-offs involved in fighting the virus will become harder to justify. ■

1617,"PATIENTS IN CHINA keep attacking their doctors. On January 27th Hu Shuyun, a physician in the southern province of Jiangxi, died after being assaulted on a ward. A few days earlier three medical workers at a hospital in Hangzhou, an eastern city, were injured when a patient set off a homemade bomb. Every month brings more shocking stories. Chinese even has a word for it: yinao, meaning “medical disturbance”. Between 2004 and 2016, the number of such disputes that ended up in court rose from 8,854 to 21,480. But only a fraction of cases get that far. In 2016 the National Health and Family Planning Commission acknowledged that it had mediated more than 60,000 disputes.
The problem of yinao has become so acute that, on March 1st, Shanghai became the first city to start a blacklist of people deemed to have engaged in banned behaviour in medical facilities. As well as facing criminal penalties, they can be barred from holding public-sector jobs and denied access to outpatient services under the social-credit system, in which bad behaviour can mean loss of rights and privileges.

These measures build on a national law that came into effect last June. It is the first to specify that citizens have a right to “basic health-care services” provided by the state. It also bans them from attacking medical staff. In July Beijing’s city government adopted its own guidelines for hospital security, recommending checks at entrances and surveillance cameras inside. On April 15th Beijing’s health commission said that 86 hospitals had installed facial-recognition systems.
China’s doctors have long worried about violence. In 2015 600,000 physicians signed a petition calling for an end to such assaults. A survey in 2019 found that 85% of doctors had encountered violence at work. Officials have hailed medical staff as heroes during the covid-19 pandemic, but at the height of the outbreak last year there were several reports of patients with the disease assaulting doctors.
Much of the anger originates in the 1980s, when reform began on the free, state-funded health-care system. Hospitals, starved of government funds, began charging patients for treatment, and often resorted to overprescribing. Many ordinary people were unable to pay. This has created a “generalised sense of distrust” towards the medical profession, says Cheris Chan of the University of Hong Kong.
Even though the government initiated further reforms in 2009, under which nearly everyone is now covered by some form of basic health insurance, the quality of care in rural areas is still poor. So people go straight to large city hospitals, many of which sell tickets for consultations that touts buy up and resell for profit.
Fully 36% of spending on health care in China comes from patients, compared with 14% in the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries. The insurance system gives hospitals an incentive to treat out-of-province patients, since they must pay upfront. And China still has only two doctors per 1,000 people, compared with 3.5 on average across the OECD. Most are poorly paid.
Medical scandals further undermine confidence. A well-known case in 2018 involved hundreds of thousands of children receiving faulty vaccines after the manufacturer fabricated inspection records. In February this year 70 people were arrested for making fake covid-19 vaccines.
Tougher regulations to protect doctors from angry patients do not seem to be working. Since the new laws were introduced in Beijing more than 180,000 prohibited items such as knives have been seized at hospital entrances. With covid-19 under control, people are going back to hospitals. This could cause violence to rise again. Until the government deals with underpaid doctors and overstretched hospitals, it is likely to continue.■",1
1618,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. We begin our coverage with the publication of a special report by our US editor.
WHEN DEREK CHAUVIN knelt on George Floyd’s neck at the corner of 38th and Chicago on a warm, cloudy night in Minneapolis a year ago, there was little unusual about the scene. Not for Mr Floyd, who had been arrested before. Not for Mr Chauvin, who had been disciplined twice for misconduct and had 17 complaints against him. And not for America, where police kill over 1,000 people a year—three-quarters of them, unlike Mr Floyd, armed. Sorted by race, more whites die like this than any other group. But black Americans (13% of the population) are over twice as likely to be killed by the police. In this, as in many other ways, African-American men who are poor are at the bottom of the heap. To find someone else’s knee on their throat is, sadly, unsurprising.
The reaction to this murder was a shock, though. Mr Floyd’s death, which was filmed by a bystander, sparked the biggest civil-rights protests in America’s history. Some 20m Americans took part, flouting covid-19 restrictions. There were 7,750 protests in over 2,440 places, in every state. Beyond America, Black Lives Matter protests were staged in Brazil, France, Japan and New Zealand, among others. Companies around the world have been busily examining whether, through their hiring, buying and selling, they play a part in perpetuating racism. A year on, footballers in England’s Premier League, who play in a country where just 3% of the population is black, still take a knee before games, a gesture that is broadcast to 188 countries. Thus America’s struggle to defeat racism shapes other societies too.


The image of a white-skinned man, wearing a uniform that reads “To Protect With Courage, To Serve With Compassion”, kneeling on the neck of a dark-skinned man evokes the worst of America’s past so strongly that there seems little doubt what killed Mr Floyd. Police violence was part of it, as was poverty. But the real culprit was racism. The jury that on April 21st, after a short deliberation, convicted Mr Chauvin of murder seemed to agree.

For many African-Americans, watching a constant stream of death videos, combined with the country’s still racialised politics, feels like “drowning in the news”, according to Eddie Glaude of Princeton University. “I never really had faith in the United States in the strongest sense of the word,” he writes in “Begin Again”, a book about James Baldwin published after the protests. “I hoped that one day white people here would finally leave behind the belief that they mattered more. But what do you do when this glimmer of hope fades, and you are left with the belief that white people will never change—that the country, no matter what we do, will remain basically the same?”
Drowning in the news makes it easy to miss the profound improvements in racial attitudes in America that have taken place just in the past generation, a change reflected in the scale of outrage about Mr Floyd’s murder (and the rare conviction of a police officer for it). When Bill Clinton became president, a majority of Americans disapproved of interracial marriages. Cynthia Duncan, a sociologist who worked in the Mississippi Delta during the 1990s, observed that “when blacks describe a white who does not seem racist, they say, ‘she treated me like a person’, repeating the phrase to emphasise how rare and remarkable the encounter had been.” And this was 30 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
Now another 30 years have passed, 90% of Americans approve of mixed-race marriage. Measuring changes in racial attitudes is fraught, because as people become more conscious that prejudices they hold are no longer widely accepted, they may become more reluctant to admit them. Yet changes in behaviour suggest the shift is real, not just what people believe they should say to pollsters. More than 10% of babies born in America are now mixed-race. Research drawing on data from dating apps suggests that one in three couples who meet online are too. This is part of a demographic transformation. Since 2019, white, non-Hispanic children have been in a minority in America.

African-Americans, whose opinion on the matter ought to count, think there is less racial discrimination than there was. In 1985 three-quarters of African-Americans thought that the fact that whites had better jobs, better wages and better houses was mainly down to discrimination. By 2012, less than half thought this was the case (a share that rose after Donald Trump was elected). And yet among the general population, racism is rated a more important issue in Gallup’s polling than health care, poverty, crime, the environment or national security.
How can the country have become both less racist and yet more worried that the prevalence of racism is growing? And if racism is indeed declining, why do so many African-Americans still seem to be so stuck?
Racism and awareness of racism are related but distinct. Sometimes they move in opposite directions. In the old South, where people were denied the right to vote for a century after the abolition of slavery because of the colour of their skin, it was a cliché for whites to claim not only that they were not racist but also that they understood African-Americans better than did those progressives in northern cities. Similarly, many whites who may have been unaware of racism when it was far more prevalent are more conscious of it now, as the protests after Mr Floyd’s murder showed.
Guess who’s coming to dinner
Since Barack Obama’s election in 2008, left-leaning white Americans have undergone what Matt Yglesias, a journalist, dubbed a Great Awokening on race. R.T. Rybak, a former mayor of Minneapolis, calls it “reality therapy”. The Trump-powered birther movement, which asserted that the country’s first black president was a foreigner, the well-publicised killings by police of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Eric Garner in New York, a mass-shooting at a black church in South Carolina: all these made people realise that racism was more widespread than they had thought. And then Mr Trump was elected president.
The share of whites who thought black Americans had worse jobs, lower incomes and crummier houses because of discrimination shot up. The share of whites who thought government should give no special treatment to black Americans shrank by a third in six years. In the year Mr Obama was elected, half of white Americans thought racial differences in incomes and wealth were caused mainly by lack of will. By 2018 that share had fallen by 15 points. Now black respondents are slightly more likely to blame African-Americans for their circumstances than whites are.
Understanding race and racism in American means grasping a set of contradictions. Despair at the slowness of improvement can be a sign of progress. Racial attitudes have changed, but black and white Americans are as segregated as they were in the era of James Brown and John Denver. As a true multiracial democracy, America has existed for less than the span of a lifetime. It is home to the biggest black middle class in the world, but also to a large black underclass that has made little economic progress since the 1960s. Writing about race is normally shorthand for writing about African-Americans, Hispanics or Asians. But as they are becoming more aware, whites are a race too.
In a multiracial democracy, emphasising race can be a recipe for zero-sum competition for public resources. Partly for this reason, the French government largely bans collection of data on race. But ducking the issue can mean that racial inequality persists. In 1967, another time of despair at racist violence, James Baldwin wrote that he wanted black Americans “to do something unprecedented: to create ourselves without finding it necessary to create an enemy.” America’s task now is to make multiracial politics work without setting groups against each other. No other big, rich democracy is as multiracial, but plenty will be one day. So America is once again a testing-ground for a great democratic experiment. For it to work, the first thing to understand is why it was Mr Chauvin’s knee that was on Mr Floyd’s throat, and not the other way around.■

1619,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson described the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse as 'a wonderful moment,' praising the jury and insisting it was a day to celebrate - while left-leaning news anchors labeled the verdict a sorry moment in US history.
Carlson, who on Monday will broadcast the first televised interview with Rittenhouse, showed his producers in the car with Rittenhouse as they drove away from the courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday afternoon.
Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by a jury on Friday of all five charges stemming from the death of two protesters, shot and killed by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020.
At the end of the two-week trial, the jury decided that Rittenhouse acted in self defense amid chaotic scenes, with riots in the city sparked by the police shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake.
'The jury reached the correct verdict,' Rittenhouse told Carlson's team.
'Self defense is not illegal. I am glad they reached the correct verdict.'
The teenager added: 'It's been a tough journey but we made it through.
'We made it through the hard part.'
Carlson, one of Rittenhouse's strongest champions, praised the jury for their 'enormous moral courage' and described it as 'a significant day in US history.'
On other networks, the response was distinctly different.
Chris Cuomo, on CNN, said that Rittenhouse had been 'weaponized' by Carlson, whom he described as 'one of the most toxic and divisive people in our society'.
Cuomo said he thought the verdict was right, however. 
'While he was not guilty, it was wrong and hurtful and people are dead and we shouldn't be celebrating,' Cuomo said.
'The law rules. And the law here is the bad guy. That self defense law is pitiful. He was allowed to carry that rifle under the law.' 
His CNN colleague Don Lemon said: 'We should respect the justice system in Kenosha. The laws that are in place are the main reason he was acquitted.
'It is hard to separate race from this case. It may not be the main issue, but it was there.'
He later added: 'Race is definitely a part of this.' 
Chuck Todd, a host on MSNBC, said that he felt the verdict emboldened people to carry guns at protests. 
'The next time there's a protest of some sort, and it may get politicized, that gun owners, with a certain ideology may feel incentivized now, may feel even emboldened,' Todd said. 
'Anyone who supports Black Lives Matter should be very afraid after this,' said Joy-Ann Reid, another MSNBC host. 
Nicolle Wallace attempted to put Rittenhouse in the same category as domestic terrorists.
'The Kyle Rittenhouse acquittal today - not guilty on all counts - did not happen in a cultural vacuum,' she said.
'There's alarming context to this moment we're considering and talking about.
'Last week, the department of homeland security released its latest bulletin warning Americans, again, of the ongoing threat posed by domestic violent extremists.
'We should also point out conservative media for many, many months have been priming its audience for this moment, framing Rittenhouse as a hero.' 
Carlson accused the Left of having 'endorsed mob violence' and said Rittenhouse was a patriot protecting his father's hometown. 
'The jury confirmed what was obvious from the very beginning,' said Carlson.
'It was a wonderful moment.'
He said it showed that 'propaganda doesn't always win. Today it was soundly defeated - thank God.' 
And he criticized rival networks for their framing of the trial in racial terms.
'It doesn't have anything to do with anything,' Carlson said.
'But it's been a fixation of the Democratic party.
'They try to racialize everything,' he said, accusing them of 'trying to whip people into a frenzy'. 
His guest, Brazil-based journalist Glenn Greenwald, remarked that three of Brazil's top newspapers had to apologize for referring to Rittenhouse's victims as being black.  
Sean Hannity, also on Fox News, responded: 'My message to Kyle Rittenhouse tonight: Sue them all, starting with the president.
'This was a clear cut case of self-defense. We do not operate under mob rule.
'If anyone at fake news CNN or MSNBC had an ounce of decency they would apologize. They are con artists. They are always wrong; they always rush to judgement.'
Hannity said that Rittenhouse should sue Biden after the then-candidate last year posted a tweet, after a campaign debate, labelling Rittenhouse a white supremacist.  
Geraldo Rivera, Hannity's guest, got into a blazing row about whether Rittenhouse should sue Joe Biden - with Judge Jeanine Pirro yelling from the sidelines.
Rivera said the suggestion of suing the president was 'absurd'. 
Hannity replied: 'It's okay to call somebody a white supremacist with no facts?'
'May I finish the sentence?' Rivera continued. 'The person that Rittenhouse should sue first is the guy who was his original attorney who sought to make a political statement who dragged this 17-year-old kid to the bar with the Proud Boys and allowed this narrative of white supremacy.'
'Oh, cut it out, Geraldo!' Pirro shouted.
'That's ridiculous,' Hannity said. 
'I want to know if you refer to somebody who is not a white supremacist and not a public figure, and you call them a white supremacist, that's not defamation?'
Rivera replied: 'Sean, what you and I get called every day…'
Hannity retorted: 'He's not a public figure.'
The argument continued for several minutes. 
Hannity's other guest, Miranda Devine, said that the case was 'a modern day To Kill a Mockingbird,' and that Rittenhouse's lawyer was Atticus Finch.
She said it was about a poor, 'defenseless' man who took on the system.
'That poor kid,' she said.
'My heart went out to him. I really hope he can get on with his life.
'He deserves to be vindicated, and allowed to get on with his life.' 
Cori Bush, a congresswoman for Missouri and member of 'The Squad' described Rittenhouse's acquittal as 'white supremacy in action'.
'This system isn't built to hold white supremacists accountable,' she said. 
'It's why Black and brown folks are brutalized and put in cages while white supremacist murderers walk free. 
'I'm hurt. I'm angry. I'm heartbroken.'
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agreed, tweeting: 'What we are witnessing is a system functioning as designed and protecting those it was designed for.'
Fellow Squad member Ayanna Pressley added: 'Racism & white supremacy remain the bedrock of our legal system. My heart breaks for the family & loved ones of those whose lives were stolen, and the trauma our communities face today and every day. 
'The struggle for accountability, for justice, for healing goes on.' 
The head of the House Progressive Caucus, Pramila Jayapal, said: 'I'm heartbroken. 
'If we're ever going to tackle racial injustice in America, we have to admit our justice system isn't working for Black, brown and Indigenous people. Then, we have to transform it. 
'It won't be easy but I'm committed to organizing alongside you to make it happen.' 
Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, said that 'to call this a miscarriage of justice is an understatement.'
He tweeted: 'Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum are victims. They should be alive today. 
'The only reason they're not is because a violent, dangerous man chose to take a gun across state lines and start shooting people.' ",3
1620,"THERE ARE things that democratic governments are not supposed to do. They are not supposed to change the rules of the game at the last minute because they are going to lose. They are not supposed to make it easier to take money for favours. They are not supposed to force MPs to do things that make them hang their heads in shame. Yet on November 3rd Boris Johnson’s government did all this and more. The father of the House, Peter Bottomley, declared that he could not in conscience vote with his party. Younger Tory MPs with careers still to make looked embarrassed.
On October 26th Parliament’s standards committee issued a damning report on Owen Paterson, a veteran MP and leading Brexiteer. He was guilty of “an egregious case of paid advocacy” and had “brought the House into disrepute”, it said. He should be suspended for 30 days, long enough to trigger a recall if enough voters demanded it. Mr Paterson had lobbied ministers and officials on behalf of two companies, Randox, a clinical-diagnostics firm, and Lynn’s Country Foods, a meat processor and distributor. They paid him more than £100,000 ($137,000) a year between them for consulting work.

The report brought a furious rebuttal from Mr Paterson and a fusillade of complaints from his friends in Parliament and the media. They accused the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, of bias against Tories, particularly Brexiteers, of having used the two-year-long inquiry to torment Mr Paterson (his wife, Rose, took her own life during it) and, in the Daily Telegraph, of wearing a nose-stud and refusing to condemn the IRA.
If the Tories disagreed with the verdict, they could have voted to reject the report or reduce Mr Paterson’s suspension. Instead Dame Andrea Leadsom, a former leader of the Commons, tabled an amendment to create a new committee to fix “potential defects” in the disciplinary system. The government then used its might to rescue Mr Paterson by imposing a three-line whip on its MPs to vote for the amendment.
His allies had little to say about the evidence against him, probably because it was overwhelming. He had lobbied ministers and officials not once but repeatedly, using contacts acquired when he was secretary of state for Northern Ireland and then the environment. He used his parliamentary office for business meetings, and parliament-headed notepaper for lobbying. He claimed in his defence that he raised issues of food safety with the Food Standards Agency. But after that he made further attempts to contact officials and to promote “Randox’s superior technology”. The committee concluded that “no previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of confusion between the private and public interest”.
Instead, Mr Paterson’s supporters criticised the process. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the house, argued that it had denied him the right of appeal as required by “natural justice”, a phrase he and other Tories used with the reverence of Thomist scholars. In fact, the system offers several chances for reconsideration—the standards committee can reject the commissioner’s report and even if it does not, the House of Commons has final say. The committee read all the evidence Mr Paterson presented, and no court is obliged to listen to any and all supporters a defendant nominates.
Whatever the current system’s failings, the government’s plan was worse. The new committee was to dispense with the independent commissioner and consist entirely of MPs, with a built-in Tory majority. It made a nonsense of Mr Rees-Mogg’s talk of an appeals process: what sort of appeal court is controlled by the governing political party? Other parties said that their MPs would refuse to sit on it.
As if to acknowledge these shortcomings, on November 4th the government appeared to back down. It would, Mr Rees-Mogg said, bring about reform on a “cross-party” basis and break the link between Mr Paterson’s case and future cases. Mr Paterson himself resigned as an MP, though he continued to insist he was innocent of wrongdoing.
Today’s system is itself the product of the cash-for-questions imbroglio in 1994 and the parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009. Yet the government is now dismantling it to wish away another money-related scandal. Almost a quarter of the 59 backbenchers who signed Dame Andrea’s amendment had previously been found in breach of parliamentary standards. David Cameron, the prime minister from 2010 to 2016, was recently hauled over the coals for lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital, a financial company that later failed. Yet the government has now protected yet another Tory MP who used his office to lobby.
The Paterson affair looks likely to further undermine public trust in politicians in general and Tories in particular. How will rich rewards for lobbying go down with the Conservative Party’s new working-class voters in northern constituencies? That MPs voted for the amendment by just 250 to 232, despite a government majority of 80 and a three-line whip, suggests many Tory MPs are uneasy. Mr Rees-Mogg closed his speech by saying that “sometimes to do the right thing, one has to accept a degree of opprobrium”. The government has just earned a great deal of opprobrium by doing the wrong thing. ■
Editor’s note (November 4th 2021): This story has been updated since its initial publication",1
1621,"IF THE ECONOMY is a machine, then monetary policymakers are backroom engineers. On November 4th they held the Bank of England’s interest rate steady at 0.1%, but seem poised to tweak it upwards soon. Investors expect the rate to rise above 1% by the end of 2022, the biggest escalation since 2006. But as the technicians tinker, they face huge uncertainty.
Rising interest rates make saving more lucrative and borrowing dearer. They can drag down asset values, consumer spending and business investment, and cause the pound to appreciate. Most directly, they can also increase mortgage payments, leaving households with less money to spend on other things. Untangling these effects is tricky. A study published in 2019 of British and American households between the 1970s and 2000s, by James Cloyne of the University of California, Davis, Clodomiro Ferreira of the Bank of Spain and Paolo Surico of London Business School, found that mortgage payments grew in response to higher official rates. But Britons’ spending on other things fell by close to four times as much, showing that indirect effects of monetary policy were also at work.

The same study found that how many households have mortgages matters a lot: spending by outright homeowners barely responded to changes in official interest rates. Mortgage terms matter, too. Historically, Britain was a nation of floating-rate mortgages, with payments rising and falling with the official interest rate. In America, however, mortgage interest rates are usually fixed for decades. That helps explain why British mortgage-interest payments were nearly three times as responsive to changes in official interest rates after four years as were American ones.
Today’s monetary policymakers face a very different mortgage market to that 15 years ago. In mid-2006 around 46% of Britons lived in a home with an outstanding mortgage; now, only around 37% do. This shift has been driven by population ageing, which means more homeowners have paid off their mortgages, and by a rise in the average age of first-time buyers. The share of Britons living in homes that are owned outright has risen from 25% in 2006 to 29% this year.

Moreover, mortgages with floating rates accounted for over half the stock in 2006, and over 70% in the early 2010s. That share is now less than 20% (see chart). Fixed-rate terms have grown longer, and since mid-2020 the majority of fixed-rate mortgages have been set for five years. According to figures from UK Finance, an industry group, mortgages with fixed rates have relatively large outstanding balances, meaning that the homeowners who would suffer most from higher interest rates are most likely to be shielded from them, at least in the short term.
That leaves first-time buyers and people refinancing their mortgages. Regulatory changes meant to ensure affordability mean that since 2014, they must show that they can cope with a rise of three percentage points within five years of taking out a loan. If the main policy rate increases, says Neal Hudson of BuiltPlace, a consultancy, there could be pressure to weaken that test to avoid shutting first-time buyers out. That would lessen the squeeze on credit associated with higher official rates.
The Bank of England seems confident that interest-rate rises will have plenty of oomph, for example in influencing credit for businesses. Its strategy of raising interest rates before unwinding the asset purchases with which it fought first the global financial crisis and then the effects of covid-19 results partly from its confidence that it understands the effects of the former. An analysis in 2019 of its forecasts by Innes McFee of Oxford Economics, another consultancy, suggested that the bank thought interest-rate rises after 2017 would have a bigger effect on GDP than in the 2000s. (Mr McFee disagreed.) Britain’s economy comes with no instruction manual. Here’s hoping nothing breaks. ■",1
1622,"AS A SELF-DESCRIBED “angry centrist”, Chuck Schumer used to relish fighting his party’s radical fringe. In a centre-left manifesto he published in 2007, entitled “Positively American”, the Senate majority leader shuddered to remember the left-wing activists he had encountered at Harvard in the 1960s who “seemed to want to tear down every part of the American system”. He was even more contemptuous of his party’s unwillingness to repudiate them. “In politics, you have to either defend or denounce what your friends say,” wrote Mr Schumer. “If you don’t, people start to wonder what you really believe.”
The activist group he recalled has morphed into the Democratic Socialists of America, whose best-known member is Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She is widely believed to be mulling a primary challenge to Mr Schumer. Yet far from defining himself against her radicalism, he, the least well-known of the veteran Democratic trio running the government, has embraced it. He often appears alongside Ms Ocasio-Cortez in New York. And he has adopted a couple of her causes, student debt forgiveness and legal pot. For the many conservatives who detect AOC’s socialist hand in everything the Democrats do, Mr Schumer is Exhibit A.

The Democrats have indeed shifted to the left, albeit more modestly than their opponents claim. And as he has always swum in the party’s mainstream—much like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, the triumvirate’s other members—he has naturally shifted with it. Yet his benevolence towards the fire-starter from Queens is not only about protecting his left flank. It reflects Mr Schumer’s general approach to sustaining the slimmest possible Senate majority.
With just 50 votes plus that of Kamala Harris, the vice-president, and no prospect of Republican support on almost any of the major bills Mr Biden wants to get passed, Mr Schumer cannot afford to lose a single Democrat. Even with a bigger majority and less ambition, his Republican predecessor showed how hard that will be. Mitch McConnell passed a tax cut, failed to scrap Obamacare and left it at that. And the left—a tribe spanning Joe Manchin and Bernie Sanders—is more quarrelsome than the right. Mr Schumer’s response has essentially been to encourage his colleagues to push for whatever in Mr Biden’s agenda, loosely defined, they like best. And he has done so persistently, coaxing the party to hang together, in the hope that the longer a falling-out can be prevented the less likely it will be.
Where Mr McConnell and Harry Reid, the previous Democrat in his office, maintained an aura of immense power, Mr Schumer, the first New Yorker and Jew to occupy it, has a more relaxed style. He has tripled the size of Mr Reid’s kitchen cabinet, making it less a coterie of feared lieutenants than a team-building exercise, which includes Mr Sanders and Mr Manchin. With his signature flip-phone always to hand, he spends much of each day calling around his caucus, congratulating, cajoling or just checking in. The results of his more modest approach are better than many Democrats had expected.
A former attention-seeking legislator (“the most dangerous place is between him and a camera,” Bob Dole quipped) and campaign strategist, Mr Schumer was said to lack the grip of Mrs Pelosi, his counterpart in the House. Yet among Democrats he is now universally praised. “It’s literally impossible to imagine anyone else doing the job,” says Chris Coons of Delaware.
Unheralded success will do that. Mr Schumer has been credited with coaxing Mr Manchin into line on the $1.9trn stimulus the Democrats passed in March. He is also the architect of a so-far successful bifurcation of infrastructure spending—which some Republicans support—and the rattle-bag of safety net and climate measures that Democrats hope to pass on a partisan basis. Even as this “two-track” process enters what promises to be a stormy last phase of negotiation (which a customary autumnal row over funding the government threatens to make even harder), a large majority of Democrats are firmly behind it.
No one should confuse this with a good way to govern America. Much like Mr Schumer’s something-for-everyone leadership style, the Democrats’ effort to jam a presidential term’s worth of new programmes and reforms into a budget bill is illustrative of their weakness and a broken system. A decade of gridlock suggests there is no other way to make progress on climate change, inequality and other big issues. Yet their approach is nonetheless riddled with shortcomings.
The old saw that bipartisan dealmaking, conducted in good faith, produces better laws still holds. The excesses of the stimulus package compared with the sleeker-looking infrastructure deal illustrate that truth. And Mr Schumer’s light-touch steerage looks like the particular enemy of hard choices. If and when Mr Manchin digs in for a steep reduction in the $3.5trn cost of the draft budget bill, Democrats should drop some of their more expendable schemes—such as free community college—in order to preserve climate and other must-haves. Yet a general hair-cut, which everyone might grumblingly live with, may be more consistent with Mr Schumer’s approach.
It might not get that far. His effort to prolong the negotiation could be storing up an ever more dramatic and damaging blow-out. For that matter, even if the Democrats pass some semblance of their plans, it is not clear that voters would reward them for it.
Virtue’s uncertain reward
Their baggy monster of a budget bill, to borrow Henry James’s phrase, looks too sprawling to be reduced to an effective slogan. The Republican attack on it as socialism would be easier to execute. When working on campaign strategy, Mr Schumer would have had that flaw uppermost in mind. Now consumed by the improbable task of passing laws, he seems unable to. Whatever he may be telling his colleagues, his party cannot have it all.■

1623,"Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of Princess Charlene after her husband revealed she's left Monaco, despite only just returning from a 10-month absence, and hinted that she's struggling with her mental health. 
Speaking to Monaco-Matin yesterday, Prince Albert, 63, confirmed his wife, 43, who has appeared increasingly frail, has left the principality and is staying at a secret location while she 'recovers from tiredness', away from him and their six-year-old twins. 
'She is better but she still needs rest and peace,' he said in an article translated from French. 'She is not in the Principality but we will be able to visit her very soon.
'I cannot tell you more out of discretion. There is tiredness, not just physical, which can only be treated with a period of rest and monitoring.' 
He added their children, Jacques and Gabriella, had 'suffered from the absence of their mother' but that he had compensated by stepping up to take a more active role in their lives. 
'For me, it's pretty simple – my priority is my family,' the prince said, when asked about juggling the role of being a head of state and a father.  
He continued: 'This is an extremely important time in [the children's] life – the way they grow up helps them see the world.
'And if one of the parents is away for medical reasons, the other parent has to be there. I have heard too many friends and acquaintances telling me that they wish they had been there for their children, at a certain age, taken up by their work or their professional life. I don't want to have these regrets.' 
Asked if the children had been 'more protected' during their mother's absence, Albert added: 'They should be protected in general, but of course they suffered from the absence of their mother. But they had enough distractions and a family circle that made sure they were not lacking in affection.'
The prince also said rumours around the state of his marriage 'don't bother him too much'.
It comes after the House of Grimaldi confirmed Charlene will not attend Monaco's National Day celebrations - one of the biggest events in the royal calendar - on Friday.
Charlene, 43, returned to her husband and twins Jacques and Gabriella in Monaco last Monday following a 10-month absence while she recovered from surgery following a sinus infection she contracted during a solo charity trip to her native South Africa earlier this year.
In the days after her arrival, Charlene's sister-in-law Chantell Wittstock, told MailOnline the princess may not be returning to the palace and did not plan to immediately return to public engagements, although she later retracted the remark.
Before she left in January, Charlene had raised eyebrows in Monaco by living in a modest two-bedroom apartment above an old chocolate factory about 300m away, rather than in the 12th Century Palace itself. It is thought she could return to living at the property. 
Asked whether the Princess would now return to the arm's-length arrangement the couple had before her departure, Ms Wittstock, married to Charlene's brother Sean, who is on the board of her charitable foundation, said: 'Oh, we don't know yet. She'll probably be commuting between the two, wherever she's comfortable.
'And none of that is clear yet where she'll be settling or anything like that. I mean, she only just arrived back, so it's everybody finding their feet. The Princess is very excited to see her kids and they're very excited to see their mom again.
'So we'll see where she'll be settling. But it will be with her husband and her children.
Ms Wittstock, asked about media stories focusing on the state of her sister-in-law's marriage to Prince Albert, added: 'It is absolutely not something I can comment on. But what I can say is the princess is back in Monaco with her husband and children that should say it all.' 
She later retracted her statement, claiming that Charlene would be staying with her husband and children, but the latest comments from Prince Albert prove otherwise. 
Meanwhile, Prince Albert has continued to carry out royal duties on his own.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the couple said: 'The Princess is currently convalescing and will continue to do so for the coming weeks, allowing Her time to recover from a state of profound general fatigue.'
The statement said the couple have 'both decided that a period of calm and rest is necessary to ensure the very best recovery for Princess Charlene's health.'   
It continued: 'In order to protect the comfort and privacy essential to Her recovery, the Princess' location will remain strictly confidential.
'As soon as her health permits, the Princess looks forward to once again carrying out her Princely duties and spending time with the Monegasques.'    
The claims will inevitably cast a shadow of doubt over the staged photocall last week when Charlene was reunited with Albert, 63, and their children after a 10-month absence from Monaco. 
Charlene spent months without her family in her native South Africa while she recovered from surgery following a sinus infection she contracted during a solo charity trip earlier this year.
The reunion, shared on Instagram, was eyed with scepticism by French commentators amid feverish speculation about the state of the Grimaldis' marriage.
Charlene's time away followed fresh allegations last December that Albert had fathered a love-child (which would be his third, if proven) with an unnamed Brazilian woman during the time when he and Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer for South Africa, were already in a relationship.
On the question of Charlene's return to public engagements, she sounded equally equivocal, saying: 'She absolutely will - if everything goes well, if she is definitely still healing and recovering.
'That doesn't just happen overnight. She's definitely going to be taking it easy. And yeah, her main focus right now will be spending time with her children and her family.

'All we can say right now is all of her procedures in South Africa were a success. So medically the doctors have cleared her to fly back. And that's why she's obviously back in Monaco with her kids.' 
She said the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, which promotes water safety and wildlife conservation in Africa, would soon expand to cover the whole continent.
'The main reason for coming to Africa in the first place was to launch more Foundation projects, which is when she fell ill and the Foundation team in South Africa absolutely carried on with all of those, making sure that everything happened exactly the way she wanted it.
'Even during recovery, in between procedures, the princess still tried to be completely hands-on and on the ground and work with us. 
The foundation will also be expanding into the whole of Africa as of next year.
'As far as Charlene goes. The outlook is is positive and you know she's going to get back to full strength and be full steam ahead. It's not going to happen overnight.'
The new development will certainly add fuel to the intense speculation over the future of the marriage of Charlene and Albert.
Monday's photos were greeted with a hefty dose of scepticism by the French media.
Albert was waiting for her at the Monte Carlo helipad, along with their six-year-old twins, Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques. The family were joined by a hand-picked photographer inside the Palace walls for the 'reunion' photos.
But there was already doubt cast over the couple's living arrangements.
'Reunion of Albert and Charlene of Monaco: but where exactly do they sleep?' was the headline question in the respected French celebrity outlet Gala on Tuesday.
And Voici – another popular magazine read widely across Monaco and France – ran with: 'Charlene of Monaco back: the Princess breaks the silence and forgets to mention her husband'.
This was a reference to Charlene using a social media video to thank everybody who had helped her through months of ill-health, without name-checking Albert at all.
In the streets in the shadow of the 12th century Prince's Palace, people could not conceal their concern for Charlene this week, having seen the photos of her looking so obviously frail.
'We are glad to have her back, but she doesn't look well and it feels we don't yet have the full picture,' said one cafe owner on the Rock, in his 50s, who asked not to be named.
He admitted that in years past, he like many Monegasques, had expressed frustration at the way Charlene has been less visible than other royals.
'There was a while when there was a sense that she was a reluctant princess,' he said, 'but this is different - there's obviously something not quite right either with her or the marriage and for whatever reason we're not being told what.'
There certainly appears to be a wall of silence around Charlene, especially since she retreated behind the ramparts of the Palace, at least for the time being.
Her Palace press officer said she could not return calls from MailOnline and did not reply to a list of questions we sent her.
Doubts about the central relationship of Monaco's royal family are not new of course.
Several residents living in the narrow medieval alleys of Monaco Ville confirmed to MailOnline that before she left for South Africa Charlene was spending most of her time outside the Palace at the Chocolate factory apartment.
'We often saw her outside the Palace and she would usually be alone or with a bodyguard,' said one source, 'but she was never with Albert - it was obvious she chose to spend most of her time in the apartment rather than the palace.'
Another Monte Carlo source who knows the couple well told MailOnline: 'The way to stop all the friction and put an end to the speculation about their marriage is for Charlene to proudly move back into the Palace and start living like a proper Princess.
'That's what the people of Monaco want, because they love their Royals, and don't want them living separate lives.'
Charlene came in for criticism before she travelled to South Africa for dividing her time between several properties outside the Palais, the official residence of the Sovereign, Albert II.
Instead of enjoying palatial rooms overlooking the Mediterranean, and a domestic staff including butlers and cooks, Charlene chose the Chocolate Factory.
It only had two bedrooms, and had been used in the past by Albert's sister, Princess Stéphanie.
Stéphanie, 56, led an extremely turbulent personal life herself that included two divorces and high-profile affairs with security guards and an elephant trainer.

2010 - Princess Charlene and Prince Albert announce their engagement
2011 - Princess Charlene was said to have bolted two days before the royal wedding after hearing Prince Albert had a third love child during their relationship. It was alleged that Charlene tried to flee home to South Africa three times before her 'arranged marriage', at one point taking refuge inside her country's embassy in Paris.
Monaco officials were said to have coaxed her back by brokering a deal between the Prince and his reluctant bride that she provide him with a legitimate heir. After that she would be free to leave of her own free will.
During the wedding, Charlene was in floods of tears, while her husband looked on impassively. Later in the year, Princess Charlene confessed she felt 'very lonely' in Monaco
2012 - Princess Charlene was reported to be 'depressed' at her failure to provide her husband with a legitimate heir.
2014 - Pregnancy was announced in May. In December Charlene gave birth to twins Princess Gabriella and heir to the throne Prince Jacques.

2020 - Charlene debuts a shocking half-shaved hairstyle. It is announced Prince Albert of Monaco will appear in court in the new year to fight explosive claims he fathered a third love child with a secret girlfriend before marrying his now wife Princess Charlene.
2021 - January 27 - Charlene is pictured with Albert for the Sainte Devote Ceremony in Monaco. It is the last time she has been seen in Monaco this year.
Charlene also escaped Royal protocol by staying at Roc Agel, a mountain retreat on the outskirts of Monaco originally restored for Albert's late mother, the Hollywood star Grace Kelly who became Princess Grace before her tragic death in a car crash on the treacherously steep road approaching Roc Agel.
Charlene was also a frequent visitor to a holiday home owned by friends on the Mediterranean island of Corsica.
Paris Match, the celeb bible, has always had particularly close ties with the Grimaldis – the ancient dynasty now headed by Albert and Charlene.
'Charlene and Albert on the Verge of Breaking Up?' was the lead headline in an edition of Match in August.
'There will be no photo for their 10th anniversary wedding anniversary,' it noted.
All the high-end French publications – the kind that Albert and Charlene would normally grant fawning interviews to – concurred.
The upmarket and very conservative Madame Figaro ran with the stark headline: 'Are Charlene and Albert II of Monaco on the verge of divorce?'
Historian and author Philippe Delorme told the magazine: 'Lots of people got the impression it was an arranged marriage, it's true.
'Albert chose a wife who resembled his mother and Charlene clearly felt very ill at ease in this Grace Kelly role they wanted her to play.
'As Karl Marx put it: History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.'
The 2011 wedding itself was an ostentatious three-day event featuring a concert by the Eagles. But onlookers were concerned by photos of the bride in tears with her husband appearing distant, but Charlene insisted later she was just emotional.
Charlene has been notable by her absence from every single flagship event in the tax haven principality this year.
They have included the Monaco Grand Prix on May 23, and the Fashion Awards hosted by the Princess's own charitable foundation on May 18.
Charlene infamously shaved half her head in the style of a punk rocker last December.
This was seen as the first public sign of a worsening crisis that could end in a multi-million pound divorce.
Charlene's exile in South Africa began a month after it emerged last December that Albert was facing yet another paternity suit.
A Brazilian woman who cannot be named for legal reasons said her 15-year-old daughter was the result of an affair with Albert in 2004.
Albert and Charlene were not yet engaged at this time, but they had known each over for four years after meeting at a swimming gala in Monaco in 2000.
Lawyers for the claimant were scheduled to demand a DNA test from Albert at a court in Milan earlier this year, while his own counsel branded the action 'a hoax'.
Neither party is now commenting, suggesting some kind of generous settlement may have been reached, as happened with Albert's earlier love children.
They are Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, who is now 29 and the result of Albert's affair with an American estate agent, and Alexandre Coste, 17, whose mother is a former Togolese air hostess.
Both children were struck off Monaco's line of succession in return for vast financial settlements.",3
1624,"ONE EVENING in March Emmanuel was in bed, about to doze off. The next moment, armed men burst into his college dormitory in north-west Nigeria and dragged him and 38 other panicked, half-dressed students outside and deep into a forest. “We were tortured,” says Emmanuel. One bandit would film as others beat the screaming students, who were forced to call their parents to demand a total ransom of 500m naira ($1.2m). Emmanuel’s father sold his car to find the cash.
“Security [in Nigeria] is at its worst since the civil war,” says Cheta Nwanze of SBM Intelligence, a consultancy in Lagos. This is a startling claim. The Biafran war of 1967-70, when the Igbos of the oil-rich south-east tried but failed to secede from Nigeria, claimed an estimated 1m lives. Since then, Nigeria has held together. The country of 200m people has had mountains of problems, from corruption and ethnic strife to a string of military dictators. But it has been democratic since 1999. And parts of it are thriving, especially in the south-west. Lagos, the commercial capital, is home to vigorous banks, a hip technology scene and a flourishing film industry, Nollywood.

Yet Mr Nwanze is right. Much of the country is sliding towards ungovernability. A jihadist insurgency in the north-east is spreading. Rebellion is brewing once more in the south-east. And across most of the country rich and poor alike live in fear of kidnappers, warlords or cattle rustlers. Even the sea provides no haven: the Gulf of Guinea is the world’s hotspot for piracy.
The country is growing ever harder to live or work in. The share of adults who tell Gallup that they want to emigrate for good has risen from 41% in 2012 to 48% in 2018. Among the young, a clear majority wish to leave. Shell, an oil giant that was long Nigeria’s biggest foreign investor, and which stuck around during the grimmest years of military rule, recently said it would pull out of its onshore oil operations, citing the threat of violence. The army has now been deployed to every one of Nigeria’s 36 states, says Mr Nwanze.
Nigeria is not yet a failed state, but large parts of it are failing. This matters not only because one sub-Saharan African in six is Nigerian. The country also has Africa’s largest economy, whose dreadful performance holds the continent back. And its conflicts are spilling across borders, destabilising fragile neighbours such as Niger and Chad and amplifying the jihadist threat across the Sahel.
Nigeria’s instability is largely born of poor governance. Britain, the colonial power, lumped together many groups in one country: Muslims in the north, Christians in the south, numerous and overlapping ethnic groups in different regions. Politics has long been a tussle to grab petrodollars, the source of about half of government revenues. All groups gripe that they are short-changed. Most are right—a corrupt elite grabs a huge portion, leaving only scraps for ordinary Nigerians of any group. Since politics is the swiftest route to wealth, it is a violent business, cursed by candidates who drum up ethnic or religious strife to win support.
What has changed in recent years is that the government has grown so rotten that it struggles to control wide swathes of territory. To understand how, start in the north-east. In 2009 a jihadist insurgency erupted there. The jihadists called themselves Boko Haram (“Western education is sinful”). They were fed up with predatory government, eager to establish a theocracy, and not averse to seizing loot and women. Their insurgency has directly cost some 35,000 lives, plus another 314,000 from war-induced disease and hunger, estimates the UN. In 2015 they nearly captured Maiduguri, the biggest city in the north-east. A force of mercenaries, reinforced by Nigeria’s army, pushed them back into isolated swamps and forests.
Muhammadu Buhari, a former general and military ruler, was elected president that year after vowing to restore peace. Alas, he has failed. Over the past six years the jihadists have regrouped in the countryside, hoisting their black flags over village after village. They are once more threatening Maiduguri, this time under the banner of Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), an offshoot of Boko Haram that now outguns it.
ISWAP is “much more dangerous” to the Nigerian state, says Vincent Foucher of the International Crisis Group (ICG), a Brussels-based think-tank. The number of Nigerian soldiers being killed by jihadists is rising. Their morale is falling. The fight is not entirely one-sided. Nigeria claimed this week that one of ISWAP’s leaders, Abu Musab al-Barnawi, is dead. Officials gave no specifics, however, and have a habit of claiming to have killed jihadists who turn out still to be alive.
The Nigerian government also boasts that thousands of Boko Haram insurgents have recently surrendered. Yet this is because of fighting between Boko Haram and ISWAP, rather than successes by Nigeria’s army, says Mr Foucher. Despite having similar aims, the groups hate each other.

Nigeria’s unofficial strategy now seems to be to contain the jihadists, rather than defeat them. The government has deployed enough force to control the biggest towns and escort convoys along the main roads, but not enough to hold, much less govern, the smaller towns and villages. The army is thinly stretched. Trying to pacify the north-east is only one of its problems.
This year more people were killed by criminal gangs in the north-west than by jihadists in the north-east. Bandits, as they are known, roar into villages on motorbikes to steal cattle and anything else of value. They threaten to torch houses unless villagers pay protection money. They murder anyone suspected of being a snitch. In Zamfara state in June bandits shot dead 41 farmers as they were planting crops. The governor of neighbouring Katsina state told voters not to rely on the police or army to protect them but to fight back “even with your teeth”.
Violence begets violence. One 42-year-old former bandit says he lived in an area where a long-running ethnic conflict pitted Hausa farmers against Fulani nomadic herders. After gunmen stole his cows, he became a bandit. “We were left with nothing, so we went and joined them—we kidnapped people.” He and some of his gang took up an amnesty offer from the state government, but some have already gone back to banditry, he says.
No sanctuary
Kidnappers have made life perilous in much of Nigeria. In July gunmen shot up a hospital in Kaduna and kidnapped ten people, including two babies. In August, audacious bandits attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy, killing two soldiers and grabbing a major.
A startling 1,400 schoolchildren and students have been kidnapped this year. After one such incident in September, schools and markets were closed across Zamfara. The government also shut telephone networks and imposed a curfew. All told, about 1m Nigerian students are out of school because of insecurity. Most of the rest are nervous. A security guard at a university in south-west Nigeria checked the boot of your correspondent’s taxi. It is “in case we kidnapped students”, explained the driver.
The army is trying to fight back, especially in Zamfara. But it often does so indiscriminately—for example, by calling in air strikes. “One of our greatest fears,” says Emmanuel, the kidnap victim mentioned at the beginning of this article, was “being bombed by our own government.”

The war on banditry is not going well. Twice as many people were kidnapped in the first nine months of this year as in all of 2020, reckons José Luengo-Cabrera, a security analyst (see chart). Driving between cities is dangerous. Abdulkareem Baba Aminu, a former newspaper editor, is still haunted by an evening three years ago when flashlights flagged him down and ill-dressed men in army uniforms suddenly blocked the road in front of him. He hit the accelerator, let the car take the bullets, and somehow escaped. Politicians are furiously lobbying airlines to add flights so they can fly to their home states from Abuja, the capital, rather than brave the bandit-infested roads.
Nigeria’s third big security threat is in the south-east, where separatists want to revive Biafra, a would-be state inhabited largely by Igbos (about a sixth of Nigeria’s population). Many Igbos feel neglected and ill treated by the central government—as do most Nigerians. The main separatist group, the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), calls for a Biafra that includes all Nigeria’s main oil-producing states, even those where Igbos are a minority.
The rest of Nigeria will not let one group walk off with all the oil, any more than it did half a century ago. Still, blood is being spilt in pursuit of this fantasy. Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB’s leader, grew popular with inflammatory radio broadcasts denouncing “all those who delight in shedding the blood of Biafrans”. In December he launched an armed wing. That was followed by attacks in the south-east on police stations, electoral-commission offices and a prison, from which 1,800 inmates escaped. Mr Kanu claims his red-beret-wearing fighters are not attacking the state but defending Igbos against Fulani herders—a debatable claim.
Security forces raided Mr Kanu’s house in 2017, leaving its walls riddled with bullet holes. (The army denies it was behind the raid.) In June the government arrested him abroad and flew him to Abuja. That is a blow to IPOB—few can match his charisma or fundraising prowess—yet his followers remain defiant. They have threatened to “handle” those they hold responsible for his arrest, naming a federal minister and a state governor. If his trial is seen as unfair, Igbos will feel even more aggrieved.
After Mr Kanu’s arrest IPOB told followers to stay at home in protest every Monday. Later, it told them to protest just on days when Mr Kanu was to appear in court. Even so, streets in the region have been eerily quiet on Mondays. Those who venture out have sometimes been killed. A survey by SBM Intelligence found that just 25% of people in the south-east opposed the stay-at-home protests.
IPOB supporters are easy to find in the south-east. They want to “wipe us out” but “we are not mosquitoes” to be swatted, shouts Kelvin, a 36-year-old, gesturing angrily at nearby soldiers. “If Nigeria doesn’t want to leave, if they want violence, we will go for violence.” Ferocious security crackdowns drive young men to join the rebels. In May Usman Baba, now Nigeria’s inspector-general of police, told officers going after IPOB that “if anyone accuses you of human-rights violation, the report will come to my table and you know what I will do. So…kill them all.”
Seun Bakare of Amnesty International, a watchdog, estimates that the police and army have killed hundreds of young Igbos. The senate minority leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, an Igbo, says “elements of the federal government” want to commit genocide. This is surely hyperbole, but Mr Buhari does little to dispel it. Earlier this year he alluded to the civil war and threatened to treat Igbo rebels in “language they understand”. The danger is that young men will hear such fighting talk and conclude that fighting is their only choice. “Nobody sits down and says I want war,” says Osita Chidoka, a south-easterner who was aviation minister in the previous administration. “But sometimes just playing with fire can lead to an explosion.”
Even in the south-west, the most prosperous part of Nigeria (bar the capital), separatist feelings are starting to spread. At a rally a few months ago, Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba separatist, clambered onto the roof of a truck, surrounded by thousands of raucous fans, and repeated his demand for independence. The next step, he said, is “entering the bush to chase away these Fulani herders”, perhaps a veiled reference to Mr Buhari, whose father was Fulani. In July security forces swooped on Mr Igboho’s house at night, killing two of his guards. Mr Igboho escaped. The security forces reportedly took away his cats, in case he had turned into a tabby. It seems not; weeks later he was seized in neighbouring Benin. As his lawyers fought extradition, protesters marched in Ibadan, one of the biggest cities of the south-west.
Not single spies but in battalions
These disparate crises are in some ways connected. Climate change has pushed Muslim Fulani herders farther south, where they clash with settled farmers of other faiths and ethnic groups. Such clashes have claimed thousands of lives since 2018. Some herders have turned to kidnapping. Igbo and Yoruba separatists justify taking up arms by playing up the dangers posed by some Fulani herders.
A mixture of neglect and sporadic brutality by the government makes matters worse. Boko Haram became more extreme after its original leader, Muhammad Yusuf, was shot dead while in police custody. The arrest in 2015 of Mr Kanu raised his profile. After a raid on his house in 2017, IPOB grew more violent. With each tit-for-tat, “Pandora’s box creaks open a little wider,” says Matthew Page of Chatham House, a think-tank in London.
A dire economy makes taking up arms more tempting. In 2019 some 80m Nigerians lived on less than $2 a day. More than half of Nigerians are unemployed or underemployed. Food inflation is 21%. Bad policies, such as closing land borders to goods entirely in 2019 in the hope of spurring local production, have deepened the pain. The government has made little effort to wean itself off oil, or to prepare for a future when cleaner forms of energy ultimately replace it.
The violence, in turn, deepens the economic crisis. Mallam Dauda sells bags of grain from his perch on a plastic chair at a market in Zamfara. These days some farmers have nothing to sell, he frets. “Some were chased away from their villages and others have been denied access to their farms,” he explains. Now the government has closed markets across Zamfara, too.
With so many forces pulling Nigeria apart, some may wonder how it has held together. One reason is that most Nigerians feel a strong sense of nationalism. “We are stronger together,” says Chukwuemeka, a south-easterner, though he also says that “Buhari has put a knife in what unites us.” In some ways, tolerance has improved, polls suggest. In 1990 almost a third of Nigerians said they would object to having a neighbour of a different race or ethnicity. But by 2020 that had fallen to 16%.
Oil-fuelled corruption can foster division, since different groups fight for a slice of unearned wealth. But it also gives elites from all groups a stake in preserving the system. There is “too much corruption among the elites holding Nigeria together” for it to fall apart, says Nnamdi Obasi of the ICG. Non-oil-producing states cannot easily secede because they would lose their share of the petro-pie. Oil states will not be allowed to secede, for the same reason.
Another cause for optimism is that millions of Nigerians still manage to thrive, despite the chaos. Some start businesses to get around the government’s failures. Security firms, unsurprisingly, are booming. So are startups. Lagos boasts three fintech companies worth over $1bn each. Most Nigerians would rather earn a living peacefully than fight.
Yet even countries that seem permanent can fall apart, if the bonds between citizen and state disintegrate. It happened to Yugoslavia. It seems to be happening in Ethiopia, long seen as a model for development in Africa, and perhaps in Cameroon, which had been peaceful for decades before a separatist war forced more than 1m people to flee their homes. It would be complacent to assume that Nigeria is uniquely immune to the poison being injected daily into it by jihadism, separatism and warlordism. “Violence is a slippery slope,”warns Bulama Bukarti of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. “Once one starts getting into it, then nobody knows where it will end.”■

1625,"Boris Johnson is facing mounting Tory unrest over 'unforced errors' today as a poll found nearly two-thirds of the public believe he should apologise for the Owen Paterson shambles.
The PM delivered a mea culpa to his own MPs last night admitting he 'crashed the car' with the extraordinary bid to save the ex-minister by pausing the Commons standards regime.
But research by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for MailOnline found that 63 per cent of the public think he should have said sorry - something he has pointedly refused to do.
Despite the government's 80-strong majority, there are growing signs of discontent on the Conservative benches at the premier's record of blunders and U-turns - which seems to be starting to hit support among voters. 
There appeared to be a thin Tory attendance at the weekly PMQs session yesterday, which is usually an opportunity for raucous shows of support.
And not all MPs turned up last night for votes on triggering a process of reform for rules on conduct and second jobs, which many politicians regard as 'knee-jerk' and impossible to implement.
The government is fending off more Red Wall anger today as HS2 and Northern Powerhouse links to Leeds have been dropped from a huge package of 'Levelling Up' rail improvements.  
One senior Conservative told MailOnline that Mr Johnson needs to mount a charm offensive on the 2019 intake, with fears they have not been integrated into the party due to the pandemic. He has already hosted a drinks reception at No10 in a bid to 'reach out' which is said to have 'gone well'.
'Colleagues are being dragooned into voting in particular ways without consideration of the damage that can be done... There is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with where we are.
'He has burned through political capital and it is unnecessary. When you have to do things that are difficult that is fine.
'But if you fail to spot things that is a problem. They hadn't spotted it and then they panicked.'
The MP said Mr Johnson had made the 'right call' by coming to speak to the Tory backbench 1922 committee last night - but pointed out that only around 150 politicians were there, out of around 365.
'The PM has seen a large number of colleagues but by no means the full parliamentary party,' they said.
'We have got to bring people back together. The PM has already started reaching out, he had the 2019 intake for drinks the other night. He is doing that for all sections of the party basically.
'We haven't been able to go to No10 since the general election really… he wasn't able to do what he would normally do, which is have receptions for colleagues.' 
Redfield & Wilton surveyed 1,500 people online yesterday, with the results weighted to represent the wider population.
A third 'strongly' agreed with the statement that Mr Johnson should have apologised for attempting to change the standards system in response to the Paterson case.
Another 30 per cent agreed - and only 6 per cent disagreed.  
At a private meeting of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee last night, Mr Johnson took responsibility for the Government's botched attempt to get Owen Paterson off the hook after he was found to have broken the rules on paid lobbying.
'On a clear day I crashed the car into a ditch. I will get the car out of the ditch,' he reportedly told the gathering.
In a round of interviews this morning, Deputy PM Dominic Raab conceded that Tories were 'disgrunted' but insisted ministers are committed to 'fixing the problem'. 
Asked on Sky News about discontent within the party, he said there is always 'one or other disgruntled individual' who is prepared to complain anonymously in the media.
Pressed on whether that means there is no general unrest, Mr Raab added: 'Not sure I'd put it in that idyllic way. There's always debate amongst MPs, but the most important thing is we're fixing the problem.'
On Wednesday, the Commons backed Mr Johnson's proposals to ban MPs from taking paid political consultancies and to limit the time they can spend doing second jobs.
However just 297 MPs – fewer than half the total – voted for the motion, with opposition parties abstaining.
Four Tory MPs even voted for a rival Labour motion which would have imposed a clear parliamentary timetable for implementing reform.
Former Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the PM had been poorly advised when it came to reforming the standards system.
He told ITV's Peston: 'It has been a very difficult two weeks and almost everyone involved would agree that it's been handled poorly by the Government and it's damaged the Government to an extent, and it's damaged Parliament as well.
'We need to take action now to restore a degree of public trust in the standards in public life, and what you would expect from a Member of Parliament.'
Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said there is a lack of urgency from the Government when it comes to dealing with the issue.
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning: 'The problem with the amendment from the Government which was passed yesterday is that there is no timetable.
'It wasn't a binding vote and, as a result, I just fear it is going to be kicked further into the long grass rather than the fundamental reform that people want and need to see now to restore confidence in our parliamentary democracy.
'I think that public service and being an MP is something that I am proud of and I think most MPs are, but at the moment you don't feel that proud. People look at MPs and just think it is just mired in sleaze.
'I think we need to sort this out quickly to restore the reputation of Parliament.
'It seems that Government just don't have that sense of urgency about restoring people's faith and trust in our parliamentary democracy.' 
Mr Johnson's appearance before the 1922 Committee was the culmination of weeks of pressure following the fiasco over the attempt to save Mr Paterson from suspension.
The former Cabinet minister had been found to have breached lobbying rules by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards but a Government-backed amendment attempted to save him from suspension and overhaul the whole standards process.
The Government U-turned on the idea after a backlash and Mr Paterson resigned as an MP, but the saga kicked off a deep dive into standards in public life, with a focus on second jobs.
Appearing before the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday, Mr Johnson admitted the initial effort to shield Mr Paterson had been an error.
'The intention genuinely was not to exonerate anybody, the intention was to see whether there was some way in which, on a cross-party basis, we could improve the system,' he said.
'In retrospect it was obviously, obviously mistaken to think we could conflate the two things and do I regret that decision? Yes I certainly do.'",3
1626,"NOBODY LIKES a call from the taxman. Donald Rumsfeld, who as America’s defence secretary oversaw a budget bigger than the economy of a typical country, nonetheless finds the rules so confusing that he writes to the Internal Revenue Service each year complaining that he has “no idea” whether he has filed his taxes correctly. So it is hardly surprising that, when the phone rings and an official-sounding voice says you have underpaid your taxes and will be connected to an adviser to pay the balance, ordinary folk tremble.
It is, however, invariably a scam. Few tax authorities call individuals about their taxes. If you are lucky, they will send you a letter a year later, to the wrong address. They will certainly not menace you, as bogus calls often do, with the threat of arrest if you do not stump up the cash right now.

Such scams have become vastly more common. Phone calls from tricksters claiming to be taxmen almost doubled in number last year, according to UK Finance, a trade association of banks. Other countries show increases at least as dramatic.
Even as rates of most crimes remain low in rich countries, the spectacular growth of cyber-crime—crime committed mostly or entirely by digital means—stands out. According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, the best indicator of long-term trends in Britain, in 2019 there were 3.8m incidents of fraud, mostly online, representing a third of all crimes committed. That figure has increased every year since 2017 when the government started collecting data. Around 7% of all adults were victims. Three-quarters lost money, and 15% lost more than £1,000 ($1,390). In America the number of reported cases of internet fraud increased by 69% last year. Reported losses there (excluding bank or credit-card fraud) reached $4.2bn, three times higher than in 2017.
Other kinds of internet-enabled crime are growing too. Computer-enabled spam phone calls and text messages, typically trying to defraud people, extract billions of dollars a year. Illegal gambling websites, many of which steal from their customers, have multiplied. And new technology makes many old-fashioned crimes easier to perpetrate. Drug-dealers use Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, to take payments and move money around. They rely on specialised criminal encrypted-communications software to organise their affairs. “There is no serious organised crime that does not have a digital component,” says Nigel Leary of Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA).
Most significant over the past year is the growth in “ransomware”—hacking attacks where victims’ files are locked up until money is paid. Such attacks were once crude. Ransomware arrived in spam emails and targeted ordinary people’s computers. The sums demanded were often small, to encourage people to pay up.
These days hackers focus on large organisations and demand big ransoms (see chart). Malicious software is injected into specific computer systems. It steals data before locking them. A ransom is then demanded to unlock the files or, increasingly, to prevent them from being leaked (backups of important data are common now). It is almost always in Bitcoin. Chainalysis, a cyber-security firm, says the amount paid in Bitcoin ransoms increased by 311% last year compared with 2019, to around $350m. Victims are usually businesses but more and more include governments and their departments, including the police. On April 27th Washington DC’s coppers revealed that they had been hit by hackers, who say they will expose police informants to gangs if the authorities do not pay up.

Ransomware is “the single biggest threat” in the organised-crime world, says Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Sussex who advises Europol, the EU’s police agency. On April 29th Alejandro Mayorkas, America’s secretary of homeland security, described it as “a threat to national security”. The damage is enormous. Maersk, a global shipping company, wrote down $300m in losses related to a ransomware attack in 2017. Travelex, a British currency trader, collapsed last year, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. An attack that took its systems down at the end of 2019 was partly to blame. Despite coughing up 285 Bitcoin—then worth around $2.3m—the firm lost about £25m that quarter. It attributed most of that to the attack.
Ransoms can be eye-watering: an attack in March on the Broward County school system, which includes Fort Lauderdale in Florida, came with a demand for $40m in Bitcoin. In messages leaked by the hackers, one of the district’s negotiators was incredulous: “You cannot possibly think we have anything close to this.”
Most government bodies do not. But the consequences of not paying can be just as costly. In Baltimore County, in Maryland, schools had to stop online teaching last year for several days after their systems were locked by a ransomware attack. In 2019 an attack on the neighbouring City of Baltimore cost its taxpayers $18m. During the pandemic, hospitals have been hit, too. France reported 27 attacks on hospitals last year, as part of a 255% increase in ransomware attacks generally. Medical treatments have been delayed in Germany and America because of attacks.
Bitcoin buccaneers
The criminals who do it are a mixed bunch. Many seem to be based in Russia, other parts of eastern Europe, or China. In Russia and Belarus, cyber-criminals thrive because the state tolerates them, as long as they scam only foreigners. Some reportedly have links to the security services.
But cyber-criminals do not seem to operate in tightly organised crime groups, like drug cartels or mafias. Their strength comes from their decentralisation. Individual elements of each crime are provided as a service to organisers. One lot may write and sell the software. Others may get it into targets’ computers. Others may collect and launder the ransom. And a few kingpins may finance the entire operation. And yet they may never know each other’s names or locations.
Crimes such as bank robbery used to be artisanal, says the NCA’s Mr Leary. Big jobs like the Brink’s-Mat robbery of 1983, when gold, diamonds and cash worth £26m (£100m in today’s money) were stolen from a warehouse at Heathrow airport in London, required a large specialist staff who all knew and trusted one another. These days large-scale crime is being industrialised by technology. “The barriers to entry are really very low,” says Mr Leary.
That is largely because an entire internet infrastructure has developed to facilitate attacks. Cryptocurrency is key. Ransomware criminals like to use Bitcoin, says Kemba Walden, a lawyer with Microsoft’s digital-crimes unit because it is very liquid and relatively anonymous. The end recipient is anonymous unless his real-world identity can be connected to his virtual address. Criminals can trade Bitcoin between themselves. Cashing out their earnings into real money is risky; in most rich countries Bitcoin exchanges apply strict “know your customer” requirements. But it is not impossible. Some exchanges in less-regulated countries apply looser criteria. And coins can be “tumbled”—swapped between cryptocurrencies by money-launderers—to conceal their origins, and then sold on well-regulated exchanges. In Russia and China “it’s just incredibly difficult” to trace stolen money, says Ms Walden.
Other technological innovations are vital, too. SIMboxes, which allow people to “spoof” (conceal the origin of) phone calls, are sold for legitimate purposes, to marketing firms, for example. But they also allow criminals to spam people or communicate without revealing their location. TOR, softwarewhich anonymises internet connections by bouncing data around the world, lets the “dark web” thrive, hosting the forums on which criminals anonymously trade their wares. “Bulletproof hosting”—server farms with a high level of security and privacy—operate like virtual safe houses, where compromising data can be moved off at a moment’s notice, invariably before the police are able to get to it.

What is the future of such crime? As ransomware has grown, so has the industry promising to protect firms from it. The crime is “becoming more high-profile”, says Michael Levi of Cardiff University, because of attacks such as the one on Maersk. Organisations are trying to buttress their defences. But many do not want to report hacking attempts or fraud. Data breaches are not only damaging in themselves; they are embarrassing, too. Individuals rarely think to report cyber-crimes to the police. The costs may be borne indirectly. Banks and insurers will often compensate people for losses. Security is improving but the crimes are increasingly profitable.
The police fret that more traditional criminals are moving into cyber-crime, and vice versa. “Now the dark web is used for the commodity trade [fencing of stolen goods], the drugs trade and firearms,” says Mr Leary. In raids in Belgium in March police seized 28 tonnes of cocaine, as well as cash, guns, police uniforms and a torture chamber in a shipping container. The criminals had reportedly been using Sky ECC, an encrypted phone network sold by a Canadian firm. The phones were seemingly designed to hide criminal activity, with end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages and no GPS data. Subscriptions were paid in Bitcoin. That gave them a great deal of anonymity—at least until European police forces managed to inject their own malware into the phones to spy on them.
Governments are starting to take cyber-crime more seriously. America’s Justice Department has appointed a team to tackle ransomware. The “five eyes” allies—America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand—are sharing intelligence on it. But there is a long way to go. In Britain only one in 200 police officers focuses on fraud, despite its outsized footprint, according to figures revealed through the Freedom of Information Act by the Times newspaper.
And the opportunities are growing. In the past six months the value of the world’s Bitcoin has soared to over $1trn. That surge of liquidity makes it even easier to hide crime. And as Mr Woodward puts it: “Why would you walk into a bank with a sawn-off shotgun to steal £30,000 when, if you’ve got some money to invest, you can go on the dark web and start a ransomware campaign and make millions?” ■

1627," (CNN Business)Entering the new Amazon Web Services Skills Center is a bit like walking into a high-tech museum. Among its exhibits are a rotating, globe-shaped screen that displays images of planets or weather patterns, an interactive ""smart home"" model and a table full of small robot vehicles trained by machine learning.  The space is designed to introduce visitors to practical applications of cloud computing — an increasingly popular set-up in which companies' technical operations are run in data centers managed by Amazon or other cloud companies, rather than in costly on-site servers. AWS hopes the center will interest some visitors in the possibility of a career in the industry. The Skills Center, which is located on Amazon's corporate headquarters campus in Seattle, Washington, and opens to the public November 22, is the first of its kind for the company. It's part of a larger commitment to train 29 million people globally in cloud computing by 2025 that AWS made last year.  It's also one of the first major announcements that new AWS chief executive Adam Selipsky has made since taking over from Andy Jassy, who was elevated to Amazon CEO when Jeff Bezos left the post in July. The Skills Center is ""going to be a free, accessible space for anybody who wants to learn more about cloud computing, what it is, what the applications are ... everything that illustrates the true breadth of the cloud, and importantly, there's going to be a lot of skills training here,"" Selipsky told CNN Business in an exclusive interview ahead of the center's opening.""There's a dramatic need for digital skills overall, and for cloud skills in particular, and this is part of a very broad effort,"" he said. ""We're going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to bring that training to tens of millions of people worldwide.""  Although the company declined to disclose an exact amount, it's a big investment into free training for people who will mostly become employees of other companies. But it's crucial to AWS's business because of a significant talent gap that threatens to hamper potential customers' adoption of cloud technology.""I have that conversation with executives of companies all the time,"" said Maureen Lonergan, vice president of AWS Training and Certification. ""So we work not only on training new people to cloud but working with customers to transform their traditional IT staff to cloud-fluent individuals.""  The talent gap comes as demand for cloud computing has surged during the pandemic. But AWS, long the cloud industry leader, is facing steep competition from rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOGLGOOGLE) Cloud, something Selipsky will have to address as the unit's new leader.  Though Amazon (AMZN) is best known for e-commerce, its cloud unit has long been its biggest money maker. In the most recent quarter, AWS contributed nearly 56% of the company's overall net income, and it now has a revenue run rate of around $64 billion. ""The cloud is actually one of the most transformative technological changes of our generation,"" said Selipsky, who started at AWS in the division's early days and spent 11 years with the company before leaving to run data visualization firm Tableau for five years. ""I know that sounds like a big statement but if you think about, when is the last time you went to rent a DVD or incurred late fees? Netflix changed all of that by streaming and that happens on AWS ... No matter what sector you look at, no matter what application you look at, it's now more and more not running in data centers that companies build and operate and put capital into and stress out about, it operates through a place like AWS."" At the Skills Center, Amazon plans to invite anyone from the Seattle community — students, unemployed workers or others looking for a career change — to get a better sense of what cloud computing is and why it matters; for example, it makes real-time, mobile gaming over the internet possible. From there, visitors interested in career opportunities in the field will have access to free tech and cloud basics courses at the center, and may be directed to AWS's other training resources. The company hopes tens of thousands of people will visit the center to explore or take classes each year. As part of Thursday's announcement, the company also said it will add around 60 free, digital cloud computing training and certification courses to Amazon.com. It is also expanding access to its Re/Start program, a free 12-week training course that prepares people for an entry level job in cloud computing, from 25 cities in 12 countries in 2020 to more than 95 cities in 38 countries by the end of 2021. The company expects to open more Skills Centers around the world starting next year, according to Lonergan.The company also hopes to reach people who have had a harder time accessing roles in tech. The Skills Center and the training programs are free and target people who don't have prior experience in tech. The company also plans to partner with local workforce development agencies in Seattle to bring people from diverse backgrounds into the facility. That effort could help increase diversity in the cloud computing field, which, like the larger tech world, still skews white and male. Amazon's own global corporate staff was comprised of nearly 69% men and 47% white employees in 2020, according to its most recent workforce data report.  ""Our customers are so incredibly diverse and who they are, and their use cases and their industries, and the companies in which they operate are so diverse, it's hard to imagine that we could really deliver what they need from us if we are not equally diverse,"" Selipsky said.

1628,"BAD FOR shop assistants, good for shoppers. That is the obvious inference from the upheaval in retailing that is leaving shopping malls and high streets, and millions of low-income jobs, surplus to requirements, yet panders to the consumer’s craving for convenience. It is, though, an oversimplification. Retail-related jobs will change but not disappear. And shoppers must make uncomfortable choices about privacy and the exploitation of data.
Start with jobs. In America and Europe, retailing is a huge employer, especially of women and young people. The National Retail Federation, an industry body, says retailers are the largest private-sector employers in America, engaging 32m. In the EU about one in six workers have retail or wholesale jobs. Even before covid-19, the rise of e-commerce, retail bankruptcies and shop closures were leading to job losses. Lockdowns during the pandemic exacerbated that. In America 2.4m retail jobs were shed in March and April 2020. By January just 2m had been recovered. Yet many lost jobs are offset by e-commerce-related employment as warehouse workers, couriers and grocery pickers. America’s Bureau of Labour Statistics says jobs in transport and warehousing grew by more than 500,000 in the seven months to December. Amazon alone added that number last year. The Progressive Policy Institute, a think-tank, says industries related to e-commerce created 900,000 more jobs between the end of 2007 and the start of 2020 than those lost at bricks-and-mortar stores.

The prospects of moving to sorting and packing jobs rather than shelf-stacking and folding ones will be little consolation for many. Warehouses may be stuck on the edge of cities, far from traditional shops and supermarkets. They offer less direct connection with the public. They may be more physically demanding and involve relentless, soul-sapping targets. Workers may need retraining. And worker organisations are rare. Amazon has resisted efforts by its American employees to unionise, though this month those at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, are voting on whether to become the first in America to join a union.

At least wages have risen. In America Amazon and others have pushed minimum pay to at least $15 an hour. Yet higher labour costs may tempt companies to replace workers with robots. A digitised retail industry raises demand for higher-skilled labour, but lowers it for entry-level workers. Jobs like delivery and grocery-picking may be outsourced to gig-economy workers, whose livelihoods depend precariously on customer ratings and reviews.
For the lucky minority still working in shops, the job may become more stimulating. That is because more tasks, from ringing up the till to showing the way to the nappy aisle, will be automated, leaving employees to offer more valuable services aimed at winning repeat customers. As Nilam Ganenthiran of Instacart says, workers whose jobs used to involve showing people where the pasta sauces are now advise on what types of pasta to make. Mark Pilkington, a former lingerie retailer whose book “Retail Recovery” will soon be published, says retail workers will need the skills of a stylist or an actor to advise shoppers what to wear and how to look fabulous, so that they return to the store. “A good stylist is cheaper than a good therapist,” he quips.
As automation increases, retailers will have to fight for tech talent. Eric Shea of Accenture, a consultancy, says the industry has had a “bad rap” and struggles to compete for employees with big-tech firms. So it needs to create “hubs” of digital experimentation away from the mothership. Instacart’s army of software engineers create tools to sell to supermarkets to automate their operations, so they do not have to build their own. The bifurcation between fast-paced warehousing jobs and creative customer-service ones is essential to make online shopping more efficient and in-store shopping more fun. Both aim at making customers feel they are truly king. No doubt the richer they are, the more regally they will be treated. Yet there is a bargain involved that shoppers are only just understanding. They pay by sharing data with retailers.
Data junkies
Data are the building-blocks of the retail renaissance. By one estimate, the volume of retail data globally is expected to rise from 33trn gigabytes in 2018 to 175trn by 2025. Until recently, stores made a hash of assimilating it. Even when they had an online presence, rivalry between physical and digital sides of the business meant information was not shared. Manufacturers had little information about customers, so no incentive to personalise. And retailers kept few tabs on what people did in their stores. As Mr Pilkington says, the irony is they would pay Facebook and Google to recruit customers online, yet let them walk free through their shops without collecting data on them. 
Loyalty cards were a step forward. Retail apps are the new way for retailers to connect with shoppers. These provide information on shoppers’ habits, either online or in-store. They inform decisions on what stock to carry. In some cases, they may alert manufacturers what goods to produce. Yet if shoppers feel their privacy is violated, they may react with outrage. Tools that can destroy trust if handled badly include location-tracking, facial and voice recognition, and voice-activated assistants who recommend products to buy in a biased way. Schemes common in China, such as community group-buy, may prove offputting in the West if shoppers are encouraged to persuade friends to join them in making purchases by social media. Data theft is a big problem.
A paper in the Journal of Retailing, an academic journal, by Kelly Martin of Colorado State University and others, suggests ways to enhance data privacy. It highlights the importance of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation and California’s Consumer Privacy Act, as well as China’s new privacy standard, the personal information security specification (though it says Chinese shoppers worry about the government keeping their data safe). It also says firms should guarantee privacy protection as a sales strategy.
Retailers fret that, as Facebook and Google deepen their involvement in commerce, questions about the use of personal data will grow. But it is hard to put the genie back in the bottle. This is a data-driven economy, and for the retail renaissance to flourish, shoppers must feel confident that personal information is in good hands. As Mr Shea of Accenture puts it, customers once pledged loyalty to the retailer. Now it is the other way round. ■",1
1629,"NORTH KOREA is not the only supposed success story in Asia’s fight against covid-19. In the middle of the continent, on the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan too has seemingly managed to go the past two years without a single recorded infection. Under President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov (pictured) its lucky citizens have been living in an “Era of Might and Happiness”. What is more, their president entertains them too, roaring around in racing cars, scoring bullseyes on the rifle range and catching whoppers on fishing expeditions. The economy is said to have grown some 6% last year. The country’s 6m people are prospering.
That, at any rate, is the official picture. The reality is quite different. Wage arrears are rife. The black-market value of the manat, the country’s currency, is a seventh of the official rate. Even the usually upbeat president has fretted about Turkmenistan’s swelling debt, though its precise scale is kept secret. The Asian Development Bank reckons GDP grew a modest 1.6% in 2020 as energy prices slumped and Chinese demand for natural gas fell. Gas accounts for 90% of Turkmenistan’s exports; China for 80% of its trade.

Exports have bounced back with the recent surge in demand for natural gas, but an inflexible contract with China has prevented Turkmenistan from reaping the full rewards of skyrocketing prices. The Taliban’s takeover of neighbouring Afghanistan has made even more unlikely already stalled plans to build a pipeline to carry gas to new markets in South Asia. The militants say they want the pipeline to go ahead, but few foreign backers are keen.
Though the government’s propagandists try their best to present the country as a land of plenty, Turkmenistanis are all too aware of the real state of the economy. State television shows shops with overflowing shelves, but “in reality people go at 4-5am to queue at state food shops,” says Farid Tukhbatullin, who heads the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR), an advocacy group based in Vienna. Most citizens dare not complain “because they fear the person next to them could be an informer”, he says.
People who do question the official line are harassed by security men. Soltan Achilova, a 72-year-old journalist in Ashgabat, the capital, who earlier this year publicly criticised the government for shortages of flour and cooking oil, which are subsidised, has faced threats, attacks and arrest as a result of her reports to Chronicles of Turkmenistan, TIHR’s news website.
Last year a young man named Nurgeldi Halykov was jailed after sharing with Turkmen.news, an independent news outlet based in the Netherlands, a photo on Instagram that drew attention to a visiting delegation from the UN’s World Health Organisation. Officials continued to deny covid was present even after the British ambassador caught it last year. “Turkmenistan never fails,” the editor of Turkmen.news, Ruslan Myatiev, notes wryly. Social-media networks and news websites are blocked. Police surveil mobile phones for software that can circumvent such censorship. Turkmenistanis cannot even access Zoom.
Such heavy-handed repression has kept Mr Berdymukhamedov, who styles himself Arkadag (“The Protector”), in power since 2007, nearly half of Turkmenistan’s existence as an independent state. Yet the absence of credible information also causes wild rumours to circulate, such as when the president, whose health is said to be failing, disappeared from public view in 2019. Many Turkmenistanis believed he was dead.
Earlier this year Mr Berdymukhamedov appointed his 40-year-old son, Serdar, as deputy prime minister answerable only to the president. Two months later the younger Berdymukhamedov was made head of the country’s horse association. The local Akhal-Teke horses and Alabai dogs play an important role in the president’s personality cult. Photographs aired this summer showing Serdar astride a thoroughbred, a gift from his father, again fuelled speculation among Turkmenistanis about a coming succession. A dynasty appears to be in the offing.■",1
1630,"EVERYONE WANTS to be a little bit Danish. Hygge, a sense of Nordic contentment attained via baking, candles and good company, became the philosophy du jour during lockdown. Danish dramas win garlands, while its comedies contain jokes so enjoyably dark that viewers may worry about finding themselves on a Europol watch list. Even Danish semen has become a booming export, thanks to the country’s combination of liberal rules for donors and reputation as a small nation of tall hunks.
But it is the Danish labour system that attracts the most plaudits. Leftists drool over a model that sees burger flippers in McDonald’s paid the equivalent of $22 per hour. Those on the right marvel that the country has no statutory minimum wage. Instead, employers and stakeholders sit down together and hammer out collective agreements that cover most workers. It is the same in neighbouring Sweden. Employees benefit from wages and benefits that are among the most generous on the continent; employers can hire or fire with ease during boom or bust. Denmark and its Scandi neighbours manage to be both a worker’s paradise and a capitalist’s dream.

Telling Scandinavians how to run a labour market is akin to teaching the French how to bake baguettes. Yet this is the position in which the Nordic countries have found themselves. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, wants all workers to be covered by a minimum wage, whether through national law (as in most of the club) or through collective agreements (as in Scandinavia). Proposals that will see the topic of minimum wages dragged into EU law are being negotiated among MEPs and national governments.
At first glance, Denmark and Sweden have little to worry about. A common minimum wage is not on the table. Indeed, that would be impossible for a club that includes Luxembourg, whose minimum wage is €2,202 per month ($2,550) and Bulgaria, where it is €332. According to the EU’s own treaties, only national governments can set a minimum wage. Indeed, the commission came to praise the Scandinavian system, not to bury it. It would rather everyone looked a bit more like Sweden or Denmark, with collective agreements galore.
Instead, the commission wants to shape how national governments guarantee decent wages, rather than to set their level. Under its proposals, countries would still be in charge of the details. Those with statutory minimum wages would be forced to ensure these are adequate when measured against average incomes. For those without a minimum wage, a group which includes Italy, Austria, Cyprus and Finland as well as the Scandinavian duo, the commission wants at least 70% of workers to be covered by collective agreements—a hurdle that the Scandinavians already meet.
Yet the Scandinavian duo are still fretting, and with some cause. All legislation comes with unintended consequences, particularly at the European level, where the European Court of Justice is a player as much as a referee. In Sweden about 60% of collective agreements do not include a minimum wage, points out German Bender, an analyst from Arena Idé, a Swedish think-tank. With EU law now encompassing minimum-wage rules, legal challenges would become possible. And peculiar things can happen. A case in the 1960s involving an unpaid electricity bill worth a few lira ended up establishing the primacy of EU law, which means EU rules trump national ones if the two clash. The so-called “no bailout” clause in the EU’s treaties did little to stop a series of bail-outs. A single judgment might upend the Nordic labour model.
When proposals start rolling, they are tricky to stop. Employment legislation gets agreed by a qualified majority of governments, so vetoes do not apply. Usually, though, the EU avoids topics that are sacred to national governments. Pleas that legislating—rather than issuing suggestions—on minimum wages violates the Scandinavian principle of no government interference in wage-setting fell on deaf ears. Denmark and Sweden “yellow-carded” the proposal for a directive on minimum wages, a formal protest, but to no avail. In the EU’s ministerial council, where national governments haggle over a position, the lawyers say it is perfectly legal. The French government, which will shepherd negotiations on the topic from January, is keen to get it done sharpish.
Beyond the bare minimum
New rules on minimum wages are only the beginning of a wider push on workers’ rights at the EU level. Laws to make pay transparent have been put forward by the commission. Proposals on how countries must treat “platform workers”—such as Deliveroo riders and Uber drivers—are in the works. For some it is a welcome shift in EU policy. During the austerity years governments were to be lean and mean. Angela Merkel was fond of noting that the EU was 7% of the world’s population, a quarter of its economy, but about half of all its welfare spending. Today, the tune has changed. Generous welfare states and high worker protections were once held to be the cause of the EU’s woes; now they are the solution.
For the Scandinavians, this shift is cause for concern. Their system is not broken, yet the EU insists on fixing it. There is little scope for dodging the legislation. Denmark has an opt-out on the euro, as well as on European laws on justice and home affairs. Sweden is in theory obliged to join the euro eventually, but uses a loophole to cling on to its krona. Such derogations are a thing of the past, however, and of no help in the present case. Europe is no longer à la carte. Systems that work well, such as those of Denmark and Sweden, may have to change in order to help systems that work less well, such as those of Cyprus or Italy. “United in diversity” is the EU’s slogan. But unity increasingly trumps diversity as the EU delves ever further into the lives of its citizens. Everyone wants to be a bit like Denmark. But Denmark may soon start to resemble everywhere else.■",1
1631,"SALTA, Argentina, Sept 14 (Reuters) - In Argentina's remote northern Salta province, the silence of the desert landscape is broken only by the hum of machinery pumping salt-water brine to extract lithium, a sign of accelerating efforts to ride the global electric vehicle boom.
Beneath the South American country's highland salt flats, reached by winding mountain roads, is buried the world's third largest reserve of the ultra-light battery metal, which has seen a price spike over the past year on the back of a global push towards greener modes of transport.
Already the fourth top producer of lithium worldwide, Argentina's national and local governments are now looking to speed up development, held back for years by red tape, high tax rates, rampant inflation and currency controls.
Provinces like Salta are building regional mining logistics nodes and access roads, lowering tax rates and rationalizing confusing rules for the sector to attract investment in the 'white gold' metal.
That has seen a flurry of new activity, deals and plans to ramp up production, which could make Argentina a key player in the electric vehicle supply chain in coming years, with demand from carmakers and buyers like China expected to gain pace.
""Argentina could become the world's leading producer from brines in less than a decade if the flow of projects is followed and maintained,"" David Guerrero Alvarado, a consultant advising Canada's Alpha Lithium (ALLI.V), told Reuters in Salta.
Alpha Lithium is in the investigation stage for a project in the nearby Salar Tolillar, one of many early-stage developments that - while offering promise - need an often long and costly process to be turned into a reality.
With countries around the world scrambling to reduce emissions, rising global lithium demand and surging prices have drawn increased interest in the so-called 'lithium triangle' that spans parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.
In Argentina, mining provinces such as Salta, Jujuy and Catamarca have moved to encourage wary investors, signing an agreement in June to create uniform rules and to ""strengthen infrastructure, legal security and fiscal stability.""
Salta's Secretary of Mining and Energy, Flavia Royon, told Reuters the province could produce 200,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent annually by 2025, after flicking though a list of upcoming lithium developments.
That would be a huge ramp-up, equivalent to around one-fifth of forecast global production that year.
""There's interest in Salta and it's the Argentine province with the most lithium projects in the pipeline,"" she said.
The country's CAEM mining chamber predicts a lower 175,000 tonnes nationally by 2025 from an estimated 38,800 tonnes this year. But - with lithium projects often taking years to ramp up - that remains a lofty goal.
FUELS OF THE FUTURE
Argentina's center-left government has been making a conscious and strategic push towards lithium.
Last year it lowered taxes on all mining exports to 8% from 12% and in April eased capital controls on firms taking foreign currency out of the country for projects with investments of over $100 million. It has backed the state energy firm YPF (YPFD.BA) to create a lithium battery plant and is pushing a bill to lower taxes on electric cars.
""We will focus on areas and fuels of the future, that generate zero polluting emissions, which are basically hydrogen and lithium batteries,"" Production Minister Matias Kulfas said in a recent meeting with reporters in Buenos Aires.
A source at the central bank, which is keen to rebuild battered foreign currency reserves, said that the country had seen growing investor interest in mining, including in lithium.
Australia's Orocobre Ltd (ORE.AX) and U.S. miner Livent Corp (LTHM.N), which have supply tie-ups with Toyota Corp (7203.T) and BMW (BMWG.DE) respectively, operate the two producing lithium projects in Argentina out of a total of over 60 proposed projects in various stages of development.
Others in the country include Australia's Argosy Minerals (AGY.AX), Lake Resources (LKE.AX) and Greenwing Resources (GW1.AX), as well as South Korea's Posco (005490.KS) and Neo Lithium Corp (NLC.V), backed by China's CATL (300750.SZ).
China's Ganfeng Lithium Co Ltd (002460.SZ) is in a bidding war to buy Argentina-focused Millennial Lithium Corp (ML.V) after an unnamed battery maker made a rival bid to its $280 million offer. 
Ganfeng and Lithium Americas (LAC.TO) are aiming to produce some 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent from the Cauchari-Olaroz mine, with production set to start in 2022.
'UNSTABLE MACROECONOMY'
Doubts, however, remain about whether Argentina can rev up its lithium output in the way it has promised. Half a decade ago, under a business-friendly government, the country expressed ambitions to overtake larger producer Chile but failed to do so.
""Argentina has the resources, but in order to transform them into reserves and making projects... a series of clear and stable rules is needed,"" said Buenos Aires-based Natacha Izquierdo, an analyst at consultancy Abeceb.
Alejandro Moro, general manager of Rincon Lithium, an Australian firm that owns a concession on the Rincon salt flats in Salta, agreed there remained hurdles to attracting capital.
""This a country with a quite unstable macroeconomy, with a high degree of taxes that are imposed on the capital that comes to invest,"" he said.
The firm is running a pilot plant on the flats, almost 4,000 meters (13,100 ft) above sea level. It pumps brine through pipes 30 meters below the ground, which is then refined to produce lithium carbonate. Rincon hopes to extract 50,000 tonnes a year by 2025.
Despite his reservations, however, Moro said he had become more optimistic about Argentina's support for mining investments after meeting with senior officials a few weeks earlier.
Argentina, an agricultural powerhouse with abundant oilseeds, has for years focused energy subsidies on biofuels, but officials are now signaling a shift in priorities towards electric vehicles - and lithium.
""Definitely, lithium is going to replace biofuels,"" Moro said.",0
1632,"“MONSIGNOR IS ARMED with the word. The word is more powerful than a four-barrelled machinegun, comrade,” says Lord Dixon, a character in “Tongolele no sabía bailar” (“Tongolele didn’t know how to dance”), a new novel by Sergio Ramírez, a Nicaraguan writer. “Those are stupidities,” replies another. “Bullets rip through cassocks too.” And yet it appears that Lord Dixon, whose role is that of a chorus, is right. In the novel the bishop in question is so dangerous to those in power that they secure his exile to Rome. And Mr Ramírez’s novel has so enraged the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega that this month it issued an arrest warrant for him. “I think the book was the trigger,” Mr Ramírez told Bello. Mr Ortega has banned it and customs officers have been seizing copies.
The two men were once comrades. Mr Ramírez was vice-president, under Mr Ortega, in the revolutionary Sandinista regime of the 1980s. Mr Ramírez then joined a short-lived breakaway movement that embraced democracy and, when that fizzled, devoted himself to writing (he won the Cervantes prize, Spain’s most prestigious literary award, in 2017). Mr Ortega won an election in 2006 and, together with his wife Rosario Murillo, a devotee of esoteric cults, has clung to power ever since.

The charges against Mr Ramírez are totalitarian and specious. He is accused of laundering money, goods and assets, “denigrating national integrity”, “provocation” and conspiracy. The first relates to grants of $13,000 over five years received by his cultural foundation for journalism courses. The charges echo those used by Mr Ortega’s regime to throw three dozen political prisoners in jail, seven of them opposition hopefuls in a presidential election due in November, which will now be a farce.
Mr Ramírez saw what was coming when he was interrogated by prosecutors in June. After that he left the country. The warrant thus amounts to a sentence of exile. In the 1970s, during the Sandinistas’ struggle against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, Mr Ramírez lived as an exile in Costa Rica. Back then, he says, “I had my whole life in front of me to think that I might return.” Now he is 79. “The horizon is shorter. I have to accept the probability of never going back. This creates anguish and you have to struggle against that.” He leaves behind a house full of books, collected over many decades, which police have raided.
“Tongolele” is ostensibly a detective story. Its title refers to the nickname of the intelligence chief. Its rapid-fire dialogue is written in the slang of the Central American street. The crimes it portrays are crimes of state. Its subject is a popular uprising against the Ortegas in 2018 and its repression, during which more than 300 people were killed. The characters are fictional but the events were real. So is what the author calls “the dark, esoteric atmosphere”. So, too, were the paramilitaries, recruited from former guerrillas and the lumpen of Managua, who gunned down unarmed students using AK-47s and high-powered snipers’ rifles. They patrolled the city in unmarked Toyota Hilux pickups—just as the death squads of Argentina’s military junta did in unmarked Ford Falcons in the 1970s.
The Ortegas never appear by name in the book. It does, however, feature “the comandante” and the “señora”, “those at the top” whose whims inspire fear, paranoia and betrayal in a claustrophobic world in which fanaticism and opportunism are “twin diseases”. “Who are my enemies and who are my friends, now that all the dogs piss on me?” asks Tongolele, as he falls out of official favour.
“We saw how those who when young struggled for a new world inflicted a coup d’etat on the people, changing the constitution to perpetuate themselves in power in the name of a now-dead revolution, and we said nothing,” preaches the bishop in the novel. The students raised their voices and were slaughtered. Repression worked, Nicaraguans are scared and the Ortegas and their prison regime look secure. Nevertheless, Mr Ramírez thinks a return to democracy can only come from within. The regime “won’t last for ever”, he says. “There are moments when things suddenly change.”
Book-banning and the exile of writers have long been staples of Latin American dictatorships, including old-fashioned tyrants a century ago and military juntas in the 1970s. “Time is frozen in Latin America,” says Mr Ramírez. “It’s part of its attraction for novelists, that everything repeats itself.” It is part of the region’s tragedy that such dictatorships are no longer of the past.",1
1633,"AUSTRIA’S CHANCELLOR, Sebastian Kurz, may have been speaking for a few other European governments earlier this summer when he suggested that Turkey would be the most appropriate refuge for Afghans escaping the Taliban. But he was not speaking for Turkey, or for the Afghans themselves. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, declared last week that Turkey would not be “Europe’s refugee warehouse”. Most Turks agree. In a country home to well over 4m migrants and refugees, including an estimated 200,000-600,000 Afghans, resentment towards the newcomers is mounting. But so is frustration that Turkey, formally a candidate for membership in the EU, has become its buffer state.
For years, policy wonks used to reach for a variation of an old Soviet joke to describe the membership talks between Turkey and the EU: we pretend to negotiate, and they pretend to reform. Today, there is no use pretending. The accession process is dead. In its place, a deal the EU struck with Mr Erdogan to keep migrants and refugees out of Europe has taken centre stage in the relationship. That agreement, too, is starting to come under strain.

The EU’s reports on Turkey’s progress towards accession once made the front pages of the country’s newspapers. In today’s Turkey, the EU is a spent political force. In theory, all it needs to do to remedy this is to say that a democratic Turkey, as opposed to the police state Mr Erdogan has been assembling, can expect to have a place in the EU once it cleans up its act. Turkey’s beleaguered democrats would like to hear nothing more. Mr Erdogan would probably like to hear nothing less.
Yet this is the one thing EU officials cannot say. Turkey is bigger than any EU country and its people are mostly Muslim. Many European voters regard the prospect of such a nation joining the club with horror. So the chances are that the EU will not accept Turkey whatever its democratic credentials. Signs of this were present from the start of the membership talks in 2005, when European leaders insisted on an “open-ended process”, the outcome of which they would not guarantee.
In Mr Erdogan and his government they have found a terrific excuse to kick the can down the road. Turkey’s leader has locked up the Kurdish opposition, harassed the mainstream one, neutered the press and the courts, and clashed with Greece, Cyprus and France in the Eastern Mediterranean. As a German foreign minister remarked a few years ago, the EU will keep Turkey out of the club as long as Mr Erdogan is in power. The truth is that it will probably do so no matter who is in charge.
For now, both the EU and Turkey have decided that the best thing to do is nothing. Neither wants to break off negotiations, and both have something to gain from the impasse. Europe does not have to push forward a process it does not believe in, and Mr Erdogan does not have to sign up to reforms that would weaken his control over parts of Turkey’s economy and its institutions.
As a result, it is the deal the two sides made in 2016, after nearly a million migrants and refugees reached Greece, that now drives the relationship. In exchange for $6bn in assistance to Syrian refugees and a vague promise of visa-free travel to Europe for Turks, Mr Erdogan’s government has reined in smuggling networks and taken back migrants attempting to cross the Aegean. The EU has reason to be pleased. The number of crossings dipped to less than 10,000 last year, compared with 850,000 in 2015. Some in Europe now propose extending the agreement’s provisions to Afghans. Turkey has so far balked at that idea.
The deal has also changed the way the EU and Turkey do business. European governments, especially Germany’s, are now extremely wary of rocking Mr Erdogan’s boat, says Michael Leigh, a former EU official. The leverage the EU once had over Turkey’s leader has gone. The bloc occasionally makes noises about human rights, democracy and the need for a solution in Cyprus. Mr Erdogan blithely ignores them.
The migration deal helped contain a populist backlash in Europe. But it has helped spark one in Turkey. Resentment of refugees, made worse by an economic crisis, has occasionally turned violent. Earlier this month a mob in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, destroyed homes and shops belonging to Syrians after a Turkish teenager died in a fight between locals and refugees. Such incidents remain rare, a remarkable thing given the size of the refugee population. But tensions are bound to mount as tens of thousands of newcomers start to reach Turkey, this time from Afghanistan, by way of Iran.
Getting nasty
Until recently, immigration had not been a big issue in Turkish politics. But this too is changing. The opposition has tapped into anti-refugee sentiment. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, head of the CHP, the largest opposition party, recently pledged to send all Syrian refugees home if his party takes power. (Most Turks, including a majority of government supporters, would support this, polls say.) Mr Erdogan, already criticised for keeping the border with Syria open for years, is facing heat for doing too little to protect the one with Iran. Work on a border wall is continuing. The debate is poised to become nastier ahead of elections scheduled for 2023. The deal with the EU is sure to come under fire.
Some Turkish diplomats suggest fixing the relationship with the EU through seemingly technocratic manoeuvres, including an upgrade to the bloc’s customs union with Turkey, visa liberalisation and co-operation on foreign policy. But even this seems impossible. Turkey does not want to make the necessary concessions, including an overhaul of its draconian terrorism laws, and the EU does not want to be seen as offering Mr Erdogan rewards. A breakthrough may happen, but not before voters give Mr Erdogan and his coalition the boot. Even then, EU membership will not be on the table. Perhaps it was never there to begin with. ■",1
1634,"ON A COLD and rainy recent night, on a mountain soaked in the blood of early Communist Party martyrs, Chaguan went for a walk to look for ghosts. None could be found. Instead Jinggang Mountain, in the southern province of Jiangxi, revealed itself as an oddly kitsch tourist complex, being readied for nationwide celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding, in July. Toiling in the dark, work crews were installing floral displays and streetlights topped with red plastic flames.
Tens of thousands died on the mountain between 1927 and 1929, as Mao Zedong and pioneering Red Army units took refuge on its bamboo-clad slopes, hiding from the ruling Nationalist regime and prowling warlords. Some died in combat, others in political purges. Others were killed by cold and disease in a region so poor that locals ate wild vegetables and trapped squirrels for meat.

Today Jinggang Mountain is preserved as a “cradle of the revolution”. The local mayor, Jiao Xuejun, calls it “a spiritual place” that “purifies minds and clarifies people’s beliefs”. For all that, visitors hear little about its complex history. Rather, generic slogans reflect the party’s modern-day claim to rule, based on decades of economic development. A typical display, formed from illuminated red characters hanging from trees, reads: “The People Have Faith, the Country Has Strength, the Nation Has Hope”.
Tour groups, some in replica Red Army uniforms, throng a museum filled with revolutionary relics before heading to souvenir shops selling Mao statues. Nearby, a China Executive Leadership Academy, overseen by the party’s Central Committee, trains high-flying officials from around the country. The academy calls itself a furnace where cadres are fired with renewed fervour, via residential courses in party history, discipline and theory: above all, “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”. Mr Xi visited in 2016. His tribute to the “Jinggang Mountain Spirit” is inscribed on an academy wall.
The mountain witnessed important ideological battles. Mao argued with party chiefs in far-off Shanghai about how to recruit peasants as revolutionary warriors, after urban uprisings failed. Some sharp rows concerned the merits of political terror, and whether to seize land from all landlords, or just the richest. Mao favoured a selective use of violence. He held public-execution rallies at which local gentry were disembowelled with spears, and hung a scaffold with couplets in his own calligraphy, reading: “Watch Us Kill the Bad Landlords Today. Aren’t You Afraid?” Mao eagerly recruited mountain bandits as troops and grumbled about the “petty-bourgeois consciousness” of villagers, who rarely volunteered to join the Red Army, wanting instead to farm in peace. When an enemy army drew near in January 1929, Mao abandoned Jinggang Mountain, leaving only a token force to defend thousands of villagers, wounded troops and Red Army wives and children. Massacres followed. An official history published in 1987, during a period of relative candour about Mao’s mistakes, cites a party inspector’s judgment that the Red Army’s 15-month stay left Jinggang Mountain “totally bankrupt”.
Such debates are now played down. Chaguan visited the mountain on a government tour, organised to introduce foreign and Chinese journalists to local leaders preparing to fete the party’s centenary, as well as to officials studying at the academy. Pressed to explain the Jinggang Mountain spirit, those students carefully refer to Mr Xi’s definition of it, which stresses persistence, seeking truth from facts, tackling difficulties and relying on the masses. Smoothly, academy students trace a common “Red culture” connecting early martyrs with material prosperity today. One student, a party chief at a university in central China, recounts how he ferried his son on a bicycle in the 1990s, whereas his soon-to-be-born grandchild will ride in a car. Definitions of happiness evolve, but “the people have always had dreams of a better life,” he beams. Another, a provincial vice-president of the All-China Women’s Federation, insists that for 100 years “the party’s goal hasn’t changed, it is wholeheartedly to serve the people.”
The right sort of fervour
Academy students take a field trip to a mountain pass, Huangyangjie, made famous after the Red Army held off a bigger enemy force there. Standing to attention in rows, the middle-aged officials recite in unison a Mao poem about this victory. A lecturer assures them—in contradiction of the historical record—that long-ago locals showed “complete loyalty to the party”, praising a villager whose eight children all joined the Red Army. “Relying on the masses is not a pretty slogan, it’s a reality forged in fire,” the lecturer says, drawing a link with the mobilisation of ordinary Chinese to fight covid-19. “The form of the war may change, but the path of relying on the masses is still the right one,” he concludes.
Officials offer simple morality tales about the selflessness of party members, from the Red Army commander who carried grain up the mountain to feed his soldiers, to the students who left “great universities” in Beijing to fight in Jiangxi 90-odd years ago. When visitors learn how highly educated patriots in their 20s sacrificed their lives, they realise that they can overcome their own difficulties, enthuses Mr Jiao, the mayor. An academy boss compares revolutionary martyrs to modern-day party secretaries who volunteered to work in harsh, remote villages to alleviate rural poverty, some of whom perished on the job.
The blandness of these approved stories is no accident. It is hard for today’s rulers, obsessed as they are with order and conformity, to celebrate a revolution, even one a century old. A revealing commentary in the People’s Daily this month called for party members to practice “self-revolution” and “self-purification” via strict discipline. In the Xi era, a revolutionary spirit is one that submits to party authority. History is a way to measure how far China has come. Ghosts from the real, messy past are not welcome.■",1
1635,"FOR MANY Lebanese, the scenes in Beirut on October 14th harked back to their country’s darkest days. Gunmen crouched behind cars and fired wildly at apartment blocks or rushed out from cover to launch rocket-propelled grenades. Frantic parents searched for safe routes to collect children from school. Residents cowered in hallways and bathrooms. The guns fell silent after a few hours, but the streets were left carpeted with broken glass, the buildings pockmarked with bullet holes.
At least seven people were killed and dozens injured in the worst violence in Lebanon’s capital since 2008. It centred on a rally organised by the two main Shia parties, Hizbullah and Amal, to protest against the investigation into last year’s catastrophic explosion at Beirut’s port. Soon after the rally began, snipers fired into its midst from a nearby building. Hizbullah and Amal, which are both militias as well as political parties, blamed this “ambush” on the Lebanese Forces, a Christian party led by Samir Geagea, a warlord-turned-politician. His party denies it was involved (there is no evidence yet to prove it was).

Ostensibly the protest was about the “politicisation” of the probe. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hizbullah, says the lead investigator is biased. His allies mumble darkly about an American-backed conspiracy. This is mostly nonsense. The investigator, Tarek al-Bitar, is a judge with a clean reputation. He has won support from families of the 218 people killed in the explosion. Pressed for evidence of a foreign conspiracy, supporters of Hizbullah and Amal offer little beyond the fact that some American congressmen have praised Mr Bitar.
It would be more accurate to call this a protest against the investigation itself: a rally for impunity, of which Lebanon has a long history. An amnesty law passed in 1991 meant that almost no one was held accountable for atrocities during the 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Since then politicians, security officials and intellectuals have been assassinated, with few consequences for their killers.
Mr Bitar, by most accounts, takes his job seriously. He has summoned high-ranking officials, including a former prime minister and cabinet members. On October 12th he issued an arrest warrant for Ali Hassan Khalil, a former finance minister from Amal, after the latter failed to turn up for questioning. Hours later a court ordered Mr Bitar to halt his work pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed by Mr Khalil and a colleague.
The investigator’s opponents have ample reason to want him gone. The explosion was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had arrived at the port in 2013 and was stored improperly. Many senior officials were aware of the stuff but did nothing to make it safe. Amal is known to wield influence at the notoriously corrupt port. Some Lebanese believe Hizbullah wanted to use the ammonium nitrate for bomb-making, either at home or in neighbouring Syria (a claim that is so far unproven). Both parties are members of the ruling coalition and see a serious investigation as a threat to the political order.
They have already removed one judge. Mr Bitar’s predecessor was dismissed in February, in part because his own house was damaged in the blast. This supposedly made him too biased to oversee the work—an absurd standard that would disqualify about one in seven Beirutis (more than 85,000 homes were damaged).
For the civil-war generation, the fighting on October 14th carried grim echoes of their childhoods. Even the location, Tayouneh, was resonant: a former front line between Christian and Shia neighbourhoods, near the site of a massacre in 1975 that is widely considered the war’s starting point. For most of Lebanon’s political factions, however, a renewed war would be a suicide mission. Hizbullah is by far the country’s strongest force, better-equipped than even the army. None of its rivals has the muscle to challenge it, nor do they enjoy the level of foreign support they did decades ago.
If war seems unlikely, though, so does stability. Lebanon defaulted on its foreign-currency debt in March 2020 and has since slipped into an economic crisis that the World Bank ranks as one of the worst anywhere since the mid-1800s. The Lebanese pound, long pegged at 1,500 to the dollar, now trades at around 21,000; annual inflation exceeds 100%. Earlier this month the national electricity grid went offline for a day when its two main power plants ran out of fuel. There has been no progress on restructuring debt, a financial-rescue plan or an agreement with the IMF.
This endless crisis affects everyone—including the impoverished, demoralised security forces. The interior minister said in a television interview this month that more than 240 police officers had walked off the job. The army does not release statistics, but desertions there are thought to number in the thousands. Other soldiers have side jobs to feed their families, since conscripts now earn less than the equivalent of $60 a month (compared with $800 before the currency collapsed).
For decades, Lebanon’s leaders have framed justice and peace as opposing choices, where one is only possible without the other. The campaign against Mr Bitar, and the deadly violence that followed, underscores that they have in fact provided neither: a state too corrupt to prosecute its criminals, and too dysfunctional to protect its citizens.",1
1636,"IN FEBRUARY THE administration of Narendra Modi trumpeted a sweeping plan to privatise India’s corporate jewels. Past governments have made such promises with little to show for it. Yet this time investors’ ears perked up. Covid-19 had drained public coffers by crushing the private economy while piling costly burdens on the public sector. In India’s business circles hope flickered of an economic reset that might complete the fitful liberalising project that began 30 years ago in response to another economic crisis.
After months of silence, on August 23rd the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, finally spoke up. The goal, she said, was to raise $81bn, or 3% of GDP, over four years. But rather than doing so through outright sales, the transactions will be more complex—and less transformative as a result. The Indian state will liquidate small minority stakes in a few airports. Other big assets are expected to be leased to investors for up to 25 years. “Monetisation of core infrastructure assets”, Ms Sitharaman intoned, “does not mean selling the assets.”

The assets not being sold include 42,300km of power lines, 26,700km of highways, 8,200km of natural-gas pipelines, 400 railway stations, 150 trains, 160 coal-mining projects, 25 airports and stakes in nine ports. In this half-hearted divestment strategy Mr Modi seems to emulate India’s biggest private conglomerate, Reliance Industries, which has sold minority stakes in various bits of its empire such as mobile telecoms and refining while retaining ultimate control over them.
This approach has its advantages. Investors get a stable, bond-like return in entities that are already up and running (which removes the headache of dealing with India’s baffling permitting process). The public gets a chance of better services, as new operators improve efficiency and increase investment. In the past moving assets into private management helped spruce up airports in Delhi and Mumbai.
Missing from Ms Sitharaman’s announcement was an update on the fate of big companies. Three divestments are said to be in the works, involving the Shipping Corporation of India, Pawan Hans (a helicopter service) and Neelachal Ispat Nigam, a steelmaker. But progress appears glacial.
Most disappointing of all was the government’s reluctance to follow up on its promise to sell the biggest prizes, such as Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Air India (the flag-carrier, also wholly owned by the state), Bharat Petroleum (an oil-and-gas giant that is listed but state-run), and even some state banks. The sale of such assets, which were nationalised after India’s independence in 1947, would carry symbolic, not just financial, weight.
Observers blame the lost momentum on three causes. First, the government still has uses for some of the firms; LIC has served as a source of bail-out cash for struggling businesses. Second, the firms’ employees are a powerful constituency that resists change. Third, like bureaucrats everywhere, Indian ones worry that a completed sale would prompt endless inquiries into whether the price was too low. For everyone involved, safer to do nothing. ■

1637,"FOR THE past month Ireland’s health-care system has been in disarray. On May 14th the Health Service Executive (HSE), the state-funded health-care provider, was hit by a “ransomware” attack which led it to shut down most of its computer systems. The attackers threatened to release stolen data, including confidential patient records, unless the HSE stumped up $20m (€16.5m). It declined to do so. Its staff were reintroduced to pen and paper, its procedures delayed, its patients inconvenienced. By June 14th services had still not returned to normal.
This out(r)age might have attracted greater attention beyond Ireland’s shores had it not occurred a week after a similar attack had disabled a crucial oil pipeline on the other side of the Atlantic. On May 7th Colonial Pipeline, a company whose namesake asset delivers nearly half the fuel used on America’s east coast, had its systems compromised by a cyber-attack and had to shut down the flow of oil. Some people headed to the pumps in panic. President Joe Biden invoked emergency powers. The company paid a ransom of over $4m; even so, it took several days for the oil to start flowing again.

The two stories are in some ways par for the course. More and more enterprises are being hit by ransomware attacks, and some of the targets are giants. In recent months attackers have struck JBS, the world’s biggest meat producer, and Apple.
In other ways they feel like an escalation. Attacks on core state functions such as health care and crucial infrastructure like pipelines are normally the stuff of war, insurgency or terrorism. They do not lose their capacity to worry governments just because they are being undertaken for cash, especially when the criminals perpetrating them come from unfriendly countries. The gangs responsible for the HSE and Colonial Pipeline attacks both seem, like many of their sort, to be based in Russia. At his summit with Vladimir Putin on June 16th Mr Biden listed 16 types of infrastructure against which he wanted to see no further cyber-attacks.
A permissive attitude to cybercrime is unsurprising for a regime led by an old spook like Mr Putin. The covert things that states have always done to each other—spying, propaganda, subversion and violence—are normally crimes as far as at least one of the parties is concerned. Criminals and spies lurked in the same shadows, shared the same methods and occasionally combined their roles long before the dark recesses of the internet beckoned.
For the most part hostile state activity is non-violent, a matter of harvesting information helpful to your national interest—including the commercial interests of your companies—and discombobulating the opposition. “Most activities in cyberspace have little to do with the use of force,” writes Joshua Rovner of American University, who in 2018-19 was scholar-in-residence at the National Security Agency (NSA), America’s signals-intelligence agency, and Cyber Command, a Pentagon command which conducts cyber-operations. “They are largely an intelligence contest—an effort to steal secrets and exploit them for relative advantage.”
But the scale, speed and ease at which that contest can now play out has been transformed. Robert Hanssen, one of the KGB’s most productive agents ever, supplied thousands of pages of classified material to his handlers. But he did so over a period of 20 years, from 1979 to 2001. Vasili Mitrokhin, a disillusioned KGB archivist, pilfered an astonishing 25,000 pages of material between 1972 to 1984, hiding reams of documents under the floor of his dacha, but it took him another eight years to get those secrets to Britain’s MI6.
By contrast, the Chinese hackers who penetrated America’s Office of Personnel Management in 2014 gained access to the records of 21.5m people at a stroke—a haul which, if printed out, would have filled a fleet of lorries. Some see the capacity to steal secrets in such remarkable quantity as qualitatively different from older forms of espionage: not just spying but warfare, or some hybrid of spying and warfare, or something entirely new.
Last year America uncovered a colossal hacking campaign which, by compromising SolarWinds, a software-maker, had penetrated a panoply of government departments. The justifications the Biden administration offered for its subsequent sanctions against Russia, which it blamed for the attack, were telling. One was the sheer scale and scope of the penetration. But there was also a worry that such a capability could pivot easily from wholesale espionage to wholesale sabotage. The scope of the attack was “virtually a declaration of war by Russia on the United States”, thundered Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator.

Demarcation becomes yet more complicated when non-state actors are added to the mix, either as perpetrators or victims. The Colonial Pipeline attack shows that private ransomware rackets are now ambitious—and, considering the new level of concern, arguably foolish—enough to attack vital state interests. The Sony Pictures attack of 2014 showed that states can seek to destroy private corporations; Sony had incurred the wrath of North Korea by mocking its supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, and had a great deal of dirty corporate laundry exposed as a result.
Sony’s good name was not that important to any government; other state action against companies could be. In 2017 Russia launched a ransomware-like cyber-attack, NotPetya, against companies in Ukraine so as to damage the country’s economy. The attack spread well beyond Ukraine’s borders; it has been blamed for $10bn of damage worldwide. One of the companies affected was Mondelez International, an American snackmaker, which made a $100m insurance claim as a result. But Zurich American Insurance declined to pay out, pointing to an exception for “hostile or warlike attack” in the company’s policy. The case has gone to the courts in Illinois, where it is currently pending.
Exceptional thieves
In general, though, there is little indication that the increasing damage done by ransomware is state-directed, as NotPetya seems to have been. It is for the most part merely state tolerated. The extortionists enjoy impunity to the degree that their host countries are indifferent to the harm they do elsewhere—though they may also, on occasion, be required to do their hosts nefarious favours.
The Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, analysed 1,200 ransomware attacks which mostly took place last year. Two of its findings make the extortionist’s incentives clear. The fact that 60% of victims were based in America or had their headquarters there can be explained by Sutton’s law: that’s where the money is. The fact that there were no victims in Russia or most other post-Soviet countries can be explained by other rules—rules about activities which are inappropriate on your own doorstep, or where you eat.
The rise in the use of ransomware may reflect, and indeed exacerbate, interstate tensions, but it is not directly due to state action. It is mostly down to increased capabilities and opportunities.
The earliest examples of people hacking into computers, encrypting files and demanding payment in return for decryption were penny-ante stuff—a way to extort a few hundred dollars from someone who didn’t want to lose treasured family photos. Its growth into a criminal industry preying on large organisations is in part down to the replicability that the digital domain makes so easy; criminals can launch dozens of attacks as easily as one. As the business got more lucrative the technology became better; larger ransoms allow the criminals to buy more sophisticated “exploits” which in turn allow more ambitious attacks. The growth of remote-working has also helped, providing criminals with far more opportunities to worm their way into corporate networks.
The rise of cryptocurrencies, which provide a convenient and discreet way for law-abiding victims to pay, adds to the crime’s appeal. Chainalysis, an American firm which examines the “blockchain” databases that power such currencies, reckons that hackers took around $350m in cryptocurrency payments in 2020, up fourfold on the year before. Increasingly the hackers prefer newer cryptocurrencies such as Monero or Zcash, which are designed with privacy in mind, to bitcoin. The fact that its blockchain makes transactions using bitcoin “wallets” public helped American police recover around half of the Colonial Pipeline ransom after it was paid.
The cyber-security industry, whose job is to protect its customers from such attacks, looks increasingly ineffective. Microsoft estimates that annual spending on antivirus software, firewalls and the like was around $124bn in 2020, up 64% in five years. Last year Debate Security, a group of cyber-security experts, published a report pointing out that despite all this the average number of breaches recorded each year by Accenture, a consultancy, has risen. Admittedly breaches might have risen faster if spending had not gone up, but it is hard to see the record as encouraging. Ciaran Martin, who led the creation of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the defensive arm of its signals-intelligence agency, GCHQ, was one of the report’s contributors. He argues that the way the business works is fundamentally flawed.
Poison pills
The report’s subtitle—“Is cyber-security the new ‘market for lemons’?”—echoes a famous analysis of the effect of “asymmetric information” on the second-hand-car market. George Akerlof, an economist, argued that since buyers cannot reliably identify high-quality second-hand cars, they will be unwilling to pay high prices. The sellers of good cars are thus driven out of the market, ceding the field to those selling cheaper, shoddy “lemons”.
Mr Martin thinks that the cyber-security field is mired in a similar asymmetry. Ian Levy, the NCSC’s technical director, has said that a lot of the industry operates in much the same way as medieval witchcraft: “Buy my magic amulet and you’ll be fine.” It is hard for buyers to pick effective defences against the dark arts out of the dross, and they know it. Almost none of the bosses Debate Security interviewed could agree on how to measure the effectiveness of the software they were buying. There was much talk of the need to “cross our fingers” and “accept what we can get”. Fixing the problem, says Mr Martin, is likely to require the development of common standards for assessing how well cyber-security software really works.
Given that they are on the hook for ever increasing ransomware losses you might expect insurance companies to be pushing for such standards. In 2020 Munich Re, a reinsurance company, estimated that the cyber-insurance market was worth $7bn and could be worth $20bn by 2025. But Kelly Bissell of Accenture says that insurers frequently conclude that the easiest way to deal with an attack on a firm they have insured is simply to pay up; that may minimise costs on a one-off basis, but it encourages more attacks in future.
France—which according to Emsisoft, a cyber-security firm, suffered ransomware losses of more than $5.5bn in 2020, second only to America—is taking a hard line on this. “Regarding ransomware, we don’t pay and we won’t pay,” Johanna Brousse, a French prosecutor, said at a recent discussion at the senate. In May AXA, a big French insurer, having been lent on by the authorities, said it would stop writing policies that allow reimbursement of ransomware payments.
Clamping down on ransom payments and setting standards for cyber-security—something Mr Martin favours—are two ways for governments to defend their corporate citizens and the infrastructure they control against commercial cyber-attacks. In doing so they may go some way towards protecting themselves from direct attack by other states, too.
Offensive cyber-capabilities are now widespread among states, and commonly used in military campaigns. In their war against Islamic State, Britain and America used cyber-attacks to suppress the group’s propaganda, disrupt its drones and sow confusion in its ranks. They are also used to do physical damage in times where no war is officially taking place. Consider the pioneering American-Israeli Stuxnet worm, which induced Iranian centrifuges to tear themselves apart a decade ago, or Russia’s successful sabotage of Ukraine’s power grid in 2015 and 2016.
Achieving dramatic physical effects is exceptionally demanding and vanishingly rare. But in some cases it may offer the perpetrator advantages. Gary Brown, a professor at America’s National Defence University who was the first senior legal counsel for Cyber Command, argues that states are more tolerant of “kinetic effects” caused by online operations than those which result from armed provocations. Had Iranian commandos attacked Israeli water plants in April 2020, the result might have been war. An alleged Iranian cyber-attack which sought to increase chlorine levels in drinking water, prompted instead only a relatively tepid Israeli cyber-riposte against an Iranian port. Israeli forces have, though, launched air strikes against sites in Gaza they associate with cyber-attacks by Hamas, a militant Palestinian organisation.
Retaliating against cyber-attacks in kind may become a norm—more assertive than turning the other cheek or lodging a diplomatic complaint, less risky than responding with physical violence. Such a stance may also provide a deterrent. America, which according to a forthcoming study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, has “offensive cyber-capabilities...more developed than those of any other country”, is widely thought to have used them to fire a warning shot over North Korea’s bow: the dictatorship’s internet suffered an odd blackout shortly after the Sony hack. Mr Biden’s demand that some areas be exempt from criminal attack was paired with a threat to respond with what he described as America’s “very significant cyber-capabilities”.

It is possible that defence, deterrence and attack will blur. In recent years, Cyber Command has embraced a strategy of “Defend Forward”, which involves observing enemy hackers before they enter American networks—something that, given the absence of unowned buffer zones in computer networks, unavoidably requires intruding on the networks of others. “There are no ‘high seas’ or ‘international waters’ in cyberspace,” writes Erica Borghard, who served on America’s Cyberspace Solarium Commission, a national task force.
Welcome to the party, pal
As more states develop stronger and more active cyber-forces, the idea that the best—perhaps the only—form of defence is something which looks very like an attack points to ever-more intense competition over computer networks. “Perhaps defending forward is necessary to frustrate particularly reckless and brazen campaigns,” argue Columbia University’s Jason Healey and Robert Jervis. “But in the long run it may someday spark a larger conflict.” Because Russia and China scarcely admit to conducting cyber-operations at all, it is impossible to say how far they have trodden the same path.
And as state capabilities grow it seems a sure thing that criminal ones will too. Cyber-capabilities are easily spread and available to those of modest means. A ranking of offensive “cyber-power” created by the Belfer Centre at Harvard University last year put Israel and Spain in third and fourth place, with Iran, the Netherlands and Estonia all placed in the top ten. Private firms like Israel’s NSO Group and Italy’s Hacking Team sell powerful hacking tools which allow states to quickly bootstrap their own cyber-forces. It is hard to imagine all these capabilities being kept out of the hands of criminals who inhabit the same demi-monde. Extortionists demanding ransoms, spies pocketing data and states spreading disinformation will sit alongside one another—multiplexed on the same channels as never before. “Cyber as a domain of military and national-security operations co-exists with cyber as a domain of everyday life,” says Mr Martin. “It’s the same domain.” ■",1
1638,"FOR HUMANS, adapting to climate change will mostly be a matter of technology. More air conditioning, better-designed houses and bigger flood defences may help ameliorate the effects of a warmer world. Animals will have to rely on changing their bodies or their behaviour. In a paper published in Trends in Ecology  Evolution, a team led by Sara Ryding, a PhD candidate at Deakin University, in Australia, shows that is already happening. Climate change is already altering the bodies of many animal species, giving them bigger beaks, limbs and ears.
In some species of Australian parrot, for instance, beak size has increased by between 4% and 10% since 1871. Another study, this time in North American dark-eyed juncos, another bird, found the same pattern. Similar trends are seen in mammals, with species of mice, shrews and bats evolving bigger ears, tails, legs and wings.

All that dovetails nicely with evolutionary theory. “Allen’s rule”, named for Joel Asaph Allen, who suggested it in 1877, holds that warm-blooded animals in hot places tend to have larger appendages than those in temperate regions. Such adaptations boost an animal’s surface area relative to its body volume, helping it to shed excess heat. Being richly endowed with blood vessels, and not covered by insulating feathers, beaks make an ideal place for birds to dispose of heat. Fennec foxes, meanwhile, which are native to the Sahara desert, have strikingly large ears, especially compared with their Arctic cousins.
Ms Ryding examined museum specimens, comparing their bodies to those of their modern counterparts. She is not the first researcher to take that approach. But it is hard, when dealing with individual species, to prove that climate change was the cause of an anatomical alteration. All sorts of other factors, from changes in prey to the evolving reproductive preferences of males or females, might conceivably have been driving the changes.
Looking at the bigger picture makes the pattern clearer, says Ms Ryding. Her team combined data from different species in different places. Since they have little in common apart from living on a warming planet, she says, climate change is the most plausible explanation.

For now, at least, the increase is small, never much more than 10%. That may change as warming accelerates. Since any evolutionary adaptation comes with trade-offs, it is unclear how far the process might go. Bigger beaks might interfere with feeding, for instance. Larger wings are heavier, and bigger legs cost more energy to grow.
And there are other ways to adapt, too. Researchers have already seen changes in the geographical range of many species, from insects to fish. Another evolutionary rule-of-thumb, Bergmann’s rule, holds that animals in hotter places tend to have smaller bodies, another way to boost the ratio between surface area and volume. Other animals may alter their behaviour as well as their bodies, such as by seeking shelter at hot times of the day.
Studying a broader range of animals will help firm up exactly what is happening. Much of Ms Ryding’s data concern birds, with less information available for other taxa. But it seems clear that the world of the future is not just going to be hotter than humans are used to. The animals living in it will look different, too. ■

1639,"VENTURE INTO the chat rooms of French cyberspace or onto the streets of Paris, and the impression this summer is of a country on the brink of totalitarian rule or civil collapse, or both. In July the word dictature (dictatorship) surged tenfold on Google, in anticipation of a new “health pass” introduced on August 9th by President Emmanuel Macron. This makes full vaccination (or a negative covid-19 test) a condition of access to restaurants, bars, trains and other places.
Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing deputy, called the new pass sanitaire a “sanitary coup d’état”. Michèle Rivasi, a Green politician, called it “apartheid”. Protesters clutched placards with slogans such as “False pandemic, real dictatorship” and “Pass Nazitaire”, or photos of Mr Macron with a Hitler-style moustache. A few wore yellow stars on which was written “non-vaccinated”, eliciting widespread indignation. Joseph Szwarc, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor, called the comparison “odious” and said he shed tears at the sight: “I wore the yellow star; I know what it was.”

In April and May the phrase guerre civile (civil war) spiked on Twitter, after retired right-wing generals wrote an open letter offering to step in to save the country should it slide into chaos. A poll suggested that 58% of the French backed the officers, and nearly half thought the army should step in on its own initiative.

Why is France so often convinced it is on the brink, and so prone to rhetorical hysteria? The country’s disjointed and rebellious history is one answer. “Are we in 1789?” is still a periodic headline in the press. And indeed, the prospect of disorder is not wholly fanciful. A culture of mass protest is deeper-rooted in France than in any other European country, and reasoned debate often gives way to factional theatrics and sabotage. Fifty years after the May ‘68 student uprising, gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) ransacked Paris. In July anti-vaxxers invaded a town hall in Chambéry, in the Alps, and vandalised vaccination centres.
Inflating fears of violence or totalitarianism may also suit some politicians. Many a French election campaign has been won on the promise of calm after chaos. Over four-fifths of the French say that feelings of “insecurity” will influence their vote at the presidential election next year, even though violent crime (sexual and domestic violence aside) has been falling for years and the murder rate is stable. Some 200,000 people grabbed headlines on August 7th by marching against the new health rules. Yet, after they were announced, over 8.5m quietly got vaccinated for the first time. As for allegations of dictatorship, Mr Macron put it this way: “If we empty words of their meaning, the risk is that we threaten our democracy itself.”",1
1640,"CALL IT AN October surprise. Almost every day over the past two weeks countries across Asia have revealed plans to loosen pandemic-induced restrictions on inbound tourism. India went first, announcing on October 7th that it would at last resume issuing tourist visas for visitors from all countries on November 15th. Two days later Singapore expanded its quarantine-free travel lanes beyond just Germany and Brunei. Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thailand’s prime minister, said on October 11th that fully vaccinated tourists would be able to visit many parts of the country without quarantine from November 1st.
Several Indonesian islands, including Bali, opened up on October 14th. Malaysia’s prime minister hinted at a reopening in December. Fiji’s government said it wants people to spend Christmas there. Even parts of Australia, which has had among the harshest travel policies in the world, will welcome travellers again from next month. “For double-vaccinated people around the world, Sydney, New South Wales, is open for business,” said Dominic Perrottet, the state’s premier.

Yet India is an exception in throwing open its borders to all tourists. Most Asian countries welcoming travellers are doing so only for those from a carefully chosen list of countries, with acres of small print. Thailand initially planned to open its doors only to ten, mostly European countries. Bali is welcoming travellers from 19, half from Europe and none from its own region of South-East Asia. Singapore’s list has expanded from two to 11, with most in Europe, and even then only on designated flights. Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, threw cold water over Mr Perrottet’s reopening a few days later when he said that it will at first apply only to Australian citizens, residents and their families.
Indeed, the more reliant a country is on tourism, the greater seems to be its caution. In 2019 tourism made up about half of Fiji’s exports, a fifth of Thailand’s, and nearly a tenth of Malaysia’s. India, by contrast, relied on tourists for just 6% of exports. The share for Singapore is smaller still, but the city-state’s economic model depends on being open to the world. The announcements are less an indication of enthusiasm for welcoming visitors back than of the sense that it would be especially damaging to delay longer: now is when people book their winter holidays.
That is one reason why the reopening is so limited. Many Asian economies desperately need a decent season of inbound tourism but do not feel fully prepared to welcome lots of visitors. Even in Thailand, where tourism accounts for a fifth of jobs, 60% of people said in a recent survey that November 1st was too soon for the country to open up. Yet that must be balanced against people’s livelihoods. On October 21st Mr Prayuth announced that Thailand would in fact open to 46 countries, more than half of them European. “If we wait until everything is fully ready, we’ll be too late. Besides, tourists may choose to go elsewhere,” he wrote on Facebook.
A phased approach allows locals to get used to the idea of tourists again. It will also help businesses, which must refill their swimming pools and rehire workers after nearly two years of closures. Taking things slowly is useful for governments, too, which are watching covid-19 case numbers and worry that they may need to throttle back.
“The first markets to open up will be vulnerable to overtourism,” says Liz Ortiguera of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, an industry body. The choice of European countries may in part reflect that concern. The vast majority of tourists in Asia come from other Asian countries, who tend to make shorter trips and therefore spend less per visit. Europeans and Americans, having travelled all the way, often stay longer and spend more freely, says David Vanzetti of the University of Western Australia. As countries re-open, they are trying to maximise profits while keeping visitor numbers manageable.
The near-total halt in travel and tourism caused by the pandemic is unique in being caused by a lack of supply rather than demand, says Xiang “Robert” Li of US-Asia Center for Tourism  Hospitality Research at Temple University in Philadelphia. People still want to travel, and will get back on the road as soon as they are allowed. After past crises, such as the SARS outbreak in 2002-04, travel recovered domestically at first, then regionally and eventually across long distances. The same will be true this time, perhaps even more so after nearly two years of public-health messages that painted the outside world as a mortal threat. “We used to take travel for granted,” says Mr Li. But after 18 months of being grounded, “we realise that tourism is not just superficial fun. It actually is part of the contemporary lifestyle and has a lot to do with our well-being, who we are, and how to be happy.”

Editor’s note (October 21st): This piece has been updated to include Thailand’s announcement that residents of several dozen more countries would be allowed to enter from November 1st. It has also been corrected to note that they can travel only to certain parts of the country.

1641,"Vladimir Putin has accused the West of 'escalating' tensions around Ukraine by building up forces on his border, even as thousands of Russian troops, tanks and artillery pieces sit close by.
The Russian president said Europe and the US had carried out ship drills in the Black Sea and flown bombers close to the frontier - crossing 'red lines' and showing that Russia is not being taken seriously.
As he spoke, the Russian military test-fired an 'unstoppable' hypersonic Zircon missile at a target in the White Sea - saying it scored a direct hit. 
It comes after Washington accused Putin of preparing for an invasion of eastern Ukraine in order to annex territory as he did with Crimea in 2014.  
'Western partners are escalating the situation by supplying Kiev with lethal modern weapons,' Putin said, even as Ukraine's defence minister revealed he has asked Brussels and Washington for more military tech.  
He said Moscow has been 'constantly raising concerns about this' but 'all our warnings and talk about red lines are treated superficially'.  
Putin has been voicing concern about US naval exercises in the Black Sea for days, telling his French counterpart this week that they were 'provocative' and leading to 'increasing tensions' between Moscow and NATO.
He has also slammed Ukraine for using a Turkish-made drone against pro-Moscow rebels.
It came as Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said he is in the process of agreeing a 'Russian containment package' with allies in Washington and Brussels including 'increased sanctions' as well as 'supplies of additional weapons'. 
Speaking today, Mr Kuleba said: 'Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, increased considerably in recent weeks.
'Ukraine is already actively consolidating partners in countering hybrid threats.
The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels in recent days, 'work is underway to develop a comprehensive package of containment of Russia'.
Ukraine has been fighting a years-long proxy-war against Russia, which supports separatist rebels in the country's eastern regions.
It stems from the 2014 rebellion which ousted pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych and led to Russian annexing Crimea in the aftermath. 
The conflict has so-far claimed some 13,000 lives.
Crimea juts into the Black Sea and contains an important Russian naval port with easy access to the Mediterranean.  
Renewed Western speculation about Russia's plans in eastern Ukraine have come amid a clash over an unexpected migrant crisis on the border with Kremlin-aligned Belarus and EU member Poland.
The EU has accused the Kremlin-backed regime of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus of purposefully luring thousands of migrants - mostly from the Middle-East - to its doorstep as revenge for sanctions.  
Ukraine accuses Putin of masterminding the scheme directly, as part of a wider strategy to 'shatter Europe'.
NATO, the EU and US have thrown their weight behind Poland against Belarus, and on Thursday UK defence minister Ben Wallace travelled to a NATO base in Poland to speak with the country's defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak.
Mr Blaszczak subsequently announced that British engineers are being deployed to the border to help reinforce the defences.
 'The Polish border is sealed and it will be sealed. Despite hybrid attacks, we will keep Poland safe,' he said.
'I would like to thank the British for their commitment, especially in the face of situation on the Polish Belarus border. 
'Polish serve side by side with British soldiers.'
Putin used a speech to Russia's foreign ministry to call for a de-escalation of military tensions, appealing directly to the EU.  
'Brussels needs to understand that decreasing military-political tensions is not only in Russian interests, but in those of the whole of Europe, even the world,' he said.
Earlier on Thursday, the Kremlin said Europe should not blame Russia for 'all problems'.
'Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
He added that Europe should instead 'address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe'.
Peskov's remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any 'military adventurism' on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland.
'Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain,' Peskov said.
'Russia is not waging any hybrid wars,' he added.
- Ukraine seeks more Western arms -
Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion.
Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, on Thursday said it was seeking more military aid from the West.
Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border.
'Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing.
The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels 'work is under way to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia'.
He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for 'the supply of additional defence weapons for our army'.
Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering.
This week, France's Macron told Putin that Paris was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity, according to the Elysee.   ",3
1642,"EVERY YEAR from May 25th to May 31st, the UN marks the snappily-named “International Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories”. When it comes to the Caribbean, some might not think there is much need for solidarity. For one thing, the region’s 17 non-sovereign island territories (seven of which are on the UN list) are richer and more politically stable than their 13 flag-waving neighbours: in terms of GDP per person, seven of the ten richest places in the Caribbean are non-sovereign. For another, they enjoy all the advantages of their former colonisers’ far greater geopolitical clout, powerful passports and the opportunity to move to Europe or the United States.
There are drawbacks, however, to not going it alone. Islanders have long wrestled with a head-versus-heart dilemma, in which material gains come at the cost of pride and a sense of belonging. Over the past decade, cracks in the relationships with their colonisers have been widening. Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States have added to a growing sense of discontent. In recent months tensions have mounted on two islands in particular.

The first is Martinique. Like its sister island of Guadeloupe, Martinique has been a département of France since 1946. On paper it is as much a part of France as Alsace or Normandy, and far more integrated than the Caribbean’s five British Overseas Territories, the six islands affiliated with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, or the two American territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (see map).

Yet an old scandal has caused tensions to emerge. Chlordecone, a very persistent pesticide, was used in banana plantations from 1972 until 1993, long after it was banned in other parts of the world. It is linked with higher rates of cancer, and some estimate that 92% of Martinican adults have been exposed to it. In January, after a 15-year legal battle, a case for “reckless endangerment” was eventually heard in a French court. To many Martinicans’ dismay, however, it was then announced that the statute of limitations to prosecute culprits might have expired, a claim that Martinican lawyers dispute. Thousands took to the streets to protest in February.
Many blame the békés, a white minority descended from slaveholders, for the poisonings. They control vast swathes of the island’s agricultural land and factories despite accounting for a tiny part of the population. “French colonialism never really ceased,” claims Rodolphe Solbiac, a Martinican academic. The pandemic has worsened tensions. Last year activists blocked roads to an airport and attempted to stop cruise boats from bringing in tourists—and with them, the first cases of covid-19.
Martinique is not the only island struggling with a perceived lack of agency. Sint Maarten lies 440km (270 miles) to the north, and shares an island with another French territory, Saint-Martin. In 2010 it became one of four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (previously it was part of the Dutch Antilles). On paper the countries are equal: they have one representative each on the Kingdom’s Council, and retain control over their own domestic affairs. In reality the islands are dwarfed in size and wealth by the Netherlands. As in Puerto Rico, it is the old colonial power that has the final say.
In March, 12 of the island’s 15 MPs signed a petition to the UN accusing the Kingdom of the Netherlands of “persistent acts of racial discrimination and violations of international human-rights law”. Politicians (rather than activists) already grumbled about their “white Dutch fiscal overseers”, referring to members of a Board of Financial Supervision who monitor Sint Maarten’s public finances. The trigger for the petition was a demand that another supervisory body be created in exchange for €18m ($22m) in covid-19 relief. The new Caribbean Reform Entity will have powers to oversee budget cuts (including MP’s salaries) and introduce tax reforms.
Non-independent territories get sizeable wads of cash from their former colonisers. Following Hurricane Irma in 2017, the Netherlands distributed grants through a trust fund amounting to €550m, or about 60% of Sint Maarten’s GDP. In 2019, fiscal transfers from France to Martinique came to €2.9bn, the equivalent of almost a third of Martinique’s GDP.
Yet to many, these arrangements feel paternalistic. The petition also accused the Dutch of imposing excessively harsh austerity measures, creating a “debt trap” with its conditional loans, and of being too slow to release aid. Similar issues have plagued Puerto Rico and certain British territories. The Dutch say intervention is necessary to stop bad governance. The Sint Maarten MPs argue that their right to self-government is being trampled.
In Martinique, calls are growing for reparations for the Chlordecone scandal and for slavery, something also demanded in the Sint Maarten petition. The Sint Maarten parliament also passed a motion to “finalise the decolonisation process” (it has not specified what exactly this means). Even so, independence is unlikely. In a referendum in 2010 79% of Martinicans voted to preserve the status quo. In Sint Maarten ordinary folk are more pragmatic than their MPs (who also quietly admit they are not ready for independence). “Maybe we see things from a different perspective, the people and the politicians,” says Ellen, a 67-year-old cashier at a jewellery shop on the seafront. Because of covid-19 the tourist-dependent economy is estimated to have shrunk by a quarter, and times are tough. “If we go independent, we’re gonna be in a hole we can’t come out of.” ■",1
1643,"A five-year-old girl is lucky to be alive after being pulled unconcious from the water at a popular Perth amusement park.
Paramedics were called to the Adventure World amusement park in Bibra Lake at 12.15pm on Saturday.
Members of the public pulled the girl who was found face down and unconscious in the water before life guards performed CPR after she stopped breathing. 
She regained consciousness and was taken to Fiona Stanley Hospital in a critical condition. 
Adventure World chief executive Andrew Sharry thanked the two park guests who played a 'pivotal role' in saving her life, according to The West Australian. 
'Early this afternoon an unsupervised five-year-old girl was retrieved from the main pool by the two closest guests,' he said.
'Our lifeguard checked vitals and commenced CPR immediately. Our First Response Team arrived and provided further support.
'The girl responded within moments and was then stabilised until the ambulance arrived.' 
She was later transported to Perth's Children Hospital and is now in a stable condition. 
A witness has described the incident as 'horrible', according to Perth Now. 
'A young girl, she was helped and fortunately taken to hospital breathing,' Sarah Louise wrote via social media. 
'The life guards and members of the public did a great job.
'Was a horrible scene.' 
Under the amusement park's policy children aged under 12 must be supervised at all times by a guardian.   
'Our thoughts are with the young girl and her family,' Mr Sharry said.
'We have reached out to the parents to offer our support.' 
Hundreds of children and their families were reportedly at the popular amusement park during the time of the incident. 
Adventure World continued to remain open to the public after the incident.",3
1644,"“MEXICANS EMERGED from indigenous people, Brazilians emerged from the jungle, but we Argentines arrived on boats. On boats from Europe.” So said Alberto Fernández, Argentina’s president, last month. It was meant as a friendly nod to Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, who was sitting beside him. Two decades ago the comment, which Mr Fernández attributed to Octavio Paz, a Mexican poet, but which was really more faithful to an Argentine rock song of the 1980s, would have gone unremarked. Not now: many took offence. What made his timing especially clumsy is that Latin Americans are once again engaging in one of their periodic bouts of questioning their national identities.
In Colombia in April indigenous demonstrators toppled a statue of Sebastián de Benalcázar, a Spanish conquistador. Monuments in Bogotá to Queen Isabella of Castile and her hired help, Christopher Columbus, were also attacked and have been removed for safe-keeping. Chile has decided to make June 24th a public holiday as “the day of the original peoples”. In May Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, apologised to the Mayans for the abuses of the past five centuries. Pedro Castillo, a left-wing teacher and the presumptive winner of Peru’s presidential election, said that to be “of Andean blood” is to be “authentically Peruvian”. Some of his opponents brandish red and white flags featuring the cross of Burgundy, an emblem of Spanish colonial rule.

National identities evolve everywhere. And they tend to be closely linked to race. That has been especially so in Latin America. Most of the region became independent two centuries ago, just when the French revolution and the European Romantics made nationalism fashionable. The new nations set out to create collective identities. It was a tricky task, as Simón Bolívar, the liberator of northern South America, wrote: “We are neither Indians nor Europeans, but a race halfway between the legitimate owners of the land and the Spanish usurpers.”
Throughout the 19th century historians, painters and poets worked to create national myths and heroes. These were generally whitish men: although Indians and black slaves were accepted as part of the nation, it was in subordinate roles. In the 20th century more inclusive national identities emerged, centring on mestizaje, the racial and cultural mixing of indigenous people, Europeans, Africans who arrived as slaves and immigrants from elsewhere. “There is not a single Latin American, from the Rio Grande to Cape Horn, who is not an heir to each and every aspect of [this] cultural heritage,” Carlos Fuentes, a Mexican writer, declared in 1992 as the region marked the quincentenary of Columbus’s arrival.
That commemoration in fact prompted a questioning of mestizaje. In 2010 around 42m Latin Americans, or 8% of the total, defined themselves as indigenous, according to censuses; others took pride in their African descent. These people tend to be poorer than average, whereas elites tend to be whiter than average. Racism and racial tension survive, albeit in less overt form. Take Argentina: behind the European façade proclaimed by Mr Fernández lay the extermination of some indigenous people in the 19th century and the hidden survival of others. Or Peru: according to Gonzalo Portocarrero, a sociologist, its history contains two persistent fantasies, that of a race war feared by whites and that of Inkarri, the return of the Inca emperor to rescue his people from bondage. Portocarrero, writing in 2015, thought both were fading. Recent events call that conclusion into question.
Statue-toppling is currently widespread, and there is an element of anarchist vandalism to it. But Latin American leaders would be foolish if they fail to recognise that in recent mass protests there is a demand not just for material improvements but also for more inclusive national identities in countries where the pandemic and the prior economic slowdown have deepened social fractures. The conquistadors were brave, but they were brutal too. They belong in museums, not in public squares (Columbus is a more complicated case, as a generic symbol of the European roots of many Latin Americans). But while Latin America should pay due recognition to its cultural and ethnic diversity, it should not lose sight of the many things its people have in common. Cultural mestizaje is in some ways a myth and it should not be imposed. But it remains the only inclusive and unifying narrative the region possesses.",1
1645,"“I NEVER ENVISIONED sending my children to a Catholic school. I have a good public school down the block from my house,” says Laura Camisa, mother of two girls aged five and seven. She and her family live in an expensive Brooklyn neighbourhood in a high-performing school district. Ms Camisa’s older daughter was in kindergarten when schools shut down in 2020 because of the pandemic. Remote learning was difficult for her daughter. Once happy and outgoing, she became withdrawn. “This is not working”, Ms Camisa remembers saying to herself. After hearing good things about St Joseph the Worker, a nearby Catholic school, she decided to send her children there.
The Camisas are one of thousands of families newly enrolled in Catholic schools. Falls in pupil numbers of a couple of percentage points a year had been the norm for years. The number had fallen from a peak in the early 1960s, when Catholic schools had 5.2m pupils, to around 1.6m last year, which meant a lot of empty desks. But this autumn dioceses all over the country are seeing increases in enrolments. The National Catholic Educational Association is still collecting and analysing the latest pupil data, but its preliminary numbers show increases in most dioceses.

The Brooklyn-Queens diocese in New York, one of the biggest in the country,  saw increases for the first time in a decade or more. Nearly 60% of its schools are growing, with many increasing by 10%. Partnership Schools, a network of Catholic schools in New York City and in Cleveland, saw a 16% increase. The diocese of Springfield, in Massachusetts, is up by 13%. Arlington’s diocese, which takes in the suburbs of Washington, DC, increased by 6%. The Archdiocese of Baltimore, the county’s oldest, saw a similar increase. Chicago’s archdiocese, which includes some suburbs, saw a 5% increase. Enrolment increased by nearly 4% in Catholic elementary schools in Philadelphia’s archdiocese.
Why are Catholic schools suddenly growing? Last autumn many public-school systems delayed reopening and did not offer full-time in-class learning. When Catholic schools reopened, most provided in-person learning. This appealed to families who struggled with remote learning—many of the new pupils are children whose parents cannot work from home. Most Catholic schools had plenty of space to socially distance: those empty classrooms came in very handy.
Families took note, including non-Catholics. In 1970 only 2.7% of the pupil population was non-Catholic. Last year it was one in five. In some dioceses it neared two in five. Kathleen Porter-Magee, superintendent of Partnership Schools, says the children in her Cleveland schools are nearly all non-Catholic: “We like to quote the late Cardinal Hickey of the Archdiocese of Washington who said, ‘We educate our communities, not because they are Catholic, but because we are’.”
Catholic superintendents and enrolment directors are giddy about the increase. Mary Pat Donoghue of America’s Conference of Catholic Bishops hopes it will stabilise the pupil population. Father Joe Corpora of the University of Notre Dame warns: “We’ll never get another chance like this again.” Some dioceses and schools are working on retention and marketing plans, a first for many.
Catholic schools are not cheap. Tuition averages $4,800 a year for elementary schools and high school costs more than $11,000. Historically, parishioners helped offset tuition costs with what they put in the offertory basket. But as fewer people went to church, that funding stream decreased. The many sexual-abuse scandals have also hurt enrolment. Charter schools, which share some of the attributes of Catholic ones (uniforms, discipline, community values) also drew prospective pupils away from Catholic schools. It is hard to compete with free.
Even so, many families are willing to pay. Ms Camisa and her husband have had to rejig their finances to afford tuition. “We moved [schools] because of the pandemic, but we stayed because of what we saw at St Joe’s.” When public schools restored in-person learning, she did not return. “We’ll probably stay Catholic the whole way to high school.” ■

1646,"After Germany’s general election the Social Democrats (SPD) emerged as the largest party, overtaking the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian allies who currently lead the ruling “grand coalition”. But forming a new government will probably take many weeks, as it will almost certainly involve a three-party coalition. Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s candidate for chancellor, is the most probable successor to Angela Merkel, at the head of a “traffic-light” coalition including the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, though this is by no means guaranteed. Armin Laschet, who led the Christian Democrats to their worst-ever defeat, is facing pressure to resign, but insists he still has a chance to construct his own coalition.
Iceland fell short of having Europe’s first parliament where women hold most of the seats, following a recount after its election. Women took almost 48% of the seats. The left-right coalition increased its governing majority.

An independent investigation claimed that 83 aid workers sexually abused girls and women while responding to an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Staff from the World Health Organisation are among the accused.
Fighting between jihadist groups in Nigeria left dozens dead. Islamic State West Africa Province is gaining the upper hand over Boko Haram, which has spent a decade kidnapping schoolgirls and strapping bombs to children. The latest fight was over which group gets to “tax” fishermen.
Jihadists from a previously unknown group claimed that they had killed six intelligence officers in Sudan. The country’s transition to democracy is looking fragile, two years after the overthrow of Omar al-Bashir, a bloody dictator who ruled for 30 years.
Tunisia’s president, Kais Saied, suspended parts of the constitution and said he would rule by decree. This comes after a power grab in July when he suspended parliament and seized emergency powers.
A judge in Mexico refused to issue arrest warrants for 31 scientists whom the country’s attorney-general wants to prosecute for mishandling funds. The lack of evidence for the charges, and the fact that the law was not in force at the time of the alleged crime, has led to accusations that the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador is trying to politicise public life.
Haiti’s general election was postponed yet again, when Ariel Henry, the prime minister, removed the council that was to oversee the poll. Mr Henry, mired in conspiracy theories about the assassination of the country’s president in July, says he would like to hold the election next year.
Fighting between rival gangs at a prison in Ecuador left 116 inmates dead. At least ten men were decapitated. The gangs have links to Mexico’s drug cartels.
Meng Wanzhou, an executive at Huawei, a Chinese tech firm, was allowed to fly home to China from Canada after almost three years of fighting extradition to America. Ms Meng had admitted to misleading bankers about Huawei’s links to a company active in Iran. At almost the same time two Canadian prisoners in China, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, were allowed to fly back to Canada. The two Michaels are widely thought to have been held as hostages, pending Ms Meng’s release.
Power cuts affected about 20 of China’s provinces, including many industrial areas. Reasons for the cuts ranged from the high price of coal to efforts by some provinces to meet strict environmental limits on energy consumption.

Safety first
Kishida Fumio will be the next prime minister of Japan, after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected him as its president. The former foreign minister takes over from the increasingly unpopular Suga Yoshihide, who is stepping down amid widespread criticism of the government’s handling of the pandemic. Mr Kishida, who trumped the public favourite, Kono Taro, is seen by the party as a safe pair of hands.

Manny Pacquiao, a senator in the Philippines and a world-champion boxer, announced his retirement from the sport and his intention to run for president. The Philippine constitution limits presidents to a single term but Rodrigo Duterte, the combative incumbent, will still be on the ticket; he has said he will run for vice-president.
Appearing before a Senate committee in Washington General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that he and others had urged Joe Biden to retain 2,500 troops in Afghanistan in order to defend Kabul and slow the Taliban’s advance. This could have allowed for possible talks, though the general admitted that the outcome might have been the same. Mr Biden has said he received no such advice ahead of America’s speedy withdrawal in August.
A study from Oxford University found that the covid-19 pandemic has led to a drop in life expectancy not seen since the second world war in western Europe. Across the 29 rich countries studied the biggest fall in life expectancy was among American men, who saw a decline of 2.2 years in 2020 relative to 2019.
There were 21,570 homicides in America last year, according to the FBI, up by 29% from 2019. The homicide rate rose from 5.1 to 6.5 per 100,000 people. This was still well below its peak of 9.8 in 1991.
Fuelish things
British motorists endured petrol queues. One cause was a shortage of lorry drivers to deliver the stuff, exacerbated by Brexit, which has made it harder and less attractive for foreign drivers to work in Britain. Another cause was panic-buying. Despite government assurances that there was plenty of fuel in depots, drivers flocked to fill their tanks. Other European countries also had fuel-supply problems, but Britain’s were especially severe.",1
1647,"FIFTEEN YEARS ago Maria, a school secretary, and her husband Samuel, a technician at an electronics firm, had just bought a car when they found out she was pregnant. They couldn’t afford the payments with a baby on the way, so they returned it. Today the couple and their three children live in a three-bedroom house in Tesistán in western Mexico, and have just bought a second set of wheels. They eat out once a fortnight and have a subscription to Netflix, a video-streaming site. “My children used to ask me if we are poor and I would say ‘No, we have food, a roof over our heads, clothes, and we are moving ahead’,” says Maria. “For me and my husband this is the best moment we’ve had yet.”
In recent decades Mexico, like many emerging markets, has witnessed the growth of its middle class. Incomes have risen—Maria and Samuel bring in around 20,000 pesos ($1,000) a month, an increase of more than 50% in real terms since they first got together 16 years ago. More people like them have bought cars, fancy TVs, smartphones and nice clothes. But recently the middle class, long neglected by politicians, has had two setbacks, thanks to covid-19 and the policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Class is nebulous. It can be defined by income, profession or aspirations. The markers of status vary. Middle-class Mexicans do not look like their Spanish peers. They are poorer and more likely to work in the informal sector, rather than be a doctor, teacher or other professional. The World Bank defines middle class as earning $13-70 per day in 2011 dollars, adjusted for purchasing-power parity. The OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, defines it as earning 75% to 200% of the median income of the country where you live. In Mexico almost half the population of 126m meets that definition of middle class. (Some 36% fall below that and 19% are officially rich.)
In Mexico the growth of a large swathe of people who are neither rich nor poor owes much to NAFTA, a free-trade agreement with the United States and Canada. It brought jobs and cheaper goods to the country when it was implemented in 1994. (A renegotiated, more restrictive version came into force last year.) The fact that Mexican consumers have more clout than in the 1990s can be seen in the proliferation of cafés and restaurants in urban areas. In 2019 Mexico City, the capital, had the world’s highest number of songs streamed on Spotify, an audio-streaming service. Mexico is one of the five biggest markets globally for Uber, a ride-hailing firm. In April IKEA, a Swedish furniture giant, opened its first store in the country.
Going places
The middle class is a vital part of any economy. In Mexico, many of its members own the small- and medium-sized businesses that provide most of the jobs in the country. “They may start with a puesto [stall] on the street and then invest in starting a fixed restaurant that goes on to employ other people, too,” says Javier Lazarín of FES Aragón, a university.
Aspiring types tend to press governments to provide better services such as health care and education, because they rely on them more than the rich, who can buy what they need. Better education can often lead to better public debate, too. Middle-class citizens are also thought to be good for democratic stability, since they are keen to protect what they have. Nonetheless, membership of the middle class in Mexico is far more precarious than in richer places. An economic shock—a family illness or a recession—can send people tumbling back into poverty. Today several forces are battering Mexico’s middle masses.
The most immediate threat is covid-19. The World Bank reckons that, by its measures, last year a net 4.7m Latin Americans fell out of the middle class. In 2020 Mexico had its worst recession since the Great Depression, with the economy shrinking by 8.5%. (It normally grows by around 2-3%.) Mr López Obrador’s fiscal hawkishness, sensible in good times, appears to have been a liability. His government provided very little financial support, deepening the pandemic’s impact. By contrast, handouts in Brazil were so generous that the World Bank says they reduced by 12m the number of people falling out of the middle class.
Miriam Corona works as an accountant at an office-furniture shop in Mexico City. Her salary of 16,000 pesos a month was cut in half when the pandemic started, she laments from her living room in Pantitlán, an eastern neighbourhood of modest houses, restaurants and shops. Ms Corona and her son, a university student, have got by only because they live with her brother and mother. “We limited what we spent,” she says. Neither she nor her company received extra handouts last year.
Even before covid-19, government policies were hurting people like Ms Corona. “In a country with so much poverty, the middle class is often not appreciated,” says Armando Regil, who runs an NGO. The rich are undertaxed in Mexico and the poor have little spare cash, so middle-class Mexicans pay more than their fair share. They pay for public services and, since these are patchy, for private substitutes too.
Mexico ranked 56th of 78 countries in the most recent PISA ranking, a test of 15-year-olds’ skills in science, maths and reading. According to a survey in 2017, less than half of Mexicans were happy with the state of public health care. Services, and access to them, have improved in the past decade but not by much. One-sixth of Mexicans lack effective access to health care.
When asked about their spending priorities, middle-class Mexicans are most likely to mention private schooling and private health care. If she had more cash, Maria would send her children to a private school—and buy them swimming lessons.
Despite his populist rhetoric, Mr López Obrador has not done much to improve matters. Since coming to power in 2018 the president has focused on the poor, doling out funds for social programmes to support them. Meanwhile, his lackadaisical approach to foreign investment, which fell in 2019, has hurt the slightly better-off, says Luis Rubio, an analyst and co-author of a book on Mexico’s middle class. One of Mr López Obrador’s first acts in office, for example, was to cancel a big new international airport, spooking investors.
Now the president is verbally chastising the middle class. Mr López Obrador blames them for his party’s losses in Mexico City in the elections in June. He has called middle-class Mexicans “individualist” and accused them of wanting “to be like those above and climb as high as possible with no scruples”.
The president conceded that people should want to “improve” themselves, but clarified that they should “not become selfish and aspire to be snobs”. Such messages are off-putting to many middle-class folk. “He talks about the richness of culture and family but not about finances—and those matter, too,” says Luis Castellanos, an academic.
Viri Rios, an analyst, reckons that taking into account the limited access to public services, a Mexican needs at least 16,000 pesos per person per month to live comfortably—what Ms Corona earned before the pandemic. A report from 2019 by McKinsey, a consultancy, talks of two “missing middles” in Mexico: robust mid-sized companies and a middle class with more spending power.
“If you don’t fight to move ahead, you don’t move ahead,” says Carla, a freelance consultant (and Mr Castellanos’s spouse). If public services improved, middle-class Mexicans could spend their money on other things—and more people could climb the ladder, too. ■",1
1648,"ON MAY 9TH China’s foreign ministry was asked to comment on an atrocity in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Terrorists had detonated a car bomb outside a girls’ school, then two more bombs to kill pupils running for safety. At least 68 people had died, most of them children. The attack was aimed at girls from a Shia minority that is often targeted by Sunni Islamist groups, which have brought much misery to Afghanistan. Today such groups are jostling for blood-soaked advantage ahead of a full withdrawal of American forces, at the latest by September 11th this year, as ordered by President Joe Biden. China’s diplomats could have responded to the latest violence in several plausible ways.
It would have been reasonable for the foreign ministry to tell the largest militant group, the Taliban, to rein in the mayhem, for China enjoys growing leverage over the Taliban’s leaders. That may seem counterintuitive. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has expressed hope that future Afghan governments will embrace moderate Islam: an apparent rebuke of Taliban-style zealotry. Across the border, in China’s north-western region of Xinjiang, officials have demolished mosques and banned young people from public prayers. In all perhaps a million Muslims, most of them from the Uyghur minority, have passed through re-education camps in Xinjiang, set up to cure them of excessively religious or “backwards” thinking, and to turn them into biddable workers, loyal to the Chinese motherland.

But the Taliban can be both fanatical and pragmatic, it turns out. Their leaders hope to rule Afghanistan soon, a quarter of a century after they first subjected the country to a reign of pious terror. Especially over the past three years, say scholars and diplomats in Beijing and other capitals, links between the Afghan Taliban and China have grown remarkably. Anxious for political recognition and economic backing from their giant neighbour, Taliban delegations have approved of Chinese plans to build motorways between Afghan cities. They claim to support a Chinese-funded project near Kabul to create one of the world’s largest copper mines, which has been stalled for years by concerns about ancient Buddhist ruins on the site and by fears of militant attacks.
Privately, it is said, the Taliban have signalled that they do not care about Xinjiang. That relates to China’s main interest in Afghanistan: to prevent that unhappy country from sliding into chaos and becoming a haven or transit corridor for Uyghur militants who, China is sure, lurk in the region. Those fighters, China believes, include some with combat experience in Syria, some trained by Iran, and others who hope to enter Xinjiang through lawless tribal regions of Pakistan.
It would have been reasonable, too, for China to have asked Pakistan to help stem the bloodshed. Pakistan is the Taliban’s patron, and has prodded the Afghan militants to establish ties with China. Pakistan likes to be useful to China, its most important sponsor. But the ministry chose a different response. After deploring the murder of the schoolgirls in Kabul, its spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, singled out America for blame. She charged that the “abrupt” announcement of America’s exit from Afghanistan had “led to a series of explosive attacks throughout the country”. She called on foreign troops “to pull out in a responsible manner and avoid inflicting more turmoil and suffering on the Afghan people”.
This is a new criticism. Chinese scholars and state media have spent years accusing American forces of straying beyond their original mission to eradicate al-Qaeda and of spreading turmoil with their naive dreams of Western-style nation-building. More recently, they have asserted that America will surely leave behind covert operatives after its troops leave, in part to make trouble for China. In short, China believes that America has stayed too long in Afghanistan, is departing too hastily and is not really leaving at all.
That line of argument is tangled enough. Making it more so, Chinese officials now call Afghanistan an area of possible co-operation with America, along with climate change and efforts to curb nuclear proliferation. When pressed for detail, including at a recent meeting with American counterparts in Anchorage, Chinese envoys are vague. A few years ago China and America did jointly train Afghan diplomats and police. These days China stresses the importance of its Belt and Road Initiative: how the infrastructure-building scheme can promote Afghan development and thus stability, such as by connecting the country to the sea via Pakistan.
Afghanistan once saw remarkable co-operation. Early in the war on terror, President George W. Bush’s administration designated a Uyghur group, the East Turkistan Independence Movement ( ETIM), as terrorists. Chinese agents were allowed to interrogate Uyghurs detained in Guantánamo Bay. They told one Uyghur he was lucky to be in American hands, since “as soon as they got him back to China, he was dead”, his lawyer later told Congress. Such joint action is unthinkable now: the two sides are so far apart on Xinjiang. In 2020 the Trump administration delisted ETIM as a terror group, expressing doubts that it still existed. China says it is a grave menace.
To China, nothing matters more than stability
China sees its positions as coherent. Singling out America as a troublemaker is logical. It also distrusts the Taliban, Pakistan and Iran, but those actors have reasons to bow to China’s will, so do not need public scolding. In contrast, America is a dangerous rival that has made bad mistakes, so is an ideal target for criticism. China may support regional or UN peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, if its neighbour seems on the brink of civil war. But it will not send its own troops to keep order, at least under a Chinese flag, because its neighbour is a “graveyard of empires”. Afghanistan’s case is revealing. China is emerging as a great power that—to an exceptional degree—trusts in cold, hard economic and security interests alone. To China, self-interest is wisdom. ■",1
1649,"“LOOK AT YOU down there, trying to run for your life,” jeers Summer Solesis, peering down at the camera. “You don’t stand a chance against my giant, size 11 feet!” Standing over her phone, she pretends to stamp on the viewer, who gets the effect—sort of—that Ms Solesis is a “giantess with dirty feet getting rid of the tiny men infesting my house”, as one video is captioned. The production quality is low-fi, but viewers seem not to mind. “Unforgettable sweet crushing,” swoons one fan, Sven, in the comments below.
The pseudonymous Ms Solesis, a personable 26-year-old Floridian, reinvented herself as an online “foot goddess” last March after covid-19 did for her restaurant job. “My mom’s just always told me I had pretty feet,” she says. So “I was just like, well, let’s see if the internet thinks I have pretty feet.” It did. On Instagram she gained 20,000 followers. Some offered money for personalised photos and videos. A few months later she joined OnlyFans, a London-based subscription platform. About 50 people around the world pay $10 a month for Ms Solesis’s newsfeed, adding up to around $5,000 a year after OnlyFans takes its 20% cut. She roughly doubles that with tips and merchandise, including unwashed socks ($10 per day worn).

In the past decade anyone with a phone has become a potential content creator. Cameras have got sharper, processors more powerful and networks faster. Apps can improve even the shoddiest content. Instagram, launched in 2010, provided filters that made ordinary photos look cool. TikTok has made it as simple to edit video. In April Facebook unveiled recording tools that aim to do for amateur podcasters what Instagram did for bad photographers. The internet’s limitless, free distribution and searchability has made it possible for this output—videos, music, jokes, rants and all manner of things that defy categorisation—to find an audience, however niche.
Yet apart from a few megastar “influencers”, most creators receive no reward beyond the thrill of notching up “likes”. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, has built a $92bn-per-year advertising business by selling space alongside posts by its 2.8bn happily unpaid user-suppliers. Twitter makes $3.4bn a year flogging ads among the free editorial typed by its 350m contributors. Being on the platform can feel like “the greatest unpaid internship of all”, Samhita Mukhopadhyay, an American journalist, recently tweeted.
But the serfs tilling the internet are increasingly finding that their output can command a price, with the effect that some of the internet’s most successful companies are being forced to adapt their business model. New platforms are offering creators ways to capture the value of their output for themselves, as Ms Solesis did when she moved from Instagram to OnlyFans. Bloggers and tweeters are moving their musings to paid newsletter services like Substack; amateur video-game makers are selling their pixelated creations on platforms like Roblox; viewers are paying to watch experts play them on streaming services like Twitch, owned by Amazon.
The upstarts are forcing incumbents such as Facebook to compensate users for the unpaid work they may not have realised they were doing. And they are helping professional creators, who once relied on middlemen, reach their audience directly.
The abundance of content in the internet age has meant that the success of online media platforms has depended on their ability to help users discover it. Rather than commissioning videos or articles, they have focused on building algorithms or content-management systems which serve users the best of others’ creations.
One consequence of the internet is that “value has shifted away from companies that control the distribution of scarce resources to those that control demand for abundant ones,” writes Ben Thompson, author of the tech newsletter, Stratechery, who calls such firms “aggregators”. Because the platform sets the conditions for a piece of content’s success, via its algorithm, suppliers have to adapt to its rules, thus commoditising themselves. In this world of abundant supply, content providers become as interchangeable, and have as little bargaining power, as Uber drivers.
All things are become new
Yet something in this model is changing. Though there is more content than ever, platforms are competing harder than ever to get it. “There's an arms race to acquire creators,” says Li Jin, founder of Atelier Ventures, a venture-capital firm. Startups are developing new ways for creators to monetise their work. Substack gives writers 90% of the subscription fees they charge for newsletters; together its top ten authors earn more than $15m a year. Twitch gives its game streamers more than half of its subscription fees, plus a cut of ad revenue and the money paid to “cheer” their performance. Cameo, a platform on which 40,000 celebrities sell personalised videos to fans, passes 75% of the spoils to contributors. Brian Baumgartner, an actor in “The Office”, an American sitcom, was its top earner last year, making over $1m. Clubhouse, a social-audio app, allows tips and has an “accelerator programme” for promising hosts. It plans to test features such as tickets and subscriptions.
In response, platforms that once paid little or nothing to creators are ponying up. Companies “need to either offer some way to monetise that content on-platform, or…they'll become just a promotional hub, where people essentially advertise the content that they're monetising on other platforms,” says Josh Constine of SignalFire, another venture-capital firm.
Twitter was in danger of becoming a promotional tool for Substack writers and Clubhouse broadcasters. It is now trying to beat both at their own game. In January it bought Revue, a newsletter firm, and cut its commission to 5%, half Substack’s. On May 3rd it added Spaces, a Clubhouse-like audio feature; soon it will let users sell tickets to chats they host. The ability to sign up for a newsletter or join an audio room directly from Twitter, without the friction of moving apps, gives the company an edge over its startup rivals, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a research firm.
Facebook is also trying to make creators stick around. Last year it made paid subscriptions widely available and enabled tips. It is now testing a Cameo-like feature called “Super”, a Substack-esque newsletter platform, and is paying gamers big bucks to join Facebook Gaming, its tribute to Twitch. In all, it says, the number of content-makers earning over $1,000 a month on the platform almost doubled in 2020.
“In developing all of these things, we’re actually really focused on the creator side, even more than on the consumption side,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, in a recent interview with Casey Newton, author of the Platformer newsletter. In an effort to attract more of them, it is offering creators not just money but power: newsletter authors will own their recipient list and be able to take it to another platform, the equivalent of being allowed to move one’s Facebook friends over to Twitter.
YouTube, which has long given regular video-posters a 55% cut of ad revenue, is developing new features including tips in the form of paid “applause”. It says the number of channels joining its paid “partner programme” in 2020 was more than double that in 2019. In all it has paid contributors $30bn in ad-revenue shares and subscription fees in the past three years, far more than any other social platform. Last year TikTok, a short-video app, launched a “creator fund” which it says will dispense more than $2bn to users in its first three years. Douyin, its Chinese twin, is investing $1.5bn with the aim of doubling its creators’ revenues. Snapchat, another social-video app, last year launched Spotlight, a sharing feature through which it is paying $1m a day to the creators of its most popular clips.
Newer types of media are joining in. Douyu and Huya, China’s largest game-streaming platforms, each paid out 7.1bn yuan ($1.1bn) to streamers last year, 31% more than in 2019. Spotify and Apple, the two biggest podcast platforms, are wooing amateur broadcasters. Last month Apple announced that it would let podcasters charge subscription fees, of which it would take a 30% cut for the first year, then dropping to 15%; days later Spotify followed suit—but said creators could keep the lot (from 2023 it will take 5%).
As platforms fight over the most popular content, bargaining power is being transferred to the people who make it. Simon Kemp of Kepios, an internet research firm, compares platforms’ negotiations with top creators to TV networks’ wrangling with the cast of “Friends” over each season’s contracts. Many offer better terms to their most successful creators: Twitch reportedly pays a higher share of subscription revenues to its top streamers; Substack offers advances to writers it believes will be a hit. The share of revenue that creators can earn seems to depend on how easily they could leave. Moving one’s email list away from Substack is simple, so the firm lets writers keep 90% of their revenues. Game-makers on Roblox, who are basically stuck there, keep about 25%.
The dancers of TikTok and pranksters of YouTube, whose popularity rises or falls on the tweak of a recommendation algorithm, may seem easily replaceable. In reality, the opportunities for interaction with online stars may make their audiences more loyal than those of other celebrities, Mr Kemp points out. Jennifer Aniston and her buddies were in people’s sitting rooms for half an hour a week. Charli D’Amelio, TikTok’s top bopper, is in their pockets all day. “After a decade of building their audiences, a class of Super Creators have emerged that have leverage over their aggregators,” wrote Rameez Tase, head of Antenna, an audience-measurement company, in a recent blog post. “They simply built such large, engaged audiences that those audiences would follow them anywhere.”
A great multitude
Yet what of those creators with more modest followings? A few online stars earn megabucks, but the tail is long (see charts). Spotify says it wants to give “a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art”. But only about 0.2% of the 7m-plus musicians on the platform make more than $50,000 a year in royalties; just 3% make more than $1,000. There are 20m gaming “experiences” on Roblox, but nearly 15% of all play takes place on one game, “Brookhaven RP”, according to analysis by Ran Mo of Electronic Arts, a game developer. On Patreon, where people can subscribe to creative services of all sorts, 200,000 creators earn a total of $1bn a year. The top earner makes around $2m, but about 98% make less than the federal minimum wage of $1,257 a month.

The main way to monetise online content has been advertising. Making real money requires a huge audience: even 1m views on YouTube might make the poster only about $2,000. Some types of content attract even lower ad rates. PornHub says its amateur contributors earn an average of $0.60 per 1,000 views; 1m hits would net just $600. Ads can make megastars rich, but cannot provide a living for small-time foot goddesses and other niche creators.
The trend towards subscriptions, and other models of monetisation, is changing that, bringing with it the possibility of a creator middle class. Consider Craig Morgan. The sports journalist was laid off last year by the Athletic, an online publication, after the pandemic put live sport on hold. A friend suggested he try writing a newsletter. AZ Coyotes Insider was launched on Substack in July. Its detailed updates about a single National Hockey League team—everything from goaltender Darcy Kuemper’s knee injury to the immigration woes of defenceman Ilya Lyubushkin—are not designed for a wide audience. But with a subscription model, they don’t need one.

Ten months on, Mr Morgan has more than 1,000 people paying a minimum of $5 a month (about 18% voluntarily pay more, he says), close to his old salary on the Athletic. Mr Morgan misses bouncing ideas off colleagues, and the safety-net of an editor. But he can write what he likes—and, he adds, “No one can lay me off anymore.”
Mr Morgan is a living example of the observation in 2008 by Kevin Kelly, a technology writer, that any artist could make a living with just “1,000 true fans” willing to spend $100 a year or so on whatever the creator makes. With that, he wrote, “You can make a living—if you are content to make a living but not a fortune.” The broadening range of online monetisation methods is making it easier to wring that sort of money out of devotees. Video-gamers can top up the money they make from streaming by working as paid wingmen on gaming platforms such as China’s Heizhu Esports. Some creators see non-fungible tokens, a method of certifying digital creations, as a way to earn more from their superfans. With platforms like Teachable or Podia, which deal in pricey online courses, creators can plausibly get by with more like 100 true fans, Ms Jin reckons.

The more possible it becomes to make a living out of online content, the more precarious becomes the position of the companies that have acted as intermediaries between creators and consumers. Newspapers, which solved a physical distribution problem that no individual writer could hope to overcome, are one example. Substack’s leaderboard includes journalists such as Glenn Greenwald and Matthew Yglesias who have found that readers are willing to pay them far more than the outlets that used to employ them (and that newsletters give them greater editorial freedom, too). Some newspapers, most recently the New York Times, have forbidden writers from launching personal newsletters without permission. A tyrannical few deny their writer-serfs bylines, ensuring that the value from every article accrues to the brand and not the author.
Record labels are another endangered middleman. They have historically taken care of turning a song into a hit, in return for an ongoing share of revenues. But more and more artists are going it alone. More than 60,000 new songs are uploaded to Spotify every day, most by bedroom-based rockstars who can use new online services to handle the logistics themselves. UnitedMasters, a music-distribution platform which bills itself as “a record label in your pocket”, recently raised $50m in a venture-capital round led by Apple. Tools like Splice make recording easier. Companies like Fanjoy take care of merchandise.
And financing is getting simpler. One startup, HIFI, helps artists manage their royalties, paying them regularly and fronting them small sums to make up shortfalls. Another, Karat, extends credit to creators based on their follower count. Helped by such services independent artists took home 5.1% of global recorded music revenues last year, up from 1.7% in 2015, calculates MIDiA Research, a consultancy. In the same period the share of the three largest record labels fell from 71.1% to 65.5%.
What has been will be again
Just as the internet allowed brands to bypass physical shops and sell directly to customers online, social platforms “offer a path for creators to communicate directly with their audience,” says Mr Shmulik. Yet they still need the new media platforms, which are becoming more like old media companies. Rather than simply helping consumers navigate a mass of commoditised online content, they play an active role in commissioning and curating it.
Substack insists that advances are determined by “business decisions, not editorial ones”. Yet it offers writers mentoring and legal advice, and will soon provide editing services. YouTubers can post what they like, within broad guidelines, but they cannot monetise content around what YouTube deems “controversial” subjects, including abortion. Twitch has imposed rules for its streamers’ behaviour offline. On May 5th Facebook’s “oversight board”, which rules on editorial matters, upheld Donald Trump’s ban from the platform.
Mr Zuckerberg has said that his social network ought to be treated like something between a phone company, through which information merely flows, and a newspaper, which has editorial control of its content. As his and other platforms more actively court and compensate creators, they are moving further towards the newspaper end of that continuum. ■",1
1650,"THESE TRACKS, from a dried-up lake bed in New Mexico, are one of several sets which radiocarbon evidence suggests were made between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago. They are described in this week’s Science by Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University, in Britain, and his colleagues, and are the oldest undisputed evidence of human beings in North America. Few doubt that the first Americans crossed from Asia, probably over the Bering Strait when low sea levels during the last Ice Age meant it was dry land. Exactly when, though, is unclear. The oldest human fossils in North America date from 13,000 years ago. But evidence from stone tools suggests the presence of people there as far back as 30,000 years in the past. The stone-tool evidence is, however, controversial. Such tools are hard to date directly, and may be moved into sediments older than the date of their creation by animal activity. Footprints, by contrast, stay put.",1
1651,"Sudan suffered its second coup in two years. Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, a former general and the country’s de facto president, seized control just months before he was supposed to step down. He also had the civilian prime minister arrested. Mr Burhan said he had acted to prevent a civil war. Thousands of protesters said no, it was a blatant power grab. Soldiers opened fire on them. At least seven people were killed and 140 wounded. Donors such as America suspended aid, but Mr Burhan hopes for backing from undemocratic foreign powers.
BioNTech, the company that developed the covid-19 vaccine marketed by Pfizer, said it would build factories in Senegal and Rwanda next year. It hopes to produce more doses for Africa, which has 17.5% of the world’s population but has so far received only 2.5% of covid jabs.

President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt lifted a four-year state of emergency. In theory, it will now be less easy for his government to quash protests, arrest dissidents without warrants and limit various freedoms. Critics wondered how much less easy it will really be. America has threatened to withhold aid from Egypt unless it improves its human-rights record.
Israel moved ahead with a proposal to build 3,000 new homes for Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. The Biden administration has condemned the plan. It may also increase tension in Israel’s governing coalition, which includes doveish parties that oppose settlements.
Israel held its biennial Blue Flag military exercise over the Negev desert. Aircraft from America, Britain, France, India and other countries joined the drill. The head of the United Arab Emirates’ air force also watched. The exercise pitted Israel and its allies against the fictional “Dragonland”, which has military capabilities remarkably similar to Iran’s.
A different sort of tweeting
A cyber-attack in Iran disrupted the sale of subsidised fuel, resulting in long queues at petrol stations. A group calling itself “Predatory Sparrow” claimed responsibility, but the authorities blamed an unnamed “state actor”. The hackers also took control of digital billboards, making them ask: “Khamenei, where is our fuel?” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is Iran’s supreme leader.
The UN said that more than half of Afghans would go hungry this winter without help, and that the proportion who subsist on less than $1.90 a day would rise from roughly half before the Taliban seized power in August to a shocking 97% by mid-2022. It said Afghanistan was about to become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Residents of Kabul are selling possessions in the streets to buy food.
Members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) convened virtually. Myanmar was excluded, since its military mounted a coup in February and has been slaughtering protesters since then. It was the first time the group has sanctioned a member state this way. Joe Biden promised to help South-East Asian countries stand up to Chinese aggression. It was the first time in four years that an American president had taken part in an ASEAN meeting.
Hong Kong’s legislature passed a law banning films that the government thinks might threaten China’s national security. Violators may face three years in prison.
China postponed the annual marathon in Beijing because of concerns about the spread of covid-19. It had been due to take place on October 31st. No new date has been set.
The chairman of America’s joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, confirmed that China had tested a hypersonic weapon. He called it a “significant technological event” and “very concerning”.
A committee advising America’s Food and Drug Administration recommended that the Pfizer vaccine for covid-19 be given to children aged five to 11. If approved, the shots will be one-third the strength of the jab given to adults.
Not everyone is happy with having to take the vaccine. New York City’s police union filed a lawsuit against a recent  mandate imposed by the mayor on public-sector employees either to take the jab or to go on unpaid leave. Thousands of workers, mostly firefighters, marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest outside City Hall. Police in Chicago are also up in arms.
Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ordered ten ambassadors, including those of America, France and Germany, to be declared personae non gratae, a prelude to expulsion. The envoys’ sin was to have called for the release of a philanthropist, Osman Kavala, who has been locked up for the past four years on trumped-up charges. The Turkish lira fell to its lowest-ever level against the dollar. America’s embassy said it didn’t meddle in Turkey’s domestic affairs, and Mr Erdogan backed down.
Roll over, Moldova
Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned gas company, told Moldova that it would cut the price of its fuel to the cash-strapped former Soviet republic, if it was prepared to alter its tariff-free trade agreement with the EU. Vladimir Putin insists it is nonsense to say that Russia plays politics with its energy exports.

Colombia said it would extradite Dairo Antonio Úsuga, aka Otoniel, to the United States, after he was captured in a big security operation. Mr Úsuga is said to be the country’s most powerful druglord. His Gulf Clan in northern Colombia is suspected of killing rivals to gain control of cocaine-smuggling routes into Central America.
Pope Francis agreed to visit Canada to take part in the country’s “process of reconciliation with indigenous peoples”. Hundreds of unmarked graves were found earlier this year at sites of former residential schools for indigenous children, most of which were run by the Roman Catholic church. Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, vowed to improve relations with indigenous Canadians. He is still taking flak for skipping the first national day for reconciliation on September 30th to go surfing.",1
1652,"GENETICISTS LIKE to compare progress in their field with the breakneck speed of innovation in computing. There, large, slow mainframes developed into fast, midsized desktops and then into the pocket-sized supercomputers known as smartphones. Similarly, the sequencing of the first human genome was announced, amid great pomp and fanfare, in 2003. It had taken 13 years and cost around $3bn. Two decades on, sequencing a human genome will set you back around $600, and might be done within a week.
Gordon Sanghera, boss of Oxford Nanopore, a firm based in the eponymous British university town, thinks, however, there is room for more. As The Economist went to press his company was set to make its debut on the London Stock Exchange. Its technology, nanopore sequencing, can cut the cost of gene analysis and reduce the time involved from days to hours or even minutes. At the same time, just as smartphones did with computing, it can make gene sequencers small enough to fit in a pocket rather than on a desktop.

Nanopore sequencing employs engineered versions of proteins that, in nature, open holes in cell membranes to allow ions (electrically charged atoms of things like potassium and chlorine) in and out. These proteins are used to punch holes in a membrane separating two chambers full of liquid, and an electrical current is applied. The DNA to be sequenced is then fed through the hole (see diagram). DNA stores its information using four different chemical bases, abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Each has a different shape, and partially blocks the pore in a different way. That causes different fluctuations in the current, allowing the sequence of bases to be read.

The idea of nanopore sequencing dates back to 1990s, says Dr Sanghera. But commercialising it has taken many years. One trick is to ensure DNA molecules move through pores at a predictable speed—and never go backwards—something the firm has solved with a specially designed molecular ratchet. Integrating the biological bits of the technology with the silicon ones has been tricky. And a pore does not, by itself, sense individual bases, but combinations of them. Translating those signals is done with the help of machine learning, a technology that has come into its own only in the past few years.
Nanopore sequencing offers several advantages over other approaches. Its compactness is one. Oxford Nanopore’s smallest product, the MInION, is the size of a chunky mobile phone. Existing sequencers resemble fridge-freezers or (at best) microwave ovens. The MInION’s minuteness permits field analyses, with no need to send samples off to a distant laboratory. It has been used everywhere from Norwegian glaciers to Welsh coal mines to the International Space Station.
Another advantage is speed. Previous technologies have chopped DNA into fragments, made copies and tagged them with fluorescent chemicals. That takes time. The record for sequencing an entire human genome is believed to be 13 hours. Oxford Nanopore reckons it can cut this routinely to a handful of hours. And the nanopore approach also provides a continuous read-out. Other methods deliver a result only at the end.
Chopping DNA into tiny fragments, meanwhile, makes it hard to work out what is going on in regions made up of repetitive sequences. Nanopore-based devices can read pieces of DNA millions of bases long, offering a clearer picture of what is happening. And they can sense methylation—a chemical modification of bases that is an important means by which gene expression is regulated in a body.
Launch sequence
On paper, nanopore sequencing sounds transformative. Whether that will come to pass in reality remains to be seen. Like all good tech startups, Oxford Nanopore has yet to turn a profit, though it hopes to do so within five years. (Its losses last year were £73m, or $98m, on revenues of £114m.) Julian Roberts, an analyst at Jefferies, a bank, says the world market for gene sequencing is worth perhaps $7.5bn a year and is growing “in the low teens [per cent] per year—healthy, but not spectacular”. It is dominated by Illumina, a firm based in San Diego.
But, says Mr Roberts, as with computers, better technology may create new uses, making the market bigger. Cheap, real-time gene sequencing could boost everything from cancer treatment (researchers in Norway are looking to use it to read the genomes of brain tumours during surgery) to environmental modelling to disease surveillance (the usefulness of sequencing in the covid-19 pandemic has put this application, in particular, uppermost in many epidemiologist’s minds).
The firm’s choice to list in London rather than America goes against conventional wisdom, which holds that America offers savvier investors who are more prepared to tolerate losses today for the prospect of a big payout tomorrow. And it hopes, for now, to stay British. Its shareholding structure gives Dr Sanghera (or, if he is unavailable, two other senior managers) the ability to block unwelcome takeovers. Mr Roberts points to the example of Solexa, a British firm bought by Illumina in 2006 for $600m. These days, Solexa’s technology is a foundation of Ilumina’s business, and the American company is worth $64bn. ■",1
1653,"IN YEMEN THEY set off fireworks; in Somalia they handed out sweets; in Syria they praised the Taliban for providing a “living example” of how to “bring down a criminal regime” through jihad. Around the world, jihadists were elated by the fall of Kabul. Through willpower, patience and cunning, a low-budget band of holy warriors has vanquished America and taken charge of a medium-size country. To Muslims who yearn to expel infidels and overthrow secular states, it was evidence that God approves. The ripple effects could be felt far and wide.
In the next few days President Joe Biden will have to sort out the mess he has created at Kabul airport, where throngs are clamouring to flee. It is a dangerous moment for his presidency. In the longer term the world must deal with the boost to jihadism from America’s humiliation. The chief risk is not that terrorists will use Afghanistan as a base from which to strike the West, as they did on September 11th 2001. Such attacks are harder now, since rich countries have better security. Besides, the Taliban are unlikely to tolerate big training camps for global-minded terrorists, as they crave recognition and aid.

Granted, some feel a duty of hospitality to foreign Sunni jihadists, and some will aid their militant cousins in Pakistan, making that nuclear-armed state even less stable. But outside Afghanistan, the main ripple effects will be psychological. The Taliban’s triumph will fire up jihadists in other countries, and spur recruits to join them. Some who live in rich countries will be inspired to commit acts of terrorism there. It does not take many such attacks to sow a sense of fear or roil domestic politics.
Even worse will be the effect in poorer, weaker states, where jihadists aspire not merely to kill but to control territory, or at least prevent the government from doing so. In places like Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Mali, Somalia and Mozambique, they already do. In several other parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, they threaten to. Many are asking: if our Afghan brothers can beat a superpower, surely we can beat our own wretched rulers?

Jihadists are not all the same. Many disagree about doctrine. Many hate and fight each other. Supporters of Islamic State deride the Taliban, absurdly, as American stooges. One of the first things the Taliban did in Kabul last week was to pull the leader of Islamic State in South Asia out of jail and kill him.
Most jihadist groups are motivated primarily by local grievances: a predatory government, an ethnic or sectarian divide, infidel intruders. Yet they also tap into a global narrative. On their phones they see daily evidence that the oppression they face at home is part of wider pattern of persecution of Muslims, from the gulag of Xinjiang to the hellscape of Gaza. When jihadists anywhere succeed, they feel pride—and a call to action.

Bad government creates an opening for jihadism. When a state is unjust, its citizens may imagine that one run by jihadists might be better. Even if they do not take up arms, they may quietly support those who do. Many rural Afghans decided that Taliban justice, though harsh, was quicker and less corrupt than government courts, and that Taliban checkpoints were less plunderous. This is one reason the Taliban’s final march to power met so little resistance. The other was psychological: they won because when America pulled out Afghans did not want to die fighting for a lost cause. Similar principles apply elsewhere. Jihadists in north-eastern Nigeria are hard to beat because locals detest the central government and army officers sell their own men’s weapons to the guerrillas and pocket the cash.
Once jihadists win power, however, they find that their ideology makes governing hard (see our Special report on the Arab world). Their desire to create a perfectly pious society, and ruthless intolerance of deviation from that ideal, make pragmatic compromise tricky. Islamic State’s rule over a big chunk of Iraq and Syria lasted only three years. Its habit of drowning people in cages alienated a potentially sympathetic Sunni population. So did its failure to foster economic activities other than looting and kidnapping. It scared outside powers and Shia Iraqis so much that they clubbed together to crush it.

The Taliban were also dreadful rulers when they last ran Afghanistan. Much depends on whether they have learned from their mistakes. If a group of jihadists could not only seize a country but also run it tolerably well, jihadists everywhere would see it as a beacon. Senior Taliban are at pains to seem pragmatic and insist they will respect human rights. But rocky times lie ahead. Taliban footsoldiers are already committing atrocities. Many urban Afghans, who have tasted the freedom to dress, work and study as they please, even if they are female, despise the new regime. Because reserves are frozen in America, it is short of cash. The Afghan economy has seized up; prices are soaring. The Taliban have yet to unveil good ideas for reviving it. Instead they bluster that skilled Afghans must not emigrate. Skilled Afghans may have other ideas.
One lesson of the Afghan fiasco is that what happens in far-off failing states matters not only to the people who live there, but also to the rest of the world. Calamity in Kabul today means bigger refugee flows, more jihadist attacks and a greater chance that other Islamist insurgencies will prevail. That could destabilise a large number of countries, endangering both locals and the foreigners who visit or do business there.
Another lesson is that a purely military approach to fighting jihadism does little to make the ground less fertile for it. The long-term solution is to build less awful, less exclusive states. If the old Afghan government had been less corrupt and less inept in dealing with tribal power-brokers, it might have proved more resilient. Likewise, if northern Mozambique, southern Thailand, Kashmir or the vast expanses of the Sahel were more benignly ruled, they might not be havens for jihadists.
Improving governance is hard, not least since many countries vulnerable to jihad are also racked by climate change. More frequent droughts add to discontent and stir conflicts over water and pasture. Donors can offer advice and cash, but ultimately it is up to locals to build institutions that work. Unless existing states provide basic services and something resembling justice, the jihadists’ siren song will always sound seductive. ■",1
1654," (CNN)The FBI conducted another search for the remains of one-time Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa last month, this time under a bridge in Jersey City, New Jersey, a source with knowledge of the search told CNN.The FBI obtained a search warrant to conduct a ""site survey"" under the Pulaski Skyway, FBI Special Agent Mara Schneider of the Detroit field office said in a statement Friday. ""On October 25th & 26th, FBI personnel from the Newark and Detroit field offices completed the survey and that data is currently being analyzed,"" Schneider said. ""Because the affidavit in support of the search warrant was sealed by the court, we are unable to provide any additional information.""The FBI used radar equipment to conduct the two-day subterranean search on private property, the source told CNN.Hoffa's presumed death has vexed investigators for decades. He was 62 years old when he was last seen outside the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan on July 30, 1975.One of the most powerful union leaders at a time that unions wielded a great deal of sway over elections -- and were notoriously tied to organized crime -- Hoffa was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud.President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980. But Hoffa tried to regain control of the union, angering his rivals.The FBI has searched various locations in their effort to locate Hoffa's remains but have always come up empty-handed. Hoffa, played by Al Pacino, was a main character in the 2019 Martin Scorsese film ""The Irishman.""The movie was adapted from the book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran, who claimed he shot and killed Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003.",2
1655,"MOST DIABETICS need at least one shot of insulin a day to regulate their blood-sugar levels. Some need four, and in America, drug companies charge about $100 a vial—nearly seven times more than in any other OECD country. Older Americans, a third of whom live with diabetes, could soon pay as little as $35 a month thanks to a bill that the Democrats are trying to fast-track through Congress, much to the dismay of the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that the cost caps will damage innovation.
Prescription drugs in America cost two and a half times more on average than in other developed countries. At the moment the federal government cannot negotiate with pharma firms over the prices of the drugs they sell, as other countries do. In Britain, for example, the NHS negotiates discounted prices with pharmaceutical companies, and only after another public body has determined if a drug is beneficial enough to justify the price. In America, pharmaceutical companies are, in effect, the price makers. If passed, this bill would allow the government to have some say in drug prices for the first time.

On behalf of Medicare patients (those aged 65 or older and the disabled), the bill could empower the health secretary to negotiate lower prices for ten of the costliest drugs by 2025 and 20 by 2028. This includes treatments typically given in hospitals, such as cancer drugs which can cost payers $20,000 a dose, and also prescription drugs taken at home. The plan would also ensure that these patients don’t spend more than $2,000 of their own money on medicine each year, a desirable development since an estimated 18m Americans can’t afford the drugs that they need.

This is, unsurprisingly, not popular with the pharmaceutical industry. Many new drugs developed today rely on venture-capital investments in small biotech firms to carry out risky research. Investors are incentivised by the promise of substantial returns, since America’s pharmaceutical behemoths eventually sell these drugs at high prices. The plan before Congress also curbs pharmaceuticals from increasing some of their drug prices more than the rate of inflation each year. This sounds good for consumers, but PhRMA, the industry’s lobbying group, maintains that this bill will up-end America’s “global leadership in biomedical innovation”. Will it?
Although high prices can subsidise research, the bill has been tweaked to reduce the impact on new drugs. The Democrats’ previous proposal would have introduced price negotiations and inflation caps for 250 drugs, for everyone. Had this been made law, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that eight fewer drugs would have been brought to market over a decade (which is either a little or a lot, depending on your medical prognosis). But in the current plan, only ten of the costliest drugs will be affected at first by inflation caps. What is more, these caps will apply only after the drugs have been on the market for a while: nine years for cheaper small-molecule drugs and 12 years for the more complex biologics.
Pharmaceuticals and their investors often make their money back, and then some, much faster than this. Take Gilead Sciences, for example, which bought the biotech Pharmasset—and their Hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi—for $11.2bn in 2011. Gilead recouped almost all of that in 2014 alone. In short, the bill strikes a balance that minimises innovation risks while still granting the government some much-needed negotiating power. Even the representatives most critical of drug-pricing reforms, such as Senator Kyrsten Sinema, seem to have come around.■

1656,"ANYBODY MULLING a career as a midwife or nursery manager might want to reconsider. On October 14th the Office for National Statistics reported that in 2020 the fertility rate in England and Wales, which is expressed as the number of children per woman, fell to 1.58, the lowest since records began in 1938. Babies are particularly scarce in inner London. Just 5,442 were born in the borough of Newham last year, down from 6,426 in 2012. And almost all were conceived before covid-19 made the prospect of going into hospital unappealing. The tally for 2021 may well be lower.
Birth rates can fall for several reasons. Couples may decide to stop at two children rather than going for a third. Gaps between pregnancies can extend. If women merely delay having children, the fertility rate will fall and then rebound, as happened to some extent in the 1970s and again around the turn of the century. But this time it looks as if people are going without altogether.

A recent article by John Ermisch, an Oxford University sociologist, finds that the drop in the English and Welsh fertility rate has been caused largely by a decline in first births. Women without university degrees, who have historically been more likely to have children, are emulating the better-educated. If the current pattern holds, Mr Ermisch reckons, 21% of women will have no children—back to the level of the cohort born in 1920 (see chart).

Although the stereotype of a childless woman is a trouser-suited careerist running too late to the IVF clinic, the reality is different. One study of Britons born in 1970 found that the two most important reasons for remaining childless, among both men and women, were that they did not particularly want children or did not meet the right partner. That hints at a broad change in norms and expectations. A new paper on America by Melissa Schettini Kearney and two other economists comes to similar conclusions. They think fertility is declining not because of economic pressures, but because people’s assumptions about life and families have changed. In particular, children are thought to require much more effort and attention than was the case in the past.
Few old people are childless today. Those celebrating their 80th birthdays this year belong to a cohort born in 1941, among whom only 11% ended up child-free. Falling fertility and growing lifespans mean that the number of childless 80-year-olds will triple over the next two decades, according to the ONS, and seems likely to rise thereafter. That will put more pressure on the care system, because old people without children are more likely to receive formal care.
Culture might change, too. British novels used to be stuffed with elderly bachelors, spinsters and maiden aunts, but they faded from view in the 20th century. “The position of an unmarried, unattached, ageing woman is of no interest whatsoever to the writer of modern fiction,” complained a character in “Quartet in Autumn”, a novel in 1977 by Barbara Pym, who was the standout exception to the rule. Bring back the literary spinster—or, failing that, look to Pym’s novels for a vision of the future.",1
1657,"OF THE ESTIMATED 55m people living with dementia around the world, only one-quarter have been formally diagnosed with the condition. There are many reasons for this. Two are enduring: many patients and clinicians alike wrongly believe that dementia is an inevitable part of the ageing-human condition and, being incurable, is hardly worth diagnosing; and some people experiencing cognitive impairment fear hearing what sounds like a sentence of brain-death, and so do not seek help.
Some of the reasons for non-diagnosis, however, may be about to change. During the covid-19 pandemic many people have delayed consulting their doctors about non-urgent conditions, and as lockdowns ease, they may begin to ask for professional guidance (moreover, evidence suggests that covid itself heightens the risk of dementia). In addition, diagnostic techniques, hitherto unreliable, time-consuming and costly, are becoming available, and for some forms of dementia hopes are emerging of more effective treatments.

Dementia is normally diagnosed by testing cognitive functions such as memory. If mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often a precursor to dementia, is detected, a patient may then be referred for tests to identify which of the dozens of causes of dementia are to blame. By far the most common is Alzheimer’s disease, accounting for 60-80% of cases.
Fear of the needle
Identifying Alzheimer’s normally requires a brain scan, and perhaps a lumbar puncture (the insertion of a needle into the lower spine), to extract cerebrospinal fluid, so as to measure its levels of two proteins that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, known as beta-amyloid and tau. Some patients are reluctant to undergo the intrusive procedure. The scans are usually by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), to look at the size of the brain, along with a positron-emission tomography (PET) scan to measure the build-up of beta-amyloid. PET and MRI scanners are expensive pieces of kit, running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For most people in the world, they are unobtainable.
That explains the excitement at the development of simple blood tests to distinguish Alzheimer’s from other neurodegenerative conditions. One, announced last year and likely to be validated for routine use within 12 months, according to Serge Gauthier, professor of neurology and neurosurgery at McGill University in Montreal, measures a form of tau called p-tau217. It has been found to predict Alzheimer’s with 96% accuracy.
It is already possible using mass spectrometry, which detects how atoms and molecules are deflected by magnetic fields, to measure the level of beta-amyloid in the blood. But it is not certain how this relates to levels in the brain. The accuracy of the procedure rises to 94% if two other risk factors are considered: age and the presence of a form of the APOE gene, known as APOE4, which heightens the risk of developing Alzheimer’s (and also appears to increase vulnerability to heart disease and covid). This can also be detected by a blood test, so Dr Gauthier envisages symptomatic patients giving blood samples for simultaneous tests for both tau and APOE4.
Other approaches aim to detect asymptomatic people years or even decades before they begin to show obvious symptoms. George Stothart at the University of Bath in Britain leads a team that has developed very quick passive tests that hold great promise for detecting cognitive impairment early. These tests use electroencephalographic caps which are worn on the head to compare brainwave responses to a series of images. The caps are relatively cheap and the test can be conducted using a tablet computer.
Taking the exam
Meanwhile, machine-learning and AI are enabling big improvements in cognitive testing, which, like other sorts of pencil-and-paper exams, has been prone to cultural and educational bias, and to a “learning bias” (lessened accuracy as practice improves the participants’ results). Cognetivity Neurosciences, for example, a firm launched by two academics at the University of Cambridge, produces an “integrated cognitive assessment” that has already been deployed by some regions of Britain’s National Health Service. It has also been approved by America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by regulators in the European Union.
The Cognetivity test relies on a series of flashing images, among which some animals have been embedded for the person being tested to identify—rather like the CAPTCHA tests used by some websites to weed out robots trying to log on, only these are conducted at rapid speeds. So rapid, indeed, that the tests cannot be conducted remotely, but are done on tablets in memory clinics or at doctors’ surgeries. Already, however, a variety of do-it-yourself cognitive tests of various standards are available online, and some of these could become important diagnostic tools.
Even before the explosion in the use of AI, scientists could detect evidence of dementia from how people use words. A study in 2011, for example, found clear retrospective evidence in the writings in her 40s and 50s of Iris Murdoch, a novelist, of the Alzheimer’s she was to die with in 1999, aged 79. The research arm of IBM, a computing giant, has used data from the Framingham heart study, which has tracked three generations of people in a town in Massachusetts since 1948 to improve knowledge of cardiovascular health. Ajay Royyuru, who heads IBM’s health-care and life-sciences research, says that studying the use of language by participants in the study suggests that changes over time can be used to predict which of them will acquire dementia, seven and a half years before they are diagnosed even with MCI.
Such data—and the massive amounts people compile every day on their smartphones, using various services such as messaging or navigation—could help enable much earlier detection of dementia. This might be possible with apps, although the ethics of any non-consensual diagnosis and the willingness of people to use such services are another matter. One way or another, though, Paola Barbarino, chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International, an advocacy group, expects a “tsunami” of demand for treatment.
For health-care systems around the world all this may pose more problems than it solves. The main one is the lack of proven treatments. In June the FDA approved Aduhelm, the first drug to treat Alzheimer’s. A monoclonal antibody shown to reduce accumulations of beta-amyloid, it has so far been little used, because it is expensive and insurers are reluctant to approve reimbursement when there are doubts as to whether it actually slows cognitive degeneration. But it is the first in a queue of drugs, for which Alzheimer’s specialists hold out great hopes.
The second difficulty is in assessing when MCI requires medical intervention. As Dr Gauthier points out, some mental decline is indeed part of ageing. People find ways of coping. Telling the difference is hard to do through blood tests or the use of AI. It still requires time and human intervention. This is part of the third and biggest difficulty: that, as the world ages, the number of people with dementia is going to rise rapidly, to more than 80m by 2030 and more than 140m by 2050. Even today health services are buckling. Who knows how they will cope in the decades ahead. ■

1658,"FOR FIFTY years the Scottish National Party (SNP) ran on oil. The discovery of deposits beneath the North Sea in 1969 transformed Britain’s public finances, and ignited the separatist movement. Before the independence referendum of 2014, Alex Salmond, the party’s leader, told Scots that Westminster had frittered away their riches, pointing to Norway’s sovereign wealth fund as an example to follow. Even after defeat, Nicola Sturgeon, his successor, charmed oil executives, stressing their shared ambition to suck the seabed dry.
These days the party is conflicted. Increasingly, the young and idealistic independence movement is stirred by climate change, an issue to which it argues Britain’s Conservative government pays insufficient attention. Yet the Scottish government, normally attentive to the desires of its supporters, is struggling to wean itself off the black stuff. Nationalism’s animating cause, and for decades its fiscal panacea, is not easy to give up.

The tension has become a headache for Ms Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister. Siccar Point Energy, a developer backed by the private-equity firms Blackstone and Bluewater, has applied for permission to start drilling in the Cambo oilfield off Shetland, which would fill as many as 800m barrels of oil over 25 years. The decision lies with the British government, a fact that would not normally stop Ms Sturgeon from expressing a view.
This time it has. On August 12th Ms Sturgeon wrote to Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, urging him to review whether drilling was compatible with the country’s emissions targets. Her own verdict was left unsaid. She acted after being confronted in her constituency by climate activists, to whom she also failed to give an answer. The SNP is negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party, which opposes the drilling and supports independence. If a deal is struck, it would cement a cross-party majority in the Scottish Parliament for a new referendum.
The SNP’s leadership knows the economics of resource nationalism are weaker than ever. Once, North Sea taxes went some way to fill the theoretical gap between public expenditure and tax receipts in an independent Scotland. Before the referendum, Mr Salmond declared the country to be on the cusp of a “second oil boom”, and said revenues could total £57bn ($90bn) in the next six years—nearly double the forecast of the British government’s fiscal watchdog.

Instead, they collapsed (see chart), repeatedly underperforming forecasts. Tax receipts came to just £414m last year, according to figures published on August 18th. Some 44bn barrels of oil (or the equivalent in gas) have been drawn from the ageing North Sea basin in the past 50 years; 10bn-20bn may remain, of which just 5bn have been confirmed or are reckoned to be extractable.
But the sector still employs tens of thousands of Scots, mostly in parliamentary seats in the north-east which teeter between the SNP and the pro-oil Conservatives. The nationalists’ ambition has been to replace oil jobs with new ones in green energy. Wind farms have proliferated, but they have been largely constructed abroad. A report by the Scottish Government’s “just-transition commission” published in March warned that the failure risks undermining the support of working-class Scots for decarbonisation.
Ms Sturgeon thus finds herself straddling two political constituencies, and two visions of independence: one green, the other black. She has happily opposed fracking and nuclear energy in Scotland, despite both strictly sitting under the control of the government in Westminster. On the Cambo oilfield, she is content for Mr Johnson to make the call. Once the SNP declared: “It’s Scotland’s oil.” These days it’s London’s problem. ■",1
1659,"IN BRANDING TERMS, Ireland is a superpower, from world-famous writers and musicians to the Irish-themed pubs scattered across the globe. But for business, as its government’s department of finance cheerily acknowledges, the 12.5% corporate-tax rate introduced in 2003 is “at the centre of the ‘Irish brand’”. Irish operations are central to the tax planning of many multinationals, among them Google, Apple, Pfizer and Johnson  Johnson. And they, in turn, have been so central to Ireland’s economy that its government long held fast against demands to raise the rate, despite endless complaints from other members of the European Union about undercutting and unfair competition.
On October 7th Ireland finally buckled, agreeing to raise its corporate-tax rate for large companies to 15%, a proposed global baseline, as part of a broader attempt to crack down on corporate tax avoidance. It was not only a big policy shift for the Republic, but a reminder, if one were needed, of the weakness of the devolved administration in Northern Ireland, and its politicians’ inability to seize opportunities and make trade-offs.

For the six counties of the island that remain part of the United Kingdom, the Republic’s low-tax policy has long provoked envy and an urge to emulate it. In 2015, after more than a decade of lobbying Westminster, the devolved administration in Stormont gained the power to lower its corporate-tax rate. It was the sole big idea for transforming a region that had been left painfully dependent on the public sector by 30 years of sectarian violence. When it was first mooted, the UK-wide rate was 30%. But by 2015 it had fallen to 20%. Nevertheless, Stormont announced that year that it would cut its rate to 12.5% in 2018.
Under European Union state-aid law, such a policy was permissible only if Northern Ireland bore the cost, estimated at the time as around £275m ($375m) a year, or 0.6% of its GDP. The British Treasury imposed another condition: that the devolved administration got its finances in order. But in 2016 the “cash for ash” scandal came to light. A scheme intended to boost renewable energy was so badly designed that people who burned wood pellets received subsidies higher than the cost of the fuel.
The scandal caused the devolved government to collapse, and Northern Ireland did without an administration for three years. In the meantime came the vote to leave the European Union. Then covid-19 struck. But as the province emerges on the other side of both Brexit and pandemic, a corporate-tax cut looks as distant as ever.
Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, European state-aid law still applies to swathes of Northern Ireland’s economy. And post-covid belt-tightening means that Westminster would in any case be unlikely to make up a revenue shortfall. Cutting corporate taxes “would only be possible if it was affordable,” says Conor Murphy, the finance minister for the devolved government, “which it is not at this time, given the very constrained budgetary position we face and the huge pressures on public services, particularly health”.
In March the Northern Irish administration appointed Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London-based think-tank, to examine whether more tax powers could be devolved to the province. Last month he told an audience in Belfast that although low corporation tax had played a role in the Republic’s prosperity, other policies had mattered, too: a long-term economic strategy and stable tax system, investment in technology and education, access to the single market, and plenty of immigration. “You need to pull that lever alongside a whole bunch of other things to be effective,” he said, “and it may be less effective now than it would have been 20 years ago.”
Hold me back and let me at him
That highlights Northern Ireland’s dilemma. Even if it slashes corporation tax, it does not have the Republic’s consensus on keeping the rate low. Companies considering investing in Northern Ireland would worry that politicians would change their minds. Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, which is expected to gain the largest number of seats in next year’s elections to Stormont, likes the idea of cutting corporation tax mainly because it likes harmonising policies across the island, never mind what those policies are. But on corporate tax, that nationalistic principle clashes with its left-wing economic ideology (it regards leftists in Cuba and Venezuela as fellow-travellers, though has been much less radical in government).
In April 2023 the UK-wide corporation-tax rate is slated to rise to 25%, re-widening the gap that the tax rise in the Republic is about to narrow. A higher mainland rate means the possibility of gaining a larger competitive advantage—but also a bigger loss of revenue, unless the lower taxes are more than counterbalanced by an ensuing boost to investment and economic activity. But given the chance to test their big idea, politicians used to other people doing the taxing while they do the spending have failed to screw up the courage. ■",1
1660,"UNTIL A FEW weeks ago only political junkies knew who Peter Marki-Zay was. That changed with his unexpected victory on October 17th in the run-off of the first-ever primary for the Hungarian opposition. The 49-year-old mayor of Hodmezovasarhely, a smallish and almost unpronounceable town in south-eastern Hungary, was elected by supporters of six parties as their candidate to try to replace Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, at parliamentary elections next April.
“We won the battle, but we need to win the war,” said Mr Marki-Zay, a conservative Catholic not affiliated with any party, at a rally in Budapest. Several politicians stood next to him, as did several relatives (he is a father of seven). Notably absent was his rival, Klara Dobrev, a vice-president of the European Parliament. Ms Dobrev merely acknowledged her defeat and pledged to support Mr Marki-Zay in his quest to remove Mr Orban from power.

Ms Dobrev won the first round of the primaries last month and Mr Marki-Zay had come third after Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of Budapest. Yet (after some hesitation) Mr Karacsony withdrew in Mr Marki-Zay’s favour. Both reckoned that Ms Dobrev could not beat Mr Orban, mainly because she is married to Ferenc Gyurcsany, a wildly unpopular former prime minister who faced riots in 2006 after revelations that he had repeatedly lied about the state of the economy.
Now comes the harder part. The six opposition parties that range from leftist and liberal parties such as Momentum and Democratic Coalition to Jobbik, a former far-right party that has become more moderate in recent years, need to maintain their united front. As well as electing a common candidate for prime minister they have picked one unified candidate for each of Hungary’s 106 constituencies. But even before the run-off they had started bickering. The small-town mayor accused Ms Dobrev of blackmailing politicians into voting for her. Ms Dobrev accused Mr Marki-Zay of methods reminiscent of Mr Orban and Donald Trump.
The opposition still needs to do a lot to win a majority, especially in smaller cities, says Robert Laszlo of Political Capital, a research outfit in Budapest. Forging a single joint list for the 93 proportionally elected seats will be the main source of conflict, he predicts; but he also worries about a fight for dominance between the allied parties. Moreover, Fidesz, the party of Mr Orban, will do whatever it can to drive wedges between the allies.
Mr Orban, who controls a two-thirds majority in parliament, will use every tool in his box to defeat his rival. He would have preferred to fight Mr Karacsony or Ms Dobrev, as the claim that the opposition is a puppet of Mr Gyurcsany will not be effective against a rural, conservative mayor. He will probably attack Mr Marki-Zay’s hectic manner, his unpredictability and his penchant for long speeches. He will no doubt label him an “American agent”, since he once worked for a car-parts firm in America, and that is all the evidence a conspiracy-monger like Mr Orban needs.
The prime minister is diligently wooing voters with their own money. He promises to send $2bn on a tax refund for families early next year. Pensioners will get a special bung in November and two weeks of extra state-pension payments in January. The minimum wage will rise.
Mr Orban’s friends control most media outlets. He can also count on the support of the various oligarchs who became rich on his watch. Yet despite all the prime minister’s advantages, polls put his challenger neck-and-neck with him. If the opposition alliance wins, Mr Marki-Zay has promised to mend fences with the European Union. He wants Hungary to join the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which can investigate the theft of EU funds—a huge problem in Hungary. He also wants to prepare his country to adopt the euro.
Mr Marki-Zay has already surprised observers twice, first by winning the mayor’s office in a town previously loyal to Fidesz, and then by prevailing in the primary. A third upset—beating the man who made Hungary a byword for demagoguery—will be harder still. But it is not impossible. ■",1
1661,"TO TRAVEL AROUND Durban last week was to witness scenes of wholesale devastation. Shopping centres were ransacked, with nothing left but decapitated mannequins lying amid broken glass. Torched factories smouldered, the smell of burnt materials wafting on the breeze from the Indian Ocean. Not that one could escape into the water. A noxious spill, thought to be from a scorched chemical warehouse, had closed the beach.
Elsewhere a humanitarian crisis was spreading. Queues for food snaked for ever. The main motorway into the city was closed after dozens of lorries were set alight. The country’s largest factory making anti-retroviral drugs was up in smoke. Vital supplies of bread, pills and nappies had to be flown in from Johannesburg. The city that hosts one of Africa’s busiest ports looked like the site of a natural disaster.

As in the case of America’s Hurricane Katrina, the carnage revealed much about the country in which it occurred—except that in South Africa the disaster was entirely man-made. In particular, the worst violence since the end of apartheid puts a spotlight on the party of Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC). Its failure to build a properly functioning state and to deliver economic growth created the potential for chaos. Its own factional battles set the timing. The effects of the destruction will be felt for years in Africa’s most industrialised country.
The proximate cause of the unrest is clear. On July 7th Jacob Zuma began a 15-month prison sentence for defying an order by the Constitutional Court to appear at an inquiry into vast corruption during his presidency of 2009-18. Messages calling for an uprising soon spread on social media. Thousands of people in townships in the provinces of Gauteng, which contains Johannesburg, and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the birthplace of Mr Zuma and home to the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, descended on factories, warehouses and malls. They were cheered on by those close to Mr Zuma, such as his daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla. Her twin brother, Duduzane Zuma, who has political ambitions, said people should steal “carefully” and “responsibly”. He later noted that the loss of at least 276 lives was “not an ideal situation for them and for any of us”.

And allies of Mr Zuma did more than cheer. On July 16th President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke of an “insurrection” and “nothing less than a deliberate, co-ordinated and well-planned attack on our democracy”. Three days later the government said it had arrested six of the “instigators”. On July 20th Mr Ramaphosa mentioned the use of “criminal networks” to organise looting. Though this may not have been a coup attempt, it was certainly an effort to render the country ungovernable and Mr Ramaphosa unpopular, so as to force the release of Mr Zuma and let his friends reassert control of the ANC.
Edendale, a township outside Pietermaritzburg, was among the first to explode. “Society is divided,” explains Michael Malinga, who farms chickens having recently lost his job with a local NGO. “These are the people who are envious of the good life that is being lived over there,” he said, pointing towards affluent suburbs. Although Mr Zuma’s incarceration was the “trigger”, he says, “looting didn’t take much to trigger.”
Peering at South Africa’s statistics verges on voyeurism. The unemployment rate, 33% in the first quarter of 2021, is the highest on record, perhaps the highest in the world. And it excludes those who have given up looking. Nearly half of black South Africans cannot find work or have stopped trying. Roughly 13m South Africans (22%) were hungry even before covid-19’s third wave, according to a survey.
Lockdowns have pushed people deeper into poverty. Poor workers, nearly all of whom are not white, are almost four times as likely to have lost jobs since covid-19 than higher-paid ones. The end of welfare grants introduced at the start of the virus has led to more hunger. A booze ban announced on June 27th has created “alcohol-thirsty people”, says Mr Malinga.
Desperation explains some of the horror. At a supermarket near Edendale five people died in a stampede; in a similar scene in Soweto ten perished. Other images shared on social media hint at the inequality behind the dash for goods, such as the woman who reportedly ended up with a couch worth 68,000 rand ($4,600) that was far too big to fit in her shack. “This is as close to a rebellion against inequality as SA has ever come,” argues Jonny Steinberg, a South African writer.
As more people joined in the looting, others began to feel left out. “We’ve become a joke, us people who don’t loot. People say ‘you’re stupid’”, says Kwasi Molefe, from the Chesterville township near Durban. Some people did not want to steal but feared there might be no food left in the shops, explains a grandmother.
Whatever the precise mix of conspiracy and poverty behind the violence, it was facilitated by failures of security. Police watched as people piled contraband onto pickup trucks. In downtown Pietermaritzburg one ransacked supermarket is around the corner from the main police station. Neither the criminal-intelligence branch of the police nor the domestic spy agency saw the violence coming or forewarned others in government. It took almost a week for the deployment of up to 25,000 troops to be authorised, a move that ultimately helped quell the chaos.

As so often, ordinary South Africans filled the gap left by the state. At night in the suburbs of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and in smaller KZN towns, pallets, branches and barbed wire were shoved into street entrances as barricades. Residents, some armed, took turns to stand guard overnight.
In most cases these vigils were peaceful. “I’ve never felt safer,” says Wimpie De Lange at the barricade between Chesterville and Westville, a suburb on the other side of the motorway. “This is South Africa. We come together after chaos.” At a roadblock in Pietermaritzburg a group of whites and South Africans of Indian descent joked with black students entering nearby university halls of residence. In case of trouble the whites had golf clubs and the Indians cricket bats.
But tensions have risen, at times fatally. In Phoenix, an Indian township north of Durban, at least 20 deaths have been reported. In a nearby black township residents say that family members were racially profiled and shot by Indians. Police and human-rights groups are investigating.
Even in peaceful areas some are uneasy about the roadblocks. Mbali Ntuli, a member of the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), who lives in a Durban suburb, says, “I don’t feel super comfortable as a black person with people asking me whether I live here.” She notes that it reminds her mother of apartheid, when black South Africans needed passes to enter white areas. Yet, adds Ms Ntuli, she understands the need for communities to protect themselves. “People are realising how exposed and unprotected we are.” For many, she says, “this is the final straw.”
Shades of the bad old days
It is a long cry from April 1994. Back then the world watched as South Africans queued from dawn to vote in the country’s first fully democratic election. Today the queues are for food, petrol and medicine. How did it come to this?
For most of the 20th century South Africa was a white-supremacist state. The creation of modern South Africa in 1910 established peace between Afrikaners (those of mainly Dutch descent) and British settlers at the expense of black people. The brutality of apartheid, introduced in 1948, built on colonial foundations. Under the National Party whites benefited from state largesse while non-whites were violently displaced and exploited. By the late 1980s white rule was morally and literally bankrupt. Pressure from the anti-apartheid struggle, capital flight and the end of the cold war brought about its demise.
The negotiated transition is seen by many on the left as a stitch-up. Blacks may have got the vote, goes the argument, but economic power remained with whites. “We missed the boat in 1994. We have no one to blame but ourselves,” says Important Mkhize, a leftist ANC figure, referring to his party’s apparent failings.
Such views, like mutterings about how life was better under apartheid, are overly cynical. Under Mandela (president from 1994 to 1999) and his successor, Thabo Mbeki (1999-2008), life improved for nearly all South Africans. Proper houses were built roughly ten times faster than shacks. Townships got running water and electricity. A basic welfare state was established. “Social grant” recipients rose from 2.5m to 12.4m under Mr Mbeki. His government’s sensible macroeconomic policies and a commodities boom raised growth to an average of 5% a year for four straight years for the first time since the 1960s. Unemployment went from horrific to merely awful.
Yet trouble was brewing. A corrupt arms deal in 1999, for which Mr Zuma still faces charges, set the standard for future graft. Black Economic Empowerment, a policy that incentivises firms to give equity to black investors or business to black-owned suppliers, has created a new generation of Randlords with more political acumen than entrepreneurial talent. “Cadre deployment”, whereby ANC party members get jobs on the basis of factional fealty rather than merit, has degraded the state. These appointees steer contracts towards chosen “tenderpreneurs”, who in turn donate to the party. By 2007 Kgalema Motlanthe, a party grandee, said: “This rot is across the board...Almost every project is conceived because it offers opportunities for certain people to make money.”
The blackouts that still plague the country began under Mr Mbeki, who neglected Eskom, the state power utility. His abject handling of the AIDS plague cost at least 330,000 lives, according to a Harvard study. It also contributed to his loss in a factional battle to Mr Zuma, who took over as the ANC’s president in 2007. That moment was crucial in fragmenting the party. What one ANC official called the party’s “rational centre” could no longer hold. Anarchy was loosed upon the country.
At its heart was Mr Zuma. Under him much of the progress was squandered. Corruption soared. The lure of jobs in the party led to scores of assassinations, most of them in KZN, where Mr Zuma’s fellow Zulus predominate. Agencies meant to stop crime ran smear campaigns on political enemies. Government came to resemble an organised-crime gang.
The economy was not helped by the global financial crisis and the end of the commodities boom. But “state capture” made things worse by deterring investment. Though growth slowed, the government kept on spending, more than doubling the share of debt to GDP during Mr Zuma’s reign. Much of this was directed to looted state-owned enterprises and wage rises for existing public-sector workers. To try to keep finances in check, the Treasury increased regressive taxes and ministries slowed the hiring of teachers, nurses and police. The result, writes Michael Sachs, a former Treasury official, is that “the real value of public services—particularly to the poor—has fallen.”
A year after bruising local-election results in 2016, the party rejected Mr Zuma and his preferred successor (an ex-wife). They turned instead to Mr Ramaphosa, who promised more jobs and less graft. His approach has been to lead from behind, appointing people to key jobs and leaving them alone. But he has not gone far enough. The “security cluster”, especially police and spies, is ineffectual. His cabinet remains replete with incompetents. Mr Ramaphosa’s defenders argue that he has to tread carefully because he needs to win internal ANC elections to stay in power. Yet South Africans are frustrated that he puts party before country.
The result of ANC misrule has been the entrenchment of two South Africas. In one, a multi-racial, but still disproportionately white, minority lives in a privatised bubble: private security, private schools, private health care and, increasingly, private (solar or generator) electricity and (borehole) water, too. In the other live most black and mixed-race (“coloured”) South Africans, with shoddy services, joblessness and hungry stomachs.
Before the unrest, NGOs working in townships warned of simmering tensions taken to boiling point by covid-19. The South African Human Rights Commission recently called Alexandra, a Johannesburg township, a “ticking time bomb”. The Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity Group said on June 30th, with devastating prescience, that “high food prices and no jobs could lead to social disorder and social instability.”
After the failure to heed those warnings, South Africa’s future is uncertain. The violence has damaged an already fragile economy. Gauteng and KZN account for half of the country’s GDP. Roughly 200 shopping centres and 3,000 shops were ransacked. Several small towns in KZN lost nearly all of their shops. In townships the economic self-harm has flabbergasted some residents. “We destroyed the amenities we had fought so hard for,” says Richard Yangaphi of Alexandra.
In KZN alone 150,000 jobs may be at risk. One supermarket employee, Mike Nkwana, has not worked since rioting destroyed his workplace, so has been unable to feed his children. He brings up the added impact of “the black tax”: on average one South African wage supports the livelihoods of 4.3 people, a burden disproportionately shouldered by black employees. “I don’t only look after my family,” he says.
Guns n’ hoses
Firms will ponder the risk of further unrest when making investment decisions. Toyota, which has a plant in Durban, told the municipality that it was “feeling very uncertain about the future of our business in KwaZulu-Natal”. Traders who rely on the port may look to alternatives such as Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. Emigration enquiries have reportedly soared.
Those who stay may take extra precautions. Denzil Smith, a B owner in Pietermaritzburg with a fondness for Victorian knick-knacks, is not your natural vigilante. “But after this I’m definitely getting a gun,” he says. South Africa’s “enclave society”, as Frans Cronje, a political analyst, calls it, may take deeper root.
There will be political effects, too. If Mr Ramaphosa does not push Zuma-era figures out of the party, they may jump. “The violence, looting and arson of the past week will change the ANC for ever,” argues William Gumede, a former anti-apartheid activist and commentator. “It has hastened the [Zuma] faction’s own departure from the ANC.” If Mr Zuma’s supporters flee the party, that would probably mean losses for the ANC in KZN at local elections scheduled for October (though they may be delayed by covid-19). Whether it would cause losses elsewhere is less clear. “People don’t feel they have a lot of options,” notes Ms Ntuli.
Even so, the unrest may speed the ANC’s secular decline. Polling suggests that fewer than half of 15- to 50-year-olds support the party. Its voters are increasingly old and rural in a young and urban country. The ANC looks ever more like Zimbabwe’s Zanu-PF and other “liberation” parties in southern Africa, which depend on rural voters (and rigging) to win elections. Mr Ramaphosa may be the last ANC leader with a national majority. That could mean a coalition of moderate elements from the ANC and DA. But it could also pave the way for the entry of left-wing populism exploiting the country’s poverty, or a right-wing version playing on fears of crime and xenophobia.

Is there reason for optimism? South Africa has defied the odds before. It did not descend into violence, as some feared, after 1994. Desmond Tutu’s commission brought some truth and a little reconciliation. Just 18% of South Africans feel there has been no progress at reconciliation since the end of apartheid, according to a survey in 2019. “A vast majority of South Africans are proud to be South African,” it concluded. An imaginative politician could galvanise the country’s pragmatism and patriotism.
Such spirit was on show in townships after the chaos subsided. In Alexandra two young residents joined hundreds in a clean-up. Talia Mogano, 17, says of the looters: “Life isn’t fair, yes, but what they did wasn’t right either. They should have had a protest but what they did was a crime.” Her friend, Thabang Kanetsi, is buoyed by the many who have risen at dawn to collect brooms and bin bags. “Everything is going to go back to normal,” he says. “I have faith in this community and this country.” But South Africa’s problem is that going back to normal may not be enough. ■",1
1662,"SUGA YOSHIHIDE, Japan’s prime minister, had been plotting for his re-election as late as September 2nd. The next day, he emerged from a meeting with the other leaders of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) looking crestfallen. With his approval ratings wallowing and his support inside the party hollowing, he declared that he would not run in the party’s leadership race after all. Mr Suga’s about-face has left the LDP—and Japan’s political future—in flux. The party will vote for a new president on September 29th. The winner will become prime minister and lead the LDP into lower-house elections that must be held by late November.
Four contenders stand out so far: Kishida Fumio, a former foreign minister, has good relationships within the party, but limited popular support. Kono Taro, a former foreign and defence minister and the current vaccine tsar, is social-media savvy, and, at 58, on the younger side by Japanese standards. Though popular with the public, his reputation as a maverick puts off many in the party. Takaichi Sanae, a former internal-affairs minister, has scant name recognition, but is a budding darling of the LDP’s right wing. Ishiba Shigeru, a former defence minister, may enter the fray as well. He too has sizeable public support but little among colleagues.

None of the four represents radical change in policy terms. All are staunch supporters of the alliance with America, and favour shoring up Japan’s own defences in the face of Chinese expansionism. None will move to reverse the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy or to impose fiscal austerity. There are subtle differences emerging over how exactly to handle relations with China, how loose to be with different forms of stimulus, how to shape Japan’s energy policy and how to manage the covid-19 pandemic. But the main faultlines are instead generational and presentational: between a predictable, old-style party man in Mr Kishida; the independent-minded, more charismatic Mr Kono; and a nationalist firebrand in Ms Takaichi.
In public opinion polls Mr Kono comes out on top. Yet the public does not decide LDP elections. The initial ballot combines the party’s 383 members of the Diet and another 383 votes that reflect the choices of the party’s 1.1m members. If no candidate wins a majority, as is often the case, the top two move to a run-off in which Diet members’ votes have far more weight. They tend to vote in blocs along factional lines, but this time around, younger MPs are chafing at the older faction bosses’ control.
The outcome of the race will depend on backroom wheeling and dealing and inter-factional horse-trading, but also on how worried the party’s leadership is about the looming Diet elections and on how much influence younger backbenchers, who prefer Mr Kono, can exert. For the party’s old guard, Mr Kishida may seem a safer bet. Ms Takaichi, a regular visitor to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, is attractive to those on the right. Mr Ishiba could upend the race further by entering himself or explicitly backing one of the others.
Before the eight-year premiership of Abe Shinzo, Mr Suga’s predecessor, Japan ran through six prime ministers in six years. There is a risk that Mr Suga’s resignation will precipitate a similar spell of turmoil. But it may also open the door to a new era. As Mr Suga’s abrupt resignation suggests, at this stage, uncertainty is the only certainty. ■",1
1663,"A former party girl has revealed how converting to Islam 'bettered her character' and saved her from a 'dark place' after her hedonistic lifestyle left her feeling suicidal. 
Persephone Rizvi, 27, from Huddersfield, told how she used to spend her weekends getting into fights, drinking until 5am and waking up with a hangover before converting to Islam seven years ago. 
Speaking on BBC Three documentary This Girl's Changed, Persephone, who now wears a hijab, said everything from her fashion sense to the way she acts has changed as a result of finding Islam. 
'Whether it was the words I used or the attitude, I had a big ego', she admitted. 'Islam has bettered me in terms of my character, the way I speak to people. I don't backbite and gossip, all these things Islam has taught me.'
Persephone described how her weekends used to be a blur of parties with friends. 
'In my peak party life a weekend would have started for me with ""Whose idea are we using, what outfit am I wearing, what's my fit going to be, what heels am I going to wear"",' she said.
'Then it would be pre-drinks, then it would be ""who is taking us to town?"" Literally the party wouldn't stop until 4 or 5am in the club and then it would be a house party and waking up in the morning with a hangover and that was literally my weekend.' 
She recalled one occasion when she was 'really drunk lying naked on the kitchen floor' and said 'I can no longer do this, this is not what's meant for me'. 
At one point in the programme Persephone returned to a park where she had previously tried to end her life. 
'I didn't even see it coming,' she said. 'When I [last] came here my mental health was really bad. I tried to end my life. I can't believe it when I think back, what could have made me be that hurt. 
'This was the starting point of my mental health being on the decline. Islam has helped me massively in terms of my mental health, just that knowledge that you can find a way through things.' 
Persephone's parents have been supportive of her journey into Islam, and the documentary saw her speaking with her mum and dad about when her mental health was at its lowest. 
Her mother recalled: 'You were just on a downward spiral. I actually at times, I didn't think you were going to make it. We had concerns for you, we thought you might do something.'
She added: 'This is what my concerns were, you didn't want to speak about anything really. But you used to write [diaries]. I used to read them. 
'I used to make sure you had lots of greasy body lotion so I could get into your phone, I used to read your chats and you were in a very dark place.'
After discovering Islam, Persephone threw away bags of her clothes she no longer felt were appropriate, removed her false nails, changed her name on Facebook and deleted all her racy pictures. 
'I think for me it was pretty much about looking for answers,' she said of her decision to convert. 
'I saw no purpose or value in myself, I started fasting with a friend in a call centre and I'd actually done Ramadan twice before I became Muslim. 
'The feeling was immense at the end of the day, she gave me that first real feeling of Islam and gratefulness and peace that finally made me say I finally need to take my Shahada now [Islamic oath].'
She ghosted her friends because she thought it would be too difficult to be around people drinking alcohol and eventually moved to London followed by Manchester before moving back home at 27.   
'When I converted I cut them off, like if you're not Muslim we can't be friends. But now I know more what I believe and I know it's not that,' she said.
'I literally dropped off the face of social media changed my whole religion converted to Islam and expected them to wanna meet up, wanna catch up with me and reintegrate into my life and let me into theirs.  Am I asking too much of them? I don't know.'
The four friends Persephone met up with were all accepting of her change of religion, and reflecting on her journey she said that she felt she could 'be herself and accept herself'.

1664,"IN MANY PLACES where seaweed used to thrive, often growing in vast “forests”, it is disappearing. The cause is global warming, which, by heating the ocean’s upper layer, reduces its density through thermal expansion—thus making it more buoyant. That extra buoyancy means it is less likely to mix with cooler, denser and more nutrient-rich waters below. This is bad for the marine environment in general. More specifically, it is bad for commercial seaweed farming, a business with revenues of (depending on whom you ask) between $6bn and $40bn a year.
The algae involved, particularly kelp, are popular in Asian cuisine. They are also used as fertiliser, and are processed into carrageenan, a natural binder and emulsifier employed in foods, cosmetics and drugs. Most are grown either on the seabed or on ropes attached to it (see picture above). But some are cultivated on small floating platforms.

To counter the effects of surface heating, which are particularly pronounced in the tropics, researchers are trying to improve the floating-platform approach by assisting the upwelling of cooler waters to stimulate algal growth on such platforms. This would also increase the area available for seaweed farms, by allowing them to be located well away from coastlines. An experimental floating farm installed in August, off the coast of the Philippines, by a group led by the Climate Foundation, an American charity, is one of the largest attempts so far to do this.
Pictures of a floating world
Artificial stimulation of upwelling is not a new idea. It has been touted for years as a way to regenerate kelp forests, in particular. And for good reason. With enough nutrients, fronds of giant kelp, which grow to an average length of about 30 metres, can elongate by more than 50cm a day. Only now, however, is upwelling-stimulation being attempted seriously.
The foundation’s test platform has an area of 100 square metres. It employs solar-powered turbines to suck water up from a depth of several hundred metres through flexible, cylindrical pipes. The foundation plans to experiment with wind-powered and wave-powered turbines, too.

If this works, which early results suggest it does, and can be scaled up, not only could such technology boost seaweed production, it might also help ecosystems that depend on seaweed forests. And—at least in theory—if part of the harvest were sacrificed by sinking it into the deep ocean, that might act as a novel form of carbon capture and storage which could help slow the warming that caused the problem in the first place.
According to Brian von Herzen, who runs the foundation, the organisation carried out smaller-scale experiments, using similar technology, in 2020. These showed that seaweed grows four times faster on platforms irrigated with upwelled water than on equivalent, unirrigated platforms. Moreover, it continues to grow during the warmest months of the year, when seaweed not so irrigated actually shrinks.
Dr von Herzen and his colleagues hope to use experience gathered from their latest rig to develop a platform that would cover an entire hectare of the ocean’s surface—100 times the area of the one just launched. To that end, they are collaborating with the Marine Bioproducts Cooperative Research Centre, a public-private partnership in Australia. At this scale, the partners estimate, a seaweed farm could pay for itself within five years.
Moreover, seaweed farms bring benefits beyond the immediate value of their crop. Seaweed is a habitat for many marine creatures, including fish. Some of these can be harvested for food. Indeed, for artificial upwelling to bring about that desirable state of affairs it may not even be necessary to farm seaweed. Ocean artUp, a project led by the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany, is experimenting with the use of upwelling to encourage the growth of the small, planktonic creatures eaten by sardines.
That could help restore stocks of these fish, which are shrinking rapidly in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Ocean artUp, which began in 2017 and is scheduled to run until the end of this year, has concentrated on simulating and measuring exactly how artificial upwelling affects the quantities of nutrients transferred between ocean layers. One thing the project’s researchers have discovered is that if you pump too hard, some of the upwelled water simply drops back into the depths, without mixing properly. Stirring the ocean in this way may thus require the design of floating water-mixers, too, to keep the nutrients at the surface.
Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Otherlab, an independent research laboratory, is working on an underwater robot intended to screw large tethers firmly into the seabed, to ensure that floating seaweed farms stay put, and can better survive stormy weather. Otherlab is part of a consortium paid for by ARPA-e, an American-government agency that is exploring the idea of using seaweed as a source of biofuel.
Those squeamish about anything that smacks of geoengineering—in other words, technology intended to change the world’s climate in ways that oppose global warming—view artificial upwelling with scepticism. They argue that it could damage other parts of ocean ecosystems, and might even create unwanted side-effects that end up accelerating climate change rather than slowing it. Proponents, conversely, see these early efforts, at least, as simply restoring upwelling that has been suppressed by climate change.
Stratified, not stirred
A study published last year in Nature Climate Change, by a team of researchers from America and China, suggested that the overall stratification of the world’s oceans has increased by 5% since 1960, with up to 20% more stratification in the tropics. This is despite any countervailing effect of the more extreme weather that global warming brings, which leads to greater churning of the oceans. Any such churning is overwhelmed by the extra buoyancy of the warmer surface layers.
Cooling the ocean surface by encouraging upwelling might also have a direct effect on the local air temperature. Warmer surface waters keep the atmosphere above warmer, too. Cooler waters do the reverse. But the technology would have to be deployed on a vast scale—over millions of hectares of the ocean’s surface—before it had a noticeable effect on the atmosphere.
As Dr von Herzen, who does not advocate geoengineering, points out, any such plans would face more than just economic barriers. The London Protocol, an international legal framework that regulates marine pollution, sets stringent limits on deliberate geoengineering of the oceans. The protocol does, however, tolerate justifiable commercial exploitation, along with some carbon capture.
If large-scale seaweed farming were, nevertheless, to be considered for geoengineering, there would be a certain irony in that fact. To do this would mean dumping the algae thus grown on the ocean floor, to stop the carbon in them returning to the atmosphere. That would probably work in the short term. But it was just such a process of sedimentation of organic matter which, over millions of years, produced modern-day petroleum fields. And it is their oil, furiously pumped up for over a century, that has generated much of the excess of greenhouse gases of which the world is now trying to rid itself. ■

1665,"NEW DELHI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - India's financial crime fighting agency has ordered Future Group to submit documents related to its 2019 deal with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) as part of an investigation into possible breach of foreign investment laws, according to sources and a notice seen by Reuters.
The demand indicates heightened scrutiny of a deal which is at the heart of legal battles between Amazon and Future after the Indian company decided to sell its retail assets to rival Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) for $3.4 billion in 2020.
That transaction has been put on hold by an arbitrator and Indian courts after Amazon argued Future had violated its contracts with the U.S. company by entering into the sale. Future denies that, and says Amazon is illegally exerting control over the Indian firm's business decisions.
In a confidential notice dated Oct. 28, the Enforcement Directorate agency asked a Future unit to submit all correspondence including emails between Amazon and the Indian group in respect of the investment the U.S. firm made in Future two years ago. Reuters has reviewed a copy of the notice.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the notice was part of an ongoing investigation by the Indian agency to establish whether there were any violations of foreign investment law when Amazon made the $200 million investment in Future's gift voucher unit, Future Coupons.
The notice has not previously been reported and was sent to Future Coupons, which was given 15 days to respond.
The Enforcement Directorate, which typically does not make details of its investigations public, did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon and Future also did not respond.
'RELEVANT FOR INVESTIGATION'
The dispute centres around three commercial agreements signed between Future and Amazon entities in 2019, which a Singapore arbitration panel - also hearing the dispute - has said must be read together while reviewing the transaction, and not separately as Future argues.
But Future contends conflating the commercial agreements would effectively mean its 2019 Amazon deal violated Indian law which prohibits such foreign investments in the retail sector without government approvals.
The Singapore panel has so far backed Amazon's contentions, saying Future breached its agreements with the U.S. company and must not proceed with the Reliance deal while the proceedings are ongoing.
The Indian enforcement agency in its two-page notice also asked Future for copies of various legal filings and supporting documents submitted by Amazon and Future group representatives to Indian courts and the Singapore arbitration panel.
The Enforcement Directorate ""considers that information/documents specified ... would be useful for and relevant to the investigation being conducted,"" the notice added.
Future is India's second largest retailer with more than 1,700 retail outlets, including popular chain Big Bazaar. Before the Reliance deal, Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's assets itself if regulations changed to allow that.",0
1666,"MOVIMENTO BRASIL LIVRE (MBL), or the Free Brazil Movement, is a group of angry young men who have a knack for using social media and the streets to achieve their political goals. Since being founded seven years ago, the right-wing group has helped bring down one president, leftist Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016, and has played kingmaker to another, the populist Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected in 2018. But MBL was nowhere to be seen on September 7th when Mr Bolsonaro’s fans filled the streets in support of his struggling government. Instead, it organised a counter-protest five days later that called for his impeachment.
“I voted for Bolsonaro and regret it,” says Luís Alberto Silva, a 37-year-old salesman and one of the protesters. Though smaller than both its bolsonarista precursor and previous anti-Bolsonaro rallies called by left-wing groups, the protest hints at a problem for the president. His base is often described as “beef, bullets and bibles”, referring to the interest groups that make up the biggest congressional caucuses. But equally important to his victory were the groups that champion free markets and decry corruption. If they defect en masse, it could cost him re-election next year—an outcome he is gearing up to dispute, with unpredictable consequences.

A decade ago most of these libertarian groups did not exist. After the military dictatorship ended in 1985 it was taboo to identify yourself as right-wing. One of MBL’s founders, Fábio Ostermann, recalls that when he started reading Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises in the early 2000s, “being young and not a leftist was seen as strange.” The left-leaning government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Ms Rousseff’s predecessor, also of the Workers’ Party (PT), was popular. Previous governments had been broadly centrist.
Two factors fuelled the rise of a “new right”, argues Camila Rocha of the University of São Paulo in a new book, “Menos Marx, Mais Mises” (“Less Marx, more Mises”). A vote-buying scandal in 2005 tainted the PT. The launch the previous year of Orkut, a social network that had 30m users in Brazil, offered a space for unconventional ideas. Free-market think-tanks, such as the Millennium Institute in Rio de Janeiro, flourished. Many of them desired a slimmed-down state, which became more salient when, in 2014, the Lava Jato (“Car Wash”) investigation revealed an even bigger graft scheme involving the PT. Alongside MBL, another group, Vem Pra Rua (“Come to the Streets”) led protests against Ms Rousseff. Partido Novo, a “new party” with a pro-market platform, fielded its first candidates in 2016.
The counter revolution
Although many of these groups proclaim themselves to be libertarian, several aligned themselves with more socially conservative viewpoints. In 2017 MBL joined protests to shut down an art exhibition on LGBT culture and, later, to ban Judith Butler, a philosopher, from an event because of her supposedly immoral (though to most readers impenetrable) views on gender. Rodrigo Constantino, a pundit and co-founder of the Millennium Institute, laments both the PT’s spending and its “satanic” sex-ed curriculum.
Mr Bolsonaro managed to appeal to this broad spectrum of conservative voters. He won “because he knew how to read the crowd”, says Sóstenes Cavalcante, a federal deputy and evangelical pastor.
Free-marketeers were cheered by Mr Bolsonaro’s choice for economy minister, Paulo Guedes, an economist who studied at the University of Chicago (and another co-founder of the Millennium Institute). But the honeymoon did not last long. MBL became dismayed by Mr Bolsonaro during his first year in office, when he ditched anti-graft plans after federal prosecutors filed money-laundering charges against one of his sons. They were further disappointed in 2020, when the justice minister, Sergio Moro, a former Lava Jato judge, resigned and accused Mr Bolsonaro of obstructing justice. By then, the president’s party had split into lavajatistas loyal to Mr Moro and ideologues wedded to the president, who quit the party. Other supporters abandoned Mr Bolsonaro when he botched Brazil’s response to the pandemic.

Some of these “new right” groups are trying to shift focus away from contentious social issues. “MBL is in a bit of an identity crisis,” says Mr Ostermann, who left in 2018 because he felt the group’s focus on defeating the PT would cost it its place at the “vanguard of liberal activism” (he is now a state deputy for Partido Novo). With Lula leading the polls for next year’s presidential election, MBL and other groups are trying to boost “third-way” challengers. If it comes down to Lula and Mr Bolsonaro, most say they will turn in blank ballots, even if that means Lula wins.
Around 30% of Brazilians still back Mr Bolsonaro. Some dedicated fans, such as evangelicals, have always cared more about social policies, such as keeping abortion illegal, than economic liberty or anti-corruption. Many millennials who frequented Orkut have been influenced by Olavo de Carvalho, a reactionary guru whose online lectures about how “cultural Marxism” is destroying Judaeo-Christian values have 1m subscribers, among them Mr Bolsonaro’s sons.
Mr Bolsonaro’s remaining supporters increasingly espouse views similar to the global alt-right, says Michele Prado, a researcher who studies bolsonarista groups on WhatsApp. Formerly fringe ideas such as the return of the monarchy or of military dictatorship have become political movements with elected representatives. Mr Bolsonaro’s election sparked a jump in the share of people identifying as right-wing.
Brazilians’ political identities are hardly coherent, points out Pablo Ortellado of the University of São Paulo. They have mostly “to do with the shirt of the team” that is winning, he says. But even if a split among conservatives undermines Mr Bolsonaro’s bid for re-election next year, the new right will not disappear as a political force. It may well evolve, or retreat into, a hard core of social conservatives, authoritarians and conspiracy theorists. Less von Mises and more Stephen Miller. ■",1
1667,"ON OCTOBER 8th 1871 Catherine O’Leary’s cow kicked over a lantern and sparked the fire that incinerated one-third of Chicago—or so legend has it. The story of the blaze and Chicago’s triumphant rebuilding is often retold with more than a dash of Whiggish inevitability: the fire was the catalyst by which Chicago became America’s commodity capital. But this year, on the 150th anniversary of the great fire, Chicagoans are looking anew at their city’s creation myth, and finding the truth to be much more compelling.
The fire was a disaster. Property records were destroyed when the courthouse burned, but Carl Smith of Northwestern University estimates the damage done in his book “Chicago’s Great Fire: The Destruction and Resurrection of an Iconic American City”. An area roughly three square miles was scorched, levelling nearly 18,000 buildings and killing about 300 people. About one in three Chicagoans was suddenly homeless. The entire business district—now known as the Loop—was torched, resulting in about $200m in property damage (about $4.5bn today).

It turns out the popular history of the fire is flawed. But its two central myths give some insight into the city then and now. First, consider poor Mrs O’Leary and her cow. Historians are sure the fire originated near the O’Learys’ barn, but have exonerated Catherine herself. Yet her supposed culpability persists, says Mr Smith, and reveals the prejudices that roiled America in the late 19th century. “Who could be a better scapegoat than an Irish-Catholic woman?”, he asks.

The second myth is that the breakneck pace at which the city rebuilt (the downtown was revived in two years) changed Chicago in a way that sparked the city’s rapid growth. In reality, the fire accelerated shifts already underfoot. After the civil war Chicago became an entrepot that was integral to the national economy, thanks in large part to its location. About 30,000 people lived in Chicago in 1850; that number ballooned to 300,000 by 1870 and reached 1m by 1890. “The fire is a speed bump on that upward trajectory,” says Julius Jones of the Chicago History Museum. “It doesn’t fundamentally alter the city.”
As Chicago reflects on the anniversary, it is tempting to compare the tragedy to that of covid-19, which has killed more than 12,000 Chicagoans. Both crises revealed inequality (some could not afford to rebuild their charred homes) and provided funds to rebuild. But drawing other parallels is tricky. In 1871 “the lesson people took away from the destruction of Chicago was that it was indestructible,” says Mr Smith. Today Chicago’s trajectory is less clear.
The city’s population grew by 2% in the past decade, a welcome change from the 7% decline seen between 2000 and 2010. But the pandemic has left Chicago’s unemployment rate roughly twice as high as it was in 2019 and nearly 17% of downtown offices are vacant, according to Colliers, a property firm. After the fire, says Mr Jones, Chicago’s residents likened their city to a phoenix, “resurrected from its own ashes to be better than it was before.” Some of that same spirit is needed again.",1
1668,"FEW SIGHTS are more pitiful than a child of three, hammer in hand, breaking big rocks into smaller ones to sell for pennies. Such scenes are considered so abhorrent in rich and poor countries alike that the convention of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) which outlaws “the worst forms of child labour” (including soldiering, slavery and prostitution) last year became the first to be ratified by all 187 of its members.
Between 2000 and 2016 the number of children working in factories, on farms and down mines fell by almost 94m, to 152m. Yet in the four years to 2020 progress has reversed, with an extra 8m children working, and some 6.5m more doing dangerous jobs. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for all of the increase. The setback occurred before the covid-19 pandemic, but the ILO and Unicef, the UN children’s agency, reckon that the economic hit from the virus may push almost 9m more children into work by the end of next year. Many will not return to school after the temporary closures imposed in countries to curb transmission of the virus (see Middle East  Africa section).

This increase in misery has prompted calls for tougher enforcement of child-labour laws. Prosecutors in Brazil are suing Olam, a commodities firm, over allegations it traded cocoa harvested by children (it denies the claim). In Ivory Coast judges have jailed dozens of people in recent months for putting children to work on cocoa plantations. And in Liberia the government said it is investigating the parents of children who are sent to work and planning to prosecute child-labour cases.
Rich countries, for their part, have been using their buying power to prevent child labour. In 2019 America halted imports of tobacco from Malawi because some of the crop was tended by children. In the same year it mulled a ban on cocoa from Ivory Coast, and the chocolate made from it, for the same reason. This impetus is natural: who would not want to take forceful steps to end cruelty to children? Yet stringent countermeasures, in many cases, may do more harm than good.
Take the rigorous enforcement of child-labour laws in poor countries. Although there are many child-traffickers who deserve to be put behind bars, most children in work are not enslaved and carted off by strangers, but instead toil alongside family members on small farms or tiny fishing vessels. In 2017, for example, Ghanaian police, egged on by Western charities, raided remote villages on Lake Volta, claiming they had rescued 144 children from slavery. Yet an investigation found that all but four had been snatched from their families. Well-meaning moves by rich countries to ban the import of tainted cocoa or tobacco may exacerbate the poverty that is the main reason why parents keep children home from school to help on the farm.
Instead of focusing on the symptoms, governments ought to help poor people become rich enough that they do not need to put their children to work in order to feed them. Over the longer run this means embracing policies that will help poor countries’ economies grow. But it will take time—time during which roughly 160m children will continue to miss the chance to learn and play.
Fortunately much can be done now. Schemes in which parents are paid modest sums to keep their children in school have proved effective at reducing child labour. An exhaustive review by the World Bank, which looked at 30 studies, found clear evidence that these tend to reduce child labour, with the biggest reductions among the poorest recipients.
Cash-strapped African countries may gripe that they cannot afford such handouts, and that borrowing or taxing to pay for them would curb economic growth and job creation. Yet such schemes are relatively cheap. Brazil’s flagship poverty programme, Bolsa Família, costs just 0.4% of GDP, a sum that even the poorest of countries could fund in a number of ways. One could be through cutting fuel subsidies that benefit mainly richer people, and which in half of sub-Saharan African countries cost more than 1% of GDP. Bilateral donors, which currently channel less than 1% of their aid into social safety-nets, could also play a big role. Few matters of public policy are as universally acclaimed as the drive to end child labour. But success will require pragmatism, not dogmatism. ■",1
1669,"GABON, A SMALL, family-run petrostate in west Africa, may seem a rather odd campaigner against global warming. Once Africa’s fifth-largest oil exporter, it profited from the world pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Now, however, it hopes to benefit by helping the world to avoid overheating—and by encouraging rich countries to pay African ones to keep their forests standing. Its advocacy got a boost on November 2nd when the leaders of more than 100 countries pledged at the COP26 summit to end deforestation by 2030. To help that happen, rich countries promised to stump up billions of dollars.
At least 85% of Gabon, which lies on the equator at the edge of the Gulf of Guinea, is covered in steaming jungle. It is one of six countries that form the massive forest of the Congo basin—the world’s second-biggest tropical rainforest, after the Amazon—which sucks in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and turns it into leaves and branches. (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the two Congos and Equatorial Guinea are the other five.) Gabon is not the largest of this group of carbon sinks, but its president, Ali Bongo, is the most eager to offer to protect his country’s forests in exchange for cash from rich countries.

Gabon’s argument is simple. Large rainforests such as those in the Congo basin provide a service to the world by sucking millions of tonnes of carbon from the air. Since performing this service provides no income, there has been little incentive for poor countries to protect their forests when they could instead profit by chopping them down for timber or clearing them for farming.

The potential benefits are large. “The stock of carbon in the Congo basin adds up to six years of total global emissions,” says Lee White, Gabon’s environment minister, adding that Gabon alone absorbs the equivalent of one-third of France’s carbon emissions each year. Although Gabon emits only around 25m tonnes of carbon a year, it sequesters about 140m tonnes, he reckons. Yet the six countries in the Congo basin used to suck far more carbon from the air than they do now. The Democratic Republic of Congo, which has the largest expanse of jungle of the six, is losing 500,000 hectares of it a year through deforestation. It will need some incentive to stop the chop. And countries such as Gabon, which have been protecting their forests, should be rewarded for having done so, argues Mr White.
The consequences of not doing so go beyond emissions. Mr White says the forests cause rain to fall across the Ethiopian highlands, the Nile valley and the southern rim of the Sahel. If these places dry up, waves of hungry people may spread across Africa, making the continent more prone to turmoil. Many will also head to Europe.
The deal struck at COP included a pledge by 12 countries to provide $12bn in public funding to protect and restore forests. The countries, which include America, Germany, Japan and Britain, hope that will also open the taps to private funding. Quite how this money will be spent is not yet clear. But several ideas are gaining ground.
Eats, shoots and LEAFs
One is to pay countries that can show they have reduced emissions by preserving forests. The LEAF Coalition, a partnership of governments and big firms that stands for Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance, has raised $1bn for this purpose. Another is that countries or companies may sell “green bonds” to finance climate-related projects. Investors keen to look green may pay a premium for these, allowing issuers to borrow at concessionary rates. “If you stop deforestation, you should be compensated for forgoing other forms of economic development,” says Andrew Mitchell, a climate scientist who founded the Natural Capital Finance Alliance. “Forests should be worth more alive than dead.”
It is not just governments that could raise money using green bonds, but also private firms such as the African Conservation Development Group, a Mauritius-registered company led by a South African, Alan Bernstein, that wants to mix virtue with profit, and help finance its efforts by selling $300m worth of green bonds to companies wishing to offset their own carbon emissions. It has bought a huge concession at Grande Mayumba, on Gabon’s south-west coast, investing $200m in sugar, rubber, fishing, forestry, cattle-ranching, and—for the very rich—eco-tourism.
Mr Mitchell is confident that African green bonds will eventually take off. But for the moment markets are still wary of buying any sort of African bond, let alone newfangled green ones. One worry is politics, as Gabon’s example illustrates. If investors are to pay more for green bonds financing forests, they would have to be certain that the carbon absorbed within the trees would be contained there for many years. Many may wonder what might happen if, for example, Mr Bongo’s regime in Gabon were to fall?
The question is far from academic. The Bongo family has run Gabon as a patronage-ridden fief for 54 years; no one pretends it is a democracy. At its most recent election, in 2016, it was obvious that the main challenger, Jean Ping, had actually won. Moreover, Mr Bongo suffered a serious stroke three years ago and may not be well enough to run again. Should he die, it is unclear if his Eton-educated, half-French son Noureddin, not yet 30, would seek to replace him, presumably using the regime’s usual tricks.
Without the backing of Mr Bongo, it may not be certain that Mr White would be able to continue to protect the forest. As it is, his position is somewhat improbable. A 56-year-old white Briton, he is an expert on biodiversity, gorillas and forest elephants. For nearly ten years he ran Gabon’s national parks, until two years ago, when an illegal-logging scandal was exposed over the illicit export of kevazingo, a reddish hardwood. In the fallout the president fired his vice-president and environment minister, and replaced the latter with Mr White.
He has won widespread admiration for promoting tree-hugging and animal-coddling in Gabon, thereby bolstering Mr Bongo’s claim to be Africa’s green champion. But his policy is far from popular with the many villagers whose crops are routinely trampled by unruly elephants. A standard cry among Gabonese tired of the ruling family runs, “Ali Bongo prefers elephants and trees to people.” It is a sentiment the leaders at the COP will need to get to grips with, if their plans to protect Africa’s forests are to come to fruition. ■

1670,"OPPONENTS OF Jovenel Moïse, Haiti’s president since 2017, have long wanted him to leave office. Now he has—but not in the way they were expecting. A group of unknown attackers shot and killed Mr Moïse in the bedroom of his private residence in a gated community on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, the capital, in the early hours of July 7th. They also injured his wife. Claude Joseph, whom the president appointed as interim prime minister in April, announced the killing in a statement and said he had taken charge of the Caribbean country. Haiti was already in turmoil—much of it due to Mr Moïse’s rule. His murder has added fuel to the flames.
On the morning after the murder Port-au-Prince’s streets were unusually quiet, without the usual roar of motorcycles and bustle of market stalls, as Haitians tried to guess what might happen next. The city’s airport was shut, as was the land border with the Dominican Republic.

The assassination has shocked a country which, for all its history of misrule and criminal violence, last witnessed the killing of a president in 1915. Rumours swirl about who was behind it. By the evening of July 7th the police chief announced that four suspects had been killed, and two more arrested. The assassins were probably mercenaries. The question is: who hired them? “It was obviously somebody with a lot of money and a lot of power,” says Monique Clesca, a former UN official.
Many pointed the finger at opposition politicians or Haitian elites. Other Haitians, who given the country’s history are suspicious of foreign interference, suspect the attack came from outside, possibly from Venezuela or the United States. Mr Joseph said some of the attackers spoke Spanish (Haitians speak Creole and French). Another video suggested they spoke English and claimed to be agents of the US Drug Enforcement Administration. This is certainly not the case, but the whispers add to the volatile situation.

It was not the first attempt on Mr Moïse’s life—at least, according to him. In February his government arrested at least 23 people, including a top judge and a senior police officer, who were accused of plotting an assassination and coup. Mr Moïse, a former plantation manager who referred to himself as “Banana Man”, had no shortage of enemies. Critics accused him of involvement in the pilfering of millions of dollars from PetroCaribe, an aid fund from Venezuela. Opponents said his term ended in February, five years after his predecessor left office. He claimed his term started when he took power, a year later—a position backed by the United States, although Joe Biden’s administration urged new elections this year. Protests regularly broke out against his rule.
As the political crisis deepened, Mr Moïse became more authoritarian. Since January 2020, when he dismissed all but ten senators in the two-chamber legislature, the president had been ruling by decree. He used his powers to create an intelligence agency and broadened the definition of terrorism to include acts of dissent. Protesters were attacked by gangsters. Mr Moïse denied asking them to intimidate and kill his opponents.
Previous Haitian presidents have fostered violence and corruption, too. But under Mr Moïse the situation grew worse. Critics accused him of using gangs to a greater extent to do his bidding, while having far less control over them, than previous presidents. In recent weeks fighting in Port-au-Prince has intensified; thousands of people had to flee their homes in June alone. By some estimates, kidnappings in Haiti tripled last year compared with 2019.

Although Mr Moïse has been the focus of much discontent, his death is unlikely to simplify things. “He was a complicated and flawed person, but the people who made him the single focus of all that is wrong in the system of Haiti miss the larger failures of that system,” says Michael Deibert, an American expert on Haiti.
Mr Joseph has little legitimacy. Mr Moïse had nominated Ariel Henry, a doctor, as permanent prime minister; he was due to take office on the day of the assassination. The constitution does not provide for the lack of both a president and a National Assembly, and the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who could arbitrate, died two weeks ago of covid-19. The killing could also make it harder to hold elections for a new president and legislature, which are due in September.
In many ways Haiti already looks like a failed state. Men with guns have long terrorised its people. Only last month Jimmy Chérisier, alias Barbecue, a former policeman and leader of an alliance of gangs, announced a “revolution” against the status quo (though many think he meant the opposition). The police are weaker than the gangs, who may now feel they have a free hand. Now that lawlessness has reached the country’s highest office, many Haitians fear the worst.■

1671,"ASK BRITONS what actually goes on in the City of London and you’ll be met with a blank stare. Trading the yen and the yuan, structuring derivatives and providing the world’s financial plumbing are all money-spinners, but they barely register in the public imagination. The exception is the stockmarket. Daily news bulletins report trading on the FTSE 100 index of leading London shares. Booms and busts are charted by its gyrations. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is the stamping-ground of giant multinationals, where city-slickers and corporate fat-cats thrash out huge deals to buy and sell the world’s companies.
Or at least it used to be. London’s high-flying stockmarket has spent the past decade tumbling back to earth. In 2006 the companies with shares listed in London were worth 10.4% of the global equity market. Today, that figure is 3.6%. London has lagged behind even the laggards: its share of Europe’s total market value has declined from 36% to 22% over the same period. The denizens of the LSE that are left look geriatric. Less than one-fiftieth of the FTSE 100’s value comes from tech companies, compared with almost 40% of the S 500 index of American firms. James Anderson of Baillie Gifford, one of the most successful global investors of the era, recently told the Financial Times that Britain has a 19th-century stockmarket. He is right.

One reason for Britain’s abysmal bourse is the underperformance of large British firms. Too many, from BP and GSK to HSBC and Tesco (average age 169), have dropped from the top tier of their industries owing to the chronic British disease of poor management. That has dragged down returns and made some firms vulnerable to takeovers. The entire asset-management industry, which has the job of supervising other firms, is badly run. Britain’s most valuable fund manager is now worth less than 10% of America’s largest. British pension schemes have spent years loading up on bonds and selling shares in a myopic quest to eliminate risk. They now have too little exposure to economic growth or wealth-creation.
The City has also suffered as global firms with international capital-raising options have drifted off. London’s revival after the “Big Bang”—reforms in 1986 that deregulated trading—relied in part on the stock exchange becoming a venue for mobile global businesses. Recent weeks have seen Prudential, an insurance giant, choose a share offering in Hong Kong and BHP, one of the largest London-listed companies, announce plans to have its sole primary listing in Australia. London’s aspirations to be a hub for European businesses have been dealt a blow by Brexit.
The City’s final weakness is a dearth of startups that choose to list in London. In 2005 London hosted one-fifth of the world’s initial public offerings (IPOs); today, it hosts one-twenty-fifth. A stock exchange that continually fails to attract exciting new firms will come to resemble a museum.
It is reasonable to ask how much a puny stockmarket matters. For British savers, the answer is that it doesn’t much. They can, should and increasingly are ditching their home bias and building global portfolios. As owners of superior foreign shares they may feel nostalgia for their once-great home market, but that is all. For Britain’s economy, a shrivelled stockmarket matters more. It limits the options startup founders have to expand their firms. Britain’s universities, courts and venture-capital scene make it a good place to build a business regardless. But the country’s attractions are fading.
For the City, the stockmarket matters a great deal. London remains a dominant centre for trading debt, derivatives and currencies, but equities are a crucial part of any claim to be a global financial centre. Listed firms exert a pull on other financial activities, and on the accounting and legal services that cater to them. The financial-services industry is Britain’s most successful, contributing 6% of GDP and about a tenth of tax revenue.
The worst reaction to stockmarket stagnation would be for the government to throw up defensive barriers. It must resist the temptation to veto takeovers or block delistings. An open market lets some firms leave, but it also encourages others to come. Far better to tackle the deeper causes of the malaise.
A starting-point is Britain’s corporate-governance rules for listed firms. Twenty years ago they were envied around the world, but they have since mushroomed and created a class of 3,000-odd semi-engaged and often semi-retired non-executive board directors who are rarely at the cutting edge of their global industry and often think their job is to sell firms, not prod them to invest. This interest group is entrenched, but it has presided over poor results and needs to be culled. The imperative is less red tape and more directors who understand risk-taking, not virtue-signalling.
The stockmarket can also be made more attractive by letting dual-class shares join the LSE’s premium segment. These give some shares souped-up voting rights and are popular among founders wishing to retain control. They are permitted by every one of the City’s rivals. But Britain’s befuddled legacy fund managers oppose them at home even though they are willing to buy them abroad.
Reform of the asset-management industry is overdue. Actuarial rules create a perverse incentive for firms to hold debt and private assets, in which volatility is masked because they are valued infrequently. This bias should be removed. Britain’s 5,327 corporate pension schemes should be merged into a few big managers with the scale to invest more competently.
Light the blue touchpaper
The good news is that a cohort of promising firms is emerging. In the past few years venture capital has flooded into Britain, which has 34 privately held startups worth over $1bn and has created more such unicorns than France, Germany and Sweden combined. Companies like Revolut, a fintech star, are reaching critical mass. As well as deregulating corporate governance and allowing dual-class shares, the government should move ahead swiftly to make it easier for startups to hire talented foreigners and let graduates of leading universities move to Britain without a job offer. The prize is a new generation of innovative firms listing in London. Time for another Big Bang. ■",1
1672,"MOST ARTISTIC impressions of dinosaurs picture them in lush forests or on vast temperate savannahs. That is fair enough. Such landscapes were common during the beasts’ heydays, the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. These pictures do, though, ignore the fact that dinosaur fossils have, for decades, been dug up in places which were at that time polar. Whether these are the remains of migrants which came for the summer, or of permanent residents, is debated. But a discovery of bone fragments and teeth from dinosaur hatchlings (see picture), just published in Current Biology by Patrick Druckenmiller of University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and his colleagues, suggests some dinosaurs did indeed make their full-time homes in the Arctic.
Modern animals that migrate to polar climes, notably birds, do often breed there. But their eggs hatch quickly and their young develop fast enough to fledge and fly to warmer places before winter arrives. Growth lines in fossilised dinosaur embryos found elsewhere suggest they needed as much as six or seven months of incubation before they were ready to hatch. Palaeontologists therefore reckon any discovery of fossilised eggs or hatchlings near the palaeo-poles would mean the species concerned must have been year-round residents rather than migrants.

Until now, no such hatchlings had been found, and the only known polar dinosaur eggs were from the Kakanaut formation of north-eastern Russia, which was only just within the Arctic Circle when its rocks were laid down. Dr Druckenmiller’s discoveries are from the Prince Creek Formation of northern Alaska, which may have been as close as 5° of latitude from the North Pole when its rocks formed 70m years ago.
The fossils themselves come from a range of dinosaur groups, including ceratopsians (related to the likes of Triceratops), duck-billed hadrosaurs, large carnivores related to Tyrannosaurus and smaller velociraptor-like predators. This suggests a diverse and flourishing ecosystem, despite the fact that Prince Creek was continuously dark for 120 days a year and had an average annual temperature of 6°C—meaning snow would have been common in winter.
How all these creatures survived those conditions was, Dr Druckenmiller suggests, a consequence of dinosaurs’ warmbloodedness and the downy feathers many of them are now known to have sported. No direct evidence of feathers has yet been found among the Alaskan fossils, but their ubiquity elsewhere makes it likely they had them.",1
1673,"SOME POLITICAL dramas flare up briefly; others redraw the political landscape. The debacle in the House of Commons on November 3rd and 4th, when Boris Johnson tried to tear up the system of parliamentary oversight to prevent the suspension of Owen Paterson, a friend and MP, only to reverse course, looks like the second type. As furious Conservative MPs complained about being treated as cannon fodder, it strained their faith in the prime minister’s judgment and undermined the whips’ authority. It also gave fresh juice to other inquiries into Tory conduct, including Mr Johnson’s recent holiday at a Spanish villa, payment for seats in the House of Lords and the extra-parliamentary legal career of Sir Geoffrey Cox, a former attorney-general who earned £900,000 ($1.2m) in the past year. A YouGov poll after the fateful vote on November 3rd found that a Tory lead of 6% had narrowed to 1%.
Marxist theoreticians argue that, as Hegel put it, beyond a certain point “merely quantitative differences…pass into qualitative changes”. Mr Paterson has stepped down, but for the prime minister the affair may mark the moment when his accumulating errors and U-turns, from getting friends to pay for expensive wallpaper in his residence to changing tack repeatedly on lockdowns, becomes a qualitative shift in public opinion.

Explanations for such a catastrophic misstep range from generous (the prime minister merely wanted to protect a friend and ally) to cynical (he sought to neuter the standards commission before it pronounced on his own actions). But one is particularly compelling: that he was unduly influenced by a clique of ageing Brexiteers. Behind the Paterson debacle stands a group of brothers-in-arms who served shoulder to shoulder in the anti-European trenches for decades. The hard core, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash, David Davis and Sir Bernard Jenkin, were critics of the Maastricht Treaty in the 1990s, “Vote No” warriors under David Cameron, stalwarts of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, self-styled “Spartans” under Theresa May—and champions of Mr Johnson as prime minister.
Dame Andrea Leadsom, who put forward the Paterson amendment, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who did most to push it through, were too young for the Maastricht wars. But they were there in spirit (the infant Rees-Mogg was educated in Euroscepticism by Sir Bill). Lord (Charles) Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, also played a pivotal role. He wrote columns in support of Mr Paterson, his friend for 45 years, and organised a dinner at the Garrick Club on November 2nd, at which Mr Johnson was fed pheasant and claret, and brought round to their point of view.
The clique’s victory in the Brexit vote of 2016 has injected a toxic mix of triumphalism and paranoia into the heart of Conservatism. Its members see themselves as possessing a unique connection with the British people, and a rare strategic genius. They think they can achieve anything, as long as they exert sufficient pressure and plot sufficiently thickly. But they also regard themselves as beset by a hostile establishment that seeks to frustrate their will. Lord Moore’s articles are textbook examples of the style. He has argued that the two-year investigation into Mr Paterson “smacks of political revenge”, and that the parliamentary standards committee selectively targeted pro-Brexit MPs while going easy on Remainers. He urged MPs to reject the committee’s sentence as a way of “reasserting the right of voters, not bureaucrats, to decide who should make [the] law and ensure that it works”.
Successful political parties rely on their elders’ accumulated wisdom to stop them making unforced errors. Even Margaret Thatcher, a radical to her fingertips, paid close attention to William Whitelaw, a moderate grandee—thus her immortal dictum that “every prime minister needs a Willie”. But the Brexit wars have removed a generation of “Willies” from the parliamentary party, notably Sir Nicholas Soames, Sir Alan Duncan, Kenneth Clarke, Patrick McLoughlin and Dominic Grieve. Politics has been left in the hands of ageing zealots in the Commons and lightweight technocrats in Downing Street, such as Dan Rosenfield, Mr Johnson’s chief of staff. The zealots appeal to Mr Johnson’s worst trait, a tendency to believe that he is above accountability; the technocrats lack the strength to rein their master in.
Younger MPs were particularly furious about the Paterson mess, not because they are anti-Brexit saboteurs (most were fervently in favour of leaving the EU) but because they resent being treated so cavalierly by people who wouldn’t recognise them in the corridors of Westminster, let alone say hello. The brewing row over extra-parliamentary income sharpens their resentment. To the ageing baby-boomers within the Brexit clique, £100,000 a year may sound like a reasonable second income; to the 2019 intake representing working-class “red wall” constituencies in the Midlands and north of England, it is serious money.
Mr Johnson now needs to break with the Brexit clique. He should stop listening to the likes of Sir Iain and Mr Davis, who are neither wise nor even particularly intelligent. Gargoyles like Mr Rees-Mogg should be cleared out of front-line politics. In their place, the prime minister should assemble a government of all the Tory talents. The brightest and best of the rising generation should be put on the fast track to high office.
They’re not out to get you
Above all, he needs to break decisively with the triumphalist-paranoid mindset. Neither he nor anyone else has the right to force through controversial legislation in the name of some mystical connection with “the people”. Not everyone who resists his actions is plotting to bring Britain back into the EU. The British establishment, by and large, recognises that Brexit is a fait accompli and the great task of the coming decades is to make the best of it. Mr Johnson can still repair the damage of the past week, but only if he takes it as a spur to party renewal. ■",1
1674,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",0
1675,"AMERICA HAS a maths problem. Its pupils have ranked poorly in international maths exams for decades. In 2018, American 15-year-olds ranked 25th in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. American adults ranked fourth-from-last in numeracy when compared with other rich countries. As many as 30% of American adults are comfortable only with simple maths: basic arithmetic, counting, sorting and similar tasks. American employers are desperate for science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills: nuclear engineers, software developers and machinists are in short supply. And while pupils’ maths scores are bad enough now, they could be getting worse. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a national exam, 13-year-old pupils’ scores dropped five points in 2020 compared with their peers’ in 2012. The status quo does not add up. But teachers and academics cannot agree on where to go next.
The American maths problem is over a century old, says Alan Schoenfeld of the University of California, Berkeley. In 1890 high school was an elite endeavour: less than 7% of 14-year-olds were enrolled and they were educated in rigorous maths. By the beginning of the second world war, by which time army recruits had to be trained in the maths needed for basic bookkeeping and gunnery, nearly three-quarters of children aged 14-17 attended high school. The cold war sparked a second strategic maths panic in the 1950s. A new maths curriculum, focused on conceptual understanding rather than rote memorising, was developed after the launch of the Sputnik satellite by the Soviet Union. Then that new curriculum was rejected in a move back to basics in the 1970s.

Maths teaching became a worry again when America started to fear being overtaken by Japan. In 1981 the secretary of education appointed a commission to evaluate the curriculum. It produced a report called “A Nation at Risk”. “If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today,” the report reported, “we might well have viewed it as an act of war.”
Since the 1990s, though, maths has become more political. Conservatives typically campaign for classical maths: a focus on algorithms (a set of rules to be followed), memorising (of times tables and algorithmic processes) and teacher-led instruction. Pupils in these classrooms focus on the basics, exploring concepts after obtaining traditional skills, explains Bill Evers of the Independent Institute, a think-tank in Oakland. These methods are familiar to many. For two-digit addition, pupils would be taught a paper-and-pencil method. Add 27 + 45 by stacking 27 over 45. Add up the right column (7 + 5 = 12). Write down the 2, and carry the 1 to the left column. Add up the left column (1 + 2 + 4 = 7). Write down the 7. The answer is 72.
Progressives typically favour a conceptual approach to maths based on problem-solving and gaining number-sense, with less emphasis on algorithms and memorising. In contrast to the conservative strategy, pupils would learn several ways to solve a problem, by using objects and by other means, before learning algorithms. To solve 27 + 45, pupils could add up the digits in the ones place (7+5=12), and then the tens place (20+40=60), and then add them together to get 72. Or they could realise that 27 is 3 digits away from 30. They would add 3 to get to 30. Then add 45 and subtract 3 to get 72. Conceptual maths strategies encourage pupils to find many potential solutions for the same problem to gain number-sense, rather than relying on an algorithm.
Although most teachers agree that maths education in America is sub-par, they have not been able to agree on how to improve it. Copying methods used in highly ranked mathematical nations such as Singapore would be one way. But that would require agreement on what is actually being taught in other countries. According to Mr Evers, successful Asian curriculums reflect the classical position. “What country do you think has totally adopted progressive education and has been a big success? China is very teacher-led. Singapore math is the best in the world. It’s not progressive,” explains Mr Evers. But Mr Schoenfeld reckons countries such as Japan and Singapore implement conceptual curriculums.
Part of the confusion stems from the messy implementation of the most recent maths curriculum, the Common Core. Implemented in 2010 under President Barack Obama’s administration, 41 states and the District of Columbia adopted the principles. Texas, Florida and several others opted out. Despite initially being a bipartisan effort (Jeb Bush and other conservatives supported the Obama administration’s effort), it was eventually criticised by both sides. Some view it as an example of progressive education, while others think it was not progressive enough. Now that test results are rolling in, many conservatives claim that the falling scores show the failure of the Common Core and progressive teachers. But supporters of the current curriculum are not prepared to give up. Whereas NAEP scores declined among 13-year-olds, they stayed steady among nine-year-olds, who would have studied Common Core for their whole school lives.
Further muddling the mess, far-left activists have paired conceptual maths methods with more radical concepts. Many opponents of conceptual maths believe that Common Core, and conceptual maths in general, bans teaching of rote-learning, as in multiplication tables. A prominent maths-education scholar at Stanford University, Jo Boaler, claims that memorising times tables is unnecessary. Conservatives have seized on this idea as an example of liberal activism gone wild. But Mr Schoenfeld claims this does not align with progressive maths values.
Some activists have also paired conceptual maths with “social-justice maths”, the concept that maths should be used to help pupils solve real-world issues and appraise the world around them. Dubbed “woke math[s]” and tagged with headlines such as “In California 2+2=4 May Be Thought Racist” (as a letter to the Wall Street Journal harrumphed), it has done conceptual maths few favours by association.
The maths debate in America is polarised and confused. While other countries implement maths curriculums with a balance of rote and conceptual learning, America continues to swing from one pole to another, decade after decade. Just like the country’s politics, in other words.■

1676,"LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London said on Thursday it would join peers in scaling up efforts to cut carbon emissions and push members of the commercial insurance market to do the same, days before international climate talks get underway in Scotland.
Lloyd's has long been seen as a laggard on climate action, leaving decisions on whether to underwrite activities in a range of heavy-emitting sectors to its 100-odd syndicate members amid sharp criticism from activists.
As pressure builds on financial companies to act on climate, Lloyd's said it had joined the United Nations-convened Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a body aiming to reduce the sector's emissions and help cap global warming.
By joining, Lloyd's said it was committing to moving all of its operational and attributable greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest. It will also set, publish and report against interim science-based targets every five years to ensure action in the near term.
Part of that effort would see it move its 3 billion-pound ($4.12 billion) Central Fund, which backstops members' liabilities, to net zero by switching to green investments.
""(We) are fully committed to working collaboratively across the financial sector to achieve its net zero ambition,"" Lloyd's Chief Executive John Neal said in a statement.
On the more contentious issue of its members' activities, Lloyd's last week wrote a 'Dear CEO' letter to its insurers to warn them they would need to come up with an environmental, social and governance plan in the second half of 2022.
This follows the launch of Lloyd's' own inaugural ESG strategy last year, years behind many of the top European insurers and reinsurers.
""Lloyd’s will advocate and support all market participants to introduce and implement their own net zero plans in order to reach a net zero underwriting position for the market by 2050 at the latest,"" it said in the statement.
""These new formal expectations will be embedded into the Lloyd’s market oversight framework, putting climate action at the heart of annual business planning cycles with syndicates.""
Lloyd's members' ESG commitments would form a key part of the risk assessment process when Lloyd's signs off their annual business plans for 2023, it said, which in turn can affect the members' ability to write business in the market.
""Achieving net-zero emissions will require transformation across the entire economy,"" said Nigel Topping, UN High-level Climate Action Champion at the COP26 climate talks starting in Glasgow on Sunday.
""Insurance will be absolutely critical to enabling that transition and to building resilience to climate shocks.
""I welcome the ambition from Lloyd’s in leading the Lloyd’s marketplace to a net zero underwriting position by using their influence with market participants to full effect.”

1677,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Media entrepreneur Byron Allen has raised $10 billion in preferred equity and debt for his bid for U.S. regional TV station operator Tegna Inc (TGNA.N), hoping to prevail over a rival offer from investment firms Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) and Standard General LP, people familiar with the matter said.
The financing is backed by a consortium of 14 banks and 10 investors, including Ares Management Corp (ARES.N), Fortress Investment Group, Oaktree Capital Management and Michael Milken's family office, one of the sources said.
Ares is leading a $2.2 billion preferred equity investment in support of Allen's financing package, another of the sources added.
Tegna could choose a winning bidder as early as this month, the sources said.
Spokespeople for Tegna, Apollo, Oaktree and Michael Milken declined to comment.
Allen, who acquired the Weather Channel TV network for $300 million in 2018, made a $23 per share offer for Tegna in September, while Apollo and Standard General offered $22 per share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tegna wants both bidders to raise their offers, one of the sources said. It also expects assurances from both bidders that they will entertain all regulatory demands necessary to complete the acquisition, and views the Apollo/Standard General bid as most likely to raise antitrust concerns, the source added.
Apollo owns 33 TV stations in 20 markets through its portfolio company Cox Media Group, while Standard General owns four TV stations, according to their websites.
Tegna reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday and said on a call with analysts it was still evaluating acquisition proposals versus its stand-alone prospects.
The company recorded $756 million in revenue in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. It has 64 television stations in 51 U.S. markets, and a market value of $7.75 billion including debt.",0
1678,"MOON JAE-IN briefly assumed the face of a badly bruised schoolboy. But it was not because he had botched a diplomatic mission or caused a political scandal. Rather, the reason was celebratory. South Korea’s president had donned a mask showing the protagonist of a popular web-based comic about bullied teenagers, to mark manhwa (comic) day and popularise his country’s latest export hit: webtoons, serialised comic strips that people can read on their phones.
Webtoons began life in the early 2000s when Naver and Daum, the country’s biggest search engines, hired cartoon artists to design online comic strips. They were supposed to attract more visitors to their websites rather than generate income. But over the past decade the market has grown tenfold, making webtoons a vital source of income for the internet companies. More strikingly, they have begun to attain a degree of influence over global culture that belies their humble origins.

For readers of webtoons, the advantage over more traditional comics lies in the variety of storylines and in the interactive features, animations and dramatic background music. After finishing an episode, fans can hit the comments section and debate the twists and turns of the plot with others. Lim Hyun-jee, a 26-year-old from Seoul, likes being able to read new episodes on her phone on her way to work rather than lug around hefty volumes of Japanese manga (comics or graphic novels), which she also enjoys. Jacqueline, a 21-year-old fan in Canada, says plots about girls discovering make-up and meeting hot guys make a nice change from standard superhero fare.
But the success of webtoons is not restricted to comic lovers, says Jang Min-gi from Kyungnam University. Some of the cartoonists who started with Naver and Daum years ago have found themselves consulting on films and television dramas, raking in thousands of dollars. “Sweet Home”, a horror webtoon about a man surviving a virus that turns humans into monsters, was made into a drama last year and became the most-watched show on Netflix in eleven countries (a scene is pictured). Shows like “Itaewon Class”, about an ex-con trying to sort out his life, or “Cheese in the Trap”, which follows the romantic troubles of a group of students, have had success too.
Ms Jang thinks this will eventually draw even more people to webtoons, as film versions of Spider-Man or Black Panther did for Marvel comics. “Most of today’s Marvel fans saw the films before the comics. It’s the same with webtoons. They are creating their own universe.”",1
1679,"Migrants have been filmed cheering and clapping as they launched dinghies off the coast of France to cross the English Channel as French police officers stood by and filmed the scenes.
Video footage taken on Tuesday - the same day that a staggering 1,000 migrants made it to the UK - showed groups of migrants, including young children, clapping in celebration as they managed to restart their boat's engine on a Calais beach.
In the clip, taken by local jogger Franck Viandier, dozens of migrants crowded around the small boat and helped to push it into the water while children clapped and cheered with excitement as they prepared to cross the Channel.
Other footage obtained by ITV News showed dozens of migrants wearing life jackets carrying a small dinghy down to the sea while French Gendarmerie officers stood by on the shore and watched.
Some officers appeared to be holding up their phones and filming the scenes, while others stood by and did not intervene as the migrants prepared to launch a boat, heading for the UK. 
On Tuesday, MailOnline journalists witnessed two 50ft long boats, setting off from the beaches near Wimereux, around 20 mile south of Calais. No police were on the beach at the time - but turned up some 24 hours later.  
Today, the RNLI rescued 23 migrants before around 50 more arrived in Kent. More people are expected to make the dangerous 21-mile trip across the Dover Strait throughout the day as weather is said to be good in the Channel.
A lifeboat was scrambled this morning to rescue people from a boat in the Channel, with one migrant airlifted to hospital after suffering a suspected medical episode while attempting the crossing. The man, who was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, is believed to be okay. 
Mr Viandier, who jogs along a Calais beach every morning, said he believes the Gendarmerie officers are doing their best amid the migrant crisis, saying that it is not 'their job' to fight migrants if they want to cross to England.
He told ITV News: 'Sometimes there is a lot of police, I can see the fight sometimes. But they say to me 'it is not our job to fight with these people, the people want to go to England, we are French police'.'
France claims that it deploys 950 officers in the Calais region each day in a bid to prevent illegal Channel crossings. 
Migrants launch their boats from France along a 100mile stretch of beach, making it harder for authorities to stop them from crossing the Channel. Out of 40,000 crossings this year, only around half were stopped, according to official figures.
Meanwhile, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said the UK's offer to set up joint patrols with the French was rebuffed.
He added: 'We constantly discuss operational options with the French, we have offered to conduct joint patrols. It's not an offer that the French have currently taken us up on, but it continues to be on the table.' 
Official figures are yet to be released but it is feared that Tuesday's total could rival the 1,185 record reached last Thursday as the migrant crisis reaches breaking point. The figures have taken some two days to calculate due to the sheer number of arrivals.
The previous daily high was 853. At least 3,941 migrants have arrived this month in 121 boats, taking the total for the year so far to 23,683.
This morning, an RNLI Dover lifeboat was launched just after 5.30am at the request of the UK Coastguard following reports of a grey dinghy in distress. 
A number of 999 calls were made to the rescue centre requesting assistance with reports that a man onboard required medical attention. 
Lifeboat crew reported there were 23 other people on the 6-foot grey rib that was caught out in rough seas. A rescue and recovery operation was launched with a helicopter seen airlifting a person to hospital.  
A spokesman for the Coastgaurd confirmed: 'HM Coastguard has been coordinating a search and rescue response to an incident off Kent, working with Border Force and other partners. We sent the coastguard helicopter from Lydd and Dover RNLI lifeboat.' 
Meanwhile, the Home Office also confirmed that 66 migrants made the perilous Channel crossing in three boats on Wednesday. French authorities stopped a further 43 in three small boats.
It comes after it was reported that Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
However, No 10 said it would not comment on conversations with specific countries over the processing of migrants who arrive in the UK. 
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'I've always been clear that we want to keep all options on the table.
'As illegal migration is an international issue, you'd expect us to have discussions with both France and other international partners to help reduce illegal migration.'
He added the UK had been in talks with a 'number of countries' but added: 'I'm simply saying I'm not going to get into speculation about ongoing discussions with individually named countries.
'As you'd expect given the international elements of this, it is right the Government speaks to a number of countries about these global challenges.'
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project could cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
Ten migrants have been found dead in an overcrowded wooden boat trying to cross the Mediterranean.
The ramshackle boat, which was packed with around 100 refugees, was found by the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) team, drifting 30 nautical miles away from the coast of Libya, where it departed. 
Dozens of survivors were rescued by the MSF team, and are now on the Geo Barents rescue vessel.
Those on board revealed there was a powerful smell of fuel in the boat and victims had spent more than 13 hours crammed in the lower deck. 
So far this year, around 1,225 migrants have died or gone missing while trying to make the perilous crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean. 
Caroline Willemen, project coordinator on the Geo Barents, described the Mediterranean as the 'deadliest migration route'.
'We are once more witnessing Europe's unwillingness to provide the much needed dedicated and proactive search and rescue capacity in the Central Mediterranean' she added.
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday.  
Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said: 'We are facing a global migration crisis and the number of people arriving on UK shores is unacceptable.
'We must work closely with our European and international partners to target the ruthless organised criminal gangs behind these deadly crossing and welcome the French Government's commitment to step up action to prevent crossings, including increased surveillance, greater intelligence sharing and deployment of frontline operations
'The New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken system, break the deadly business model of the people smugglers and prevent further loss of life.' 
Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has confirmed that the Government is looking at processing migrants who cross the Channel in small boats overseas.
He told LBC Radio: 'First of all, you're always better off dealing with the flow of migrants from a crisis or a conflict in the region itself, our overwhelming focus is on that. It's better for migrants, it's better to be resettled and relocated nearer to your home.
'But to the extent that we get this flow over to the UK, it's important to reduce the pull factor, we will work with all our partners - and it's not just one country, we've looked at the Australian experience, we've been talking with the Danes about this and we want to make sure the processing, if it's possible - and that will depend on the good will and co-operation of partners - can be done elsewhere.'
Asked if this will include Albania and Rwanda, he said: 'Let me avoid talking about individual countries but just say with international partners this is something we're probing because we want to test the idea because we will do everything we can to resolve this problem.'
Pressed if the plan will cost £100,000 per migrant, he said: 'I don't recognise that number. Until you've got a detailed agreement with a particular country, I don't think we'll be in a position to cost it.'
Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal that migrants evicted from their squalid Dunkirk camp by French police have set up a new encampment in a field next door.
Others have erected their tents in woods less than half a mile away from their demolished camp to keep alive their dream of finding a place on a boat to the UK.
The crowded camp on an area of abandoned industrial land and was home to 1,500 migrants until it was closed down by police at Grand-Synthe near Dunkirk.
Residents of the camp were given the option of being taken by coach to shelters across France in return for going through the French process for asylum seekers.
But most of them chose to continue living rough and refused to accept the offer out of fears that it would hinder their long term aim to reach the UK. 
Small groups of migrants today returned to their old camp and broke through the fences erected by police in a half-hearted bid to seal off the entrance.
MailOnline today witnessed pitiful scenes as former camp residents rummaged through stinking piles or rubbish left behind after the mass eviction. 
Migrants piled up old clothing, bedding, tents and pots and pans into supermarket trolleys which they wheeled away to their new camps.
Others chopped up pallets and other construction material from flattened makeshift shelters to get fuel for their camp fires.
Many of the migrants including families with children had only a short distance to travel to their new home in the field next door to their old camp.
They included Iraqi Kurdish mother Kazhal Rzgar, 46, and her two daughters Hadya, 22, and Hasta, seven, and her and her two sons who put up their old tent in a corner of the field.
The family have been surviving largely on food hand outs from charities since they arrived 16 days ago at the Grand-Synthe camp after landing in Italy on a migrant boat.
Channel migrants are set to be flown to ALBANIA to a new asylum centre at cost of £100,000-a-head a year as French deny agreeing to stop all crossings 
Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania, it was reported last night.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project would cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday. 
On Tuesday, around 80 migrants were pictured climbing into inflatable dinghies in northern France before they were pushed into the sea and began their journey to Britain. 
A total of 1,185 people crossed the channel last Thursday, eclipsing the previous daily high of 853. Overall this year, there have been more than 20,000 crossings.
In response to news about the plan to open an asylum centre in Albania, a Home Office spokesman said: 'Migrants making these dangerous crossings are putting their lives at risk and it is vital we do everything we can to prevent them and break the business model of the criminal gangs exploiting people.
Migrants who have been picked up after landing or intercepted at sea are taken to a Border Force processing centre, such as Tug Haven near Dover. 
Here arrivals are triaged to identify any medical needs or vulnerabilities, fed and checked to see if they have a criminal record. Adults have an initial interview before being sent to accommodation centres across Britain, paid for by UK taxpayers and provided by private contractors. 
The migrants are given £37.75 per week for essentials like food, clothes and toiletries while they wait for a decision on their asylum application. If the claim is rejected they face deportation back to their home country. 
Kent County Council normally takes unaccompanied children into its care, although other local authorities are also involved in this programme. 
'People should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and as part of our response it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the channel and work with international partners to put an end to these dangerous journeys.'
When the plans were first reported by The Sun last month, the Albanian prime minister's official spokesman branded the reports as 'absolutely untrue'.   
The news comes after it was suggested in March that asylum seekers who cross the Channel illegally to reach Britain could be sent to a third country such as Turkey. 
Other options on the table were islands off the coast of Scotland, the Isle of Man, or Gibraltar. 
At the time, charities branded the proposals 'inhumane', while an immigration expert said that whilst there was no law prohibiting such a move, there was 'bound to be a court case about it'. 
On Wednesday, new research from the British Refugee Council revealed that nearly two thirds of migrants who cross the Channel to reach the UK are originally from the Middle East.    
More than 61 per cent of those who make the dangerous journey across the 21 mile straight Calais to Dover are nationals from countries such as Iran and Iraq.
The highest number of migrants arriving in small boats are from Iran, with 3,187 Iranian nationals reaching UK shores from January last year to May this year. 
This accounts for 26 per cent of all arrivals in small boats over this period.
Figures also show 2,185 people from Iraq crossed the Channel over the same period. 
The figure makes up around 17 per cent of the 12,195 migrants who arrived in the UK in small boats in 2020 and at the start of this year.
Other Middle Eastern nationalities in the top 10 countries of people who arrived in small boats include war-torn nations such as Syria and Yemen, along with oil rich Kuwait.  
From non-Middle Eastern countries, the largest number of arrivals came from Sudan, in north-east Africa. Around eight per cent of small boat arrivals were from Vietnam, while around six per cent of people arrived from Eritrea and one per cent from Ethiopia.
All of the nations in the top 10, which make up 91 per cent of arrivals on UK shores, are countries were human rights abuses and persecution are common, according to the British Refugee Council. 
According to figures obtained by the British Refugee council, migrants arriving in the UK in small boats between January 2020 and May 2021 were from: 
Iran: 26 per cent
Iraq 17 per cent
Sudan 11 per cent
Syria: 10 per cent
Vietnam 8 per cent
Eritrea: 6 per cent
Afghanistan 5 per cent
Kuwait 5 per cent
Yemen 2 per cent
Ethiopia 1 per cent
Other: 9 per cent  

The research came after MailOnline journalists witnessed the moment that two 50ft long inflatable dinghies loaded with up to 40 migrants each leave northern France on Tuesday morning. 
At dawn. dog walkers and a jogger watched in amazement as the two separate groups, who had been hiding overnight in the sand dunes, ran to the water's edge with their giant boats.
Smuggler minders waded in to the sea as the migrants climbed aboard for the dangerous trip to Britain but they did not make the journey with them.  
Despite the ongoing crossings and the lack of progress in stopping them, Ms Patel had claimed she had agreed with French interior minister Gerald Darmanin agreed to work to prevent '100 per cent of crossings' of the Channel.   
The Home Office issued a joint statement from the pair which said they had agreed measures to 'stop the dangerous crossings' of the 'deadly route'.
But the French embassy in London said the 100% figure 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin held talks on Monday night with the UK and France involved in a long-running row over how to address the problem of migrants seeking to cross the Channel.
The 'joint statement' issued afterwards said: 'Both the Home Secretary and interior minister agreed to strengthen operational cooperation further.
'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings.
'They agreed to accelerate the delivery of the commitments made in the joint agreement of July 2021 to deliver on their joint determination to prevent 100% of crossings and make this deadly route unviable.'
But the French embassy said on Twitter: 'For the record, the 100% figure was not agreed between the Home Secretary and French interior minister @GDarmanin and should not be presented as an agreed commitment: it is not.
'And it is not part of the joint statement.'
However, in a press conference on October 9, Mr Darmanin said that with the correct resources and the support of the British authorities, 100 per cent should be able to be reached.",3
1680,"AMANCIO ORTEGA, founder of the Zara fast-fashion empire, got his start selling bathrobes in northern Spain. Erling Persson of H peddled women’s clothing in a small-town shop in Sweden for decades before going global. Xu Yangtian had none of their tailoring experience when he founded Shein (pronounced she-in) in 2008. Instead, the creator of the fashion world’s latest sensation was a specialist in search-engine optimisation.

This expertise gave Mr Xu an understanding of how to draw shoppers’ attention in the digital world. He has brought to Western fashionistas a Chinese style of “social commerce”, which combines social media with online shopping. Add a revolutionary approach to manufacturing and the results have been spectacular. In 2019 Shein’s gross merchandise value (GMV), e-commerce groups’ preferred measure of total sales on their platforms, was $2.3bn, estimates Zheshang Securities, a Chinese broker. This year it is forecast to surpass $20bn (see chart). By 2022 analysts expect Shein’s GMV to overtake Zara’s revenues. In May Shein became the most downloaded shopping app in America, beating Amazon.

Mr Xu has also grasped how to navigate the growing commercial and geopolitical tensions between China and the West. It is hard to say for sure, given how secretive his privately held company remains, but Shein has probably had more success selling directly to Western consumers than any other Chinese firm in history. America is its biggest market, accounting for 35-40% of GMV. Another 30-35% comes from rich parts of Europe. It has won the backing of both big American venture capitalists (like Sequoia Capital) and Chinese ones (such as IDG Capital). Stitch all this together and you get a new model of a successful Chinese multinational company.
Shein’s success has three threads. The first is a turbocharged version of the fast-fashion formula of offering a constantly updated range of garments at bargain-basement prices. Whereas Zara launches about 10,000 new products a year, Shein releases 6,000 fresh “stock-keeping units” (including old designs in new colours) every day. Some are quickly discontinued. Still, its permanent virtual wardrobe now numbers 600,000 individual items. And with a typical price tag of between $8 and $30, Shein’s rags cost roughly as much as those of Primark, a resolutely offline British retailer, and 30-50% less than similar ones from Zara or H, reckons Douglas Kim of Smartkarma, a research firm.
Shein has pulled this off by combining a mastery of fashion supply chains with on-demand manufacturing originally enabled by Chinese e-commerce giants like Alibaba. It starts with design. A team trawls the web for the latest trends using algorithms to determine what is grabbing attention. One of its members told Chinese media last year that he visits thousands of websites to come up with ideas. These concepts are sent to another group that draws up designs, which are then manufactured in batches as small as 100 items, compared with a typical order of thousands.
Next, learning from Alibaba, Shein tests the new designs simultaneously on its app. With all sales happening digitally, managers have a real-time view of the performance of each item. If a new design is popular the company quickly orders more. If consumers shrug at the new style, no more orders are placed. By centralising inventory in a small number of large warehouses and then shipping directly to customers, Shein has pushed inventory turnover down to just 30 days, compared with an industry average of 150 days, according to a consultant who works with the company.
To streamline the entire process Shein has moved from the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing to Guangzhou, a huge southern manufacturing hub. It has also been offering factory bosses better terms than most fast-fashion rivals. The firm guarantees it will purchase the entire batch and pay within 14 days rather than the 90 days common in the industry, in exchange for guaranteed supply. Around 400 of Shein’s 3,000 or so suppliers in China have signed up to this deal, says Chen Tengxi of Zheshang Securities. A bespoke software interface lets them know when production needs to be stepped up.
Insta-catwalk
Shein has deployed digital savvy not just in its procurement but also in sales and marketing—the second thread of its success. Besides handing out products free of charge to thousands of influencers, a common practice nowadays, it has recruited hundreds of local designers in America and several other countries. As well as dreaming up new clothes, they market its products and backstories on social media. The company plans to hire another 3,000 such third-party designers in 2022.
The strategy has helped Shein amass 250m followers across Instagram, TikTok and other social-media platforms. About 70% of them shop on Shein’s mobile phone app, which boasts 24m daily active users. On any day, one in two of the world’s shoppers who buy apparel online do so using its app. This approach has been so effective that others are trying to copy it. Gabby Lewis, a designer in Los Angeles who works with Shein, reports that as soon as the Chinese firm began featuring videos of her promoting her products on social media, rival fashion groups got in touch to see if she would do the same for them.
The third ingredient in Mr Xu’s winning formula is deft avoidance of geopolitical controversy. Shein wears its Chineseness lightly. Unlike other Chinese brands that have tried to conquer the world, such as Huawei, a telecoms-equipment giant, or Xiaomi, which makes smartphones, it sells next to nothing domestically. That weakens its already loose association with China in Western eyes. Western consumers assume, correctly, that like most of their clothing, including Western brands, Shein garb is made in Asia. Few realise (or care) the label is Chinese. Helpfully, most shipments to individual customers in America are small enough to dodge tariffs on Chinese exports imposed as part of a trade war between the two countries.
Shein has also evaded scrutiny from the Chinese Communist Party. In part that is because selling frocks is less contentious than making semiconductors or writing artificial-intelligence software. Its tiny presence at home has also spared it the sort of headache that has afflicted Alibaba and other internet groups with a large domestic business as President Xi Jinping intensifies his campaign to right the perceived wrongs of Chinese capitalism.
For all its stupendous success, Mr Xu’s formula is not without risks. Some of these relate to its industry. Like others in the fast-fashion business, Shein has come under fire for waste and a heavy impact on the environment. Many fast-fashion brands are facing questions over whether they source cotton from the Xinjiang region in far-west China, where the government is accused of using forced labour. And its products’ low price sometimes goes hand in glove with shabby quality. Pictures comparing Shein garments received by customers with the catalogue images have turned into online memes, hurting its reputation in Europe, notes one consultant.
Other dangers may be more specific to Shein’s heavily digital business model. Although venture-capital funding rounds have valued the company at $15bn and it has reportedly approached investment banks about an initial public offering, no one outside the firm seems to know whether it makes any money. In recent years Shein executives have given few media interviews, and none to Western journalists. Chinese media have consistently dubbed it China’s “most mysterious unicorn”. Analysts are left scratching their heads over its profitability and margins.
That may not be a problem, at least in the short term. Investors’ appetite for tech-adjacent startups, even loss-making ones, is undiminished. Another Shein-specific risk may prove harder to manage in the long run. The company relies on collecting lots of data from American shoppers. As a result, it may face the same problems that befell TikTok, another hit Chinese export to America. Last year the short-video app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, barely averted a forced sale of its prize asset to American investors over fears that Americans’ data could fall into the hands of China’s Communist rulers (an accusation that TikTok has always vociferously denied).
As with TikTok’s social-media rivals in America, Shein’s Western competitors may invoke national security as a reason to curb its relentless rise. That would be a compliment—after a fashion. ■

An early version of this article was published online on October 3rd 2021",1
1681,"FROM THE outside, it resembles an army base, an expanse the size of 45 football pitches filled with rows of austere, grey, three-storey buildings. The facility (pictured) on the outskirts of the southern city of Guangzhou is China’s first purpose-built quarantine centre for people arriving from abroad. Soon guests will begin moving in to its more than 5,000 rooms. For at least two weeks, whether fully vaccinated or not, they will live in isolation, their food brought to them by robots.
Since the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, China’s aim has been to eliminate the coronavirus entirely from within the mainland’s borders. Hong Kong and Macau have similar strategies. But even as the handful of other countries with “zero-covid” policies, including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, move to relax them, China is holding out.

The point of Guangzhou’s $260m facility is to make it even harder for the virus to enter the country, by keeping people quarantined away from densely populated areas. People flying into the city from outside the mainland will be whisked there directly, instead of to normal hotels, for at least two weeks of confinement and frequent testing. Even the medical staff may not leave the premises. After working there for four weeks, they must do a week of quarantine and then, after returning home, spend another two weeks in isolation.
Chinese officials describe the complex as the latest example of “China speed”: it took just three months to build. Another dedicated quarantine centre (unlike Guangzhou’s, not built from scratch) is also due to open soon in the nearby city of Dongguan. It will have 2,000 beds. Officials have ordered cities elsewhere to follow suit. In September, at a training session for medical staff in Guangzhou’s facility, an official tried to fire them up with a well-known term used by Mao Zedong to describe a relentless, long-lasting campaign to wear down the enemy with guerrilla attacks. It would be a “protracted war” against the virus, he said. “It can only end when the disease is no longer around.”
China’s zero-covid policy involves keeping most foreigners out, meticulous quarantines, huge manpower, track-and-trace apps, intense lockdowns in areas where the virus is found and frequent mass testing. A recent traveller to China from New York describes having to submit photographs of her pre-departure covid test to the Chinese consulate-general to prevent any fakery. Two pictures, taken by a nurse, were of blood being drawn from her arm and a swab up her nose. Another, by clinic staff, showed her at the entrance, holding her passport and a test certificate.
Such efforts have achieved impressive results, given the size of the country and the porousness, in normal times, of its land borders with some of its 14 neighbours. By October 10th China’s official tally of covid-related deaths stood at 4,636. Only three had occurred since April last year. Some provinces have seen no fatalities at all, including Jiangsu on the coast. It has a population of more than 80m, nearly as big as that of Germany where the official death toll is 94,000. To the Chinese authorities, a big outbreak is one involving dozens or, rarely, hundreds of cases: barely a blip in the statistics of most other countries.
If the world were to face a similar outbreak again, knowing what it does now, many countries would choose China’s approach. But eventually they would face the same question: when to relax those measures? As the rest of the world begins to get used to covid as an endemic disease—always present but contained at a level that people consider acceptable—how long will China keep up its enormous campaign to crush it altogether?
It is an important question, of concern not only to China’s 1.4bn people, but worldwide. Consider just one side-effect of China’s zero-covid approach: the inability of world leaders to meet China’s president, Xi Jinping, face-to-face. Mr Xi has not received foreign visitors or travelled abroad since January 2020. He is unlikely to attend a meeting of the G20 in Rome at the end of October, or a subsequent UN climate-change conference in Glasgow. At a time of potentially dangerous tensions with America, he has yet to hold a formal summit with President Joe Biden. On October 6th China agreed to such a meeting later this year, but only by video link.
Mr Xi’s hard choice
Several factors will affect China’s decisions about when and how to change its policy. They include the way the virus mutates, the effectiveness of its vaccines (China does not allow the use of foreign ones), risks to the economy and the public mood. The Communist Party has hailed its success in crushing the coronavirus as evidence of the superiority of China’s political system. Accepting that the virus is endemic would involve a big change of tune.
The Delta variant, now dominant globally, is making China’s policy a lot harder to implement. It spreads two to three times more easily than the original strain, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. But such problems may be offset by a high rate of vaccination. By September 15th, the latest date for which data are available, 71% of Chinese had received two jabs and another 10% had received their first (see chart 1). By comparison, 56% of Americans and 64% of EU residents had got two shots by October 11th.

However, China is unlikely to relax its policy soon. The imminent opening of Guangzhou’s high-tech quarantine centre hints at this. The National Health Commission has recommended that workers at airports, borders and quarantine sites be given priority for booster shots. Such people are most likely to be exposed to infections brought from abroad. If the zero-covid policy were about to be abandoned, those most in need of booster jabs would be vulnerable people such as the elderly, who would be infected locally.
By September 15th China had given two jabs to nearly three-quarters of people over 60. But even if it succeeds in vaccinating almost all of them, as some countries in Europe have achieved, hospitalisations will still increase after the country starts opening up. By how much will depend on the jabs. China has approved seven vaccines, all of them produced by Chinese firms. The two most widely used are made by Sinovac, a private company, and Sinopharm, which is state-owned. Both have been endorsed by the World Health Organisation. They are based on a traditional kind of vaccine technology, using an inactivated form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Like the West’s vaccines, China’s work well at preventing serious illness but less so at stopping covid’s spread. It is hard to compare them more precisely. Few studies have tried doing so among comparable groups of people, at the same time and in the same place. There are not enough infections in China to enable effective vaccine-testing. So most data have been gathered elsewhere. Most trials have involved exposure to non-Delta variants. A study of 61m vaccinated people in Brazil, conducted when most infections there were caused by the Gamma type, found that Sinovac’s vaccine was 75% effective against hospitalisation, and AstraZeneca’s 90%. In Chile, Uruguay and Indonesia Sinovac’s jab has been used in national vaccination campaigns. It has proved 85-95% effective in these against hospitalisation and death. Like the Western vaccines, it works less well among the elderly.
There are fewer data relating to Sinopharm’s shots. But they, too, seem less effective than some of the vaccines used in the West. In Bahrain people vaccinated with Sinopharm had higher rates of infection, hospitalisation and death than those who had received Pfizer’s or AstraZeneca’s jab—especially if they were aged over 50 at the time when Delta became dominant.
China could try to strengthen its defences by allowing the use of Western vaccines. But it is determined to rely on home-grown solutions. One reason is clearly political: the party wants to be seen as the sole enabler of China’s salvation from the virus. For a while, state media suggested that the West’s vaccines were shoddy. An application in China for approval of Pfizer’s vaccine, made in partnership with BioNTech using an advanced technology known as mRNA, has made little progress. Two million doses of it that were meant for China have been sent to Taiwan instead.
It is possible that China will develop better vaccines. Its army has been working with two private Chinese firms on an mRNA type. But it may not work well. China is a latecomer to the technology. An mRNA vaccine made by CureVac, a German company with long experience in the field, proved only 47% effective in trials. It may be a long time before China feels confident enough in its vaccines to consider scrapping the zero-covid policy.
Might economic malaise force China’s hand? The country’s repeated skirmishes in recent months with Delta-related outbreaks have prompted sudden and severe lockdowns. Combined with a longer-running campaign against property speculation, these may have sent the economy into a “double-dip” contraction, according to Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank. He thinks China’s GDP shrank by 0.2% in the three months from July to September (compared with the previous quarter), following a spectacular first dip when the pandemic struck (see chart 2).

Other recent data also look gloomy. During China’s national-day holiday from October 1st to 7th, people took about 58m trips a day across the country, official data show. That was about a third less than in 2019 and also 7.5% less than they took last year. By contrast, during this year’s five-day public holiday in May, the number of trips exceeded pre-pandemic levels.
But although China’s fight against covid has hurt services, its exports have been strong. Indeed China’s periodic, pointillist lockdowns have been less disruptive to its factories and trade than the more sweeping restrictions imposed in manufacturing rivals like Vietnam. China has benefited from covid-related shifts in buying patterns in foreign countries, where people stuck at home have been splurging on goods such as electronics and exercise gear. China makes such things aplenty.
How would the economy have fared if the Delta variant had spread more widely? China’s weak retail spending is in part due to covid-related controls. But it is also caused by fear of the virus, which would only deepen if China were to lower its guard. Chinese people are right to worry. Huge social stigma surrounds anyone who gets the virus and thereby triggers a lockdown. Such a person also faces legal sanctions. And the health-care system is weak. The number of intensive-care beds per 100,000 people in China—about 3.6—is much closer to the level of India than to that of rich countries. In overseas markets, Chinese shares have suffered heavy sell-offs in recent weeks, wiping more than $1trn off the value of some of the country’s biggest tech firms. But this has reflected anxiety about new regulatory moves, not about China’s economic prospects under an indefinite zero-covid regime.
Foreign businesspeople in China certainly grumble. One reason is that the government is reluctant to grant visas to spouses or children. An American who runs two businesses in China had a baby in America during the pandemic. He cannot return even though he and his wife have a visa. The total population of non-mainlanders in Beijing and Shanghai fell from about 316,000 a decade ago to just 226,800 last year, census data show. Those who remain are often treated with suspicion by strangers, who view them as potential virus-carriers. A campaign encouraging people to report foreign “spies” does not help.
But despite such gloom, foreign direct investment in China amounted to nearly $114bn in the first eight months of 2021, more than one-quarter higher than in the same period of 2019. Less than one-tenth of European firms are thinking of diverting investment away from the country, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reports. In 2015 about one-sixth were.
Some Chinese experts have aired suggestions that, when vaccination rates are high enough and death rates low, China should abandon zero-covid. In a recent on-camera interview with a Chinese magazine, China’s most senior disease-control official, Gao Fu, said the country may reach a vaccination rate of 85% by early next year. At that point, Mr Gao asked: “Why don’t we open up?” He also said China should study Mao’s protracted-war idea in the fight against the virus. But he suggested this would involve living with it.
Mr Gao, however, is not a member of the ruling Politburo, whose members may have considerations unrelated to epidemiology. One is that there appears to be strong public support for the zero-covid approach. In June online commentators excoriated one of China’s most respected scientists, Zhang Wenhong, for suggesting that the country should relax the policy next year. Official media appeared to echo such criticism by publishing the views of a former health minister (whose background is in finance) expressing “astonishment” at the idea of easing controls. In August a teacher was detained for 15 days after suggesting that Yangzhou relax its lockdown. He, too, was vilified on the internet.
People applaud the lengths to which the government goes to keep the virus out and stop it from spreading. Some wealthier Chinese may resent the difficulty they now face going abroad on holiday, or even getting a passport (the police have become much more reluctant to issue them). But many people have little sympathy with their travails. Travelling internally can involve much hassle. At motorway checkpoints on the edge of Beijing cars often have to join lengthy queues so that police can scan the ID cards of people entering the city, check their health apps and record other details. But if there is anger over such bothersome procedures, people swallow it.

As for the enforcers, many of them have a stake in the status quo, too. During the pandemic, grassroots Communist Party committees have been re-energised. Their chiefs, once sidelined by rapid social and economic change, have gained new authority to mobilise people and deploy resources to control covid. They will not readily return to their often-marginalised pre-pandemic state, nor does the party want them to. It hopes that its street-level workers will play a bigger role in maintaining order in urban neighbourhoods, using skills honed during the pandemic.
The party may see other political benefits from keeping the zero-covid policy. It faces a series of big public events that it will not want overshadowed by outbreaks that raise embarrassing questions at home about its vaunted ability to defeat the virus. In February Beijing will host the Winter Olympics; the annual session of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, will be held in March; and late in the year the party will convene a five-yearly congress which Mr Xi (bathed in glory, he surely hopes, for his victory over covid) will use as a launching pad for five more years, at least, in office.
A human-rights storm is already brewing around the winter games. Activists and politicians in the West have called for boycotts in protest against China’s human-rights abuses in the far-western region of Xinjiang and its repression in Hong Kong. On September 29th, however, the International Olympic Committee announced China’s decision that, to keep the virus in check, no spectators will be allowed from outside the country—the same restriction that applied to this year’s summer games in Tokyo. This will much reduce the risk of foreign visitors marring the events with protests. As for possible boycotts by Western leaders, China may avoid that problem by not inviting them.
Again, many Chinese applaud. As China’s leaders consider possible harm that may be caused in the long term by clinging to their zero-covid policy, the rise of nationalism at home is not among their concerns. The party has deliberately fed it with West-blaming and West-scorning rhetoric, suggesting that the only morally correct approach is to eliminate the virus entirely. Many Chinese, encouraged by state media, believe the West has been peddling falsehoods about the origins of the virus in order to make their country look bad. Such sentiments have made the poisonous atmosphere surrounding China’s relations with the West, evident well before the pandemic, even more toxic.
When China does eventually declare that the virus need not be eliminated, its reopening to the world will not necessarily be greeted with joy by many of its citizens. They see a West that has rejected China during the pandemic, not the other way round. Their bitterness will be long-lasting, and not about the zero-covid policy. ■

1682,"OVER THE past decade Gloria Porras, a judge on Guatemala’s constitutional court, has earned a reputation for fearless independence. It came as little surprise to some, then, that on April 13th Congress refused to confirm her nomination for a third five-year term. The move is the latest effort to oust Ms Porras, who has faced a series of lawsuits from groups believed to be acting on behalf of corrupt politicians, smears in the media and attempts to strip her of her immunity as a judge.
Resistance to crusading judges is growing. The constitutional court is the primary target since it deals with politics and crime. Ms Porras often ruled against the rich and in favour of the marginalised. She boosted the rights of indigenous people, who make up at least 40% of the population of 18m. She also helped block a congressional proposal to provide amnesty for crimes against humanity.

The backsliding started under the administration of Jimmy Morales, president from 2016 to 2020. In 2019 he refused to renew the mandate of CICIG, a UN-backed commission that successfully prosecuted dirty politicians and businessmen. But Ms Porras says pressure on her has intensified since Mr Morales’s successor, Alejandro Giammattei, took office.
The judicial system has been hindered in other ways, too. In 2009 a law was adopted to bring transparency to the committees that appoint judges to the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal. But according to the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) a human-rights lobby group, the process has been marred by conflicts of interest and criminal manipulation. For example, an increasing number of law schools have been created to try to influence which judges are picked (the committees are partially drawn from these schools). Last year the special prosecutor’s office against impunity, a state body, suggested that a businessman in pre-trial detention for corruption had attempted to rig the selection process. Congress, as the blocking of Ms Porras’s confirmation shows, is also biased. It barred another judge, Néster Vásquez, from taking his seat on the constitutional court. Other judges on the court have close links to the president: one of them, Leyla Lemus Arriaga, was his chief of staff.
This will further weaken the rule of law in Guatemala, one of the factors behind the migration of its citizens northwards. “The constitutional court was one of the last checks and balances in the country,” says Adriana Beltrán of WOLA. The abuses that will follow its taming are yet another reason to leave. ■",1
1683,"VENETIANS CAN be credited with one significant intervention in the history of travel and one near miss. Disgruntlement over the constant din led them to consider a ban on wheelie-bags in Venice’s alleyways in 2014, though it was never enacted. Seven centuries earlier the city pioneered the use of international borders to stop an infectious disease. The word quarantine is derived from a requirement for ships to anchor offshore for 40 days if plague was suspected. Perhaps inconvenient for ancient mariners, the impact on the travel business of attempts to keep covid-19 at bay has been greater. Efforts to restore confidence have accelerated moves to make travel more digital, contactless and seamless.
Reinstating international travel depends on reassuring people that it is safe and finding ways acceptable to health authorities to let passengers fly. Long quarantines are almost as much of a deterrent to travel as a ban, says Andrew Charlton of Aviation Advocacy, a consultancy. “The public are not scared of flying, they are scared of arriving.” Getting people back onto planes is not a problem, if the rebound in domestic markets where covid-19 persists is a guide. A poll in July 2020 by UBS found that only 10% of European leisure travellers and 9% of businessfolk would refuse to fly in the foreseeable future. In October data collected by IATA found that only 44 out of 1.2bn passengers since the start of 2020 were known or thought to have contracted covid-19 on a plane. IATA’s medical adviser notes that, even if 90% of cases went unreported, that implies just one infection for 2.7m passengers.

Commercial jets are fitted with a grade of air filter found in operating theatres. The air on board is replaced 20-30 times an hour. Seating arrangements help. Boeing reckons that sitting side by side in an aircraft facing a seat back is equivalent to sitting seven feet apart indoors on the ground. New measures make flying safer still. Some airlines are keeping middle seats in economy free. Hygiene practices go far beyond the cabin crew sauntering down the aisle collecting rubbish. Queuing for the toilet is banned on some flights and airlines have introduced rules to keep passengers apart by ensuring they get on and off in strict row order. Planes are thoroughly disinfected between flights.

The main obstacles to a rapid rebound are closed borders and ever-changing regulations for entry, as covid-19 ebbs and flows. Out of 220 countries monitored by Kayak, a travel firm, 50 remain closed to air travel, and most of the rest have some restrictions. Effective vaccines give hope, but Gloria Guevara, boss of the WTTC, says the travel industry “cannot wait”. Her organisation says that 198m jobs are at risk if current restrictions remain in place until the summer.

The aviation industry has pushed testing to get planes back in the air. But agreement on how, where and when to test is covered by such a mish-mash of different requirements as to make flying even more troublesome. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans should have a test one-to-three days before flying and three-to-five days after a trip abroad, and also isolate at home for seven days. It also requires travellers to America to have evidence of a negative test. Many other countries require a test as a condition of entry. This is often accompanied by checks on arrival and a period in quarantine, sometimes in a hotel at the traveller’s expense. A PCR test, often required by countries that insist on a test before travelling, can cost $50-150.
Until fast, accurate and cheap tests are available or vaccinations are widespread, the hope is that a standard pre-departure regime could allow a restart of international travel. Airlines think trials of different systems may provide evidence that pre-flight testing is enough to dispense with quarantine rules. IATA and ACI World, a global airports association, have called for an internationally recognised pre-flight testing regime to replace quarantine.
If such systems are to work, mutually agreed standards and some way of showing that passengers are covid-free and/or vaccinated will be needed. Qantas’s boss, Alan Joyce, reckons a valid vaccination “passport” may become a general pre-boarding requirement. This has led to a flurry of activity to develop digital-health passes. IATA is promoting Travel Pass, a digital-health app, that allows governments to verify tests and identities of passengers presenting a result issued by a recognised laboratory. Free to travellers, airlines will pay a small fee. A more recent vaccination credential initiative, backed by tech giants including Microsoft and Oracle, has a similar aim.
Such technology will become common, reckons Arnaud Vaissié of International SOS, the world’s biggest travel-security firm. AOKpass, its digital-health pass, is secure and easily readable using blockchain technology. Apps like this will be the basis for a new focus on health in travel. Mr Vaissié notes that, after 9/11, security went from being an obscure corporate function to the main priority in many boardrooms. Health information will become as vital to international travel as a passport is today.
The experience of electronic tickets for airlines, which went from 20% of the total in 2004 to 100% by 2008, shows that digital data-sharing can cut costs and make travel easier. Technical hurdles remain to making different health systems interoperable with each other and with airlines’ passenger-information systems. Jeffrey Goh, boss of Star Alliance, the world’s biggest airline alliance, says the industry is resigned to living with multiple passes. Personal data will need to be secure but systems must also be flexible enough to reveal what health data is required where—lots on arrival in snooping Singapore but little apart from covid-free status in America, say. And a way needs to be found not to discriminate against passengers who are unable to take a vaccine.
It helps that the travel industry has long been working on how to make journeys more seamless. Steve Peterson of IBM, another company working on a digital-health pass, says such systems could be the “backbone” for storing more data, allowing a new level of personalisation in travel. He cites the example of a passenger with a trip from London to New York that includes a plane ticket, hotel and transport on arrival. If something changes, such as a delayed flight, an app loaded with personal preferences can automatically rebook all these elements. It may eventually book the entire trip, with a traveller just entering where and when to go and letting details of past journeys and personal preferences guide the choice of flight, hotel and so on.
Passage through airports may be about to get easier as well. Jeff Lennon of Vision-Box, a Portuguese operator of automated border controls, argues that “biometrics is the enabler…the face is the key”. An app will store a person’s credentials, cameras can then recognise the traveller at security and boarding gates will automatically open. Travel may thus become a more seamless, even personalised experience, with business customers greeted by name and even given their favourite drink. Nina Brooks of ACI World reports that some 50 airports are trying out biometrics. The ideal outcome would be continued travel without most of today’s hassles.■",1
1684,"America’s annual inflation rate soared to 4.2% in April, higher than expected and fuelling concerns that rising consumer prices may become a problem for the American economy. Inflation hawks blame the huge amounts of stimulus injected into the economy and a boom in consumer demand (prices for used cars were up by a fifth, year on year). Global supply bottlenecks are also pushing up costs for manufacturers. The Biden administration, however, thinks inflationary pressures are temporary and will ease later this year.
Commodity prices are also going up, with the prices of iron ore and copper reaching record highs, in part because China’s factories are sucking up supplies. Oil prices are on the ascent again, approaching $70 for a barrel of Brent crude.

The FBI launched an investigation into a cyber-attack that forced the closure of the Colonial Pipeline, which stretches from Texas to New Jersey, providing half the transport fuel for America’s east coast. A criminal gang called DarkSide claimed responsibility. It describes itself as apolitical. There was some panic-buying of petrol (gas) as pump prices soared.
With the outlook for inflation uncertain, stockmarkets bounced around as investors pondered whether the Federal Reserve would change direction and raise interest rates. The share prices of high-growth big tech companies have fallen in recent weeks because higher bond yields lower the value of their forecast earnings.
Markets were also rattled by weak data on the American jobs market. Employers added 266,000 people to their payrolls in April, well below the numbers for February and March. And job vacancies hit 8.1m at the end of March, the most since records were first compiled in 2000. That led to a lot of head-scratching by economists trying to explain a lack of hiring when the economy is taking off.
Just warming up
The British economy shrank by 1.5% in the first quarter compared with the previous three months. The post-Christmas lockdown hit output hard in January, but by March it was expanding again as businesses adapted to the restrictions. GDP was still 6% smaller than before the start of the pandemic in February 2020.
SoftBank reported net income of ¥5trn ($46bn) for the year ending March 31st, a record annual profit for a Japanese company. Much of that came from gains in its vision-fund investments, particularly Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce company that went public in March. It reported a deep quarterly loss this week, despite rising sales.
Elon Musk, a vocal backer of digital currencies, reversed his three-month-old policy and said that Tesla would not now accept bitcoin as payment for its cars because of the environmental effects from the electricity used to power the currency on computers.
The EU’s General Court, the second highest in the bloc, ruled that the European Commission was wrong to order Amazon to pay €250m ($300m) in taxes to Luxembourg, finding that the commission had not proved the firm received special tax treatment. The same court made a similar decision last year in the case of Apple; the commission is appealing that ruling to the European Court of Justice.
America’s Department of Defence agreed to remove Xiaomi from its ban on American investment in companies that are said to have ties to the Chinese army. The maker of smartphones and other devices had already won a suspension of the ban in court.
Almost 40% of the shareholder vote at AstraZeneca’s annual meeting rejected the salary package for its CEO, the latest in a wave of rebellions by investors against generous payouts for executives dished out during the pandemic. The pay policy—which increases the potential bonus and stock awards for Pascal Soriot—was approved by just 60% of shareholders at the meeting.
There were more signs of a recovery in the tourism industry. TUI, the world’s largest tour company, said there had been a clear pickup in demand. Although it doesn’t expect its business in 2021 to reach pre-pandemic levels, bookings for holidays next year from Britain, one of its biggest customer markets, are exceeding bookings at this point in 2019.

1685,"Schoolies has well and truly kicked off on the Gold Coast as thousands of teenagers flock to the city for a week of partying.
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
With a kiss and a hug goodbye to mum, many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning.
Others had already gone to the local supermarket to stock up on food and drinks for the week ahead.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",3
1686,"IN 1975 Adam Fergusson, a journalist on the Times, published a book called “When Money Dies”. A history of hyperinflation in Germany in the early 1920s, it was written with an eye to what was going on in the then-present day. Inflation in Britain was not at the prices-soaring-day-by-day levels seen in the Weimar Republic. But in 1975 it reached an unprecedented 24%—grim enough for Fergusson’s warning that the experience of inflation was “totally absorbing, demanding complete attention while it lasts” to hit home.
Rapid, continuous increases in prices arbitrarily take wealth away from savers and devalue people’s wages. It is not just the purchasing power of a unit of currency that is eroded; it is the trust in a reliable future on which contracts and capitalism depend. From the early 1970s to the 1980s more than 50% of Americans said “inflation or the high cost of living” was the single biggest problem facing the country.

But by the 1990s the beast seemed to be vanquished. Average rates dropped; so did the number of “inflation surprises” in which the rate spikes (see chart 1). When “The West Wing”, a television show, gave its fictional president a “secret plan to fight inflation” in 1999 it was as a joke, not a plot point. True to Mr Fergusson’s belief that the experience of living with inflation is “forgotten or ignorable when it has gone”, his book fell out of print.

It was republished to acclaim at the end of the 2000s, when post-financial-crisis stimulus packages increased government debt prodigiously, and “quantitative easing”, the process by which trillions of new dollars would be created, started to hit its stride. Many worried that the stage seemed set for prices to surge in a way which had not been seen for a generation.
They did not. Over the 1970s rich-world inflation averaged 10% a year. In the 2010s the rate stayed stubbornly below 2% a year. That is one of the reasons that the small but vocal band of economists and investors that is once again worried about excessive price rises is by and large being ignored. The agenda for a big conference on central banking to be held in February has copious space for financial instability, climate change and inequality but barely any for inflation—despite taking place in Germany, a country which, since Weimar, has all but fetishised sound money.
Indeed a modest rise in inflation, rather than giving central bankers the vapours, would have them sighing with relief. In recent years, and most dramatically during the worst of the crisis this spring, the threat of demand-sapping deflation loomed large, especially in the euro area and Japan. Some want central banks to aim for inflation higher than the 2% target that most of them use, and America’s Federal Reserve has already said that it wants to overshoot its 2% target in the recovery to make up for recent shortfalls. Recent experience suggests that may be hard: interest rates close to zero have left monetary policy hard-put to push inflation back up even to 2%.
Look behind you
But if it is easy to ignore the prophets of doom, it may not be wise. If 2020 has a lesson, it is that problems which many in the world had broadly stopped worrying about can rear up with sudden and terrible force. And those sounding the alarm today are right to point out that the circumstances of the covid pandemic do not offer a simple re-run of 2009’s false alarm.
Some of today’s inflationistas predict a possibly high but transitory spike in prices as consumer spending bounces back from the pandemic. On December 3rd Bill Dudley, who was until 2018 a vice-chairman of the Fed’s interest-rate-setting committee, warned Bloomberg readers that sharp price increases might be necessary “to balance demand with the available supply, which the pandemic has undoubtedly diminished.” The next day David Andolfatto, an economist at the St Louis Fed, warned Americans to “prepare themselves for a temporary burst of inflation.”
Others warn of more persistent inflationary pressure. Economists at Morgan Stanley, a bank, predict “a fundamental shift in inflation dynamics” in America, with inflation rising to the Fed’s 2% target by the second half of 2021 and going on to overshoot it. After a typical recession such a rebound takes three years or more. The most pessimistic group warns that complacent or distracted central bankers will allow such pressures to go unchecked, leading to a decade of stubbornly high inflation comparable to the 1970s.
Three main factors are deemed to be at play: the after-effects of the stimulus measures taken by governments to cope with the pandemic; demographic shifts; and changes in policymakers’ attitudes towards the economy.
Take the stimulus packages first. Monetarism, which was the dominant economic ideology over the period in the 1980s during which inflation was squeezed out of rich-world economies, sees the root cause of inflation as an excessive supply of money. On that basis the fact that nearly a fifth of all the dollars in existence have been created this year clearly looks perturbing. Central-bank balance sheets in America, Britain, Japan and the euro zone have risen by more than 20% of their combined GDP since the crisis began, mostly to buy government debt. This new money is paying for enormous stimulus programmes, including wage subsidies, furlough schemes and expanded welfare benefits that put money in pockets and purses.
This money creation differs from the burst seen after the financial crisis—the burst which, despite warnings, triggered no surge in inflation. That earlier burst began during a prolonged credit crunch. This meant that the new money created by central banks was making up for money that was not being created by bank lending.
This time it is not just “base money”— physical cash and electronic reserves the quantity of which is under central-bank control—which has soared. Measures of “broad money”, which includes households’ bank balances, have, too. Lending to the private sector has risen sharply as firms have borrowed cash to continue operations. After 2009 the broad-money supply rose slowly; today it is spiking (see chart 2).
The private sector will thus find itself flush with cash as vaccinated economies reopen. Households and firms may remain cautious, sitting on their accumulated savings. But amid the joy of reopening they may instead go on a spending spree, making up for all the time not spent in theatres, restaurants and bars during 2020. That would result in a lot of money chasing goods and services that might not be in ample supply, resulting in a period of inflation that would tail off as the purchasing power of the money involved fell, bringing things back towards the status quo.
From the Black Death on
Researchers from the Bank of England who looked at 800 years of (admittedly patchy) records have concluded that inflation does typically rise in the year after a pandemic begins. A recent paper by Robert Barro of Harvard University and colleagues finds that the influenza pandemic of 1918-20 “increased inflation rates at least temporarily”. By the time the effects of the covid-19 pandemic are fully on the wane more firms will have joined the ranks of those which have already gone under and many of the survivors will be struggling to run at full tilt. Thus people’s willingness to spend could easily rebound faster than their opportunities to do so. There is already some evidence of bottlenecks where supply is falling behind demand. The price of shipping an object from one country to another has jumped in recent weeks, while the price of iron ore has risen by more than 60% since the beginning of the year.
This is the risk of which Mr Dudley warns. In the aggregate, though, investors seem unconvinced. The inflation expectations which can be derived from prices in financial markets have recently picked up a little thanks to the good news on vaccines and the prospects for a rebound in the world economy. But they still suggest that investors think next year’s inflation is more likely to be below the 2% central banks target than above it (see chart 3). Lars Christensen, a Danish economist, points out that this means there is a “clash” between the two best-known economic theories associated with the Chicago school. Milton Friedman said sustained growth in the money supply leads to inflation; Eugene Fama argued that market prices fully reflect all available information. “If you believe that we are going to have inflation now...the efficient-markets hypothesis would have to be wrong,” Mr Christensen argues.

Most economists side with the markets and Mr Fama. In general they no longer think about inflation as 1980s monetarists did (indeed even Friedman, late in life, admitted that modern central banking might have severed the link between the money supply and prices). Following the “New Keynesian” framework of the 1990s they believe that the underlying driver of inflation is a combination of the public’s expectations of price rises, which are self-fulfilling, and the health of the labour market. Both currently point to low inflation.
Neither survey data nor the financial markets suggest that the public expects dramatic price rises. And most forecasts suggest it will take some time for employment to find its pre-pandemic level, even in the economies which bounce back most quickly. Goldman Sachs, a bank which has been especially bullish about the prospects for the American economy, does not expect the unemployment rate to fall below 4% until 2024. And America’s economy is expected to recover faster than most. Relatively high unemployment—in the jargon, an “output gap”—will give firms little incentive to increase people’s wages, and thus little need to raise prices. A “projected large output gap should push global core inflation 0.5% percentage points below its pre-crisis levels next year”, argue economists at JPMorgan Chase, another bank.
So even if there is a spending boom, there will be plenty of economic slack around to accommodate it. Some economists bridge the two views, predicting that the economy will get back to speed in fits and starts, some perhaps inflationary. But for most, high joblessness and contained inflation expectations make forecasting continued low inflation a no-brainer.
What, though, if the New Keynesian view is missing key parts of the story? In “The Great Demographic Reversal”, published last summer, Charles Goodhart, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary-policy committee, and Manoj Pradhan of Talking Heads Macro, a research firm, provide an alternative view of the past decades’ low inflation. It was not, they say, the result of a correct diagnosis of the problem leading, in the hands of independent central bankers, to appropriate monetary policy. Rather, it was driven by global demography.
In recent decades the integration of China, Europe’s formerly communist east and other emerging markets into the global trading system provided the world economy with millions of new workers. As bosses found it ever easier to get their labour done in Guangdong or Bratislava the bargaining power of rich-country workers fell, and price rises to cover increased wages became a thing of the past. This fits the finding that much more of the low inflation seen in recent decades has come from stable or falling prices for goods that can have their site of production shifted than has come from services which have to be delivered in situ.

Things are now about to change, the authors claim. As populations in the rich world and China age, the number of dependents per worker will soar, creating a labour shortage in care industries. True, Africa and India have plenty of youngsters. But rich-world politics may further increase the barriers to their migration. Workers in the rich world will thus acquire more bargaining power; wages will rise and prices will rise accordingly. As well as reigniting inflation, these demographic forces will make Western countries more equal, Mr Goodhart and Mr Pradhan argue: another seemingly inexorable trend reversed.
It might seem that the recent experience of Japan, the rich country that has aged the most, puts paid to this idea. Inflation there has long been lower than anywhere else, despite Herculean efforts on the part of the Bank of Japan. Mr Goodhart and Mr Pradhan counter this argument by saying that a “global escape valve” stopped inflationary pressures in Japan from achieving much. Rather than stagnate, investment moved overseas as Japanese manufacturing firms took advantage of plentiful global labour. Cheap imports kept goods inflation down and the offshoring of manufacturing jobs reduced workers’ bargaining power.
In fact, though, wage growth in Japan’s manufacturing industries has been comparatively strong. What is more, the authors concede that Japan’s ageing population has not had quite the effect on the dependency ratio that might be expected—because many more elderly people are now working. The same phenomenon could yet contain inflation elsewhere.

The third argument for fearing a return of inflation is political. It rests on the idea that governments and central banks are becoming more tolerant of inflation, and that they will become even more so as the extent of the pressure on government budgets becomes apparent.
Back in the 1970s presidents and prime ministers were happy to strong-arm central bankers into doing what they wanted. Inflation was tamed only after Paul Volcker proved the Fed’s commitment and independence by pushing America into recession to slow price rises. A new paper by Jonathon Hazell of Princeton University and colleagues argues that post-Volcker “shifts in beliefs about the long-run monetary regime” have proved more important than any other factor in conquering inflation. Their actions in recent decades have built up a firm expectation that central banks will respond to the prospect of inflation rising above its target with higher interest rates, regardless of what politicians and the public might want.
It is possible that these norms are weakening. In recent years there have already been greater attacks on the independence of central banks, such as President Donald Trump’s exhortations that interest rates should stay low. And during the pandemic the relationship between central banks and finance ministries has grown unusually close. After it ends, politicians will face the problem of the debts left behind. Where those debts are long-term, inflation would be a handy way to reduce their real value, easing the strain on budgets. Politicians may be more willing to entertain such an option for the reason identified by Mr Fergusson—that, after a long period of low inflation, people forget how awful it can be. A third of the people currently living in the rich world had not been born when average inflation last exceeded 5%.
Doubting the future
The Fed’s commitment to deliberately allow inflation to exceed 2% during the recovery is Exhibit A for this belief. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), emphasises her mandate is to “support the general economic policies” of the EU, as well as ensure stable prices. Central bankers everywhere now admit, if only under their breath, that as well as maintaining price stability they are also trying to keep governments’ long-term-borrowing costs low in order to facilitate fiscal stimulus. Should inflationary pressure start to rise while they are doing so, will they abandon that effort? Central banks which put up borrowing rates under the current circumstances would undoubtedly face opposition from the finance ministries that would pay the increased costs and suffer in subsequent elections. Inflationistas think that the politicians would win, as in many cases they constitutionally should. Central bankers’ independence is granted by elected politicians.
But this political argument, too, has its weaknesses. The ECB’s independence is protected by treaty, and even though it has become more willing to stimulate in recent years, it still exhibits a hawkish bias, tolerating inflation expectations that are well below target. Elderly people like to vote and tend to dislike inflation, argues Vitor Gaspar of the International Monetary Fund. That should limit any political pressure for higher inflation in ageing societies.
The doves and the markets currently have the better of the argument. But the case for reflation in the world economy is stronger than it was after the global financial crisis. A recovery from the pandemic that is untroubled by excessive inflation looks likely. But it is not guaranteed. ■",1
1687,"THE TIMING could hardly be more awkward. Colombia is suffering a third peak of covid-19, even more deadly than its predecessors. Almost all intensive-care beds in the main cities are full, and oxygen tanks are running short. Bogotá, the capital, is under a red alert, with the working week cut to four days and a curfew at 8pm. Yet in April the government of President Iván Duque sent a bill to Congress proposing stiff tax rises. Although the increases would be phased in, the government thinks it must signal now its intention to raise more revenue, particularly if it is to provide emergency aid to its people until the pandemic is over. Many of the country’s politicians disagree, and the bill was the target of a large national protest on April 28th.
Colombia is an early example of the fiscal dilemmas Latin American governments will soon face. The region has suffered grievously in the pandemic. Its economy shrank by 7% last year, more than double the average contraction around the world. As lockdowns eased a couple of months ago, there was optimism that recovery might exceed the 5% growth of most forecasts. But then the P.1 variant of the virus, first detected in Brazil, began to run wild. Like Colombia, other South American countries have been forced to restrict movement yet again. Meanwhile vaccination is happening slowly. The result is that 2021 is shaping up to be another difficult year.

Matters would be even worse had governments not been able to soften the blow with aid to poorer households and to firms. Though not on the generous scale of many rich countries, this fiscal stimulus was much more than the region managed in past slumps. According to a study by the IMF, it averaged about 4.5% of GDP. With revenues falling because of the recession, fiscal deficits ballooned and public debt rose last year from an average of 64% of GDP to 72%.
That would once have been seen as a dangerously high figure. But low international interest rates make it more affordable. Nonetheless, several governments are scaling back aid even as the pandemic continues. Many economists think that is a mistake. Investors will tolerate deficits and debts provided governments set out—and preferably approve—credible measures to curb them once economies have recovered.
“It’s right to spend during the pandemic,” argues Alejandro Werner, the IMF’s outgoing director for Latin America. “But it’s also right to start thinking about tax and spending reforms.” In a typical Latin American country, paying for the better health care and social assistance citizens are demanding while at the same time servicing higher debt requires a rise in government revenue of between 1.5% and 3% of GDP. (Some countries would need instead to trim ineffective spending.) If recovery turns out to be slower, tax rises could be postponed.
This is the path Colombia’s government wants to follow. Its bill raises around 2% of GDP in additional revenue, mainly by widening the net of income tax and removing exemptions in VAT. Mr Duque says that would allow the government to continue to make emergency payments of $44 per month to over 3m poorer households, compensate them for levying VAT on basic goods and continue a furlough scheme. It would also safeguard Colombia’s investment-grade credit rating, which makes borrowing cheaper for firms and the government.
The bill is praised by tax specialists but, with a general election due next year, it has prompted political uproar. Woundingly for Mr Duque the critics include Álvaro Uribe, a conservative former president who is his political sponsor. Mr Uribe has submitted an alternative bill that would cut the revenue gains in half.
Other countries will soon face similar decisions. The region is not facing a debt crisis—or at least not yet. But the credit-rating agencies are flashing an amber light. Joydeep Mukherji of Standard  Poor’s, one agency, notes that with 13 downgrades since the pandemic began and nine “negative outlooks”, Latin America’s credit score has been hit harder than that of any other region.
If Colombia’s tax reform is thwarted by short-term political considerations, that sends the wrong message to other governments. The risk is that “we’ll end up with not enough stimulus and problems with the financial markets,” says Mauricio Cárdenas, a former finance minister in Colombia. That would mean Latin America would have to say adiós to a robust economic recovery.",1
1688,"Boris Johnson has refused to say whether his father Stanley will be probed by the Tories after two women made claims of inappropriate touching.
The PM said it was 'absolutely right' women feel they can make complaints with confidence.
It comes after it emerged Stanley could be fired from a prestigious role as an environmental ambassador over the sexual assault allegations.
The powerful Conservative Environment Network, of which he is international ambassador, said: 'The alleged behaviour is not acceptable.'
The 81-year-old allegedly assaulted Conservative MP Caroline Nokes who said he had smacked her 'on the backside about as hard as he could' in 2003.
Her revelation earlier this week promoted political journalist Ailbhe Rea to come out and say he 'groped me'.
But as calls grew for a probe, a supporter of the 'charming' former MEP vowed it should not be a police matter if he was 'a little over-friendly, indeed handsy'.
Asked about the claims against his father, Mr Johnson said today: 'First of all, it's absolutely right that everybody, women in particular, should be able, have the confidence, to come forward and make complaints.'
The Prime Minister added: 'I'm obviously not going to comment on individual cases.'
He also declined during a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, North Yorkshire, to say whether he has spoken to his father about the allegations.
Last night it emerged Stanley could lose his role as international ambassador of the Conservative Environment Network.
Yesterday in an excruciating exchange in the Commons, the PM found himself being grilled by MP Miss Nokes about government policy on sexual harassment.
She did not mention her own claims against his father, but asked Mr Johnson if women would have more confidence 'if public sexual harassment was a specific crime', and if early intervention might stop 'those harassing women becoming sex offenders?' 
Stanley ignored questions on the matter as he left his house in north west London yesterday.
He had previously told Sky News: 'I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all – but there you go.'
Labour has called for 'criminal authorities' to investigate the claims, which emerged on Monday when Miss Nokes named Stanley during a panel discussion on Sky News.
She said during the Tory Party conference in 2003, when she had been the Tories' candidate for Romsey, Stanley slapped her bottom and said: 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat.'
After the allegation was broadcast, political journalist Miss Rea, who writes for the New Statesman, tweeted: 'Stanley Johnson also groped me at a party at Conservative conference in 2019.'
Yesterday another political journalist, Isabel Oakeshott, tweeted a photo of herself with the PM's father.
But she wrote: 'The charming Stanley Johnson can be a little over-friendly – indeed handsy – but I don't believe this is one for the police.
'Officers should focus their limited resources on investigating real crimes.'
She was deluged with replies from Twitter users accusing her of 'excusing' sexual assault. One said: 'I don't think 'Handsy Stanley' is the defence you think it is.'
Sky News political correspondent Kate McCann tweeted: 'You might be OK with someone being handsy but other women would find that uncomfortable...
'Your tweet suggests… it's their problem if they're offended, not his for being 'over-friendly'.'
Lifelong conservationist Stanley was made international ambassador at the think-tank the Conservative Environment Network in February.
But the organisation has now distanced itself from him, saying: 'We take all allegations of inappropriate behaviour very seriously.
'We have clear internal processes for managing allegations of this nature. The alleged behaviour is not acceptable to CEN.'
The chairman of CEN is Ben Goldsmith, a family friend of the Prime Minister's wife Carrie.
Yesterday the PM was grilled about sexual harassment when he appeared before Parliament's liaison committee of senior MPs.
They included Miss Nokes in her capacity as chairman of the women and equalities committee.
Miss Nokes – two days after accusing his father of smacking her bottom – put it to the Prime Minister.
She said: 'Isn't it fair to say that if public sexual harassment was a specific crime, you might see women with more confidence to come forward?'
Mr Johnson replied: 'All women should have confidence to come forward… and there are proper procedures for those claims and complaints to be investigated.'
The MP asked: 'Should we not intervene earlier, before those harassing women become sex offenders?'
The PM said: 'We need to prosecute people more effectively for things that are already criminal.'
Earlier Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the International Trade Secretary, said if Mr Johnson Snr had touched her inappropriately, 'I'd have probably slapped him'.
She told Sky News: 'This is something women have, for far too long, had to tolerate – the casual sexism, the wandering hand.'",3
1689,"YOU KNOW it’s election time in Germany when every lamppost sprouts the grinning face of a politician. The placards appear suddenly. Local authorities decide on a date and time, and activists race to get their ladders out: popular lampposts on busy roads are hot property.
The images on the placards and the posters have barely changed since 1949, when modern Germany’s first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, stared ferociously into the middle distance above the words “Peace, Freedom and Unity”. Today’s would-be chancellors use the same technique: a face, a party name and a slogan. But strategists now analyse how to transmit the party’s core message in the two seconds voters on average spend looking at a poster. What look like bland photos are carefully, and expensively, choreographed.

The posters of the current poll favourite, the centre-left SPD’s Olaf Scholz, are the most successful, says Frank Brettschneider, a political scientist at Hohenheim University. Mr Scholz, who is selling himself as the Angela Merkel continuity candidate, sits statesmanlike, as if he’s already chancellor. His capable-looking hands are in the foreground, crossed in a manner reminiscent of a characteristic Merkel pose. “The SPD has done well focusing on the candidate, who is more popular than the party,” he says.
Mrs Merkel’s own party, the conservative Christian Democrats, for their part have realised that their candidate, Armin Laschet, is more of a liability than an asset. So their slogans feature more prominently. Unfortunately, a ring around Mr Laschet’s photo gives him the appearance of being stuck in a washing-machine.
The usually immaculate Christian Lindner, leader of the market-friendly FDP, has opted to look knackered in shirtsleeves at his night-time desk—a hardworking, last-one-in-the-office pose that he hopes will appeal to his pro-business supporters.
The Greens, also realising that their candidate, Annalena Baerbock, divides opinion, often feature their co-leader, Robert Habeck, alongside her. They have chosen to drench their photos in a murky, pond-like pale green. “They look like Martians,” says Professor Brettschneider.
To foreign observers from more image-conscience climes, the posters can seem old-fashioned and the photos unattractive. Few people, after all, are in politics because of their looks. But in Germany posters are effective political tools. Some 56% of voters said they were informed about parties and candidates from posters, compared to only 48% for TV ads and 25% for social media, according to a study by Hohenheim University and Forsa, a polling company.
The posters are omnipresent, so they are seen by voters that are hard to reach. “Whether we want to or not, we can’t escape political posters,” says Stephanie Geise, a professor in communications at Bremen University. When it comes to broadening voter turnout, maybe cardboard is cutting-edge after all.",1
1690,"THE VAST spheres rest on a desolate ridge at Cape Kiglapait in Labrador, one atop a tower and two others on the ground like a toppled snowman abandoned by giants. Each is a radome enclosing radar antennae that spew invisible waves across the Labrador sea. They are the electromechanical sentries of the Arctic. Strung across the northern fringes of Canadian territory from Labrador to Yukon, then into Alaska, the Kiglapait station and its many siblings form a picket line known as the North Warning System, or NWS (see map).
Since the early days of the cold war, Canada has served as North America’s first line of defence from Russian bombers and, later, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), whose quickest path to North America lies over the poles. To detect such threats, the United States and Canada jointly built a line of radar stations in the 1950s that stretched 5,000km (3,100 miles), known as the Distant Early Warning (DEW) line, and established a North American Aerospace Defence Command (Norad) in Colorado. The DEW line was replaced with new radars in the late 1980s, creating the NWS. Now the two countries are contemplating its renewal. That is far from simple.

One issue is that the radars’ targets are changing. The shift from DEW line to NWS reflected a shift from ICBMS, which loop high into space, and can thus be spotted easily, to cruise missiles, which fly slower but lower. Now Russian air-launched cruise missiles fly faster and farther, which means that the bombers which carry them must be spotted at greater distance.

In March the commander of Norad warned that missiles could probably strike America from “launch sites on Russian soil”. The collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty in 2019 means that Russia could also deploy ground-based cruise missiles in the Arctic. New hypersonic gliders, with the speed of ballistic missiles and the manoeuvrability of cruise missiles, could fly around the NWS.
Updating the picket to cope with such threats poses a challenge. The Canadian Arctic is a forbidding place. The radar stations are uninhabited, with contractors visiting occasionally for maintenance. When entrances freeze up crews smash their way in with sledgehammers, says Colonel Walter Norquay, director of the North Warning System Office in Ottawa. Inquisitive polar bears are not uncommon.
Another challenge is that the radar stations are built on land populated by the Inuit and other indigenous peoples. The federal government has ceded powers to the Arctic region and is a signatory to a UN declaration that requires it to consult indigenous groups before using their land for military purposes. “We don't want to make the past mistakes that we did,” says Andrea Charron of the University of Manitoba. One was leaving five tonnes of PCBs, toxic chemicals, at Resolution island.
Today, the Inuit are closely involved. The Canadian Rangers, an army unit whose recruits are largely indigenous people, inspect many of the most desolate sites. “We are the ears and the eyes of the military,” says Harry Flaherty of the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation, the for-profit development agency of the 15,500 Qikitani people.
America and Canada split the costs of the NWS in a 60-40 ratio, but would need to negotiate how to pay for any successor. Canada’s latest budget allocated C$163m ($131m) over five years for Norad modernisation, though some experts reckon the total bill may eventually run to $11bn. Successive American governments have been irked by Canada’s low spending on defence, which at 1.39% of GDP is well below NATO’s 2% target.
More broadly, the two countries do not always agree on Arctic matters. One dispute is over the status of the Northwest passage, which Canada maintains are “historic internal waters”. America insists that the passage is an “international strait”. Differences like these are managed amicably. But American officials view the Arctic as a zone of competition with Russia and, to an increasing extent, China. Canada prefers a softer approach. Though happy to track nuclear threats, it has been wary of joining American plans to parry them with interceptors in Alaska and California, fearing that would upset nuclear stability.
Part of modernising the NWS is making better use of what is there now. Its radars collect “a whole bunch of data that previously has just not been used”, says Whitney Lackenbauer of Trent University. In Colorado, Norad is using a system called Pathfinder, which uses machine learning to analyse data not just from military sensors, like the NWS, but also commercial ones to spot threats amid the flow of civilian air traffic and the clutter of weather.
The biggest question is whether a network of ground-based radars is still the best way to shield the continent. In “Norad: beyond modernisation”, a report published in 2019, Dr Charron and Jim Fergusson, a colleague, argue that even longer-ranged radars deployed farther north would struggle against the new Russian missiles. Building new radars in melting permafrost and cleaning up old sites would also be expensive.
Canada thus hopes to eke out the life of the NWS for as long as possible. One way of doing so is to augment ground-based radar with radar aboard ships, planes, blimps and satellites. In 2019 Canada launched a trio of radar satellites in polar orbit that can provide excellent coverage of the Arctic. More may need to follow. North America’s tripwire may steadily migrate to space, and into the virtual cloud. ■",1

1692,"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our coronavirus hub
IN ABSOLUTE TERMS, America has been the country worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 1.7m of its inhabitants have been infected, a number which is still growing by around 20,000 every day. On May 27th the country passed its 100,000th confirmed death. Such official death tolls do not necessarily capture all of the lost, and the real tolls in some other countries may be much higher than they seem. But America’s official figure is more than 20 times that, say, of China, the country where the disease originated. China is unlikely to have managed to hush up 95% of its deaths.
In most countries such a national tragedy would bring with it a wave of unity. And in many places across America that is what has been seen. All sorts of communities have been suffused by a spirit of mutual aid. People have stopped their ordinary lives to flatten the infection curve, pooled cash to feed unemployed restaurant workers, clapped and banged on pots nightly to celebrate health workers, and held drive-in church services for socially isolated spiritual succour.

On the national stage, though, no such luck. President Donald Trump has done little if anything to bring the nation together or to provide effective leadership to the government’s executive branch. He has used the exceptionally prominent bully pulpit he engineered through daily prime-time press briefings to spread confusion, misinformation and folly.
To get beyond the spectacle of Mr Trump’s shortcomings, and the hatred and disdain with which all his actions are greeted in some quarters, requires seeing America’s experience of the epidemic for what it is: highly uneven geographically; disproportionately harmful to some minorities; but, in terms of its death rate, not as yet particularly bad when compared with many countries in Europe.
There were a number of structural reasons to imagine that America would be hit particularly hard by an epidemic such as this. Its health infrastructure is set up principally to maximise profits, and such a system’s incentives are not well aligned with pandemic preparedness. One cannot bill an insurer for surge-capacity ventilators, let alone spare intensive-care beds, for specialists in infectious diseases whose expensively acquired expertise is not normally needed or for stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE).
The health-insurance system is patchy and expensive, leaving many Americans with too little or no coverage. Researchers speculate that African-Americans may have had a particularly deadly experience of the virus in part because, being less likely to have adequate insurance than their fellow citizens, they tended to seek treatment later in the course of their disease, which typically leads to worse outcomes.

America, like China, has a younger population than Europe’s. Other things being equal, that should have helped. But other things were not equal. Americans have high levels of conditions that make the virus more lethal, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Roughly 11% of Americans are diabetic, compared with 5% in Italy or France; more than one-third of adults are obese, compared with less than a quarter in Germany. The burden of cardiovascular and respiratory disease in America is substantially higher than it is in western European countries.
Different in many ways
Despite all this, the statistics to date do not show America doing particularly badly. As of May 27th it had seen 301 deaths per million citizens. The 27 countries of the EU have between them seen a death toll of 125,000; 279 deaths per million people. But seven EU countries (including Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) currently rank above America in their mortality rate. So does Britain, where the official rate is a shocking 559 per million. America thus looks to have fared better, so far, than most major European states, despite significant structural disadvantages when it comes to its people’s health and the system meant to maintain it.

Against this, though, should be counted two other factors. The first is that America is less densely populated than Europe, and much less densely populated than the western European states that have been very badly hit. The pandemic has in general been worse in densely populated places. The parts of America which have been worst hit are those with western European population densities (see chart 1).
The second is that the infection began to spread in at least some parts of Europe significantly earlier than it did in America. Italy passed the 100-confirmed-deaths milestone on March 4th, almost two weeks before America did; South Korea had logged 3,000 cases before America’s first death was reported. There was thus a short grace period during which America might have shored up its response.
Current evidence suggests that the best thing to have done with that time would have been to get into lockdown sooner. Researchers at Columbia University have estimated that if America had implemented its social-distancing measures just one week earlier it could have reduced nationwide infections by 62% and deaths by 55%.
In America’s federal system the timing of shelter-in-place orders and other population-wide measures aimed at stopping the spread of the virus was always going to be a matter for states and cities. Those that went earlier can now be seen, in general, to have done better. A team of economists studying the differences in timing of shelter-in-place orders among states found that the average effect of social-distancing orders in America was to reduce caseloads by 44% within three weeks—with better results for high-population-density states.
The divergence between the East and West Coasts of the country shows the difference vividly. Seattle and San Francisco were early hotspots but shut down fast—which seems likely to be part of the reason that they avoided a meltdown like New York’s, where the unwillingness of Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, to adhere to the advice of his public-health agency may have lost valuable time. San Francisco has seen just 40 deaths, compared with New York’s 21,000.
Some states might have shut down earlier had they had enough testing capacity to properly evaluate the spread of the virus. Alas the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) botched the manufacturing of the test for the virus that it had created in January. Its failure might have been made good, at least to some extent, by private industry. But the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was unwilling to license their efforts. Thus much of the head start which might have made America safer was lost.
Special in some sort of way
This was not Mr Trump’s fault. He did not set the timing of the lockdowns, sabotage the CDC or fetter the private labs. But that does not exonerate him. His public statements in the early stage of the pandemic sought to minimise the threat that it posed to America well after scientific advice was making it clear that it would hit America hard. A clear, realistic warning from the White House might have concentrated the minds of state governments. And the jostling with the FDA could have been avoided had Mr Trump’s administration banged agency heads together and insisted on a co-ordinated, purposeful response.
America’s public-health services are a remarkable resource in terms of brainpower, analytic capability and experience, but they are also numerous and disparate. There are at least a dozen federal ones; local agencies number in the thousands. During the Ebola crisis of 2014 President Barack Obama appointed a tsar to keep the various necessary efforts aligned with one another. Mr Trump has done nothing similar. Nor does he feel he should have. On March 13th, when talking about the failure to get a serious testing infrastructure in place early on, he said, “I don’t take responsibility at all.”
There was no wartime management of the supply chains for testing reagents, swabs and other needed kit. Rather than acting as a co-ordinator, the federal government encouraged an internecine competition between states for PPE and ventilators. A federal agency outbid the commonwealth of Massachusetts for 3m medical-grade face masks, dramatically seizing them after they had been delivered to a New York port. Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, was so worried about the federal government muscling in on an order of 500,000 testing kits from South Korea that state police spirited them away to a secret location straight from Baltimore airport.

In assessing this friction, it is worth having a look at the fortunes of two other federated republics during the pandemic (see chart 2). In Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, the president, thinks that containing covid-19, which he once likened to “sniffles”, is not worth the economic cost (see article). He has tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent some states from locking down. When tasked with enforcing those lockdowns which have gone ahead, the police, who are generally sympathetic to the president, have been dilatory. Brazil’s death toll has been climbing steeply.
Germany provides a counter-example. Its states quickly set the country’s many private labs to work on testing; this wealth of testing capacity in the early stages of the epidemic allowed local public-health officials to trace contacts and close hotspots of transmission. Angela Merkel, the chancellor, clearly communicated the risks to the public. She and the heads of Germany’s states collectively agreed to shutter the economy just a day after the country had recorded its tenth death.
The degree to which Mr Trump’s denial of the problem and lack of engagement with the response made America’s epidemic worse is unknowable. But it is hard not to imagine that the country might have been better served by an approach more like Mrs Merkel’s. Germany’s overall death rate has remained considerably lower than that of other comparable European countries; it is one-third that of America’s.
In one area, though, Mr Trump’s mere presence has been integral to America’s outperformance of comparable countries, indeed of any countries: stimulus spending. The states’ actions have hit America’s economy hard. The official unemployment rate, 3.5% in February, was 14.7% in April. Almost 40m Americans have now filed for unemployment during the epidemic, roughly a quarter of the pre-crisis labour force. “Absent a historically unprecedented burst of hiring, the unemployment rate could remain in double digits [until some time in] 2021,” economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently concluded.
The federal response to this incipient depression has been remarkably generous. Congress has provided ample unemployment benefits and a grant-and-loan scheme for big and small businesses. Its fiscal stimulus has so far amounted to something like 14% of GDP—higher than most European countries. Of the $9trn the IMF estimates to have been spent on fiscal stimulus globally, $2.8trn has been American. There has been a one-time grant of $1,200 to most Americans and a temporary $600 boost to weekly unemployment benefits, which means many of those laid off will be receiving more than they did in work until payments sink back to where they were on July 31st.
Nothing works for everybody
There have been difficulties in getting some of this money out fast enough—state unemployment offices had few staff and run on antiquated software—and gaps in provision remain. Since the start of the crisis, food banks have distributed nearly 1bn meals, 20% more than usual. A recent survey found that more than one in six young children were not eating enough because of their parents’ loss of income. But there is more money in the hands of the unemployed than there might have been.
To get a sense of the counterfactual, compare the prompt generosity of this year’s action to what Congress provided in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-09: $840bn. The difference is nothing that Mr Trump has done—co-ordination with Congress has been the treasury secretary’s task—but the simple fact of his election-year incumbency. Republican lawmakers are much more willing to loosen the purse strings under Mr Trump, not least because of the effect of the economy on his election prospects, than they were under Mr Obama. Had covid-19 struck late in President Hillary Clinton’s first term, rather than Mr Trump’s, it is a fair bet that there would have been similar hostility this time round, too.
Spending may ease the pain; but many states are nevertheless reopening businesses and easing restrictions on work and social gatherings. Thirsty patrons are snaking around the block to get into reopened bars in Dallas; vacationers at Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks filled up swimming pools over the holiday weekend.
Again, it is the states which are doing this, not Mr Trump—despite his various attempts to undermine the shelter-in-place orders while they were in force. But the politics of Mr Trump’s presidency are a key part of how things have unfurled.

This is because the geographical underpinnings of covid-19 epidemiology and electoral politics are correlated. Low population density predicts both a low covid-19 death rate and a propensity for supporting the Republican Party. Places where Mr Trump has the most support tend to have atypically low experience of the medical effects of the epidemic (see chart 3). Recent polling by YouGov has found that only 9% of Republicans have had a family member, friend or acquaintance die of covid-19, compared with 15% of Democrats. Many Republicans in sparsely populated areas feel entirely justified in their exasperation with blanket stay-at-home orders.

But the partisan divide on reopening is not just a matter of population density. Researchers at Stanford, Harvard and NYU, armed with location data from mobile phones, have found that throughout lockdown Republicans have been less likely to adhere to social-distancing orders than Democrats, even when living in places with similar levels of infection and similar official constraints on activity. This is in line with research by The Economist on movement during lockdown in America and elsewhere (see chart 4).
The tyranny of the blood test
The right-wing media, which give their audiences a sense that lockdowns, mask-wearing and calls for greater testing are weak-willed coastal liberalism, have also played a role. Economists estimating the causal effect of watching Fox News, the television channel in closest alignment to the views of the president, find that it may have persuaded one-third of its viewers not to comply with stay-at-home orders. Nearly 4m Americans watch the network’s prime-time opinion shows each night.
America is not an outlier in the fact of its reopening; the same is happening in western Europe. But there is a crucial difference. European reopenings have been preceded by clear indications that the rate of infection was falling. The same is not true for all of America.
An epidemiological analysis published by researchers at Imperial College London, found that, as of May 17th, “the epidemic [was] not under control in much of the US”. In 24 states the number of further cases to be expected as a result of each new case remained above one. The situation has improved since then, but not by leaps and bounds. New York and surrounding hard hit states are showing declining levels of infection. In other states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, infection rates do not appear to be under control, perhaps because their lockdowns were not that well observed. Outside New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, hospitalisation rates have not changed since the start of May.

Part of the point of a sustained lockdown is to take the time it buys to build the capacity to deal with later recurrences with well-thought-through and resourced testing and contact-tracing programmes. These are not in place nationwide. “We had time to develop these capabilities that required a national co-ordinated effort, and we have not used this time,” says Leana Wen, a former health commissioner of Baltimore. “And I’m afraid that as a result, the sacrifices that people have made are in vain.” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, testified before the Senate that, should states skip guidelines and open prematurely, “There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control.” Local spikes in new cases, if they go unnoticed, will allow community spread to re-establish itself.
Experts have recommended that a disease-surveillance scheme up to the task of nipping such recurrences in the bud would require testing rates of at least 1m per day. Some want a rate double or triple that. But today’s rate is reported to be less than half the desideratum—about 400,000—and that is probably an overstatement. Some states are juicing their numbers by reporting the results of antibody tests (which reveal that someone has had the disease) alongside diagnostic tests (which reveal current infections), an apples-for-oranges mistake.
In spite of this, as far back as May 11th a barefaced Mr Trump triumphantly told a Rose Garden of mask-wearing journalists that the testing mission was accomplished: “We have met the moment and we have prevailed.” If that is by happy chance the case, it is no thanks to Mr Trump. But re-openings which feel premature after lockdowns which were sketchily observed suggest it may not be the case at all. There may be more sad records yet to be set. ■",1
1693,"LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Italy's government and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) are preparing to call off negotiations over the sale of ailing bank Monte dei Paschi (MPS) (BMPS.MI) after efforts to reach an agreement over a costly recapitalisation plan failed, two sources told Reuters.
The decision would complicate efforts by Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government to meet a mid-2022 deadline agreed with European Union authorities to re-privatise the bank Rome rescued in 2017.
Rome will now have to gain clearance from Brussels to pump more money into Monte dei Paschi without a plan in hand to cut the state's 64% stake. It will also have to negotiate a new agreement with European authorities over its exit.
Italy has long seen a merger with a stronger peer as the best solution for the Tuscan bank and hired advisers to secure a deal last year.
But the sources said the terms demanded by UniCredit after it entered exclusive talks on July 29 have made the deal too costly an alternative to a standalone plan.
UniCredit had put forward requests for a recapitalisation package worth more than 7 billion euros which the Treasury deemed ""too punitive"" for Italian taxpayers after they spent 5.4 billion euros to salvage the bank four years ago, according to one of the sources.
""No deal is possible under UniCredit's conditions right now. But the same framework that was offered to UniCredit could be applied to a standalone plan,"" one of the sources said.
UniCredit, Italy's No. 2 lender, and the Treasury declined to comment.
PLAN B
Rome has already reviewed the possible benefits of a standalone strategy, which would see the Treasury implementing parts of the measures offered to UniCredit, including a capital increase worth several billions of euros, the source said.
Italy is likely to overhaul MPS' leadership to deliver the plan which would see the bank's remaining soured loans transferred to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO and its legal risks carved out and guaranteed by the state, this source said.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) has yet to see a standalone plan, a source close to the matter said, but it has no immediate concern over MPS's capital position.
MPS envisaged in January a 2.5 billion euro cash call if it failed to find a partner and the central bank's supervisors would need to approve any capital increase.
But the European Commission's Directorate-General (DG-COMP) will have the last word on MPS' fate having requested a disposal plan to be ready by a Dec. 31 deadline.
While DG-COMP may well grant an extension, it is unlikely to back down altogether from demanding a sale, this source said.
CHERRY PICKING
UniCredit had started discussing a possible purchase of MPS under previous CEO Jean Pierre Mustier. But his successor, Andrea Orcel, who took over in April, raised the bar, targeting a deal for only the most profitable parts of the bank which generate roughly 600 million euros in annual income, according to one of the sources. 
UniCredit had said it wanted only MPS' branches in wealthier northern and central regions, and would not take any soured loans or risks stemming from mismanagement.
After concluding its due diligence analysis in September, UniCredit presented the Treasury with detailed demands based on the July terms earlier this month. It aimed to reach a decision before an Oct. 27 board meeting to approve quarterly results.
The sources said the parties had found it impossible to bridge differences over MPS' recapitalisation needs, with one person saying the valuation gap stands at about 2.5 billion euros.
To complicate matters, disagreements resurfaced this week over the assets to be sold, with the government pushing to include MPS' capital services arm and its leasing and factoring unit, two sources had said.
In addition, negotiators haggled over the way UniCredit calculated its fair value adjustments on MPS' liabilities, which became another major stumbling block along with the size and costs of job cuts that Italy had to provide for, the first source said.

1694,"THE BALDING figure looks frail and harmless, sitting in the dock behind a Perspex screen in the German town of Koblenz, where the rivers Rhine and Moselle unite. But appearances can deceive. Anwar Raslan, 57, once a Syrian policeman, has been charged with torturing more than 4,000 people and murdering at least 58 between 2011 and 2012, when Syria’s dictator, Bashar al-Assad, set about crushing the initially peaceful demonstrations that shook his regime as the Arab spring took off.
Mr Raslan is on trial because, by his own lights, he made a mistake. Having fallen out with the regime, in 2012 he joined the exodus of Syrians who ended up in Germany, where he seemed to be settling down nicely with his family in a Berlin suburb, until one of his alleged victims, by a fluke, spotted his presence—and told a human-rights group. With the encouragement of NGOs, in particular the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), Germany’s judicial authorities applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, whereby human-rights violators of any nationality can be charged in any country, no matter where the crimes were committed. Mr Raslan was arrested in 2019. His trial began in Koblenz in April 2020 and may last for more than a year.

Scores of witnesses will be called before five German judges. Thousands of photographs collected by a Syrian military photographer may be shown. A gravedigger has described the condition of hundreds of bodies, often mutilated in the dungeons of the building where Mr Raslan is said to have worked, which were thrown into mass graves. A catalogue of torture is being spelt out in court, including electric shocks, the pulling out of fingernails, beatings with cables and whips, hanging upside down, dousing with cold water and rape—nothing was too cruel.
The idea of universal jurisdiction won global attention in 1998 when a murderous former president of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, mistakenly presuming diplomatic immunity, was arrested in Britain at the request of a Spanish judge—and was eventually sent home. Since then the practice has gathered pace. A new case opened on December 3rd in a court in Switzerland, where Alieu Kosiah, a Liberian former commander, is being tried for crimes such as mass murder and recruiting child soldiers, allegedly committed during a civil war more than 20 years ago in his home country.
The number of universal jurisdiction cases is rising. Máximo Langer, an Argentine expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, counts 815 such cases from 2008 to 2017, nearly as many as in the previous two decades put together. At least 16 countries have heard cases under universal jurisdiction; 71 cases have been completed, mostly with convictions. About 40% of the defendants have been African, a quarter from the Middle East, a fifth from Europe and 8% from Asia. Other regions may follow; Argentina is keen to use this powerful tool. Some countries allow universal-jurisdiction trials in absentia.
Spain and Belgium led the way in pursuing cases under universal jurisdiction. The Netherlands, the Nordics and Switzerland are prominent among countries where such cases are being tried. Germany is in the vanguard. According to Patrick Kroker of the ECCHR, which has helped at least a dozen plaintiffs in the Koblenz trial, 110 cases are now being investigated under universal jurisdiction in Germany, most of them to do with Iraq and Syria (concerning both the Assad regime and the slave-owning jihadists of Islamic State). The Koblenz case is the first where a member of the Syrian regime, albeit of middle rank, is facing justice in court.
Human-rights campaigners do not see universal jurisdiction as a rival system to the various international courts set up in the past two decades or so, culminating in the International Criminal Court (ICC). Rather, it is complementary. It is useful because the old system has holes in it. For example, the creation of UN-backed international courts and tribunals for Syria has been stymied by powerful countries (often China and Russia) which scorn the concept of individual rights and are bent on protecting their protégés. “The ICC has been blocked over Syria,” laments Fergal Gaynor, an Irish human-rights lawyer who is bidding to be the ICC’s next chief prosecutor. “So an expansive universal justice system has had to step in.”

The ICC, which started to operate in The Hague in 2002, remains the cornerstone of an ambitious new architecture of international justice. It is the sole permanent court where grand-scale offenders, including heads of governments and states, can face justice for serious crimes, the “core” ones being torture, crime of aggression, crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Two-thirds of the world’s countries—123 at last count, 33 of them African—have signed up to it. Its main message is that no leader should consider himself (rarely, so far, herself) to have impunity.
The ICC has stumbled largely because of geopolitics. It can function properly only if its signatories fulfil their obligations to arrest and send those indicted to The Hague. A clutch of important countries—the United States, China, Russia and India—have refused to sign up, citing encroachments on sovereignty. Cases can be referred to the ICC only by the UN Security Council or with the consent of the country where the crimes occurred. The council has referred only two cases, during brief moments when America, China and Russia decided not to block: Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s president, was indicted for alleged genocide in his country’s western region, Darfur; and Libya’s late dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, was indicted at the height of the Arab spring, when he was bombing civilians in the city of Benghazi.
Going down in Africa
The ICC has succeeded in convicting only a handful of big men, all of them African. Several African governments, at first keen on the court after the genocide in Rwanda, have concluded that it was anti-African, though all the African cases, bar Libya’s and Sudan’s, had been referred to the ICC by African governments themselves.
It was thanks to the mediation of a recently retired secretary-general of the UN, Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian, that in 2011 Kenya’s then government was persuaded to let the ICC indict two rivals, after a bloodily disputed election. It charged Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, who later became president and vice-president, with crimes against humanity, but later had to drop the charges. “The ICC was no match for Kenya’s government,” says Reed Brody, an American human-rights lawyer. “It controlled everything—the country, the witnesses, the evidence. No way could the people in The Hague win.” The ICC was humiliated.
The failure of states to arrest Sudan’s Mr Bashir as he swanned around Africa, even though they had signed up to the ICC, was another reminder of the court’s lack of authority: South Africa rolled out the red carpet for him. Another low point for it was when Laurent Gbagbo, a former president of Ivory Coast, whom it had charged with crimes against humanity, was acquitted eight years later.
Supporters of the ICC cite other tribunals backed by the UN that did bring justice to the many victims of atrocities during Yugoslavia’s break-up in the 1990s and during Rwanda’s genocide, which saw perhaps 500,000 people murdered, mostly with machetes, in 1994. Around 90 ex-Yugoslav and 61 Rwandan culprits were sentenced to prison, many for life. A final appeal by Ratko Mladic, the general who oversaw the massacre of 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, will be heard in 2021, closing a judicial process that has lasted a generation.
While the ICC has struggled, other “hybrid” courts have been more effective, embracing a medley of ad hoc judicial systems operating under a mix of home-grown and foreign judges. “The ICC will never be a solution for all human-rights violations,” says Serge Brammertz, a long-serving chief prosecutor for the Yugoslav tribunal. “I believe in an à la carte system: the ICC has an important but not the only role.”
Mix and match
That may be the best way to go. Mr Brody led a successful campaign to convict Hissène Habré, a mass-murdering former president of Chad who had fled into exile in Senegal, where he was tried and sentenced to life in 2016 by a special UN-backed African court. In that case, though justice was achieved in an ad hoc court, the legal process against Mr Habré was initiated under universal jurisdiction by Belgium, eventually cajoling a new government in Senegal, backed by the African Union, into setting up a special court. Mr Brody says that Mr Habré’s Chadian victims were inspired to seek justice by the Pinochet precedent.
Another recent case illustrates the enduring effectiveness of UN-backed tribunals. Félicien Kabuga owned a Rwandan radio station that helped orchestrate the genocide, urging neighbour to slaughter neighbour. He evaded arrest for 26 years; an informant who tried to lead police to him in Kenya in 2003 was found dead in a pool of blood. He was arrested near Paris last May, where he was living under a false identity, and sent to the ICC. He may be sent on to the Tanzanian city of Arusha, where a “special mechanism” has taken over from the Rwandan tribunal (it closed in 2015) to try the last of the génocidaires.
In the past decade or so other human-rights bodies have also set their sights on the worst offenders. The UN’s Human Rights Council (HRC), the nearest thing to a permanent global state-backed monitor, is often ridiculed because its 47-strong membership, chosen in regional groups, often on uncontested slates, always includes a clutch of egregious violators. As of January 1st it embraces the likes of Bahrain, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Russia and Somalia. The council keeps Israel permanently under special scrutiny—the sole country it constantly scolds.
Less toothless than it appears
The United States, an active and effective HRC member under Barack Obama, refused to take part under Donald Trump. Yet despite its faults the HRC is useful. Its system of Universal Periodic Review puts every country in the spotlight every four years. The commissions of inquiry it can order have often laid the groundwork for further investigations, sometimes by other bodies with more teeth. And many of its 50-plus “special rapporteurs” and “independent experts” have written trenchant exposés of torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions—along with more arcane topics such as the mistreatment of people with albinism and leprosy.
In 2005 the UN endorsed the principle of a “responsibility to protect” in cases of genocide or mass atrocities, justifying liberal military interventions. This has largely fallen into disuse. China and Russia are likely to veto any such proposal that comes before the UN Security Council.

However, governments that care about human rights have become savvier at getting around such obstacles. Although Mr Assad’s regime shows no sign of collapse, a vast body of damning evidence is being collected, which may one day be used in court against the regime’s chief villains. The Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), a Dutch-based NGO involved in the Koblenz case, is said to have collected 800,000 documents incriminating Mr Assad and his torturers.
Another way of circumventing the big human-rights blockers is to work through the UN General Assembly instead of the Security Council. A resolution presented in 2016 by tiny Liechtenstein led to the creation of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to investigate crimes in Syria since 2011. Not to be outdone, the almost as tiny Gambia pulled off a similar judicial coup, after the HRC had passed a resolution in 2018 to create an “Independent, Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar”. The Gambia got the backing of the 57-country Organisation of Islamic Co-operation to take Myanmar to the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ), the world’s highest court where states may contest each other, for its mistreatment of the Rohingyas, a Muslim minority. In September the Netherlands said it would hold Syria responsible, also at the ICJ, for gross violations under the UN’s Convention against Torture.
Is this panoply of tribunals, laws and reports, which name and shame countries and people, a true deterrent? “It’s impossible to prove a negative,” says Andrew Gilmour, former deputy head of the UN’s High Commission for Human Rights. “But yes, they do mind—they hate being shamed,” he says, citing the lengths to which countries such as China go to prevent scrutiny. “Anyone who says they don’t care—it’s nonsense,” says Prince Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the UN’s former high commissioner for human rights, who adds hopefully that “One day the ICC will become a powerful court.”
Moreover, there are signs that weaker countries that once kowtowed to China at forums such as the HRC are increasingly reluctant to do so. A row is brewing over the election of the council’s next agenda-setting president. China seems bent on stopping Fiji, which takes human rights seriously, from winning the post. Instead it is promoting a pliable candidate of its own, Bahrain. Five years ago China would easily have prevailed; now it is less cocksure.
Back on track
Whereas Mr Trump cared little for human rights, campaigners are confident that President Joe Biden will promote them. He is unlikely to sign up to the ICC, particularly as it may investigate America’s protégé Israel and perhaps, for alleged crimes in Afghanistan, America itself. But Mr Biden is likely to drop Mr Trump’s bizarre executive order to put sanctions on the ICC’s staff, including its chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, should they visit America. The United States may once again tacitly support the ICC, as it did before. Mr Biden may also seek to rejoin the HRC, where America under Mr Obama often led the way.
Human-rights campaigners say the enduring web of tribunals and the spread of universal jurisdiction are raising hopes. “Things are moving in an interesting direction,” says Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group, a think-tank in Geneva. “We need a range of tools,” he adds, hailing the EU and various states for enacting Magnitsky laws (named after a tax accountant murdered for exposing government chicanery in Russia) to prosecute individuals for human-rights violations or grand corruption. “It’s a very different climate,” says Mr Brody, who is seeking to have Yahya Jammeh, the Gambia’s former dictator, extradited from his exile in Equatorial Guinea to face charges of complicity in murder.
“A whole lot of things are happening that make international justice possible,” says Stephen Rapp, Mr Obama’s ambassador for war-crimes issues, who calls himself “a fan of universal jurisdiction and of hybrid courts”. Patience is in order. Mr Bashir, in detention since he was overthrown in 2019, may yet face justice, perhaps in a hybrid court in Sudan. Mr Raslan, the Syrian policeman on trial in Koblenz, may not be the sort of bigwig the ICC is intended to nail. But for torture victims in Syria, the trial is a welcome step. The evidence piling up, thanks to universal jurisdiction in Germany and elsewhere, suggests that Mr Assad may not enjoy impunity forever. ■",1
1695,"A tech billionaire allegedly kept a spreadsheet of 5,000 women he has had sex with, one of them a teenager he paid off to keep quiet, despite losing his high-profile job over a sexual misconduct allegation in 2016.
Michael Goguen, 57, a former partner at Sequoia Capital who now heads his own firm, has been sued by four former employees who say they helped manage his 'harem' of women.
The explosive lawsuit claims the investor met with the women at various safe houses or at a 'boom boom' room in the basement of his bar in Whitefish, a small town in Montana where he now lives.
The married billionaire, who has two children, once asked his employee to arrange a hit on a former friend who knew too much about his personal life, according to the lawsuit. 
A retired Whitefish police chief now says that Goguen - whom he compared to serial predators Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein - 'has to be stopped.'
These are the latest allegations of sexual impropriety leveled against Goguen, who in 2016 was accused of 'countless hours of forced sodomy' by his former girlfriend, exotic dancer Amber Baptiste.
The latest 135-page lawsuit was filed in February by former employees of Goguen’s Amyntor Group LLC, a security contractor, according to the New York Post.
It lays out a complex operation headed by Goguen to protect his simultaneous affairs. The breakdown of the operation, and the employees who helped it run, can be traced through multiple guilty pleas by former employees and associates who threatened to speak out about the alleged scheme.
Among the plaintiffs is Matthew Marshall, the former head of Amyntor who quickly grew to become Goguen's 'right-hand man.' 
Marshall pled guilty to wire fraud and other charges earlier this month after he pretended to be an elite member of the Marine Corps and asked Goguen for money for 'off the books' missions, according to the Flathead Beacon.
But Marshall says Goguen, who is currently married to his fourth wife, allegedly kept a 'harem' of 'numerous women, including married women, strippers, and prostitutes,' who he bought homes for and used for 'illicit sexual activity.' 
Goguen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. 
The tech investor is worth more than $5 billion, according to the New York Post. 
He flew some of the women in his private $42 million jet. 
'Marshall was being asked to purchase, out of his personal accounts, vehicles, jewelry, earnest money deposits on properties, and to provide cash or other items for Goguen’s mistresses, or as hush-money payoffs to Goguen’s acquaintances and employees who had ""learned too much"" about Goguen’s sexual misconduct and crimes, and the Goguen Sexual Scheme,' the lawsuit states.
'Goguen informed Marshall it was best to have him pay the property expenses, especially any expenses that were solely for Goguen’s safe houses, out of his personal account to avoid his then wife Jordana from discovering that Goguen owned a number of properties that he used extensively for extramarital affairs because Jordana had visibility over Goguen’s accounts at that time.'
The lawsuit, which is asking for $800 million in damages, claims various violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) act. 
It accuses Goguen of offering 'gifts' to the women - including alcohol, travel, jewelry, cash and health care expenses - 'to perform other deviant sexual acts with him, and/or to maintain their silence as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.' 
He gave one woman a credit card and bought her a five-bedroom home after her husband, a prominent businessman, found out about their affair and began divorce proceedings, according to the Post. 
Goguen also allegedly gave Eric Payne, who did construction for Goguen, an office in the basement of Casey's Bar, an establishment that he owns in Whitefish.
The office 'was passcode protected, had a built-in full size stripper pole, and commonly referred to as the ""boom boom"" room where he and Payne could procure young women to engage in sexual acts with them for money, drugs or other items of value as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.'
Goguen was vindictive against those who tried to put a stop to his nefarious activities, according to the lawsuit viewed by DailyMail.com.
His friend Bryan Nash called him a 'pedophile' after Goguen brought his two daughters to Nash's house but later absconded with their high-school-aged babysitter to have sex with her in a cottage on the property. 
The age of the babysitter is not clear. 
'Goguen threatened to kill Nash if he “said anything to anybody” about his “character flaw,” later telling Nash that he “owns Montana” and “supplies law enforcement,'"" the lawsuit states.
Goguen then began having sex with Nash's wife and paying for her divorce proceedings, allegedly costing Nash more money in a drawn out legal battle.
He used Marshall to investigate and harass Nash, who went to authorities 'to no avail,' the lawsuit states. 
In September 2014, Goguen texted Marshall using the encrypted texting service Wickr, writing: 'Nashf*** has pushed me too far and his occasional reminders he might help blow the lid off my personal life requires an extreme response. The cyber route isn't having the impact on him that I was hoping to achieve,' according to the lawsuit.
'Buddy, he’s f*****with my life, career, etc. and the potential for me being destroyed if he gets traction with the authorities or press is significant. This requires an extreme response. He will f***** destroy the ""bigger picture"" for us if he's not stopped. 
'He needs to be killed. I know that's a VERY big ask but we are in defcon 5. We can discuss details in person but we do NOT have conversations about this on our cell phones. Wickr only…'
Marshall did not try to have Nash killed, the lawsuit states.
In May 2020, Nash pled guilty to one count of blackmail after prosecutors say he threatened to release negative information about Goguen if he didn't pay him $250,000 to cover his divorce proceedings, according to the Flathead Beacon. 
Goguen is from Bedford, Massachusetts, according to the Post. 
He went to Cornell and Stanford universities, where he studied electrical engineering, and joined Sequoia Capital - an early investor in Google, YouTube and PayPal - in 1996, according to his LinkedIn.
He was let go from his job at Sequoia after Amber Baptiste accused him of physical and sexual assault over a 13-year period after he picked her up at a Texas strip club, according to the Post.
She said he sodomized her for 'six hours at a time' and forced her to call him 'king' and 'emperor' in a lawsuit asking for $40 million.
Goguen then told Marshall to act as his 'general 100x more aggressive than Patton was, to coordinate and make sure everything is happening that should be happening — PR firms, private investigators criminal side, local PR, everything,' according to February's lawsuit, emphasizing the lengths he was willing to go to, and the money he was wiling to spend, to punish those who hurt him. 
Back in 2016, Sequoia called Baptiste's allegations 'unproven and unrelated to Sequoia' but said that Goguen's departure 'was the appropriate course of action.'
In 2019, a judge dismissed Baptiste's lawsuit for failing to provide relevant documents or to submit to a medical examination, according to TechCrunch. 
A different judge then found that Baptiste committed fraud and extortion and granted Goguen a restraining order preventing her from repeating her claims, according to the Flathead Beacon.
The latest lawsuit does not name any of the allegedly 100 women in Goguen's 'harem.'
It does note, however, that he's bought some of them homes, including a multi-million dollar home in Santa Monica, California for a woman whom he allegedly got pregnant multiple times but paid to have abortions. 
Retired Whitefish Police chief Bill Dial, who is also suing Goguen, told the Post: 'This man has to be stopped. He’s a billionaire a la Harvey Weinstein and Epstein. There's a lot of people in this community who know what he’s about and they’re afraid of him.'
Goguen's employees say that a detective by the name of Shane Erickson was 'forced to resign' after failing to investigate sexual assault allegations against Goguen while 'improperly accepting gifts and other compensation' from him.
'Mr. Erickson was forced to resign from his position as a Police Detective with the Whitefish Police Department for failing to investigate the alleged conduct by Goguen and improperly accepting gifts and other compensation from Defendant Goguen while employed with the Whitefish Police Department,' the lawsuit states.
The teenager, identified only as Pam Doe, was given alcohol and cocaine by Goguen, Payne and a third individual, the lawsuit states.
In an email she wrote to her lawyer, she said she had been asked to pop out of a cake at a party when she was 17, wherein after she was 'roofied' and asked to be an 'escort,' to multiple men.
During the course of his investigation, Erickson told Marshall that Goguen admitted he paid her $1,200 to have sex with him. 
'During the course of April, May and June 2018, Det. Erickson openly shared with Marshall the fact that he was spending time with Goguen, including having dinner at his house, spending time on Whitefish lake, going on a coyote hunt and doing other leisure activities with their families,' the lawsuit says, adding that Goguen took Erickson via private jet on his 'yearly week-long ~$20,000 elk hunt in Colorado with private guides.'
Pam Doe eventually recanted her allegations. She was allegedly 'forced to sign a non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreement' and paid off. 
Whitefish police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. ",3
1696,"IN FIVE WEEKS the Supreme Court will return from its summer break to hear a batch of new disputes, including clashes over abortion and guns. After scrutinising briefs from litigants and amici curiae (friends of the court), the justices will hear oral argument in these cases and—weeks or months later—release opinions explaining why one party won and the other lost. But this methodically adjudicated “merits docket” represents a shrinking proportion of the Supreme Court’s notable business. Although the justices handle about five dozen cases this way each year (down from more than 150 in the 1980s), they dispatch thousands of other legal tangles without fanfare—and often with scant explanation.
The so-called “shadow docket” (a term coined in 2015 by Will Baude of the University of Chicago) includes emergency appeals from parties who believe they would be irreparably harmed without quick intervention from the justices. Whereas cases arrive on the regular docket if at least four justices agree to take them up, anyone can try their hand at filing an emergency appeal. Most shadow-docket orders are unremarkable. Some, like that of the man seeking to lift the federal airline mask requirement so he could fly to Germany without triggering an anxiety disorder, border on the comical. (His application was denied.)

Other orders, including a pair this week, are big news. On August 24th, with the liberal justices in dissent, the court rejected President Joe Biden’s plea not to be compelled to reinstate Donald Trump’s border policy, which required asylum seekers to await word on their applications while living on the Mexican side of the southern border. And as The Economist went to press, the second iteration of Mr Biden’s moratorium on tenant evictions awaited a quick judgment.
It has been a busy month in the penumbras. On August 12th, acting on her own, Justice Amy Coney Barrett rebuffed eight students who claimed Indiana University’s covid-19 vaccine requirement violated their constitutional rights. No explanation accompanied the denial. Two hours later, the court agreed to block part of New York state’s moratorium on evictions in response to a plea from a group of landlords. This time the majority offered a short opinion—with a single sentence of justification—and the three liberal justices appended 1,000 words in dissent. Some were not impressed with the majority’s reasoning. On a podcast he co-hosts, Mr Baude, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, panned the terse explanation, asking “How could this even be right?”
The shadow docket—officially, the “orders list”—has always been part of the Supreme Court’s work. Requests from condemned criminals to have their executions blocked or delayed routinely reach the justices this way. Of the 8,000 or so annual petitions to review a decision in a lower court, about 99% are denied. The justices also use the shadow docket to respond to litigants requesting extensions to file their briefs or to handle similarly quotidian matters. A few important orders are sprinkled through Supreme Court history: a (brief) execution reprieve for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg came on the orders list in 1953, as did a halt to the bombing in Cambodia in 1973.
Historically, though, the Supreme Court has adjudicated few matters of consequence in the shadows. That changed in 2017 when several policies of the Trump administration ran aground in lower courts. A litany of Mr Trump’s moves—from a ban on travel from Muslim countries and diversion of funds to pay for his border wall to a prohibition on trans soldiers and aggressive use of the federal death penalty—were blocked by federal judges, prompting the administration to beg the Supreme Court to intercede. According to Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, the Trump administration filed a staggering 41 emergency applications in its four years—compared with just eight during the 16-year period when George W. Bush and Barack Obama sat in the Oval Office. That is a 20-fold increase in presidential use of the shadow docket. And it paid off: of Mr Trump’s 41, the justices at least partially came through for him 28 times.
These results may not be surprising given the court’s increasingly conservative complexion. But outcomes aside, the spike in shadow-docket cases involving issues of national importance—including battles over election rules and public-health measures to fight covid-19—highlights a deficit of transparency and accountability. The court usually affirms or denies a request without a word of explanation, though sometimes a short opinion (or dissent) is attached. Individual justices decide whether to reveal their votes—they usually remain hidden. With only a week or so between application and decision, time for briefing is limited and the justices do not have the benefit of questioning the parties in an oral argument.
What is to be done? Mr Vladeck, who testified before a House subcommittee investigating the shadow docket in February, wants to see the court include “at least a brief explanation” whenever it makes a change to the status quo. Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, says a justification is particularly important when the Supreme Court reinstates a death sentence that has been blocked by a lower court. Mr Vladeck would also like the justices to own up to their votes by identifying themselves and, for important issues that do not require immediate resolution, hold fast-tracked oral arguments before rendering a judgment. The court’s pandemic-era pivot towards hearings by telephone may supply a handy way to do this.■",1
1697,"IN 1909 THE founder of General Motors (GM), William Crapo Durant, offered to buy Ford for $8m. Henry Ford spurned the advance, making way for one of the fiercest and most multifaceted rivalries in corporate history. Does Ford’s harnessing of mass production with the one-size-fits-all Model T in 1908 trump the marketing genius of GM’s Alfred Sloan, who promised a “car for every purse and purpose” in the 1920s? Which is Detroit’s finest V8 engine: Ford’s “flat head” or the “small block” from Chevrolet, GM’s main brand? Did the looks of the Ford Thunderbird outshine the Corvette in the 1950s? Did the Chevrolet Camaro outmuscle the Mustang a decade later?
Even as petrolheads continue to squabble over the history, a new contest is brewing between America’s two mightiest carmakers that may be the most momentous in a century. It is the race to electrify their fleets, and especially pickups, the biggest source of profits for both companies. As part of this campaign GM has said it will build four battery factories by 2025 with its partner, LG Chem, a South Korean battery-maker. And on September 27th Ford and its battery partner, SK Innovation, also of South Korea, announced an investment of $11bn in three battery factories and an assembly plant for electric F-Series pickups.

Ford reckons that 40% of its global sales will be electric by 2030 (the deadline President Joe Biden would like to set for half of all new cars in America to be battery-powered). GM wants all its vehicles to be emissions-free by 2035. The ultimate result of this competition will determine which of Detroit’s giants will have the upper hand in the market for electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving. It will also help shape the future of both motoring and carbon emissions in the country that invented the gas-guzzler and car culture.
After a slow start compared with European and Japanese rivals like Volkswagen and Nissan, the Detroit duo are revving up their EV plans. The new investment by Ford and SK Innovation, $7bn of which will come from the carmaker, is part of a pledge the company made in May to spend over $30bn on electrification by 2025, up from a previous commitment of $22bn. That put it ahead of GM’s target of $27bn by that date. But not for long: in June GM responded by raising its goal to $35bn.
The reason for this newfound ambition is the firms’ painful decline in their home market. America “defines both companies”, says Dan Levy of Credit Suisse, a bank. In 2020, 65% of Ford’s revenues and over 80% of GM’s, along with most of their profits, came courtesy of domestic buyers. But although America defines both of them, they no longer define America (see chart). Hubris, bred from decades of effortless success, ran up against smaller, cheaper and better vehicles made by foreign firms. Ford’s and GM’s combined market share of 30% is a shadow of the combined 50% they commanded 20 years ago, let alone the 70% in the 1970s.

GM was quicker to start getting out of the rut. Ironically, that is in part owing to Ford’s efforts to do so in the mid-2000s. In 2006 Bill Ford, chairman and Henry’s great-grandson, appointed Alan Mulally, an outsider from Boeing, a planemaker, to revive the firm. Mr Mulally’s plans included a $24bn credit line. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, this saved Ford from bankruptcy protection and a government bail-out that befell GM and Chrysler (the smallest of Detroit’s big three that is now part of Stellantis, a global carmaking group whose largest shareholder, Exor, part-owns The Economist’s parent company). But it also let Ford avoid the deep transformation into which GM had been forced.
Neither Mark Fields, a Ford insider who took over from Mr Mulally, nor Jim Hackett, an outsider who replaced him as CEO in 2017, managed to turn things round. New Fords underwhelmed and the firm made a series of missteps, such as the botched launch of the Explorer SUV in 2019. Profits dived between 2016 and 2019. If Mr Hackett indeed had deep thoughts about the future, the ostensible reason Mr Ford appointed him, he proved inept at enunciating them to investors. Critically, he failed to get his hands dirty running the day-to-day operations in the present, says Philippe Houchois of Jefferies, a bank.
By contrast, Mary Barra, who took the helm at GM in 2014, ran the firm with a laser focus on profits over market share. Slashing underperforming parts of the business, she took GM out of Russia and India, and sold Opel, its European operation, to PSA Group. Mr Levy of Credit Suisse says that, thanks to Ms Barra, “not much is left underperforming”. This in turn gave GM greater self-confidence in communicating its future direction to investors. Its share price has outperformed Ford’s by a country mile in the past ten years.
Ford’s new boss, Jim Farley, appointed just over a year ago, has brought fresh urgency. His credentials as a “car guy” are indisputable. He proudly displays his intricate model cars on Twitter. Only Carlos Tavares, boss of Stellantis, spends more time on the racetrack. Mr Farley’s love of speed and his attention to detail are evident in Ford’s electrification plans.
The company has stolen a march on GM with its current EV line up. GM says it will have 30 electric models by 2025, but the only car on the road now is the Chevy Bolt, a small hatchback in a market hungry for pickups and SUVs. Ford’s offerings look more compelling, desirable and closer to the firm’s areas of expertise. The battery-powered Mustang Mach-E has revived a dying brand. Whereas the electric Chevy Silverado may not hit the showrooms until 2024, Ford’s F-150 Lightning can already be pre-ordered and goes on sale next year. Mr Farley is also exploiting Ford’s strength in commercial vehicles by electrifying its famous Transit van. The company expects revenues from the commercial-vehicle unit to rise from $27bn in 2019 to $45bn by 2025. It has an undisclosed but sizeable stake in Rivian, a EV-trucks startup that is set for an IPO that could value it at $80bn (roughly equal to GM’s market capitalisation and half as much again as Ford’s).
GM is not asleep at the wheel, however. In January it created BrightDrop, a new division dedicated to electric delivery vehicles. And it retains an edge in basic technology, as well as in making batteries in-house, a sure route to cutting the costs of the priciest element of electric cars. Its Ultium batteries, with a wire-free system that cuts weight and costs, married to its new electric motors, could make for a car with a range of 450 miles (724km), nearly 50 more than the longest-range Tesla.
If the electric race is tight, the longer-distance one to autonomous driving is even harder to call. Both companies are tight-lipped about progress in their self-driving divisions. Cruise, of which GM is the majority owner, is widely seen as being ahead of Argo, jointly owned by Ford and Volkswagen. Cruise has landed the backing of SoftBank, a giant Japanese tech-investment group, and a funding round in April valued it at more than $30bn. But its robotaxis, now set to hit the road in 2023, are four years behind schedule. Despite a humbler valuation of around $7bn, Argo is already starting trials of its autonomous cars and is planning to go public this year. And so the age-old rivalry shows no signs of slowing. ■

1699,"THERE ARE many ways to describe pork-barrel politics in Brazil. They include tomá lá dá cá (give and take), troca de favores (trading favours), corporativismo (corporatism) and velha política (old politics). In 2018, on the campaign trail, Jair Bolsonaro used these and far ruder insults to disparage his fellow politicians, especially ones from the left-wing Workers’ Party (PT), which governed from 2003 to 2016 and was roiled by two big corruption scandals. As president, he vowed to advance his agenda without distributing cargos (jobs) or emendas (amendments: ie, pork).
The first sign he had given up on this “new politics” came in mid-2020, when he formed an alliance with a bloc of self-serving parties known as the centrão (big centre) in order to shield himself from impeachment petitions, of which there are now 117. Centrão support is never free. A recent investigation by Estado de S. Paulo, a newspaper, showed that last year Mr Bolsonaro’s government forked over 20bn reais ($3.9bn) through emendas do relator, or “chairman’s pork”, a reference to the chairman of the budget committee. At least 3bn reais were funneled through the development ministry to congressmen to fund public works and purchase farm equipment at inflated prices, sometimes through companies owned by relatives.

The scandal, which the press has dubbed tratoraço (roughly, “tractor-gate”), is the clearest proof yet of Mr Bolsonaro’s participation in pork-barrel politics. It is unfolding alongside an even bigger public-relations disaster: a parliamentary commission of inquiry (CPI) into the government’s handling of the pandemic. The two crises demonstrate how Mr Bolsonaro has become increasingly weak and how Congress, which is known for virus-like opportunism, has used his vulnerability to strengthen itself. “The more fragile the president, the higher the cost of support,” explains Sylvio Costa of Congresso em Foco, a watchdog site.

Brazil’s political system, known as “coalition presidentialism”, is a hybrid between the presidential model of the United States and European-style parliamentary government. The president directs policymaking and drafts the budget but cannot get much done without Congress, where his or her party rarely has a majority. Most of Brazil’s 30 or so political parties lack ideological platforms; they back presidents in exchange for patronage. This favours vote-winning projects like paving roads or painting schools, rather than long-term planning, says Élida Pinto, a professor of public finances at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), a university.
In 1994 six congressmen lost their posts as a result of a vote-buying scandal involving fake NGOs. In 2005 a centrão lawmaker admitted that the PT was funnelling 30,000 reais per month to congressmen in exchange for legislative support. (He was kicked out of Congress but is now an ally of Mr Bolsonaro.) In 2014 prosecutors launched a probe called Lava Jato (“Car Wash”) which revealed a vast kickback scheme among construction firms, political parties and the state oil firm.
In response to protests, Congress passed a series of constitutional amendments aimed at reducing corruption while keeping congressmen sweet. Most emendas became in effect an automatic allowance (not at the president’s discretion) for lawmakers to spend in their constituencies. They had to follow new rules, such as providing receipts. But such restrictions made it harder for presidents to cobble together a coalition. When Dilma Rousseff, a PT president, was impeached in 2016, it was technically because she had hidden the size of Brazil’s budget deficit; but also because she struggled to manage an increasingly unruly Congress. She expanded her cabinet to 39 ministries in order to dole out patronage, but a recession in 2014-16 limited her scope.
Mr Bolsonaro is experiencing something similar. Brazil has had one of the worst covid-19 outbreaks in the world, with an official death count of more than 450,000. His strategy of downplaying the pandemic seemed to work last year, when a third of Brazilians received emergency aid. But this year a second wave has coincided with rising inflation, slow vaccination and a reduction in handouts. Mr Bolsonaro’s approval rating has fallen from 40% to below 30%. The speaker of the lower house, Arthur Lira, the only person who can open impeachment proceedings, warned of “bitter political remedies”.
But impeachment is unlikely, partly because Mr Bolsonaro in effect reinvented chairman’s pork at the end of 2019. Most of the new allowances went to lawmakers who voted for Mr Lira and the centrão’s pick to head the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, in leadership elections in February. Documents on government sites account for only around 1bn of the 3bn reais spent by the development ministry. The budget chairman, Domingos Neto, sent 110m reais to a city of 59,000 people of which his mother is the mayor. The ministry agreed to pay 500,000 reais apiece for tractors listed as costing 200,000. It insists that there were no irregularities.
A bigger threat to Mr Bolsonaro’s popularity is the CPI, which began hearing testimony in the Senate this month. Its daily sessions are broadcast live on TV, creating a macabre oral history of Brazil’s pandemic disaster. Two former health ministers said that the government’s initial strategy rested on herd immunity and hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug promoted by Donald Trump. A Pfizer executive said that the government ignored six offers to sell Brazil vaccines. The health minister at the time, Eduardo Pazuello, a general who was also in charge when the city of Manaus ran out of oxygen, tried to skip testifying by saying he might have covid-19 himself.
Mr Bolsonaro “is becoming a prisoner of his unpopularity”, says Alessandro Molon, the leader of the opposition in the lower house. The latest polls show the president’s support falling in nearly every constituency, including among his strongest backers, such as evangelical Christians. His top rival in the 2022 election is likely to be Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former PT president whose popularity has recently increased. One poll suggests that if a runoff election were held tomorrow, 55% would pick him against just 32% for Mr Bolsonaro (the rest said neither). When Brazilians see Europeans and Americans getting vaccinated, they realise “our president is a caricature,” says Ciro Gomes, a former governor who also plans to run.
Mr Bolsonaro could recover before next year’s election. Vaccination is at last progressing and the economy is doing better than feared. The economy minister, Paulo Guedes, has urged Congress to reform taxes and the public sector. This would free up money for vote-winning programmes, he argues. But lawmakers want handouts too. “The centrão is not loyal,” warns Rebeca Lucena of BMJ, a consultancy. “If the ship is sinking, it will jump to another.” ■",1
1700,"AN OFFICE IS meant to bring people together. Instead, it has become a source of division. For some, the post-pandemic return to the workplace is an opportunity to re-establish boundaries between home and job, and to see colleagues in the flesh. For others it represents nothing but pointless travelling and heightened health risks. Many ingredients determine these preferences. But one stands out: seniority.
Slack, a messaging firm, conducts regular surveys of global knowledge workers on the future of work. Its latest poll, released in October, found that executives are far keener to get back to the office than other employees. Of those higher-ups who were working remotely, 75% wanted to be in the office three days a week or more; only 34% of non-executives felt the same way.

The divide has played out publicly at some companies. Earlier this year, employees at Apple wrote an open letter to Tim Cook, the firm’s chief executive, objecting to the assumption that they were thirsting to get back to their desks: “It feels like there is a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote/location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple’s employees.” Why are bigwigs so much keener on the office?
Three explanations come to mind: the cynical, the kind and the subconscious. The cynical one is that executives like the status that the office confers. They sit in nicer rooms on higher floors with plusher carpets. Access to them is guarded, politely but ferociously. When they walk the floors, it is an event. When they sit in meeting rooms, they get the best chairs. On Zoom the signals of status are weaker. No one gets a bigger tile. Their biggest privilege is not muting themselves, which isn't quite the same power rush as using the executive dining room.

The kind explanation is that executives believe that in-person interactions are better for the institutions they lead. Working from home “doesn’t work for people who want to hustle, doesn’t work for culture, doesn’t work for idea generation,"" was the verdict of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, earlier this year. Ken Griffin, the boss of Citadel, a hedge fund, has warned young people not to work from home: “It’s incredibly difficult to have the managerial experiences and interpersonal experiences that you need to have to take your career forward in a work-remotely environment.”
These concerns have substance. Virtual work risks entrenching silos: people are more likely to spend time with colleagues they already know. Corporate culture can be easier to absorb in three dimensions. Deep relationships are harder to form with a laggy internet connection. A study from 2010 found that physical proximity between co-authors was a good predictor of the impact of scientific papers: the greater the distance between them, the less likely they were to be cited. Even evangelists for remote work make time for physical gatherings. ""Digital first does not mean never in person,"" says Brian Elliott, who runs Slack's research into the future of work.
But the advantages of the office can also be exaggerated. The Allen curve, which shows how frequency of communication goes down the farther away colleagues sit from each other, was formulated in the 1970s but still rings true today. Every workplace has corners that people never visit; no gulf is greater than that between floors. And the disadvantages of remote working can be overcome with a bit of thought. Research by a trio of professors at Harvard Business School found that lockdown-era interns who got to spend time with senior managers at a ""virtual watercooler"" were much likelier to receive full-time job offers than those who did not.

If physical workspaces have drawbacks, and remote working can be improved upon, why are executives clear in their preferences? The subconscious supplies a third explanation. As Gianpiero Petriglieri of INSEAD, a French business school, observes: “people advising youngsters to go into the office are those who made their way in that environment.” Executives who have achieved success by working in an office are the least likely to question its efficacy.
That is a problem, especially since a majority of executives say that they have designed return-to-work policies with scant input from employees. A hybrid future beckons, in which workers divide their time between home and office. Managers need to improve both environments, not assume that one is obviously superior to the other.

1701,"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has come up with a new offering that allows investors to bet on special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), its latest attempt to capitalize on the dealmaking trend, people familiar with the matter said.
The product is structured as a two-year bond that pays interest and gives investors exposure to SPACs without owning them, the sources said. It could appeal to institutional investors who want regular income through a portfolio of many SPACs, the sources added.
One of the sources, however, said Goldman Sachs has so far only arranged a handful of these products, referred to as ""SPAC-linked structured notes.""
Goldman does not charge a management fee for the offering. The bank makes money by providing investors financing to participate in the product and by keeping some of the returns on the SPAC stocks for itself, depending on how well they perform, the sources said.
Investors also receive a payout based on the SPAC stocks' performance at the end of the two years, the sources said. If they are willing to take on more risk to juice their returns, they can also borrow from Goldman to add leverage to the offering, but have to pay the bank back for any losses, the sources said.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the details of the product.
The boom in the SPAC market, whose size has reached $137.4 billion last month from $13.6 billion two years ago, has already been a boon for Goldman Sachs' investment banking business. The bank said in April that financing SPAC deals – though a small part of its overall business – helped boost revenue and that advising SPACs on acquisitions would be a ""tailwind"" for earnings in the future.
The new SPAC product is being offered by a desk in Goldman Sachs' global markets division, which is the sales and trading arm of the bank, rather than investment banking, the sources said.
Investors are allowed to bet on the shares of SPACs where Goldman Sachs bankers had a deal role, the sources added. SPACs sponsored by Goldman Sachs are excluded.
Investors have some protection against losses. SPAC stocks can be redeemed for their initial public offering value when shareholders vote on their mergers, and investors can provide instructions to Goldman Sachs to carry out such redemptions, according to the sources.
'DOCTOR SELLING DONUTS'
Mike Stegemoller, a banking and finance professor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas who has studied SPACs, said that Goldman Sachs' role as both adviser and financier of SPAC deals and seller of this new product poses a conflict, even if different parts of the bank are involved.
This is because SPACs cannot complete their mergers with companies if too many investors redeem their shares, bleeding them dry on cash they need to pay for their deal. By offering redemptions of SPAC shares as a safety net for its investor clients, Goldman Sachs is relying on a practice that is a thorn in the side of some of its investment banking clients – SPACs and the companies that do deals with them.
""It's like a doctor selling donuts in the office,"" Stegemoller said.
To be sure, many investors already exercise their right to redeem their SPAC shares, and Goldman Sachs' new product will not change that. Reuters could not establish whether Goldman Sachs has informed its SPAC clients about the new product and what their reaction would be.
Goldman declined to comment on the conflict.
Goldman Sachs' new product has already irked some hedge fund managers who hoped they would not be competing for investors with a top Wall Street bank.
""If you're an investment bank underwriting a SPAC IPO, and advising on a business combination, it can be perceived as effectively working against clients and potential clients if you are soliciting investors to redeem SPACs,"" said Julian Klymochko, founder and CEO at Accelerate Financial Technologies Inc, which manages an exchange traded fund that invests in SPACs.",0
1702,"ON THE MORNING after the polls closed last week, America withdrew from the Paris agreement on climate change. The effects will be short-lived. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to rejoin the pact as soon as he enters the White House.
Donald Trump’s defeat has evoked strong reactions around the world. The main one “is relief”, says Andreas Nick, a German MP. But the world will not return to how it was in 2016, and Mr Biden will not please everyone.

Consider climate change. Most countries are eager to welcome America back into the club of those that care about it. In the past eight weeks, China, Japan and South Korea have vowed to reduce net emissions to zero by mid-century or thereabouts. Four of the five largest economies have now committed themselves to emissions cuts that are in line with limiting global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels or less (see chart 1).

Mr Biden has said he intends to adopt a target of net-zero emissions by 2050, which modellers say will shave 0.1°C off their temperature projections for the end of the century. To rejoin the Paris deal, he will need formally to submit this goal alongside an updated national pledge to slash emissions. Most observers believe a 45-50% decrease from 2005 levels by 2030 would be tough but feasible, fair and commensurate with what Europe is doing.
Mr Biden can re-enter the Paris deal without congressional approval, but he will need some degree of buy-in from both sides of the aisle to make his pledges credible. Integrating green infrastructure, energy, and research and development into any new government stimulus would help. American public opinion is broadly favourable. In exit polls two-thirds of voters said that climate change was a serious problem. Whether they will accept higher energy prices to fix it remains to be seen.
Outsiders are watching to see if Mr Biden structures his team in a way that makes it clear that he wants to integrate climate action across his foreign and domestic policy. The importance of having America back on the climate train is hard to overstate. Over the past four years, voters around the world have noticed not only warmer temperatures, but increasing numbers of floods, droughts and forest fires. Europe is pushing through an ambitious green deal at home and working closely with China, the world’s largest emitter. If Mr Biden can formalise America’s emissions targets for 2030 and 2050 before the COP26 UN climate summit next year, that will help convince other governments that the country intends to pull its weight. That should give others—including China—the guts to decarbonise faster.
However, not all governments will welcome a carbon warrior in the White House. Oil- and coal-producers are wary. So is Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, not least because Mr Biden has threatened “economic consequences” if Brazil continues to tear down the Amazon rainforest. Mr Bolsonaro, who thinks foreign eco-scolds have imperialist designs on Brazilian territory, tweeted “OUR SOVEREIGNTY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE” and spoke vaguely of needing “gunpowder” to defend it. Brazil’s carbon emissions rose by a whopping 9.6% in 2019, mainly due to deforestation.
Another area where the world expects more collaboration is health. Mr Trump announced in July that America was pulling out of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the main global body for fighting pandemics (among other things), grumbling that it was beholden to China. Mr Biden says he will reverse this rash decision on the first day of his presidency.
By executive order, he can stop the clock on the withdrawal process, which was to be completed by July 2021. It is unclear how big the disruption will be. America is the WHO’s biggest donor: in 2019 it provided around 15% of its budget. With Mr Biden in charge, America is also expected to join a global coalition funding the development of covid-19 tests, drugs and vaccines and their distribution to poorer countries. International co-operation is likely to work better than “America First”. The pandemic “won’t be over in the US if it’s not over in Mexico,” notes a Mexican official.
Governments everywhere are asking how Mr Biden will affect their national interest. China’s state media have given him a cautious welcome. Global Times, a tabloid, even called him an “old friend”. China’s regime may have relished the decline of American soft power under Mr Trump, but it also chafed at the capriciousness of his China policy and the hawkishness of his officials. In its view, the Trump administration is to blame for pushback in much of the West against Chinese influence.
China does not expect a Biden presidency to reduce Western anxiety. But it hopes for more predictability. Under Mr Trump, China feared a sudden policy shift towards Taiwan that might have brought the two countries closer to war. It hopes that Mr Biden will be more careful.
China would also like a less choppy trade relationship. It doubts that Mr Biden will ramp up tariffs in a futile effort to make bilateral imports equal to exports, as Mr Trump did. It hopes that he will cut some of those tariffs. It does not expect any change in America’s attitude towards Chinese involvement in building 5G networks, or its military build-up in the South China Sea.
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was quick to fire congratulatory messages both to Mr Biden and to his running-mate. Kamala Harris inspires “immense pride” not just among her chittis (aunties) but among all Indian-Americans, Mr Modi gushed. Indian pundits speculate that he is keen not to be punished for having bet heavily on Mr Trump, his fellow populist.
He probably won’t be. Whoever is in charge, bilateral ties have warmed in recent decades. “The US cannot create an effective balance of power against China without India,” notes Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank. Mr Biden’s campaign website took India to task for its backsliding on democracy and human rights. India’s unspoken retort, in the words of Sadanand Dhume of the American Enterprise Institute, another think-tank, is “Let us do whatever we like, because we are with you on China.”
When it comes to asserting hard power, America’s friends in Asia want Mr Biden to be closer to Mr Trump than to Barack Obama. Mr Obama drew red lines in the South China Sea, but then did little when China crossed them. The Trump administration, by contrast, more vociferously rejected China’s claims in the sea and upped the American naval presence. It reaffirmed America’s defence commitment to Japanese islands harassed by China. And it sold arms to Taiwan. Bilahari Kausikan, formerly Singapore’s top diplomat, says that when Mr Trump told President Xi Jinping of China, his guest at Mar-a-Lago in 2017, that he had just bombed Syria over its use of chemical weapons, he did much to restore the credibility in Asia of American power.
Say it ain’t so Joe
Some Asians worry that Mr Biden might make security concessions to China in pursuit of other goals, such as co-operation on climate change. Where Mr Obama “put emphasis on engagement first, it’s time to put deterrence first,” says Miyake Kunihiko of the Canon Institute for Global Studies, a think-tank in Tokyo. “They shouldn’t leave China with any illusions it would be able to attack Taiwan,” says Sasae Kenichiro, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States. Still, many would like to see Mr Biden approach China in closer co-ordination with allies, and with less blind rage. For all that Japanese policymakers wish to constrain their huge neighbour, they are, given China’s proximity and the two countries’ enmeshed economic ties, reluctant to confront it. They dread the kind of open break with China that the Trump administration has seemed bent on.

Japan’s new prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, surely hopes for a more conventional relationship with his country’s main ally. “It’s extremely important for us to have professional consultations with the United States, and with a head of government who is knowledgeable about foreign policy,” says Tanaka Hitoshi, a former deputy foreign minister.
South Koreans would agree. Mr Trump tore up a trade deal and constantly threatened to withdraw American troops from Korean soil if Seoul did not pay more for their presence. Mr Biden, in an op-ed for South Korea’s national news agency, called such threats “reckless” and vowed to strengthen the alliance. In a poll before the election, almost two-thirds of South Koreans said they wanted Mr Biden to win.
Likewise, in South-East Asia, Mr Trump’s calls for an ideological crusade against “Communist China”, to be fought on every front, showed an administration out of touch with diplomatic realities, argues Dino Patti Djalal, an Indonesian former ambassador to America, in the Diplomat, a magazine. Yes, China causes headaches in South-East Asia. But it has posed no ideological threat for decades. For now, he says, the region’s priority is to overcome the pandemic (with China’s help) and chart an economic recovery (in which China will be the motor of growth). The American presence is welcome, but having to take sides is not—which is why Indonesia recently refused to offer a home to American spy planes.
As for Mr Biden, Asians are counting on a return of what Kevin Rudd, an Australian former prime minister, calls “strategic and economic ballast” to America’s relationship with Asia, and “a more nuanced diplomacy”. Is that likely? Mr Rudd thinks so. Mr Biden is pulling together a team of Asia experts for whom “the granularity of the Indo-Pacific is like second nature”.
During the Trump years the European Union (EU) unexpectedly found itself the guardian of multilateralism. After Mr Biden’s victory, Europeans hope this burden will be shared. Besides rejoining the Paris agreement, they would like America to stop undermining the World Trade Organisation and to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Mr Biden has suggested he will do so.
In grand strategic terms, the EU’s main aim is to avoid being dragged into a hegemonic struggle between America and China. It wants to be slightly firmer and less credulous with China, but may not support Mr Biden if he pursues confrontation.
Mr Biden will not undermine NATO as his predecessor did. And he will insist that NATO allies, two-thirds of whom fail to spend 2% of GDP on defence, invest more in their own armed forces. Germany hopes that this message will no longer be accompanied by threats to slap tariffs on German cars, and that disputes between allies will be settled quietly, rather than over Twitter.
France hopes for a fresh American push to resolve regional conflicts that affect European security, from Turkish expansionism in the eastern Mediterranean to instability in Lebanon and Libya. Germany and France will welcome a return of American civility and seriousness, and an end to Mr Trump’s efforts to divide Europe.
Yet there is also a clear-eyed recognition in European capitals that, even under Mr Obama, Europe had begun to slip out of American sight. “The Americans are obviously indispensable,” says a French presidential source, “but the world has changed.” France now wants Europe to do more for itself, and differently. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, will need to persuade the Biden team that his ambitions to build up “strategic autonomy” in Europe are not aimed at sidelining NATO.
Not your average Joe
Britain hopes to secure a trade deal with America (to offset the damage done by Brexit) and to punch above its weight globally via its “special relationship” with the superpower. However, Mr Biden, who has Irish ancestry, has hinted that Britain can forget about a trade deal if it reimposes a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He has described Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, as “the physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump”, which is not meant as a compliment. That Mr Johnson was the second world leader to speak to Mr Biden after his victory will allay some fears, but Britain will probably lose its role as the bridge between the United States and Europe.
In the Middle East reviving the Iran nuclear deal will not be easy. Most American Republicans and some Democrats revile it. Mr Biden may lift some sanctions and then try to negotiate a follow-up agreement. Israel and the Gulf states will want it to go much further than the original 2015 version—to impose limits on Iran’s ballistic-missile programme and perhaps its support for militant groups. Iran is unlikely to agree to such terms, though, in which case America’s Middle Eastern partners will urge Mr Biden to maintain the sanctions.
Mr Trump had a notable success in persuading Arab states to recognise Israel. Mr Biden will be under pressure to continue the thaw. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was close to Mr Trump, and will have to mend ties with Mr Biden. However, his country retains strong support in America. The Palestinians hope to reverse some of Mr Trump’s more antagonistic moves, such as closing their diplomatic mission in Washington and cutting aid. They are unlikely to convince Mr Biden to move America’s embassy in Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv. Most countries want Mr Biden to slow the drawdown of American troops from Afghanistan, where fighting between the government and the Taliban is intensifying, and to keep a foothold in Iraq, where Islamic State is active (see chart 3).

For the world’s populists and nationalists Mr Trump’s presence in the White House was evidence that theirs was the ideology of the future. “The value Bolsonaro derived from Trump was the narrative,” says Oliver Stuenkel of the Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university in São Paulo. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s left-wing populist president, has so far refused to congratulate Mr Biden.
Viktor Orban, Hungary’s illiberal prime minister, supported Mr Trump on the ground that Mr Biden’s party stood for “moral imperialism”. Poland’s rulers did so for similar reasons. Janez Jansa, prime minister of Melania Trump’s native Slovenia, insisted for days that Mr Trump had won and retweeted fake news to that effect.
Back to life, back to reality
These countries now face a president who sees upholding the rule of law as a foreign-policy priority. As vice-president, Mr Biden repeatedly toured eastern Europe explaining that America saw corruption as a tool of Russian influence, and fighting it as crucial to NATO’s security. Daria Kaleniuk of AntAC, an anti-graft group in Kyiv, hopes Mr Biden will be “much stronger and more involved”.

Many autocratic leaders will miss Mr Trump’s tendency to overlook their sins. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, will find his regular WhatsApp chats with Jared Kushner less useful. Vladimir Putin expects frostier relations. Hence, perhaps, the histrionics of Dmitry Kiselev, his propagandist-in-chief. “For a long time, they have been trying to teach us [democracy],” he said. “But now the teacher has staged a debauchery, smashed the windows and shit his pants.”
Many poor countries hope that Mr Biden will notice them. Governments in Africa want support to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic. Central America wants aid to curb violence and give people an alternative to emigration. Developing countries everywhere would like less bluster about a new cold war with China and more American trade and investment.
Human-rights groups would like a vocal ally in the White House, or even a long-winded one. “We will clearly see a more serious voice on democracy and human rights in Africa,” says Judd Devermont of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank. “The Trump administration’s absence was most deafening on politics and governance.”
Finally, the world expects America to welcome more foreign talent. Mr Biden vows to repeal Mr Trump’s toughest immigration curbs, stop building the wall, stop putting children in cages and offer a path to citizenship for people living in America illegally. Countries that send lots of emigrants, such as India, are pleased.
So are the migrants themselves. Arvin Kakekhani, an Iranian researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, designs catalysts to turn water and carbon dioxide into clean fuels. After Mr Trump’s “Muslim ban” he felt “so insecure”, not knowing whether he would be able to stay in the country, he recalls. He has had to live apart from his Iranian wife for two years. “My dream is to use expertise to tackle the climate crisis,” he says, adding that with Mr Biden’s victory, he is “now much more motivated to stay” and do it in America. ■

1703,"SUDAN’S PATH to democracy has always been strewn with landmines. The country became independent in 1956. That year, and again in 1964 and 1986, there were brief attempts at democratic rule. All were scotched by men with guns. In 2019, after 30 years of genocidal military dictatorship under Omar al-Bashir, hope flowered once more. Peaceful protests toppled the tyrant. Many Sudanese longed for the army to retire to barracks.
The army had other ideas. In April 2019 it seized power again. Weeks later, security forces gunned down protesters, killing more than 100 and tossing their bodies into the Nile. Demonstrators kept coming out into the streets, however, braving bullets and beatings. To end the crisis, mediators pressed the protest leaders to let the army stay in charge for almost two years in exchange for a promise that it would hand power to civilians and allow elections in 2022. On October 25th, as the handover approached, officers staged another coup. Perhaps they were nervous of what future courts might say about their role in Sudan’s civil wars. Perhaps they just like being in charge. Either way, Sudan is in trouble.

The power-sharing deal, though squalid, was not always doomed to fail. It gave Sudan’s civilian politicians two years to build trust with the army by, say, offering amnesty for all but the most serious war crimes in exchange for full disclosure about them (an approach that worked in South Africa after apartheid). This opportunity was squandered.
Western donors could have smoothed Sudan’s transition with aid more quickly. Instead the economy kept contracting, fuelling a sense of crisis that the army exploited. Days before the coup, Western diplomats warned the generals to back off. That they did not shows how lightly they now take Western threats.
African coups are making a comeback. The past year has seen successful ones in Chad, Guinea and Mali (its second in less than a year), and failed ones in Madagascar and the Central African Republic. It is as bad as the early decades of independence, when Africa endured roughly four coups a year. The “no-coups policy” of the African Union (AU), which seemed more or less to work after it was adopted in 2000, now counts for little.
Two trends are making putsches more likely. One is the spread of jihadism. In 2012, when soldiers seized power in Mali, the AU swiftly suspended it. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a regional bloc, imposed sanctions and America halted aid. But then jihadists overran the north of the country. Now the AU and ECOWAS appear to have an unofficial policy of publicly ticking the generals off but leaving them in place rather than risking instability. Unfortunately, unaccountable governments tend to govern badly, feeding the very grievances upon which jihadism thrives. By putting short-term stability before democracy, you often end up enjoying neither.
A second trend is the jockeying for influence in Africa by foreign powers. China has won friends with its policy of “non-interference”. Russia is gaining clout by hiring out mercenaries to guard presidents and to train their armies. If Western countries condemn a coup or a rigged election or threaten sanctions, they know that they will lose influence even as Chinese and Russian ambassadors race to the presidential palace with offers of support, aid and loans.
Balancing values and realpolitik is hard, but two principles can help. The first is to draw red lines and stick to them, making it clear that genocide, war crimes and gross abuses of human rights are intolerable and will be met with sanctions, even if that leads to a break in relations.
The second is to remember that Africans themselves, by a wide margin, want more democracy than they have now. The West should respect that desire. So should the neighbours of countries where putsches occur. If coup leaders are tolerated, there will be more coups. ■",1
1704,"FOR THE past six months Italians have been floating from triumph to triumph. It began in May when an Italian band, Maneskin, won the Eurovision song contest. In July their men’s football team became Europe’s champions and in August, at the Olympics, their male sprinters astonished the sporting world, claiming gold in the 100 metres and 4 x 100 metres relay. In October an Italian scientist, Giorgio Parisi, shared the Nobel prize for physics.
Italy has meanwhile had what is, for it, the novel experience of being governed by an internationally respected prime minister, Mario Draghi, with a huge parliamentary majority that allows him to turn his projects swiftly into law. Supported by an effective vaccination campaign, the economy is recovering strongly. On October 28th Mr Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, forecast economic growth this year of “probably well over 6%”, though few expect Italy’s GDP to regain its pre-pandemic level until 2022, well behind America and Britain, among others. But Standard  Poor’s, a rating agency, has revised its outlook for Italian debt from stable to positive, and Italians can look forward to a period in which their government will be in a position—under an obligation, indeed—to spend liberally for the first time since the days of the post-war, American-funded Marshall Plan.

Italy stands to be the biggest beneficiary in absolute terms of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery project. From the core Recovery and Resilience Facility alone, it is due to receive €191.5bn in grants and loans. Such an influx of cash cannot help but have an impact on an economy that, even before covid-19, had barely grown this century: in real terms, Italy’s GDP in 2019 was only 4% above its level in 2000, thanks to a combination of slow growth in even the best years and big declines in the bad ones. Real GDP per person was 1% lower over the period, compared with increases of 16% in France and 24% in Germany. Oxford Economics estimates that over the next three to four years the EU’s recovery project will add on average a helpful annual 0.5 percentage points to Italian GDP growth.

Enzo Moavero, a professor at LUISS university in Rome who has served as a non-party minister in three recent governments, warns that the real challenge for Mr Draghi will be to deliver sustainable growth at or preferably above the European average. This, he reckons, will require “effective reforms that lead to thoroughgoing structural change.”
The EU’s recovery project is designed to address that issue. It makes the allocation of funds contingent on specific reforms and investments aimed at improving the growth prospects of member states. Italy has so far been given an initial €25bn with no strings attached. But it will have to satisfy a daunting 51 requirements by the end of the year to qualify for the next tranche. And it could struggle to meet the target. A report to the cabinet on September 23rd revealed that at that point only 13 of the 51 objectives had been reached.
Italy’s reform programme is not the problem; that is ahead of schedule. In May a package was approved that simplified a wide range of bureaucratic procedures. And a shake-up of the criminal-justice system is about to be implemented. A further reform, focusing on civil justice, is in the pipeline. Officials say that legislation to promote competition is also coming soon.
The problem is with investment. The outstanding foot-draggers appear to be the ministry of tourism, which at the time of the report had yet to implement any of the six investments for which it is responsible; and the department for ecological transition, which had implemented only one.
Looking beyond the end of this year, two doubts arise. The first concerns the fate of legislation after it is handed out for implementation at the sub-national level. “In Italy, the intention of policies is all too often lost in translation,” says Paolo Graziano, who teaches political science at the University of Padua. There is a shortage of the necessary project-management skills among officials charged with implementing complex programmes—a shortcoming the Draghi government says it has begun to address. But another reason, says Fabrizio Tassinari of the European University Institute in Florence, is that “secondary legislation becomes hostage to vested interests, from local authorities to trade unions.”
A further doubt centres on Mr Draghi himself. He is known to want the presidency, which becomes vacant in February, and if he were chosen he would have to resign as prime minister. Even if he does not become head of state, he is unlikely to remain in government after a general election that has to be held by the spring of 2023, and may well come sooner.
On October 18th mayoral candidates from the Democratic Party (PD) were elected in Rome and Turin, completing a clean sweep of Italy’s biggest cities by the centre-left. But the PD and its allies are weaker in the provinces. Polls continue to suggest that Italy’s next government will be a coalition dominated by two parties that have long been critical of the European Commission: the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, which has links to neo-fascism, and the hard-right Northern League.

Those close to Mr Draghi argue that his departure need not lead to a radical break. His government has established bureaucratic mechanisms for steering and controlling the flow of the recovery money that will, with luck, outlive it. And future governments will be just as constrained by the deadlines the commission imposes and loth to forfeit the flow of cash from Brussels by failing to meet them.
Perhaps. But the League, which is a part of the coalition underpinning Mr Draghi, and the FdI, which is not, are both wedded to policies and interests that are at odds with the reforming thrust of the recovery plan. The League has already succeeded in parrying it in one important area. A significant weakness of the Italian economy is that, while taxes on labour are too high, those on property are too low. Mr Draghi’s government moved to adjust the balance by changing the criteria used in the land registry in a way that would have boosted the revenue from property. But he ran into determined opposition from the League’s leader, Matteo Salvini. As a result, the changes will not now come into effect until 2026; and even then they will not be used to calculate tax liability.
“I am more positive now than I was a year ago,” says Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics. “But I still consider a permanent improvement in Italy’s economic prospects to be an upside scenario rather than a base case.” ■

1705,"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub
IN THE SIMULTANEOUSLY global, parochial and precise view of the scientists of the Global Carbon Project (GCP), it was April 7th which marked peak lockdown. The parts of the world where there was some sort of confinement order in place on that day would normally have accounted for 89% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions, the highest such percentage of the whole pandemic: the day before, less of America was locked down; the day after, more of China had gone back to work. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted on that peak day was, the GCP calculates, 17% lower than 2019’s daily average.
That is a huge difference: more than 11m tonnes of carbon dioxide. It is also a small one. For years, environmentalists have been calling on people to change their lifestyles in order to protect the planet. In the face of covid-19, governments have made some of their strictures official policy. The world now knows what can be achieved by closing a vast number of shops, as well as offices and factories, and stopping a great many people from travelling: a reduction in emissions which, though striking, is not enough to fundamentally change things, gained at an enormous price in terms of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

The measures governments have taken against covid-19 are entirely unsuited to a campaign against climate change that has to last for decades, rather than days. But the financial muscle brought to bear and the willingness to use the full force of the state is nevertheless suggestive. Climate-minded academics, public intellectuals and think-tankers have worked themselves into a lather over the benefits which action on such a scale could provide if effects on climate were actually part of the remit.
As Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental think-tank, points out, government decisions guide about 70% of the world’s spending on energy. “In a very short period of time,” he says, “governments will make enormously consequential decisions.” Total stimulus spending will be in the trillions. If a decent fraction of that is earmarked for climate action, it could be world changing.
This idea is not new. Similar pleas were heard—from some of the same people—a decade ago, when policymakers were trying to get the world out of the slump brought on by the financial crisis of 2007-09. Roughly an eighth of the stimulus money disbursed by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)—some $90bn—went into clean-energy loans and investments.
This greenery is remembered in political circles mainly because the first loan issued under the scheme—for a meaty $535m—went to Solyndra, a company devoted to cylindrical solar cells which went bust soon afterwards. The overwhelming majority of its loans, though, were repaid. One of them helped to finance Tesla’s first car factory.
Defenders of those clean-energy investments argue that they drew in $150bn of private and non-federal investment in clean energy—2009 and 2012 proved to be bumper years in America’s wind-energy sector—and paved the way for great progress over the subsequent decade. They did not, though, have any prompt appreciable effect on the global emissions trajectory. That was dominated by China’s post-crisis stimulus, which relied on ramping up coal-fired power stations. If American emissions did not rise as fast as they might have, it had more to do with cheap natural gas from the fracking boom providing a profitable alternative to coal-fired electricity than to any effects of ARRA.
Whatever ARRA’s role in the matter, though, renewables did start to have an appreciable effect in later years. They helped global emissions plateau in 2014-16, and again in 2018-19, even as the economy expanded. Renewables are now often cheaper than fossil fuels in large parts of the world. This is one of the reasons why today’s calls for a green stimulus are not carbon copies of those made ten years ago. They have less stress on renewable-energy R and fewer calls for demonstration projects. There is more emphasis on deploying technologies for types of decarbonisation not easily achieved with electricity, and on energy-storage systems and greatly improved electric grids that will open the way to much needed further expansion of renewables.
In America, the precise details of what is on the stimulus menu seem immaterial; President Donald Trump’s administration is much more interested in helping coal and oil companies than it is the renewable sector. That said, a block of Republican senators from states with significant clean-energy industries—including wind farms of the sort that blossomed after the financial crisis—has convinced the Treasury to consider extending tax-incentive schemes for renewable developments which have been stalled by the response to the epidemic.
The fact that renewables now have lobbying power is one demonstration that things are different this time. Another is that politics have changed, too. The Paris agreement of 2015 required its signatories to develop plans for emissions reduction, and to stand ready to increase their ambition at another big UN summit, co-hosted by Britain and Italy, which was originally planned for this year but has now been deferred to 2021. Polling suggests that citizens would be happy to see them take that commitment seriously. In April Ipsos MORI asked people from 14 countries whether they thought climate change was as serious a threat as covid-19. The greatest assent was in China, where 87% agreed that it was; but even in America, where the assent was lowest, 59% agreed. Nearly two-thirds of respondents, including 57% of Americans, went on to say that it was important that government actions aimed at economic recovery prioritise action on climate change.
Gizza job
Green boosters have always been keen to claim that strong climate policies have the added advantage of producing copious jobs; the Obama administration credited clean-energy investments under ARRA with supporting 900,000 job-years of employment. In recent years of low unemployment such claims have come to seem somewhat beside the point. With joblessness now having bounced back above Great Depression levels in many places, green jobs have again become a selling point.
Some see mass unemployment not just as a symptom to assuage, but as a unique opportunity to get things done which, if everyone had a job, would be much harder. Such ideas fit with the growing need for large-scale infrastructure that gets the most out of private investments. With renewable energy growing fast, getting it to the places where it can do the most to edge out fossil fuels—for example, the batteries of electric vehicles—is an obvious next step. The British government is one of those considering rolling out a huge network of car-charging facilities.
Many economists might prefer to see governments simply provide incentives for endeavours they think worthwhile, leaving industry to meet those goals with whatever number of workers seems most efficient, rather than how many the government wants off the dole. This is particularly true given that much covid-related unemployment has fallen on the service sector; the jobs that need doing and the people who need jobs might be a poor fit.
Against that needs to be considered the problem of the “90% economy”. Some service-sector jobs will come back quite slowly, if at all. If governments incentivise, say, home insulation and offer training and certification, all sorts of local companies might provide the actual service, and they would be quite labour intensive.
In Pakistan the unemployed are being released from lockdown to work on a tree-planting programme that predates the crisis. The climate impact may not be that high; but refugees from service sectors around the world might rather enjoy similar opportunities, at least for a while. And they would not need all that much training. As Cameron Hepburn of the University of Oxford points out, you can go from pulling pints to planting pines pretty quickly. ■",1
1706,"BRITAIN WAS one of the first countries to light its streets at night. In 1782 Karl Philipp Moritz, a German essayist, was astounded by the “festive illumination” of London; a visiting German prince thought the lamps had been lit for his benefit. But Britain has also been ambivalent about providing light. Whereas streetlamps in Paris expressed state power (hence revolutionaries hanging their enemies from them), street lighting in Britain was often the responsibility of households and businesses. Even today, local authorities are not legally required to light the streets.
Outside big cities, they are doing so less. Over the past decade councils have replaced sodium-vapour lamps with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which use less energy and can cast light precisely on the pavement. They seldom run on full power. Since 2009 Hampshire has gone from dimming its lights by 25% in the middle of the night, to dimming them by 65%, to switching them off in residential areas. North Yorkshire is beginning to permit residential developments without streetlights.

For some, the point is to reveal the beauty of the night. Andrew Griffith, the Conservative MP who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dark Skies, grew up in suburban London. His first sight of a truly dark sky, in Morocco, was a revelation. Others care about bats or moths. Councils must cut their electricity use in order to reduce carbon emissions.
Overwhelmingly, though, the aim is to save money. Despite rising electricity prices, Lincolnshire County Council has managed to cut spending on streetlights by a fifth in the past decade, to £4.6m ($6.2m). That is less than in some London boroughs, where the lights blaze on. Richard Davies, the councillor in charge of Lincolnshire highways, says complaints often fade when people hear that the savings have gone on social care and filling potholes.
In general, young people, women and left-wingers are the most concerned about climate change. But when Lincolnshire County Council surveyed residents, it found that the young were most opposed to turning off the lights. Female students at the University of Lincoln have lobbied for all-night lighting. Conservative rural districts are often content with darkness; urban ones dominated by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, less so. The borough of Ipswich in Suffolk restored all-night lighting following the murder of Sarah Everard, who was abducted in London in March.
Local authorities that have reduced public lighting tend to argue that crime does not increase as a result. That may be true. But Jemima Unwin, who studies attitudes to light at University College London, says that darkness appears to deter people from walking around, at least in the evenings. She also finds that pedestrians feel reassured when vertical objects, such as walls and other pedestrians, are well-lit. Sodium-vapour lamps do that better than carefully focused LEDs.
The truth, however, is that few people outside big cities are out in the middle of the night. “Most residents don’t know whether the lights are on or off,” says Alasdair Ross, a Labour councillor in Ipswich. Paul Gilmore, North Yorkshire’s electrical engineering manager, did on-the-ground research before the council switched off the lights. Loitering in the middle of the night, he usually found no one else was around, on foot or in a vehicle. The lights were only helping foxes find their way.■",1
1707,"J.R.D. TATA recalled it as his saddest day. In 1978 the illustrious Indian industrialist opened the newspaper to discover that the government had fired him as chairman of Air India, the airline he founded in 1932 and managed even after its nationalisation in 1953. He called his secretary to ask if the story of his sacking was true. She replied that his successor, a former air marshal, was already making himself comfortable in his chair.
Tata, who died in 1993, frequently said that his job at Air India was to protect the airline from the central government in Delhi. No doubt the sentiment contributed to his sacking—and was justified. After his exit the flag-carrier entered a spiral. In recent years it was losing nearly $3m a day. Operating costs far exceed the industry average. So do customer complaints. Perhaps realising this, the government began trying to offload Air India in 2001, but deals repeatedly foundered over financial terms and demands that the state retain a residual stake, and possibly residual control.

On October 8th the drawn-out process finally concluded. The airline would return to Tata Group, today still one of India’s biggest conglomerates. Its bid of $2.4bn (including $2bn in debt) beat the only other, from the owner of Spice Jet, a heavily indebted low-cost airline. Some of Air India’s non-core assets, and its remaining $6bn in debt, will be transferred to a separate government-run holding company.
Given what has unfolded in India’s aviation since J.R.D.’s inglorious dismissal, it is not entirely unfair to conclude the government did Tata Group a favour by taking Air India off its hands. Private carriers have emerged only to go bust. Covid-19 travel restrictions have caused the industry to wallow in losses. Indigo, the most successful carrier with a market share of 57%, is embroiled in litigation between its founders and has ejected multiple top executives.
On the surface, Tata Group’s desire to return Air India to the fold looks foolish. The group already controls two smaller airlines through an 84% stake in AirAsia India (an affiliate of a Malaysian carrier) and a 51% stake in Vistara (co-owned with Singapore Airlines). Both have consistently lost money. Adding Air India to the mix seemingly deepens Tata’s aerial woes. The carrier burns cash as fast as its old and frayed fleet burns kerosene. The workforce is unionised, difficult to manage and resistant to change. The terms of the deal prohibit redundancies in the first year and after that only through voluntary attrition.
Still, Tata’s move is not without reason. Its current management sees its existing aviation operations as irredeemably subscale. The deal will double Tata’s domestic market share to 27% and give it a platform for growth through Air India’s network of landing slots abroad, particularly in London and New York. Air India owns a low-cost airline based in the state of Kerala that does a booming business ferrying Indian workers to and from the Persian Gulf, and could dovetail with AirAsia India.
Tata in turn may be providing Air India with capital and even more desperately needed good management. A pandemic-era depression in global aviation means aircraft are available. Boeing and Airbus are doubtless already pounding Tata’s door. Tata Consulting Services, India’s largest information-technology consultancy, could help tie together the various entities and enable savings in areas such as bookings and loyalty programmes. Tata’s hospitality division, Indian Hotels, could benefit from marketing links.
Managing this process will not be easy. Singapore Airlines is thought to have opposed the deal and hoped that Vistara would feed its own global network. Managing no-frills and full-service divisions makes sense in theory but no large airline has done it well. Crucial support for Air India comes from the country’s tight restrictions on foreign carriers, negotiated as bilateral treaties with their home countries. Those may be eased now that the airline is in private hands, reducing its advantage. Having reclaimed J.R.D.’s chair, Tata may find it not entirely comfortable. ■

1708,"The Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold at its latest meeting, though there was a perceptible shift in the mood music. The central bank’s projections now suggest that rates will be lifted twice in 2023, a change from previous guidance that they would remain at record-low levels until the end of 2024. The US economy is recovering from the pandemic more quickly than had been thought.
Inflation sensation

The annual rate of change in Britain’s consumer price index jumped to 2.1% in May, from 1.5% in April. Inflationary pressures are increasing as economies return to business. Inflation in America also rose again in May, to 5%, the highest reading since August 2008.

With inflation running at 8%, Brazil’s central bank raised interest rates for the third time this year, lifting its benchmark rate to 4.25%.
A big factor driving inflation is rising energy costs. The price of Brent crude closed in on $75 a barrel this week after OPEC and the International Energy Agency issued bullish forecasts on demand for oil. The IEA called on OPEC to “open the taps” to keep markets adequately supplied.
The European Union conducted the first funding operation for its Next Generation EU programme, raising €20bn ($24.2bn) through the sale of a ten-year bond, the largest amount the EU has raised in a single transaction. The bloc wants to tap €800bn in capital markets by the end of 2026 to finance the recovery fund.
America and the EU reached a deal to end their 17-year dispute over subsidies for Boeing and Airbus. Tit-for-tat tariffs will be suspended for five years while both sides work out an arrangement to limit subsidies and discuss other issues, such as funding to develop new aircraft.
Five bills were introduced in America’s House of Representatives that aim to curb the power of big tech companies by, among other things, prohibiting a dominant platform from promoting its products over others and barring the use of takeovers to smother competition. The most ambitious overhaul of antitrust law in decades would affect all firms, but is directed at Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. The bills face a long journey through Congress.
Big tech companies are to face a formidable foe at the Federal Trade Commission, where Lina Khan has been appointed chairwoman. Just 32 years old, Ms Khan is a professor at Columbia University Law School and has written extensively on reforming antitrust law. She was a counsel to the congressional committee that drafted a report forming the basis of the bills in the House.
Satya Nadella took on the role of chairman at Microsoft in addition to his job as chief executive, the first time that both roles have been combined since Bill Gates was in charge.
Didi Chuxing filed papers to list shares on either the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange. Expected next month, the IPO of China’s biggest ride-hailing firm could raise a reported $10bn.
Emirates reported an annual loss of $5.5bn for the year ending March 31st. With international travel almost at a standstill because of the pandemic the airline carried just 6.6m passengers over the 12 months, down by 88% from the previous year. The government of Dubai will continue to support the company, which has shed almost a third of its workforce since the start of the crisis.
Britain struck a free-trade deal with Australia, the first agreement negotiated from scratch by the British government since Brexit. British farmers are worried that their market will be swamped by cheaper goods from Down Under. They will be protected by a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years.
Nagayama Osamu said he would consider resigning as chairman of Toshiba, following the publication of a scathing independent report into collaboration between management and the Japanese government, but only after he had fixed the company’s problems. The report laid bare the extent to which officials colluded to head off a rebellion at last year’s shareholders’ meeting, which critics say proves that the government is more interested in protecting cronies than investors’ interests.
A court in France fined IKEA €1m ($1.2m) for spying on its staff through a surveillance system between 2009 and 2012. The former head of risk at IKEA France reportedly once inquired how a member of staff could afford a new BMW.

Bankers in America are being pressed to return to the office after a year of remote working. James Gorman, the boss of Morgan Stanley, told staff that if they felt comfortable visiting a restaurant in New York then they should also come back to the office. Goldman Sachs has taken the toughest approach, ordering all its employees back to their desks.",1
1709,"THE TIDE was pleasingly high, the seaweed on the white sands of the Cornish beach carefully combed out of sight. Seven world leaders sauntered back from their seafront photo for talks. As they walked, only one was treated to the American presidential arm, a full across-the-back hold, and for a total of 37 seconds: the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The high art of diplomatic choreography renders such fleeting gestures priceless. Was it not a kind of consecration? Britain’s Boris Johnson may have hosted the G7 meeting in June. But France’s president got the honours.
When Joe Biden was elected, France saw a rare chance to establish itself as America’s favourite European interlocutor. Brexit, went the argument, had relegated Britain’s usefulness in its transatlantic ally’s eyes. Germany was about to lose to retirement Angela Merkel, the continent’s de facto leader and Americans’ European of choice. Who better to step in than Mr Macron, an English-speaker who had once been selected as a French-American “young leader”? None other than Barack Obama, Mr Biden’s old boss, had called the French candidate in 2017 to wish him good luck. “Is this Emmanuel?” Mr Obama’s voice boomed through on speakerphone in the campaign office in Paris, urging Mr Macron to keep campaigning hard right to the end.

Moreover, France, a fellow child of revolution and America’s oldest ally, seemed to have unusually good links to the new administration. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, was educated at a lycée in Paris, as was Robert Malley, the special envoy for Iran. America supplies intelligence and logistics to French-led counter-terrorist operations in the Sahel. French and American navies train together, including in the Indo-Pacific, where France keeps over 7,000 troops (and has nearly 2m citizens). France’s pursuit of its own strategy in building up a geopolitical presence in the region in the face of an assertive China was “good for America”, notes Michael Shurkin, an American security analyst.
So it was with a mix of consternation, anger and pique that the French learned—just hours beforehand—of America’s new defence pact with Australia and Britain, which torpedoed an existing French contract to sell submarines to Australia. To lose a big defence deal was one thing. To be kept in the dark for months by three close friends, who evidently saw no place for you, was quite another. “Allies don’t do this to each other,” snapped Jean-Yves Le Drian, Mr Macron’s foreign minister, calling it a “stab in the back” and accusing the trio of “lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt”. France recalled its ambassador to America (as well as its one to Australia) for the first time since 1793. This week it was Boris Johnson who jetted off triumphantly to the White House, while Mr Macron sat nursing his wounds in the Elysée.
It is as hard to overstate the depth of the colère in Paris as it is to fathom America’s failure to anticipate it. France is as capable as anybody of acting with ruthless self-interest and disregard for others. A prickly, proud nation, it does not hesitate to say out loud what others keep to themselves. But the secret pact was as brutal a blow as any Western ally has landed on another in recent times. Trust is the first casualty. It took seven days for Mr Macron to accept Mr Biden’s call. Mr Biden agreed that there ought to have been “open consultations among allies”. Mr Macron agreed to send his ambassador back to Washington. Confidence-building talks will be launched. But the scars will remain.
What might be the consequences of all this? In the short run, a slighted France will be a more distrustful, irascible partner on other matters, less willing to compromise or give ground on trade, say, or over regulatory disputes. France cannot dictate what the European Union does; public European sympathy for France has so far been notably scant. But it can shape and block positions. Postponed meetings and summits may feel like poor tools of retaliation, but the cumulative effect can be corrosive.
The episode will also force the French, if not to rethink their ability to pursue their own Indo-Pacific strategy, then at least to confront the limits of it when measured against an Anglophone alliance. Some voices outside government, especially on the political right, are calling for a more dramatic, de Gaulle-like flourish. In 1966 the general distanced France from NATO and went off to sweet-talk the Russians. Ahead of the French presidential election next April, rival candidates are calling for some sort of replay. Gérard Araud, a French ex-ambassador to America, warns of “a Gaullist temptation”.
The ghost of de Gaulle
Mr Macron has indeed argued that France should act as a “balancing power”. Following America’s shambolic retreat from Kabul, the submarine episode has weakened the voice of French Atlanticists. But Mr Macron is no anti-American. He may not seek full-on confrontation with China, but he has long urged Europeans to consider it a strategic rival on industrial and security matters.
The geopolitical conclusion that he will probably draw from all this, rather, is that he was right. That America is an unreliable ally for continental Europeans at a time of a rising China; that this is not a fleeting trend; and that Europe needs greater self-reliance. Which brings France back to its persistent but generally thankless efforts to build European “strategic autonomy”.
During their call, Mr Biden acknowledged that European defence “is complementary to NATO”, as Mr Macron has always argued. But the concept still unnerves fellow Europeans. Most of them, especially those near the Russian border, are happy to rely on America’s security guarantee. Few share France’s willingness to splurge on defence, or its expeditionary military culture. (Germany, especially, does not.) Nobody agrees what “strategic autonomy” actually means. Low odds, however, seldom deter Mr Macron. After the latest snub, the unhugged French president will doubtless conclude that he has little choice but to keep trying. ■",1
1710,"IRAQI AIRWAYS flight IA271 from Baghdad to Minsk was a surprisingly popular service. The four-hour trip from Iraq, an unstable country in the Middle East, to Belarus, a dictatorship on the edge of Europe, became busy this summer. At the start of the year the flight ran once a week; in July it was going four times as often.
Lucky passengers were decanted at Minsk airport and whisked to Belarus’s border with Lithuania, in the hope of a new life in the EU. In 2020 just 74 people crossed from Belarus to Lithuania illegally. This year more than 4,000 people have tried. All this was overseen by Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, whose government had encouraged the arrivals. “We will not hold anyone back,” said Mr Lukashenko. “They are headed to enlightened, warm, cosy Europe.”

The fate of Flight IA271 reveals a few things about the state of asylum in the EU. For starters, the topic is still neuralgic for Europe’s politicians. Lithuanian officials label Mr Lukashenko’s approach “hybrid war”, with migration used as a weapon. Whereas 4,000 migrants is quite a lot for a country of 3m people, it is a rounding error for a club of 450m. Yet it triggered a state of emergency in Lithuania and abundant media coverage elsewhere. Images of people walking into Europe recalled the migration crisis in 2015, when about 1m entered the bloc, causing a continental political seizure. Mr Lukashenko is trying to cause another.
Unfortunately for Mr Lukashenko, the EU is less naive than it was in 2015. Whereas the European Commission once chided its governments for building fences on the EU’s external borders, it now helps provide the resources to man them. Glossy photos of Lithuanian soldiers rolling out barbed wire were met with none of the criticism that Viktor Orban, the Hungarian leader, faced when he did the same in the previous crisis. The EU’s ideological war over asylum between humanitarians and hardliners is over. The hardliners won.
The new approach of the EU and its governments verges on cynicism. Iraq was reminded that the EU is a big aid donor; its government was no doubt aware that the EU limits visas from countries it fears might generate lots of refugees. Iraq swiftly stopped allowing its citizens onto the flights. It was, after all, the Iraqis who were being ripped off, paying thousands of euros for nothing but a stiff glare from Lithuanian border guards and an unexpectedly long stay in Belarus. The migrant crisis of 2015 convinced the EU to create a hard border at its edges in order to maintain easy movement within the club. Now the EU is also exerting pressure to block travel to adjacent countries that do not police their borders.
When neighbours use people as weapons, such hardline tactics may be necessary. Mr Lukashenko is only the latest to try it on. Last year Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, bused thousands of would-be migrants to the border in an attempt to overwhelm Greek guards. Rough treatment from the Greeks has kept them out, though it violates international law. A similar formula is used on the Lithuanian frontier. Ugly tactics elicit an ugly response. Squeezing the flow at the source, by cajoling countries to limit flights like IA271, is preferable to beating people up.
Austrian Airlines flight OS52 from Tokyo to Vienna reveals the other side of the EU’s asylum policy. Rather than fly in a straight arc across Siberia and Belarus to Austria, it skirted round Belarus, avoiding Mr Lukashenko’s airspace like a geopolitical Bermuda triangle. The caution was understandable. In May Belarus sent up a fighter jet to hijack a Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight in order to kidnap a Belarusian dissident on board. OS52 had a similarly controversial cargo: Krystina Timanovskaya, a Belarusian athlete on her way to claim asylum in Poland.
In one sense, Ms Timanovskaya’s red-carpet treatment represents the hypocrisy of the EU‘s approach to asylum. Those attempting to hop into Lithuania are met with grumpy border guards, while the Belarusian athlete is welcomed as the platonic ideal of an applicant for asylum. The threat against her is obvious: state television labelled her a traitor. As a world-class athlete, she would be an asset to any country. The fact that she is a white woman rather than dark-skinned or male helps soothe the anxieties of xenophobes. And there is only one of her. A warm welcome for Ms Timanovskaya enforces the dangerous idea that asylum should be limited and based on character rather than circumstance—that one must be personally worthy of protection, rather than guaranteed it by law.
Leaving, on a jet plane
In another sense, Ms Timanovskaya’s Austrian Airlines flight represents a solution. More direct resettlement of refugees from troubled countries into the EU is one of the few ways the club can secure its border and maintain any sense of moral leadership. After all, European countries take more refugees than most rich countries. Japan, where Ms Timanovskaya boarded, took 47 refugees in 2020. By contrast, the EU gave refugee status to 23,000 people and offered protection to another 22,000 in the first quarter of this year alone. If the EU takes in bigger numbers of people who need shelter directly, rather than just causes célèbres such as Ms Timanovskaya, it could justifiably claim to be doing its part.
Leavening brutality and cynicism with humanity is the best that advocates of asylum can hope for. European governments—and voters—are set on stiff borders. Chancers will not be tolerated, be they cynical governments or simply people who want to improve their lives but are not victims of persecution. When neighbours use migration as a weapon, fences and flight bans are among the few available responses. Yet such tactics will scar Europe’s conscience unless it increases its efforts elsewhere, by settling large but controlled numbers of refugees in the bloc. If the EU is going to crack down on flights like IA271, the least it can do is offer a lot more flights like OS52. ■",1
1711,"FOR THOSE worried about the health of European democracy, the departures were all the more welcome for being so unexpected. After a decade in which populist governments have undermined the rule of law and moulded the state to their advantage across central and eastern Europe, two leaders accused of manipulating the political system lost power on the same day. An election in the Czech Republic appears to have ended the tenure of Andrej Babis, the billionaire prime minister, who is under investigation for misuse of EU subsidies, which he denies. In Austria, meanwhile, an investigation into the use of government funds to buy favourable media coverage has led to the resignation of Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor—although he, too, denies wrongdoing.
A bigger showdown is looming. Poland’s government, led by the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, has spent years trying to establish political control over its courts, bringing it into conflict with the EU. On October 7th its constitutional court raised the stakes by declaring that parts of the EU’s founding treaty infringe the Polish constitution, and that the final say in such conflicts belongs to Polish judges, not to the EU’s highest court. Such a break with EU treaties could force the European commission to deny Poland access to €36bn ($42bn) in covid-recovery funds. That would be the biggest escalation yet in the EU’s internal feud over the minimum democratic standards that all its members should uphold. If the commission goes ahead, it would signal a strong resolve to bring wayward members into line—and thus mark a big escalation in the long conflict.

Mr Kurz is a 35-year-old wunderkind whose tough anti-immigration policies aided his rapid rise to become head of the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), foreign minister and then chancellor. But the scandal has shed unwelcome light on concerns about how he did it. On October 6th police raided the chancellery, the foreign ministry and the ÖVP’s headquarters. The justice ministry’s economic crimes unit accused the party of using money from the Foreign Ministry to bribe a tabloid newspaper to run positive stories on Mr Kurz between 2016 and 2018. The stories were based on surveys allegedly doctored to make him look more popular, produced by a friendly polling agency.
Illiberal regimes often use state advertising to buy influence in the media. Some, such as Hungary’s government under Viktor Orban, do it blatantly. In Austria, things are less clear-cut, but have moved in a worrying direction of late. Government advertising purchases make up a large part of most newspapers’ budgets, and many have long worried that this may exert a subtle influence over their news coverage. But messages on a phone confiscated from a colleague of Mr Kurz showed an unusually naked quid pro quo.
Mr Kurz denies that he broke any laws or had any knowledge of the scheme. He will stay on as head of the party in parliament, and his replacement as chancellor is a close ally, Alexander Schallenberg. He might even have tried to stick it out, had not his coalition partners, the Green Party, threatened to bring the government down if he stayed. Austrians are sharply polarised in their views of Mr Kurz, but he is likely to attempt a comeback. His travails suggest that Europe’s problems with systemic corruption are not limited to formerly communist countries.
In the Czech Republic, Mr Babis’s defeat is piquant in that he long campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, claiming to be too rich to need bribes. He built his fortune starting in the 1990s by creating Agrofert, an agricultural conglomerate. Since entering politics in 2013 he has been dogged by investigations into whether the company abused EU subsidies. That investigation is now being pursued by the European public prosecutor’s office. Mr Babis has put his shares in Agrofert into a trust, but another EU investigative body, OLAF, concluded early this year that his connections to the company constituted a conflict of interest.
In the run-up to the election polls showed Mr Babis’s ANO (“Yes”) party narrowly in the lead. But on October 3rd an international journalists’ consortium released the Pandora Papers, a massive analysis of leaked documents from financial companies. The consortium’s Czech members, Investigace.eu, said the leaks showed that in 2009 Mr Babis had sent $22m through a shell company in the British Virgin Islands to buy a secret villa in the south of France.
Mr Babis spent the last weeks of the campaign imitating Mr Orban’s EU-bashing rhetoric. He has imitated Mr Orban’s techniques of media control too: Agrofert owns publications with a 25% share of the print news market. But the Pandora Papers got heavy coverage and may have tipped the balance in the election. Turnout was high, especially among young people and in cities where the opposition is strong. Spolu (“Together”), an alliance of centre-right parties, got 27.8% of the vote to ANO’s 27.1%. An alliance of the Pirate Party with a group of mayors and other officials got 15.6%. Together they will have a narrow majority in parliament because most parties fell short of the 5% threshold.
Mr Babis is far from done. President Milos Zeman, a eurosceptic populist, has vowed to reappoint him as prime minister regardless, claiming ANO won more votes than other individual parties. But that effort is unlikely to last long. Matters are further complicated by the fact that Mr Zeman was taken to hospital on October 10th. The victory of the opposition alliances vindicates a tactic adopted in other countries struggling with illiberal populist leaders. In Hungary too, opposition parties have teamed up across the political spectrum to try to unseat Mr Orban in the election next year.
Balancing out the progress, the Polish court decision on October 8th was the week’s gravest challenge to the rule of law in Europe. Ever since PiS came into office in Poland in 2015 it has been trying to gain control over the country’s courts by giving the government power to appoint pliant judges and punish defiant ones (another model borrowed from Mr Orban). That has brought Poland into ever deeper conflict with EU treaties, which require member states to have independent judiciaries. Polish judges have been barred from referring controversial cases to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the EU’s highest court. Some who did have been suspended and prosecuted.
The European Commission, which is supposed to enforce the bloc’s treaties, has been a reluctant cop, taking years to inch towards meaningful sanctions. But the constitutional court’s ruling could now force the commission’s hand. In a suit brought by Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, the court declared that parts of the EU’s founding treaty violate the Polish constitution, and that Polish judges rather than the ECJ have the last word in such questions.
The constitutional court is a rubber stamp for PiS, and officials in Brussels were prepared for an unfavourable decision. But the direct attack on an EU treaty went beyond their expectations. The principle that European law supersedes national law and that the ECJ is the arbiter of disputes lies at the very core of the EU. If member countries can ignore European laws or interpret them as they see fit, the European project is moot. (An earlier blow had been struck in May last year by Germany’s constitutional court, which ruled that in an area concerning European Central Bank financing, the EU exceeded its authority. That row is still being sorted out.)
The commission’s initial statement on the ruling was circumspect, but many officials think the time has finally come for a firm response. It could refuse to authorise Poland’s request for money from the EU’s massive €800bn covid recovery fund, which includes a clause requiring the commission to certify that recipient countries respect the rule of law. Poland has asked for €36bn. It needs the money for a slate of social programmes the government has labeled the “Polish New Deal”. This would be a nuclear step, but it may be a fight over the rule of law that the EU cannot avoid.",1
1712,"LEUVEN IS PERHAPS best known to the general public as the birth place of Stella Artois. Among chipmakers the Belgian city’s biggest claim to fame sits in a squat building not far from the Leuven Institute for Beer Research. Metal banding lends its facade the glittering look of a silicon wafer etched with microcircuitry. Inside, its lower floors hum with the noise of $3bn-worth of some of the most complex equipment humanity has ever devised. The offices above house hundreds of the planet’s keenest semiconductor engineers dreaming up the future of chipmaking.
The building (pictured) is the headquarters of the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre. IMEC, as it is better known, does not design chips (like America’s Intel), manufacture them (like TSMC of Taiwan) or make any of the complicated gear in its basement (like ASML, a Dutch firm). Instead, it creates knowledge used by everyone in the $550bn chip business. Given chips’ centrality to the modern economy—highlighted by the havoc wrought by current shortages—and increasingly to modern geopolitics, too, that makes it one of the most essential industrial research-and-development (R) centres on the planet. Luc Van den hove, IMEC’s boss, calls it the “Switzerland of semiconductors”.

IMEC was founded in 1984 by a group of electronics engineers from the Catholic University of Leuven who wanted to focus on microprocessor research. In the early days it was bankrolled by the local Flemish government. Today IMEC maintains its neutrality thanks to a financial model in which no single firm or state controls a big share of its budget. The largest chunk comes from the Belgian government, which chips in some 16%. The top corporate contributors provide no more than 4% each. Keeping revenue sources diverse (partners span the length and breadth of the chip industry) and finite (its standard research contracts last three to five years) gives IMEC the incentive to focus on ideas that help advance chipmaking as a whole rather than any firm in particular.
A case in point is the development of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). EUV is a delicate process involving high-powered lasers, molten tin and ultra-smooth mirrors. The bus-sized machines that generate EUV are today all made by ASML and used by TSMC and Samsung, a South Korean chipmaker. It took 20 years of R to turn the idea into manufacturing reality. IMEC acted as a conduit in that process. That is because EUV must work seamlessly with kit made by other firms. Advanced toolmakers want a way to circulate their intellectual property (IP) without the large companies gaining sway over it. The large companies, meanwhile, do not want to place all their bets on any one experimental idea that is expensive (as chipmaking processes are) and could become obsolete.
IMEC’s neutrality allows both sides to get around this problem. It collects all the necessary gear in one place, allowing producers to develop their technology in tandem with others. And everyone gets rights to the IP the institute generates. Mr Van den hove says that progress in the chip industry has been driven by the free exchange of knowledge, with IMEC acting as a “funnel” for ideas from all over the world.
This model has lured ever more contributors. Today “several hundred” are active at IMEC at any one time, the institute says. They range from startups to the stars of the chipmaking firmament, from ASML to TSMC. Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s newish boss, is effusive in his praise for the outfit. Even as their number has grown, individual partners have also become more generous, in part to keep pace with the rising price of all the chipmaking equipment that IMEC must procure (even if it gets a lot of it from collaborators at reduced rates). As a result, IMEC’s revenues, which come from the research contracts and from prototyping and design services, doubled between 2010 and 2020, to €678m ($773m). Its annual takings are already on the order of those of giant charities such as the Ford Foundation or the American Cancer Society, and growing roughly in line with the booming chip business (see chart).

The deepening rift between America, home to some of the industry’s biggest firms, and China, which imported $378bn-worth of chips last year, threatens IMEC’s spirit of global comity. China’s chip industry is increasingly shielded by an overbearing Communist Party striving for self-sufficiency, and ever more ostracised by outsiders as a result of American and European export controls. All this limits the extent to which IMEC can work with Chinese semiconductor companies.
It is a matter of public record that IMEC has worked with Chinese firms in the past, including Huawei, a telecoms-gear giant with a chip division that has been hobbled by American sanctions, and SMIC, China’s biggest chipmaker. Chinese make up 3.5% of people working at IMEC, the fifth-largest group and ahead of Americans at 1.5%. IMEC has a unit in Shanghai. Still, no Chinese tools are visible in its basement. IMEC would not comment on individual partnerships but says it has “a few engagements with Chinese companies, however not on the most sensitive technologies, and always fully compliant with current European and US export regulations and directives”. Mr Van den hove adds that IMEC has no “major partnerships” with up-and-coming Chinese toolmakers.
Less chipmaking know-how flowing to China and less streaming out of it means that Chinese engineers’ ideas can no longer be integrated with the global technology base of which IMEC is the custodian. There is little that IMEC can do about the growing distance between the Western and Chinese techno-spheres. So it is focusing instead on what it does best: pushing the cutting-edge of chip manufacturing.
A hulking machine made by SUSS MicroTec, a German firm, scans chips to create a 3D image so that multiple processors can be aligned and affixed—fiddly business at nanometre scales. Elsewhere in the building Peter Peumans, who runs IMEC’s health-tech portfolio, hands over a prototype developed during the pandemic that uses a custom silicon chip to cut DNA-sequencing times from hours to minutes. Xavier Rottenberg is developing semiconductor-based ultrasound sensors that can be printed out using the technology to make flat-screen TVs, which may lead to scanners much larger than today’s handheld ones and able to capture the whole body at once at a higher resolution. Such work keeps IMEC’s neutral ideas factory awhir. Maintaining Swiss-like neutrality in chip geopolitics will be tougher. ■

1713,"IT MIGHT SOUND obvious that if you want to improve a robot’s software, you should improve its software. Agrim Gupta of Stanford University, however, begs to differ. He thinks you can also improve a robot’s software by improving its hardware—that is, by letting the hardware adapt itself to the software’s capabilities.
As they describe in Nature Communications, he and his colleagues have devised a way of testing this idea. In doing so, they have brought to robotics the principles of evolution by natural selection. They have also cast the spotlight on an evolutionary idea that dates from the 1890s, but which has hitherto proved hard to demonstrate.

There is a wrinkle. The team’s robots, which they dub “unimals”, are not things of metal and plastic. Rather, they are software entities that interact with a virtual environment in the way that metal-and-plastic devices might interact with a real one. Unimals are pretty simple, having spheres for heads and cylinders for limbs (see picture). The environments through which they roamed were also simple, and came in three varieties: flat arenas, arenas filled with hills, steps and rubble, and ones that had the complexities of the second sort, but with added props like cubes that needed to be moved around.
To begin with, the unimals were given a variety of randomly assigned shapes, but with identical software running each of them. That software was a piece of artificial intelligence called a deep evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm, or DERL.
Newly created unimals started in a virtual boot camp, in which the DERL learned enough about the world to face the challenges to come. They were then entered into tournaments. In groups of four, Dr Gupta put them through tests of agility, stability and ability to manipulate objects. Each group’s winner was allowed to “breed” by spawning a daughter with one mutation (an extra limb for stability, perhaps, or extra rotation in a joint, for flexibility). This daughter was substituted for the oldest unimal in the pool, assigned to a new group of four, and the process repeated.
Unimals were withdrawn from the fray after ten generations of evolution, and Dr Gupta reckons about 4,000 varieties of them underwent training. The team were surprised by the diversity of shapes that evolved. Some had arms as well as legs. Others had only legs. There were bipeds, tripeds and quadrupeds. Some moved like lizards. Others resembled an octopus walking on land. Crucially, though, the researchers found that the most successful unimals learned tasks in half the time that their oldest ancestors had taken, and that those which evolved in the toughest arenas were the most successful of all.
In this evolution of unimals’ morphology to promote the ability to learn, Dr Gupta sees a version of something called the Baldwin effect. In 1896 James Baldwin, an American psychologist, argued that minds evolve to make optimal use of the morphologies of the bodies they find themselves in. What Dr Gupta has shown, though in software rather than in the real, biological world, is that the obverse can also be true—changes in body morphology can optimise the way minds (or, at least, DERLs) work. Even though he held the software constant from generation to generation, it became more efficient at learning as the unimals’ bodies evolved.
Whether that discovery can be turned to account in the way robots are developed remains to be seen. But it is certainly, in the jargon beloved of some businessfolk, an out-of-the-box idea. ■

An early version of this article was published online on November 3rd 2021",1
1714,"PRINCESS MAKO and Komuro Kei were undergraduates when they first met in Tokyo back in 2012. Mako was drawn to Kei’s “smile that is like the sun”. Kei saw Mako as “the moon watching over me tranquilly”. The couple began dating and kept in touch while Mako studied abroad; in 2017, they got engaged.
The problems began when Japanese tabloids dug into Mr Komuro, and discovered that his mother had reportedly taken a loan of ¥4m ($35,000) from her ex-fiancé that she did not return. Commentators called Mr Komuro, a commoner, a gold-digger. They questioned whether his love for Mako was real. The couple delayed the marriage and Mr Komuro went to study law in America, but the furore did not die down. On his return earlier this year, Japanese media seized upon his ponytail as further evidence of his unsuitability for their beloved princess.

On October 26th the couple married at last, but without the typical formal ceremony and despite a small street protest held the same day. By most measures, the accusations are not scandal-worthy. But they reflect broader anxieties around the challenges confronting a changing Japanese society and institutions that have been slow to catch up.
One challenge is to the royal family itself, which is the world’s oldest surviving hereditary monarchy. It has been slow to adapt to modern media. The Imperial Household Agency is masterful at managing archives and fussing over rituals, but struggles with public relations. It did little to correct misinformation that spread about the couple online.
Another is the harsh treatment of royal women, a magnified version of the sexism that many Japanese women face on a daily basis. Mako was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder during her ordeal. Empress Masako, the wife of the current emperor, Naruhito, has also suffered from stress-related illness amid intense pressure to produce a male heir. Empress Michiko, her predecessor, lost her voice for months in the 1960s and 1990s as a result of stress.
The affair has also brought the family’s tenuous future to the fore. By marrying a commoner, Mako has ceased to be royal (this rule would not apply if she were male). Her departure leaves just 17 royals, and only men can inherit the Chrysanthemum throne. Merely three potential heirs remain. Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has blocked moves to allow future female monarchs.
The episode highlights how Japan’s politics, especially on social issues, are hostage to a vocal, conservative minority. Recent polls show that most Japanese in fact support the partnership of Mako and Kei. Some 85% favour allowing female succession. A similar dynamic—where the public is far more liberal than legislators—exists around gay marriage and the question of whether to allow couples to keep separate surnames, which Japanese law does not allow.
Like a certain British duo, the Japanese royal couple have decided to make their future outside the stodgy confines of their homeland. Mako and Kei will soon join Harry and Meghan in America.",1
1715,"MIN AUNG HLAING can cut a lonely figure on the international stage. Since seizing power in a coup in February, the commander-in-chief of Myanmar’s armed forces has been persona non grata in many places. But one country at least has remained steadfast: Russia. Its friendship with Myanmar grows “stronger and stronger”, boasted the general on a visit to Moscow in June. Nor is Myanmar the only South-East Asian country Russia is buddying up with. In July President Vladimir Putin gave Hun Sen, Cambodia’s prime minister, a “friendship” medal, and sent his foreign minister on official visits to Laos and Indonesia. Seven of the ten member-states of ASEAN, a club of South-East Asian countries, have bought or plan to buy the Russian government’s Sputnik V vaccine. Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia have even signed deals to manufacture it.
Russia’s Asian charm offensive is not new. Since Mr Putin first took office two decades ago, Moscow has assiduously cultivated ties there, eager to sell commodities to its booming markets and to develop the anaemic economy of its far-eastern territories. But some analysts argue that this “pivot to Asia”, as Moscow calls it, is really a pivot to China, which is thirsty for Russian hydrocarbons and with which Russia shares a rival, America. And as fears have grown that Russia’s economy is becoming too dependent on China, so the benefits of sharing the love with the rest of Asia have seemed more apparent. So over the past decade, Moscow has stressed the importance of stronger bonds with ASEAN.

The most obvious evidence of this burgeoning friendship is on the parade ground. Russia is the region’s biggest arms supplier. Between 2000 and 2019 it sold $10.7bn-worth of tanks, warships, fighter jets and other weapons to South-East Asia, surpassing America, the region’s second-biggest supplier, by nearly a third. Over the past decade, Russia’s navy has made more frequent port calls in the region. Its armed forces occasionally conduct joint exercises with its South-East Asian counterparts. Over the past five years these ties have been affirmed by a flurry of defence agreements—with Indonesia and Myanmar, but also with Thailand and the Philippines, both formally allies of America.
Moscow supplements military ties with camaraderie. Mr Putin has for years made a point of attending ASEAN summits, and in 2016 began to play host to an annual Russia-ASEAN shindig. Years of glad-handing have borne fruit. When in 2014 the UN voted on a resolution condemning Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Vietnam, Brunei and Cambodia abstained, while Laos apparently forgot to vote. Russia reciprocated this year, torpedoing moves by other members of the UN Security Council to condemn the military coup in Myanmar.
South-East Asian governments welcome Russia’s courtship. Its weaponry is more reliable than China’s, and cheaper and less tangled in red tape than America’s. Moreover, as the rivalry between America and China ratchets up, many South-East Asian countries feel under pressure to choose sides. So they are keen on ties with other powerful countries like Russia, says Elizabeth Buchanan of Deakin University in Australia.
The problem is that, aside from arms and hydrocarbons, Russia does not have much to sell to the region. In 2019 ASEAN’s bilateral trade with America was worth $292bn and with Japan $116bn. With Russia it amounted to a piddling $18bn. Little has changed since 2010, when Russia’s foreign minister lamented that economic ties with ASEAN were “mostly skin-deep”.
Russia’s approach to foreign policy is “short-termist”, says Alexander Gabuev of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, a think-tank. Strategists know that the country ought to focus on the rest of Asia, yet “every year we see Russia doubling down on China” because it remains preoccupied by the commercial potential there. But when democracy takes a beating in South-East Asia, Russia does seize the opportunity to reward its assailants, notes Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington. When coup-makers in Myanmar and Thailand took power and when the Philippines’ irascible president seemed inclined to rip up its alliance with America (he later relented), it swooped in to sell arms and promise lasting friendship. Unable to add substance to those overtures, however, Russia contents itself with thumbing its nose at America and patting authoritarians on the back. It is not so much a great power as a great mischief-maker.",1
1716,"In an astonishing turn, AT decided to spin off Warner Media, a film and television company it battled to acquire just three years ago, combining the business with  Discovery, a broadcaster of factual programming. The combined company’s brands will include HBO, CNN and numerous Discovery channels. Together the pair spent more on content last year than their rivals and will have the biggest share of American cable viewers.  AT has now shed all its media assets, leaving it to focus back on telecoms.
A possible Bond trade

Amazon is reportedly in talks to buy  MGM, the studio behind the James Bond franchise, for $9bn. MGM is one of the few big Hollywood film-makers not to have been swallowed up by a media conglomerate.
Also joining the rush among media companies to consolidate,  TF1 and  M6, two French broadcasters, announced their intention to merge. The pair say that the deal will protect the independence of French content against the likes of Disney and Netflix. Regulators will be concerned by the 70% share of advertising on French TV that they would control.
The International Energy Agency surprised many with its “road-map” to net zero emissions by 2050. To reach that goal, the IEA’s report said that no new oil or gas projects should be approved, and that the power generated by solar and wind should increase fourfold by 2030. Underlining the challenge, for solar that would be the equivalent of installing the world’s largest solar park nearly every day.
Almost 89% of shareholders in Shell backed the management’s plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company has come under pressure from green activists who say this does not go far enough and from other investors who say Shell’s strategy lacks the focus of American giants, who remain centred on oil and gas. A separate resolution submitted by Follow This, a Dutch green investor group, was supported by 30% of shareholders, passing a threshold under British company law which means Shell must now consult with them.

Japan’s economy shrank by 1.3% in the first quarter over the previous three months. The declaration of a second state of emergency, which urged people to stay at home, was mostly to blame. In a sign that a recovery may be under way, exports in April grew by 38% year on year. That was the fastest pace in a decade, even if it is a comparison with trade in the depths of the pandemic.
Britain’s annual inflation rate leapt to 1.5% in April from 0.7% in March. The increase reflects a jump in consumer prices when shops re-opened in April and higher oil prices, which pushed up the cost of energy. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said he was carefully watching the data and if inflation persistently rose above the bank’s 2% target he would take action, “no question about that”.
China told its banks and payment companies not to conduct transactions involving cryptocurrencies and warned investors against speculating in them, because they are disrupting the “normal economic and financial order”. The price of bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies plunged in response. China’s central bank is well advanced in developing its own digital currency.
Light at the end of the tunnel
Eurostar secured a bail-out from investors, mostly in loan guarantees. The rescue package was led by SNCF, the French state railway group, which is Eurostar’s majority shareholder. The British government refused to take part; it sold its 40% stake in the company in 2015. Eurostar hopes to increase the number of trains it runs between London and the continent as travel restrictions ease.
Britain’s railways, meanwhile, are to face the biggest set of reforms since privatisation in the mid-1990s. The government published a plan that would bring rail infrastructure, timetables and ticket prices back under state control, but still contract train operations to private companies. The hope is that this will lead to clearer lines of communication between the government and the private sector.
Indonesia’s two biggest startups, Gojek and Tokopedia, said they would merge, creating a platform that spans ride-hailing, digital payments and e-commerce. The combined company, GoTo, will reportedly seek to float on stockmarkets later this year, in a dual listing which could see it valued at up to $40bn.
Working 55 hours or more a week is “a serious health hazard” according to the World Health Organisation, in a first global analysis of the effects of working long hours. Working at least 55 hours is associated with higher risks of stroke and heart disease, compared with working 35-40 hours. The disease burden is significant in men, people living in East and South-East Asia, and middle-aged or older workers.",1
1717," (CNN)Steve Bannon's relationship with former President Donald Trump has landed him in the dock, charged with criminal contempt of Congress.  Doubling down on his Trump-emulating defiance, Bannon has retained the ex-president's former lawyer, David Schoen -- perhaps most famous for taking part in the defense in the second impeachment when seven members of Trump's own party voted to convict him.  Schoen is making the rounds offering Bannon's public defense: He was just following the advice of his (prior) lawyer, who told him to respect Trump's claims of executive privilege. But Schoen's arguments are no better now than they were during Trump's impeachment trial. It's worth taking the time to debunk them. First, Trump is no longer the president, and he doesn't get to invoke executive privilege to shield himself and his cronies from accountability. As Judge Tonya Chutkan held last week in denying Trump's attempt to block the National Archives from releasing January 6 documents: Presidents aren't kings -- and Trump isn't even the president.  The ex-president's invocation of the privilege is not a sufficient basis to take the law into your own hands and simply refuse to show up, as Bannon did. Trump helped Bannon evade accountability once, pardoning him after he was arrested for wire fraud. Not this time.   Trump's attempt at invoking the privilege is especially weak here because he wasn't acting as chief executive when he planned and implemented his effort to overturn the election. He was acting as a defeated candidate, and there is no candidate privilege.  Second, there's no such thing as podcaster privilege. Even if Trump could invoke the privilege, it wouldn't protect Bannon -- he was a podcast host, not a White House advisor, on January 6. Bannon's whisperings with other conspirators also aren't Oval Office advice to the president. Third, Bannon can't hide behind his lawyer any more than he can hide behind Trump. Schoen claims that Bannon was merely acting on the advice of his lawyer, who told him to honor Trump's privilege invocation. But the majority of federal courts hold that reliance on a lawyer's advice isn't a defense to criminal contempt. The Godfather's Vito Corleone didn't get to break the law with impunity because Tom Hagen told him it was OK.  Fourth, even if good faith reliance on a lawyer's advice were a defense, it wouldn't help Bannon. A person who wants to invoke a legitimate privilege in good faith doesn't simply ignore a subpoena. He responds on time, and he negotiates. He turns over all relevant documents that aren't covered by the privilege, and produces a privilege log indicating which documents he isn't turning over and why. He doesn't simply skip out on a scheduled deposition. He shows up, answers when he can, and invokes the privilege on a question-by-question basis.  Even with an executive privilege claim, the committee could plausibly pose questions that bear no connection to Trump, such as communications Bannon had with others outside the administration who were in a pre-insurrection ""war room"" at the Willard Hotel in DC.  Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department lawyer who apparently collaborated with Trump in trying to overturn the election results, also sought to invoke the privilege -- but he at least showed up at his deposition to do it.  Bannon didn't, and he didn't negotiate either. He appears not to have even tried to act in good faith. It looks like he holds Congress in abundant contempt. Now it's officially mutual.  Fifth, and finally, with no facts or law on his side, Schoen has resorted to claiming that Congress and the DOJ are just being unfair to his client. That's not going to cut it as a defense -- try winning a selective prosecution defense -- but it's also wrong on the facts.  Bannon's own words have been even more damaging than his lawyer's. When he surrendered himself to the FBI on Monday, Bannon brazenly outlined his intent, ""I don't want anybody to take their eye off the ball...We're taking down the Biden regime.""  Willfulness -- an informed and deliberate refusal to comply -- is required to prove criminal contempt. Look for the tape of those words to be played at trial to show bad intent.  Judge Carl Nichols may be a Trump appointee, but it's hard to conceive that he would look kindly on Bannon's brazenness. Proof of that is his scathing decision against Trump's allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, rejecting their effort to get Dominion Voting Systems' libel case against them thrown out. It's true that criminal contempt prosecutions are rare. They should be. They're a big deal. But Bannon's flagrant contempt of Congress cries out for consequences. And our republic needs them.  We are still looking for answers about what happened on January 6 and how to stop the ongoing attack waged by Bannon and his co-conspirators on the very idea of a democratic government. ",2
1718,"SAARLAND IS NO stranger to transition, jokes Thorben Albrecht, policy director for the IG Metall trade union. The second-smallest of the 16 states, for a century Saarland bounced back and forth between Germany and France, establishing itself inside the federal republic only in 1957. Coal deposits and steel made it rich, but also left it exposed to job losses when globalisation came knocking in the 1970s. A booming car-parts industry provided a cushion, but Saarland now faces a third shift, as industrial transformation and climate policy come after its two big sources of jobs: cars and what remains of steel.
The government wants 14m electric vehicles (EVs) on German roads by 2030, up from 1m today. But the slow death of the internal combustion engine undercuts the business model of gearbox, cooling-system or fuel-injection pump makers—suppliers that dot Saarland and other states. Almost 20,000 people work in Saarland’s car industry, mostly in small and medium-sized firms. The state has neither a large company headquarters nor a big city with a thriving service sector. “A huge reduction in car-sector jobs will mean social problems of a very large order,” says Hans-Christian Herrmann, who charted previous waves of deindustrialisation as the chief archivist in Saarbrücken, the state capital. An IG Metall survey found that 42% of German car workers fear for their future.

Workers at steel plants, which account for around 6% of German carbon emissions, are as worried. “You can see my grey hairs”, chuckles Stephan Ahr, who chairs the works council at Saarstahl, a steelmaker in Völklingen. The plant has already lost tens of thousands of jobs. The main decarbonisation plan, in which polluting coke is ditched in favour of hydrogen obtained from renewables, will require far fewer workers. Other developments, including uncertainty over the carbon price and EU policy on steel imports, add to Mr Ahr’s worries. “Everything affects us without us having any influence,” he says. “It’s take it or die.”

Germany’s industrial model rests on the full employment that buys consensus between firms, workers and government. Labour relations are harmonious. But the impulses to create what unions call a “just” transition can lead to ruinously expensive deals like the “coal exit” agreed in 2019: a €40bn programme to manage the slow elimination by 2038 of the final coal mines, which employ 20,000 people, slightly fewer than the country’s yoga teachers.
The transition is also a challenge to big companies. If carmakers were late to the electric game, Volkswagen, which has almost 300,000 employees in Germany, is scrambling to make up for lost time (and perhaps to repair the damage to its reputation from the diesel-emissions scandal in 2015). Under its charismatic boss, Herbert Diess, and with an eye on Tesla, soon to open a battery gigafactory outside Berlin, VW has gone all-in on electric. It says EVs will account for half its vehicle sales by 2030. By 2035 vw, which reckons to account for 2% of global carbon emissions, will cease selling petrol-powered cars in Europe.

EU rules and climate targets are forcing tough decisions. But talk to VW insiders and you see how deep the shift has gone. To power the next generation of cars, VW plans by 2030 to build six lithium-ion battery plants in Europe. Entire plants are given over to EV production. The “MEB” chassis (or platform) will be spread across models, ensuring cars are built around batteries rather than vice versa, and may be licensed to other manufacturers. “Think of this as a system, with suppliers, batteries, services and infrastructure,” says Andreas Walingen, VW’s chief strategy officer. “Only then will customers go electric”. Mr Diess has also linked executives’ bonus payments to VW’s share price, a decision one employee says “changed the DNA of the governance.” VW’s profits surged in the first quarter of 2021, and investors seem satisfied.
The car industry faces the biggest disruption in its history, says Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, head of the Centre Automotive Research in Duisburg. Electrification is just a start. Audi, a VW brand, is trying a car-subscription model aimed at younger drivers, a growing market that could upend revenue models. Software systems require digital skills and fresh ways of working. “We are strong on the hardware side of cars, not so good on data and AI,” says Danyal Bayaz, the Green finance minister of Baden-Württemberg, another big car state. Some fear VW will never catch up with Tesla—or the Chinese firms muscling in. Fully autonomous vehicles, should they arrive, may bring the biggest change yet.

As for the jobs, the scares are overblown, insists Mr Diess (who faces powerful unions and workers’ councils). “Seats remain seats, steel remains steel, wheels remain wheels, brakes remain brakes,” he recently told the German Press Agency. A study by the Boston Consulting Group and the German think-tank Agora Verkehrswende projects no net loss of jobs by 2030, although other surveys are less sanguine. But the headline figure conceals massive churn, as component making gives way to battery production and coding. Almost half the country’s 1.7m car workers will need reskilling, especially the SME suppliers. This, warns the study, will mean “considerable expense” for firms and workers.
And for the state, too. Carmakers rely on the government to set carbon targets, roll out EV charging infrastructure and tweak regulations to make it easier to harmonise refuelling payment systems across the country. Until 2025 the federal government will subsidise EV buyers to the tune of €6,000 per car. The incentives have lifted the share of EVs and hybrids to over a fifth of all new sales, but they are regressive and expensive. Deutsche Bank calculates that each EV could over its lifespan cost the state €20,000 in subsidies and taxes forgone.
Beyond the jobs churn, Saarland looks hopefully to new industries spawned by industrial transformation, rather as cars provided a safety net during the previous wave of deindustrialisation. SVolt, a Chinese battery maker, plans two plants in the state which it says could create 2,000 jobs, although locals are sceptical. Hydrogen, an untested fuel central to the government’s climate plans, is another hope. One thing everyone agrees on is that the transition needs to be oiled with public money. The industry reckons some €30bn will be required to make the full transition to decarbonisation. Some politicians pledge that climate protection will be the next engine of prosperity. At least in Saarland, many are unconvinced. “We have just eight years to change a region,” says Ralf Reinsteadtler at IG Metall. “That’s tomorrow.”■

1719,"Until last night, the most nauseous I've felt in my life was after eating a vegan sausage roll live on air, a reckless decision that prompted me to instantly hurl into a large bucket.
But that sickening ordeal paled into vomit-inducing insignificance compared to the comically cringe-worthy collision between the world's two most narcissistic, fake and irritating female celebrities, Meghan Markle and Ellen DeGeneres.
Watching them giggle and preen away during their lengthy cheese-fest, stroking each other's egos and dishing out cash to charity, you'd think they are the kindest, sweetest human beings to ever bestride the globe.
But it's worth reminding ourselves that they both stand accused of being nasty little bullies who, when the cameras aren't around, terrorize their staff.
Unsurprisingly, bullying in the workplace didn't come up as a topic of discussion last night.
Nor did Princess Pinocchio's trashing of the Royal Family and Monarchy, the institutions she professes to detest but milks like a greedy dairy farmer.
Or her treatment of her own family, almost all of whom she's disowned for threatening her relentless climb up the social and financial ladder.
Instead, viewers were treated to a repulsive exchange of faux-humble shmaltz designed to flog copies of Ms. Markle's critically derided, poor-selling children's book The Bench.
To help do so, she released new photographs of her son Archie feeding chickens at her $14.7 million mansion in Santa Barbara and talked about her daughter Lilibet's teething problems.
All of which may come as a surprise to those who'd been conned into thinking Meghan quit Britain, dragging her husband with her, because she craved privacy for her family from the beastly British press.
It turned out she didn't want privacy at all, she just wanted to get away from anyone that might take a negative view of her constant whining and rank hypocrisy.
And of course, she wanted to get away from having to perform the often arduous and unexciting royal duties that go with having a title like the Duchess of Sussex.
Now Meghan has the best of all worlds: she gets to exploit her fancy royal name to make hundreds of millions of dollars, doesn't have to do any work for the institution that bestowed it upon her, is free (in her head) to publicly abuse the royals as a bunch of heartless racists, and can live the life of a fabulously rich celebrity who pops up on TV chat show sofas to promote her brand.
But at what cost does all this come for the Royal Family that she renounced at the same venomous speed she renounced her own father when he didn't toe the line?
The worst thing about her Ellen appearance wasn't even the fact she was going on the show at all given her friend and neighbor's show has been cancelled in the wake of the awful bullying allegations against the host and some of her executives.
That was bad, but then Ellen's no more a real 'friend' of Meghan's than Oprah Winfrey. She's just another famous person with the tools, currently, to inflate the Sussex celebrity brand.
No, the worst thing came when Ellen made Meghan literally dance for her book-plugging supper by taking part in one of the most embarrassing stunts I've ever seen a royal do on television.
The 'Duchess of Sussex', as she so proudly calls herself at every opportunity, pulled a prank on a trio of street vendors, carrying out a series of orders from Ellen via a secret microphone in her ear.
Meghan touched her elbow, and her nose, performed a squat, held a large crystal to her head as she moaned and groaned, and bounced up and down with excitement at seeing a hot sauce for sale as she exclaimed: 'Let mommy have a taste! My boo loves hot sauce!'
She then chomped a sauce-coated chip 'like a chipmunk' because Ellen instructed her to, before telling the salesman: 'That's not spicy! Let me try something real hot, mommy wants some heat! Let's get the spiciest, let's get the hottest!'
Ordered by smirking Ellen to shove another chip whole into her mouth, Meghan did so, and began furiously fanning her face while exclaiming: 'Lordy, lordy, lordy!'
Then she burst into singing 'I'm feeling hot, hot, hot!' as she danced around.
Just when I thought things couldn't possibly get any more toe-curling, she shouted: 'Mommy needs some milk!' before pulling out a baby bottle from her purse and guzzling down the milk.
The humiliating farce ended with Meghan asking another female vendor if she would like to hear a joke.
'Why did the elephant put his trunk in the cookie jar?' she said, then stayed silent and refused to reveal the punchline before bursting out laughing and saying to the bemused vendor: 'It's funny, isn't it?'
Well, no, it wasn't.
None of this was remotely funny.
It was all just incredibly, soul-suckingly excruciating.
In the final scene, Meghan put on a pair of kitten ears and burst into song again, prancing around in her ears as she wailed: 'I'm a kitten, mew mew mew.'
By this point I needed my sick bucket to go ew, ew, ew.
Honestly, it all made me genuinely want to puke.
This is a senior member of the British Royal Family whose husband Prince Harry is sixth in line to the throne, behaving like a gormless desperate reality TV starlet.
Royals don't do this kind of thing for a very good reason.
The public expects them to behave in a regal manner, that is the mystique that preserves the Monarchy.
It may seem anachronistic to many Americans, but it works. The Royals bring in billions of pounds in tourism money to the UK and the Queen remains the world's most revered head of state.
Take away the mystique and the very future of the Monarchy itself may be imperiled, especially given that Her Majesty, now 95, has been in recent worryingly poor health.
That's why what Meghan Markle and Harry get up to carries significance and cannot be dismissed as inconsequential.
So long as they're still the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, their behavior directly impacts on the reputation of the Royal Family.
And just as Prince Andrew's - far more serious - behavior in refusing to be interviewed by the FBI about his relationship with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein is causing huge damage to that reputation, so Meghan and Harry's constant self-publicizing, royal-bashing antics are, in a very different way, doing consistent damage too.
Last night's Ellen debacle exposed Meghan Markle's desire to be a jobbing C-list reality TV celebrity, not a jobbing A-list royal.
But even a Kardashian would have deemed that street vendor stunt beneath them and brand-damaging.
That's how puerile and embarrassing it was.
For a British royal to demean herself in such a way is completely unacceptable.
Not just because it made Meghan Markle look ridiculous, but because it made the British Monarchy look ridiculous.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the Queen must strip the Duke and Duchess of Sussex of their royal titles before their brazen, craven, money-grabbing campaign to fleece their duty-free royal status destroys everything she has worked so hard to maintain.",3
1720,"SOMETIME AROUND the middle of the 19th century, Maria Sutton Clemments worked as a slave on an Arkansas cotton plantation. Years later she remembered one typically vicious overseer. If her fellow slaves “didn't chop that cotton just right,” she recounted, “he would have them tied up to a stake or big sapling and beat him until the blood ran out of the gashes.”
Fast forward around 175 years from that Arkansas scene, and Ruslan Utayev is recalling his own experience of being forced to pick cotton, in Uzbekistan, less than a decade ago. Between September and November, he says, the then president, Islam Karimov, closed Mr Utayev’s school and made its children and teachers work the fields. His shift started at 6am and he was expected to pick 100kg of cotton a day, a barely conceivable amount of what is, in essence, fluff. Those who failed to reach their quotas were spared the whip, but could expect public humiliation from their supervisors.

Like countless others, both Susan Merritt and Mr Utayev were the victims of the world’s hunger for cotton. American plantations supplied the newly mechanised cotton mills of Europe, particularly Britain. And it was a desire to free itself from a reliance on Western cotton that led pre-Soviet Russia to turn vast swathes of its Central Asian conquests over to the crop. Both Western capitalism and, later, Soviet communism, had the same effect: to compel the unwilling to harvest a labour-intensive crop as cheaply as possible. The legacy has endured. Today the world’s attention has turned to the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, a gulag-splattered region in western China. There, companies bus in minorities to cotton fields under the pretence of creating “a sense of unity and nationality”, says Kai Hughes, executive director of the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC), an industry group (though he was speaking in a personal capacity).
Farmers produced an estimated 26m tonnes of cotton in 2019-20, worth $41bn, according to the ICAC. It is the most widely farmed product that you can’t eat, reckons the World Wildlife Fund. America’s Department of Labour lists 17 countries believed still to use forced or child labour in their cotton industries. Miscreants span the globe, from Argentina to Egypt to China. Of the world’s ten biggest cotton producers, only three—America, Australia and Mexico—are considered free of it (and some argue that, given its use of prisoners to pick the crop, America is lucky to be off the blacklist).
Nowadays few pickers face such blatant coercion as those in Arkansas or Uzbekistan did, or the Uyghurs do. Labourers are more likely to be entrapped by debt, or exploited by agents. India’s experience is common. Pickers there tend to be migrants who move with the seasons. Often jobs in far-off states are arranged through middlemen, who take an advance, ostensibly to cover accommodation and such like. The effect is to bond the harvester to the agent until the money is repaid. At the same time, the majority of cotton farms are smallholdings. According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, a think-tank, of the 100m farmers who cultivate the crop around the world, around 90% do so on less than two hectares of land. That discourages mechanisation, forcing them to rely on cheap human labour.
The use of children is a separate, though related, issue. It comes in two guises. The first is migrant families taking their offspring to toil in the fields with them. The second is farmers using them on their own holdings. Children are employed not only because they are cheap. Farmers also prize their small, nimble hands, particularly during seeding season, says Purva Gupta of the Global March Against Child Labour, a human-rights group. When that is combined with rural poverty and inadequate schools, many parents think their kids’ time is best served working. Lax regulation doesn’t help. Child labour in India, for example, is outlawed only for hazardous occupations, among them mining. Cotton farming doesn’t feature, even though the children can often be exposed to dangerous agricultural chemicals.
Brand spanking due?
Many people argue that the solution to forced labour lies with global clothing brands, the ultimate beneficiaries of such practices. Why are they not being more rigorous when they source their textiles? Many brands say they would like to be, for both legal and reputational reasons. The trouble is cotton’s convoluted journey from farm to shop. Even a “simple” supply chain, says Mark Sumner of the University of Leeds, looks something like this: a farmer and his small-holder neighbours sell raw cotton to a ginner (who separates the fibres from the seeds), often through an agent. The ginner then supplies huge global traders, which amalgamate cotton from around the world, sorted by quality. They in turn sell to yarn producers. Next come the textile manufacturers which knit or weave the fabric and sell to dyers and finishers. Finally the cloth is ready to be sold to a garment manufacturer which produces the finished item. These tend to be the only firms in the supply chain with which the brands have a contract.
Even if those further down that chain had the will to track which bales came from which field (which it is not in their interest to do) it would be logistically unworkable. And expecting brands to audit the practices of firms with which they don’t have a contract is a big ask. Even the biggest clothing companies would represent only a small fraction of the trade of downstream firms, giving them little leverage when it comes to enforcing standards.
The problem, then, can feel intractable. Yet there are things that can be done. Some schemes reward firms that invest in ethical sources of cotton. The Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) is one example. It certifies brands using a concept called “mass balance”. When a clothing firm places an order for finished garments, it asks for a certain weight of certified cotton to be associated with the order. BCI then ensures that a farmer somewhere in the world produces the same weight of cotton to its standards, which not only include criteria on labour but also on environmental impact. This credit is passed through the supply chain. Thus, although the clothing firm cannot guarantee that the actual material it uses has been produced without forced labour, it can say that it has been instrumental in producing the equivalent amount of ethical cotton.
Motivated governments also help hugely. Around the turn of this century, for example, Brazil decided to make a concerted effort to stamp out child labour. Laws were tightened, penalties increased and government inspectors sent out to farms. Such measures have “effectively priced child labour out of the market there”, reckons Genevieve LeBaron of the University of Sheffield.
Authorities in importing countries must play their part, too. Xinjiang produces more than 80% of China’s raw cotton, says Mr Hughes, and the country as a whole is the world’s second-largest producer after India. Last month the American government placed “Withhold Release Orders” on firms accused of using forced Uyghur labour, in effect making their cotton illegal to import. Since then China’s share of America’s cotton-textile market has dropped from 31% to 26%, says Mr Hughes. (Although China still has a huge domestic market.)
Reaping the harvest
Many point to Uzbekistan as a beacon of hope. Seventy per cent of the country’s arable land is used for cotton (often in rotation with wheat), according to the International Labour Organisation, a UN agency. Some 1.75m people—one in eight of the working-age population—work picking the crop. Many were once forced to do so. But following the death of President Karimov in 2016, the country decided to clean up its act. Under the pressure of sanctions, forced and child labour were criminalised. Smallholders were also nudged into co-operatives and foreign experts encouraged into the country.
One such was Dan Patterson, a Mississippian who in 2018 set up the Silverleafe farm cluster in Jizzakh, in the east of the country. Its co-operative now operates on 27,000 hectares. That has allowed Mr Patterson to mechanise. Mr Utayev, the schoolchild forced into the fields a decade ago, no longer toils with his hands. Instead of 100kg of hand-picked cotton, he operates a harvester that brings in more than 120,000kg of raw seed a day. Higher wages mean he can now take care of his family, he says. The crop from each plot on Silverleafe is radio-tagged and sent to the cluster’s own ginner. The co-operative is also building a textile mill. Both digitisation and vertical integration make it much easier to track each bale of cotton “from dirt to shirt” says Mr Patterson.
The ILO says Uzbekistan is on the way to eradicating forced and child labour. It reckons the number of people participating involuntarily in the harvest fell by 40% in 2019 compared with the previous year, to around 102,000. Others, like the Cotton Campaign, an umbrella group that includes brands, producers and NGOs, are more cautious. Allison Gill, its senior coordinator, thinks the number may sneak up again this year. As covid-19 hits the economy and depresses the price of cotton, she says, firefighters and even bankers are being mobilised on some plantations. For the moment, none of the group’s members favour lifting a boycott of Uzbek cotton. But if Uzbekistan can prove that eliminating forced labour is not only ethical, but also financially rewarding, other countries might eventually cotton on, too.",1
1721,"GO INTO ALL the world and preach the gospel to every creature, said Jesus. Which was an enthusiastic attitude, but not a very English one. The Church of England (C of E) has therefore tended to take a more muted approach to evangelism, winning converts less through bashing Bibles than through offering weddings, funerals, tea and biscuits in the church hall—and a reassuring sense that no one is going to do anything so American as talk too much about God. As Alan Bennett, a playwright and national treasure, once wrote, vicars don’t like to mention Him. They “keep him up their sleeve for as long as they can…They know it puts people off.”
Now the church is displaying evangelising glints that are, for many, alarming. A briefing paper on “Vision and Strategy”, delivered in July at its general synod, called for a church that is “younger and more diverse”—and much bigger. It aims to develop 3,000 “worshipping hubs” for children and young people, and has linked with a movement called “Myriad” (the word is Greek for 10,000), which aims to create 10,000 new churches and a million new worshippers in Britain within a decade.

Myriad does not mean “churches” in the spinsters-and-stained-glass sense. It is not promising 10,000 more pulpits or transepts or tea urns or vicars. It is not promising buildings at all. Myriad groups might meet in churches and work with priests—or they might meet independently, in houses or offices or parks. Followers talk freely about God. As a promotional video explains, this movement is “not just reserved for Bibles and a building”. These churches will be “predominantly” led by lay people—a Myriad boss referred to buildings and theological training as “key limiting factors” in church expansion.
The response has been bitter. Both the church and Myriad later apologised for the “limiting factors” comment, but the damage was done. The plans have been described as “Stalinist” and a “Great Leap Forward”. This, one vicar wrote, is a Christianity that is “randy for converts”. A Save the Parish group has been formed. Diarmaid MacCulloch, an emeritus professor of ecclesiastical history at Oxford University, sees in the scheme a certain “adolescent self-confidence”. Many are very angry. Mr MacCulloch says he is merely “mildly cross in an Anglican sort of way”. Which in Anglicanese means furious.
At times the debate can seem to be as much about old stones as about salvation. But it would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of architecture. The English aesthetic has been shaped by its churches. Thomas Gray elegised them; William Morris toured them; even Philip Larkin, a curmudgeonly atheist, was stilled by them. The English language has been shaped by the King James Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, books that created a land of linguistic milk and honey, and gave English such phrases as “thief in the night” and “ashes to ashes, dust to dust”. Neither mentions “worshipping hubs”.
Yet aesthetic appeal is not enough to put bums on seats. Turville in Buckinghamshire is a perfect English village. The road to it is rolling; its mists are mellow; its trees fruitful. Its church, St Mary’s (pictured), is so perfect that for years it was used to film “The Vicar of Dibley”, a BBC series. And yet on a Sunday morning in early autumn, this perfect church is perfectly empty. Turville has not had its own vicar for decades; instead it shares a priest and an associate priest with a group of five other churches. Services are held in each in rotation. This week it is the turn of nearby Hambleden, so St Mary’s is silent.
Step inside and it offers the usual things: matting, seats and the smell of old stone. “Welcome to our lovely Church”, says one sign; another laments a lost cat; a third advertises the Turville Bell Ringers (“Campanology is a very British tradition.”) There is a tin for the Church Flower Fund. What there are none of is people.
Church attendance in England has been falling for decades. In 1970, according to the church’s own figures, 1.5m went to a service every Sunday. In 2010 only 800,000 did. And attendance is still falling. The “key measures of attendance” fell by 15-20% between 2009 and 2019. Those who do attend are ageing. As the C of E itself points out, “An 80-year-old is eight times more likely to be in church than a 20-year-old!”
Something must be done. Exactly what is disputed. Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been criticised as too corporate, but Robert Ekelund, an emeritus professor of economics from Auburn University, Alabama, argues that when looking at religion, economics has its place. “When you get down to it, you’re selling a product,” he says. There are customers (the congregation), running costs (churches) and a product (salvation). If the product is not shifting, “these entrepreneurs have to figure out a way to differentiate their product” to maximise attendance.
The C of E is already diversifying. Just as many employers have embraced working from home, so the church has started to embrace praying from home: last year, Archbishop Welby delivered his Easter address from his kitchen. For God, as for Mammon, WFH offers benefits such as lower building costs and greater convenience. And God, like 3G, is everywhere. “If God exists,” says Mr Ekelund, “he exists in your restroom as well as your living room.” But traditionalists dislike this sort of casual approach. “A house is not a very convenient place to worship,” says Mr MacCulloch. “The telly gets in the way. You trip over the sofa.”
In St Mary’s, there is neither sofa nor telly. There is old stone, and there are King James Bibles and prayerbooks by the door. Be fruitful and multiply, their pages say, and ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In the air, there is silence. ■",1
1722,"IN A WARMING world it helps to stay cool. But doing so also threatens the planet. Most air conditioners use refrigerant gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Though these do not deplete Earth’s ozone layer in the way the chlorofluorocarbons they replaced back in the mid-1990s did, they are hundreds of times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide is. Less-potent greenhouse gases are now being phased in as refrigerants, but these are not without problems of their own. They can be expensive, and some are inflammable.
Researchers have long sought ways to produce cooling systems that do without these troublesome gases, but none has come close to being a direct replacement. A small Irish company, however, now claims to have come up with an answer. Exergyn, based in Dublin, has developed a new type of air conditioning which not only avoids HFCs, but also has the benefit of having few moving parts at its core.


Exergyn has been working secretly on the project for two years, in collaboration with a multinational company which it is not at liberty to name (though its partner is understood to be Carrier, a giant American manufacturer of heating and cooling equipment). The two firms are currently testing a 60kW version, which would have the capacity to cool 15-20 apartments. Exergyn has also begun talks with carmakers and aerospace companies about setting up similar joint-development projects. With cars, and some small aircraft, going electric, it is not just cooling the cabin that manufacturers are having to think about, but also cooling the batteries.
Squeeze me
Exergyn’s system uses a substance called a shape-memory alloy. SMAs, as they are known for short, are a group of materials with the unusual ability to return to a predetermined shape when heated. They are sometimes employed to make spectacle frames, and also in medical implants such as stents. Nitinol, the SMA chosen by Exergyn, is a blend of nickel and titanium.
All SMAs release heat when deformed by compression, and then absorb it when the pressure is released and they return to their original shape. But Exergyn’s version of nitinol displays this property to a remarkable degree. For its prototype, the company produced 4cm-square plates of the alloy, each pierced by holes intended to permit the passage of a heat-carrying liquid or gaseous medium. A range of benign substances can be employed in that role. The firm’s engineers have tested water, brine, glycol and air, all with success.
To build a refrigerator involves assembling these plates into stacks of 50 or more. Four stacks make a unit. The stacks are compressed in turn by hydraulic rams or electric actuators, in a sequence that works a bit like a four-stroke engine, explains Kevin O’Toole, Exergyn’s managing director. At any given moment, one stack is being compressed, one released, one preheated and one pre-cooled.

To cool a room involves passing two circuits of the heat-carrying fluid through this four-stack unit. Fluid in a “cold” circuit first travels through a heat exchanger in the room to be cooled down, absorbing warmth as it does so (see diagram). It is then directed by a series of valves and pumps into whichever core is undergoing its relaxation stroke. The relaxing nitinol absorbs the heat burden and the fluid is pumped back to the heat exchanger for the cycle to be repeated.
Heat thus accumulated is removed by the passage through the stack of fluid from the second, “hot”, circuit during the compression stroke. It is then dumped to the outside world via an external cooling unit. Using four stacks permits both the hot and the cold circuits to run continuously.
Tony Ennis, Exergyn’s chairman, reckons this method of cooling is not only more environmentally friendly than an HFC set-up, but will also be less expensive to buy and 30-40% cheaper to run. It will be lighter and smaller, too—an important requirement, not least because air-conditioning units often have to go up lift shafts to be installed. As for reliability, he says the prototype’s performance suggests the unit at its core could operate for more than 40 years without a problem.
When Dr O’Toole, an expert in memory materials, co-founded Exergyn in 2012, his intention was to use nitinol to create a system that would generate electricity from low-grade waste heat. But the challenges presented by HFCs persuaded him that air conditioning would be a quicker way to bring the technology to market. Development is still continuing, but products may be only a few years away.
His thoughts of a generator have not diminished, though. Nor has interest in other products that could use the technology. These include refrigerators, and also heat pumps to extract warmth from the ground for domestic heating. When time allows, Dr O’Toole and his colleagues hope to get to work on those ideas, too. ■",1
1723,"ON NOVEMBER 15th, at around seven in the morning Greenwich Mean Time, the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) was warned that there was some debris coming their way and that they ought to get into the two spacecraft that are currently moored there. That way, if anything went wrong, the four Americans, one Russian and one German currently crewing the ISS under the command of another Russian, Colonel Anton Shkaplerov, could make a quick getaway.
The source of this new debris was, at the time, unspecified. Now it is known to have been the remains of a Soviet-era spy satellite (known as Kosmos-1408) which had been used as the target in a test of a Russian anti-satellite weapon (ASAT).

According to America’s State Department this “reckless” act turned the two-tonne space hulk, which was orbiting at an altitude of about 500km, into more than 1,500 pieces of orbital debris trackable by radar (which may be down to a few centimetres in diameter) as well as many more smaller fragments. The cloud of shrapnel will, over time, spread out around the Earth. It will take a while for the orbits of all the hypersonic flotsam to be determined accurately enough to allow the ISS, China’s space station Tiangong, or anything else in low-Earth orbit to take evasive action.
There is no doubt that America is telling the truth. LeoLabs, a Silicon Valley startup which tracks satellites and space debris, confirmed that the satellite had been broken up. Russia had filed a warning that there would be a rocket launch from Plesetsk early that morning, and an anti-satellite weapon called Nudol has previously been tested from the same place (though not against a real target). Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at Harvard who keeps a database of satellites, tweeted a diagram showing that the time announced for the launch corresponded to a time when Kosmos-1408 would be in range of the missile.
Russia did not immediately confirm its responsibility. But its ASAT shot can be seen as fitting into a pattern of provocative actions over past weeks, most seriously a large build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border.
Experts condemned the action for further increasing the risks which space debris poses to the fast-growing number of satellites in vulnerable low-Earth orbits. The only event to have created more such fragments this century was a Chinese ASAT test carried out in 2007; it was responsible for about 3,000 of the 10,000 pieces of debris that America keeps an eye on for threats to the ISS. “That’s been our nemesis for an extended period of time,” Bill Gerstenmaier, once the head of NASA’s human spaceflight programme and now an executive at SpaceX, which ferries astronauts to the ISS, said at an industry event in Las Vegas. “It looks like now we have another one of these. This is not what we need to do.” America’s Space Command said the debris would pose a “significant risk” to the ISS, other human space missions and satellites for years, if not decades.
An Indian ASAT test in 2019 created considerably less debris, much of it too low to be a threat, but sparked further condemnation and renewed calls for such tests to be outlawed. Indeed, it is arguable that they already are: the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 requires countries to consult with each other before doing anything which might lead to “potentially harmful interference” with the activities of other countries. The space liability convention of 1972 could also apply to damage caused by the debris. But negotiations for a specific ban have yet to gain traction.
Even if it does not lead to a ban, though, this provocation will surely have international fallout. America, Canada, the European Space Agency and Japan—Russia’s partners in the ISS—cannot fail to respond. Meanwhile, on the station itself, the direct risks are not, for the moment, reckoned to be as bad as initially feared. Although some of the station remains sealed off, the astronauts and cosmonauts are back at work. What they all feel about the actions of their commander’s motherland has not yet been revealed.

1724,"ISAABDUL KARIM, aged 42, was the 11th person to die on Rikers Island, New York’s penal colony, this year. “He shouldn’t have there in the first place,” says Corey Stoughton of the Legal Aid Society, which provides free legal assistance to the poor. Mr Karim was sent to New York City’s biggest jail in August for a minor parole violation, despite his parole ending in June. He was held in the “intake unit” for ten days. He slept in his wheelchair and contracted covid-19 in a crowded space. The city’s department of correction said his death appeared to be natural. Since then, another inmate has died on Rikers.
The death toll from covid-19 continues to mount—our excess mortality tracker shows that daily deaths from the virus in America are greater than in all other rich countries combined. Prisons, which are often crowded, poorly ventilated and where the value placed on a life is low, have been hit particularly badly. Yet Rikers is something else. It stands out as an example of how some institutions are unreformable.

Jessica González-Rojas, a member of the state assembly, saw an inmate attempt suicide during a recent visit. She also saw uncollected rubbish and vermin and had to step over faeces and urine. The incarcerated told her of not being fed and of not receiving medical care. This is not exactly news: the island has been poorly managed for a very long time, says Jullian Harris-Calvin, of the Vera Institute of Justice, a think-tank. The city council voted in 2019 to close Rikers permanently by 2027. Bail reform meant fewer people were sent to the island. In April 2020, in part because of covid, fewer than 4,000 were incarcerated there, a drop from the 11,000 when Bill de Blasio, the mayor, took office in 2014.
Rikers seemed to be an ex-problem, and was even sometimes presented as a model of how the prison population could be managed down. More recently, numbers have increased again, to 6,000. At the same time correction officers have stopped going to work. New York City’s guards are permitted to take unlimited sick days, and as many as a third call in sick on a given day, forcing those on duty to work double and triple shifts. There are not enough guards to transport the incarcerated to court hearings, further extending stays at Rikers.
The misery at Rikers is not for lack of resources. The jail’s population fell by half between 2012 and 2020, yet its budget grew by 24%. It costs $438,000 to jail one person there for one year. Of this $379,216 goes to personnel costs; less than 5% goes to services like substance-abuse treatment. The average salary for guards, after five and half years on the job, is $92,073. In 2012, the ratio of inmates to officers in the city was 7:5. In 2020 it was 1.6 officers per inmate.
And yet, the island’s chief medical officer said he is seeing “a collapse in basic jail operations”. On September 29th a federal judge issued an emergency order to safeguard inmates’ wellbeing. Ms Harris-Calvin says the only way to fix Rikers is to “get people off that island”. New York’s politicians and prosecutors seem to agree. Manhattan’s DA suspended bail for non-violent crime. Kathy Hochul, New York’s new governor, issued an executive order allowing virtual court hearings on Rikers. She also signed a bill which will remove minor bail infractions, such as missing curfew, as reasons to be locked up. It does not take effect until next year, but 191 people were released immediately. Mr Karim was eligible, but he missed the cut-off date by a day. ■",1
1725,"Editor’s note: Sign up and listen to Checks and Balance, our weekly newsletter and podcast on American politics, and explore our presidential election forecast
ON MAY 15TH the American government announced a startling escalation in its campaign against Huawei, a Chinese company which is the largest provider of telecoms equipment in the world. American politicians and officials have long expressed concerns that mobile networks which rely on Huawei could allow snooping and sabotage by China. In May 2019, citing alleged violations of sanctions against Iran—charges Huawei denies—America used powers designed to stop the transfer of military technology to bar the company from receiving American components vital to the systems it sells.
Those measures had loopholes: suppliers could keep on selling Huawei many components as long as they were made in facilities outside America. So this year America targeted the whole supply chain: as of September it will be seeking to stop companies around the world from using software or hardware that originally comes from America to manufacture components based on Huawei’s designs.

The move was a serious blow to the company. It may well have brought a sigh of relief in Britain. In January Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, had approved a substantial if clearly demarcated role for Huawei in Britain’s 5G telecoms infrastructure. Its promise of a faster, more commodious type of mobile broadband that allows completely new internet applications and might prove necessary for self-driving cars has made 5G a touchstone for seers scrying the next big thing and for politicians who pay heed to them. Infrastructure spending stamped with such a hallmark of futurity is right up Mr Johnson’s alley. If Britain’s existing procedures for overseeing Huawei’s role in telecoms infrastructure were applied, the government argued at the time, Huawei’s equipment could be used in “non core” parts of the network, and Britain could get its 5G systems up and running considerably sooner, and cheaper, than would otherwise be possible.
This decision was unpopular both with the White House and with a significant faction within Mr Johnson’s Conservative Party, with the opposition happily backing the rebels. Dismay over China’s imposition of new security laws on Hong Kong, in breach of the agreement under which the territory was handed back to it, heightened feelings further. America’s new salvo of sanctions provided a plausible reason for changing course. The inevitable dislocation to Huawei’s supply chains, the government said, would make relying on the company riskier. The new measures also meant that the vaunted system whereby British spooks vetted Huawei equipment would no longer be able to do its job: it would itself fall foul of the American sanctions.
On July 14th the government said it will ban mobile-network operators in Britain from buying Huawei equipment for their 5G networks, and told them to remove equipment already installed by 2027. Well before that—by the time of the next election, in 2024—the country would be on an “irreversible path” to expunging the Chinese firm from its networks, said Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary.
Mr Trump immediately took credit for having “convinced many countries” not to use Huawei. While some have been on board for a while—Australia banned Huawei 5G equipment in 2018—others have moved more recently. In June telecoms companies in Canada and Singapore announced plans for 5G networks built around equipment provided by Huawei’s main rivals, Ericsson, a Swedish firm, and Nokia, a Finnish one (see chart 1). In both cases Huawei had previously been a possible provider. On July 6th the head of the French cyber-security agency advised network operators which do not currently use Huawei not to plump for it in future.

Now all eyes are on Germany, which has said it will decide on the matter in the autumn. If it follows America’s urging and Britain’s example then the rest of the EU will probably go the same way, and a significant corner will have been turned. Western communications systems will be a bit less insecure. America will have used its sovereign might to humble one of China’s national champions, and China will doubtless be responding. The technophilic imperative that has made 5G a totem of the fully networked future will have had its momentum checked, at least a little, by a mixture of countries not wanting to upset America and being willing to upset a China they find increasingly disturbing.
The last domino
Perhaps most profoundly, such a change may leave behind it a world where governments are less willing to depend on companies from countries with divergent interests to supply capacities they deem strategic. “At the heart of this is a dilemma which the West has not faced before: how to cope with a technology superpower whose values are fundamentally opposed to our own,” in the words of Robert Hannigan, a former boss of GCHQ, the British signals-intelligence agency.
Germany’s decision is not a done deal. Deutsche Telekom (DT), a 32%-state-owned company, is the country’s largest mobile provider and already relies heavily on Huawei equipment. It has lobbied strongly against any action that would make it harder for it to roll out 5G. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, often eager to defend the interests of German industry, has backed the firm. Angela Merkel, the chancellor, has not wanted any trouble with China (see article).
Yet, like the British Conservatives, Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats have split on the issue. As Norbert Röttgen, a conservative member of parliament and one of the leaders of the anti-Huawei faction, has put it, “We cannot trust the Chinese state and the Chinese Communist Party with our 5G network.” The Social Democrats, who are part of the governing grand coalition, and the opposition Greens are also opposed to letting Huawei play. “If there were a vote in parliament today, Huawei would lose,” says Thorsten Benner of Global Public Policy Institute, a think-tank based in Berlin.
Mrs Merkel, who will make the final decision, has so far been circumspect. She says she does not want to exclude a company on the basis of its nationality and that any firm that complies with certain security standards should be allowed to sell its wares in Germany. In late 2019 China’s ambassador in Berlin threatened retaliation against German companies should the government exclude Huawei from its 5G plans, and insiders say it is a threat the chancellor takes seriously. Meanwhile, DT is busily creating the aura of a done deal. It intends to provide basic 5G services to 40m Germans by the end of this month using equipment from both Huawei and Ericsson, though users will see little benefit at this stage. The company has also decided to intensify its co-operation with the Chinese firm in cloud computing and other areas.
There are many reasons for Europeans to be uncomfortable siding with America. Having missed the boat on the rise of consumer tech—Europe still bemoans the lack of the home-grown Google or Amazon—European politicians fear falling further behind if they delay 5G and the various wonders it is held to enable, such as an “internet of things”. Mobile-network operators play up these fears, with an eye to either keeping their ties to Huawei or receiving some form of compensation if it were to be proscribed. By combining direct costs with estimates of lost GDP they argue that ditching Huawei will cost the continent tens of billions of euros.
Regulators and independent observers are not convinced. Mr Dowden, admittedly an interested party, put the impact of Britain’s volte-face at two or three years’ delay and £2bn or so. A study by Strand Consult, a research outfit, thinks that the cost of eschewing Huawei would be quite modest for Europe as a whole, given that its ageing 4G kit would soon have to be replaced anyway. It estimates a total of around $3.5bn, no more than $7 per mobile customer.

That said, not all European mobile-phone customers will get the same deal. The EU has failed to create a single digital market; an operator in Poland cannot sell services to a customer in Sweden in the same way New York-based Verizon sells to Californians. So where China and America have three network operators each, Europe has more than 100 (see chart 2). In some markets, such as Belgium, Germany and Poland, the local companies are highly reliant on Huawei; companies in Finland, Ireland and Spain would face much lower costs if forced to make the switch.
Shrunken titans
The multiplicity of operators is a function of EU policy. Denied a continent-wide framework that would let them compete in far-off markets, telecoms companies are also kept from consolidating at home; the EU commission likes there to be four providers in each market. The resultant competition provides a stonking deal for customers. In Europe the average revenue per mobile-phone user is less than €15 ($17) a month. The average American user pays more than twice that. Rewheel, a data company, says that the cheapest unlimited-data plan in America costs €74 a month. In Germany the figure is €40, in Britain €22.
For network operators this fierce level of competition, coupled with the high costs of comparatively small, unconsolidated markets, constitutes a serious drag. Some carriers, including DT and Vodafone, a British operator, have returns on capital lower than their costs of capital: not the kind of business model that will find willing shareholders in the long term. Emmet Kelly of Morgan Stanley, a bank, points out that the market capitalisation of Europe’s major operators has shrunk from over €1trn in June 2000 to €258bn this June—a loss of 81% in real terms. Telefónica of Spain and Orange in France, once giants, are now not much more than minnows.
Mobile-network operators have long complained to the commission that the thin margins which scare away investors leave them unable to splash out on upgrades such as 5G, and that as a result Europe will fall behind its peers. China is investing massively in 5G and America is intent on keeping up; Mr Trump has called 5G “a race America must win”. The GSMA, which represents mobile-network operators, says that by 2025 half of all mobile users in America and the richer bits of Asia (including China) will be on 5G, compared with just one-third of Europeans.
In the past, Brussels has turned a deaf ear to such griping. The EU’s download speeds have remained comparable to those in America; the price of data services has fallen even faster than usage has grown: what’s the problem? But it is possible that a ban on Huawei could catalyse the “new deal” on regulation that the operators crave. Governments which realise that their actions are delaying 5G and driving up its costs might see their way to easing merger restrictions. The spectrum needed for mobile services, which in Europe is often sold through auctions designed to maximise revenue, might be given away instead, as happens in China and Japan. The lobbyists’ list is long. The industry takes courage from last year’s appointment of Thierry Breton, who was once boss of France Télécom (now Orange), as commissioner for the internal market.
Pending such a deal things might just slow down. There is already agreement among analysts that despite the hoopla 5G networks will be rolled out more slowly than the previous 4G ones were. This year’s 5G-spectrum auctions in France, Spain and Poland have been delayed by the covid-19 pandemic, which may quietly suit some operators. The equipment needed for 5G is only going to get cheaper and more reliable, as all chip-based kit does.

To the extent that there is indeed a race, it will not necessarily be won by those who get off to the fastest start. The services on offer so far are mostly just a faster version of 4G, and sometimes in practice the speed is not all that great. The most revolutionary aspect of 5G technology—the way in which it allows the workings of a network to be reconfigured through software and thus tailored to specific needs—will need years to come into its own. Profitable business models will take time to emerge.
A continent of its own
A slower roll-out might also ease pressure on Ericsson and Nokia. The two Nordic companies will plainly benefit from countries turning away from Huawei, even if, as looks likely, they lose sales in China. They are precisely the kinds of industrial champion Europe is trying to promote these days, but there are worries about whether they can seize the moment. They now enjoy a duopoly in America (for a while there was talk of an American company taking a stake in one of them, but this idea seems to have been put aside). Some operators question whether, given those commitments, they can meet the needs of a Huawei-free full-speed-ahead Europe too. There is also the awkward fact that, supply chains for electronics being as they are, using European system integrators still means that much of the equipment comes from China.
The difficulties of having only a few suppliers will subside in time. Samsung of South Korea, a country very committed to 5G, is a growing presence. On July 15th Reliance Industries, an Indian conglomerate, announced that its Jio network, which uses a Samsung 4G network, will be building its own 5G infrastructure and selling it to others. Jio is likely to follow in the steps of some other carriers, most notably Rakuten Mobile in Japan, which are betting on networks based on advanced software, off-the-shelf hardware and open standards, thus side-stepping the need for systems integrators like Ericsson, Huawei or Nokia. Widespread implementations are still several years away, though.
Chinese reprisals against countries chucking out Huawei can be expected to come around a great deal sooner. China buys a lot from Europe, with Germany its largest trading partner in the bloc. It also invests quite heavily in the continent, having been courted by many of its leaders. Some of that may now be at risk. On the day of Britain’s U-turn the Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, tweeted that it was “disappointing and wrong”. China is painting the decision as a groundless capitulation to anti-Chinese pressure from America, and saying it calls into question the safety of Chinese investments in Britain, which are many and various.
But Europe does not see China exclusively through a commercial lens. Last year EU leaders designated it a “systemic rival”. The EU has since been working to limit Chinese state-backed groups’ operations in Europe. Its treatment of the Uighur minority, its reluctance to see word of covid-19 spread to the world and its move on Hong Kong have all raised hackles.
That does not mean Germany, or Europe as a whole, will necessarily ditch Huawei. Europe’s China links matter, and it does not like being pushed around by America. Policymakers on the continent have long fumed at the financial muscle that allows American administrations to punish European firms it sees as miscreants by squeezing the banks those firms deal with. But that does not mean it wants its internet infrastructure under the control of a third power that might, in time, aspire to use that control against it. A continental security official points out the underlying irony: “America wants to prevent China being able to do what America currently does to the rest of the world by controlling the financial system.”
The irony, though, does not invalidate the argument. Europe has sometimes acted to maintain its technological autonomy with respect to America in areas where national-security needs and civil infrastructure overlap, such as satellite launchers and navigation systems. In an interview with The Economist last November Emmanuel Macron, the French president, complained about European reliance on American tech platforms. At the same time he called development of 5G “a sovereign matter” and went on to say that “Some elements [of the 5G network] must only be European.” That did not in itself rule out any role for Huawei. But subsequent developments have pushed the continent further in that direction. American pressure may end up seeing Europe take a more assertive view of its “digital sovereignty”.■

1726,"SINCE THE Ming dynasty, Chinese who are oppressed by local officials have sighed, by way of explanation: “The heavens are high, and the emperor far away.” An earthier variant runs: “With no tiger in the mountains, the monkeys are in charge.” Today’s Communist Party bosses have no time for such cynicism. They want the masses to believe that, even in the remotest villages, their welfare is the concern of an all-knowing leader, Xi Jinping, served by officials striving to follow his stern but wise example.
Inspiring the public is not the party’s only concern. A central task of the Xi era is to transform morale among the country’s 90m party members, including millions of bureaucrats. Officials are told that they serve a rising China, whose growing strength is the awe of the world. Since Mr Xi became supreme leader in 2012, party membership has been presented as something close to a secular priesthood, in which a select few selflessly serve the masses. Government ministries in Beijing play their part in spreading the faith. Their high-flying staff—almost always party members—compete for the career-enhancing honour of a stint as grassroots officials in impoverished villages and towns.

Central government departments have sponsored a growing number of poor counties around the country since 1992, when the State Council first urged ministries to pair up with left-behind places. Chaguan recently spent four days in Malipo, a remote county of conical, cloud-topped hills, terraced fields and fruit orchards in the southern province of Yunnan, on the border with Vietnam. Malipo has been sponsored for 29 years by the foreign ministry, which organised (but did not pay for) this reporter’s visit with a delegation of officials from the national and provincial governments. The ministry uses its connections to help the county, which was declared free of extreme poverty in 2019 and last year recorded an average income per person of 11,984 yuan ($1,874). Foreign embassies and businesses have donated school buildings, books and scholarships. On October 17th America’s National Basketball Association donated a new basketball court to a middle school in Malipo (the NBA is still trying to mend fences in China after a coach signalled support for Hong Kong’s democrats, triggering nationalist fury). “Of course this is thanks to the foreign ministry,” said the headmaster, as teenage pupils intently copied the moves of visiting NBA coaches, or shyly asked them for autographs. The nearest city, Wenshan, used to be hours away along winding roads. A new motorway opened on October 1st, following lobbying by the foreign ministry. A diplomatic charity raised funds to build clean water systems for villagers who previously fetched water by hand.
Dozens of younger diplomats have done stints as volunteer teachers in primary schools in villages. More importantly, the ministry sends a mid-ranking official to serve for a year or two as Malipo’s deputy county chief. Duties include conducting foreign policy, for officials in Yunnan must talk to Vietnamese counterparts about exchanges of students or travel permits for ethnic minorities whose lands straddle the frontier. Both sides regularly clear landmines from border areas—a lethal legacy of China’s brief invasion of Vietnam in 1979, which still costs locals limbs.
Domestic tasks also loom. The ministry’s current man in Malipo, Chen Minghuang, served in Japan for several years. In addition to seeking inward investments for the county, he is, among other things, responsible for water quality in several rivers. Asked why a non-specialist can be entrusted with such work, a local official praises foreign-ministry volunteers for their promotional skills. Diplomats may not know how to raise a pig, but they can spot what makes a pig from Malipo marketable, she enthuses.
Chaguan ventures at one point that an Oxbridge-educated British diplomat may receive a thin welcome if sent to help run a county in rural Scotland, without any experience in local government. China is not so hung up about elitism, it turns out. The foreign ministry sends “the best of the best”, responds an official from Beijing. It sends party members, because they are expected to be moral exemplars. “Compared with the masses, party members represent more progressive and developed forces. That’s how they can help the people,” says the visitor from Beijing. A years-long anti-corruption drive has created a culture of honesty among officials of all ranks, she adds. At an agricultural training base, local officials offer a broad defence of rule by technocrats. Farmers may not understand which crops will grow well, and which will make money, says a county official. The role of experts is to guide them to harness market forces.
Heaven near at hand, and the emperor close by
Some may dismiss all this as a mere propaganda tour. Certainly, the delegation was only taken to handsomely restored villages and model farms, and greeted by folk dancers at every turn. It would take many days of independent reporting to assess the foreign ministry’s help, not to mention its sustainability. Malipo is just one of 88 counties in Yunnan formerly ranked as extremely poor.
But a visit to Malipo is a window on something else important. Lots of officials are increasingly proud of the system they serve, especially as they survey what they regard as chaos in the West. More than before they talk openly about the party’s role in that system. As Mr Chen puts it, millions of party members are working towards the same goals, guided by strong leaders. He describes the changing views of Malipo’s masses as they see their roads being paved, and houses and schools restored. “The central government always enjoyed a high status in people’s minds. Now local government’s reputation has also risen,” Mr Chen says.
Mr Xi’s China remains a big country with complex problems, run by men who see a world full of hostile forces. But the domestic confidence of its ruling party is unmistakable. Outsiders miss that tigerish swagger at their peril. ■",1
1727,"BRITAIN, PROCLAIMED Boris Johnson, the prime minister, is a country in transition, away from “the same old broken model” to a “high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity” economy. On October 6th, addressing the party faithful gathered in Manchester for the Conservatives’ annual conference, he promised that workers would soon begin to feel better off. Wages are indeed rising. But so too are prices. Moreover, payroll taxes are due to rise in the spring. And on the same day as Mr Johnson’s speech the main working-age benefit, universal credit, was cut by £20 ($27.10) a week. Britons look set to experience a tight squeeze on disposable incomes in the months ahead.

An analysis by The Economist based on government forecasts that predate some of these changes suggests that total household income, after tax and corrected for inflation, will fall in both 2022 and 2023 (see chart). After two years in which household incomes fell because of the pandemic and Brexit, the result will be the longest decline since the mid-1970s.

First to feel the squeeze will be the 5.5m low-income households in receipt of universal credit, which is both an out-of-work benefit and a supplement to the earnings of the low-paid. The loss of £1,040 a year is the biggest single cut to social security since the foundation of the modern welfare state. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity, estimates that more than 500,000 people, of whom 200,000 are children, will fall into poverty. More than a third of those affected are in work.
The cut to universal credit, which unwinds a temporary increase at the beginning of the pandemic, at least featured in projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an official forecaster, when it last ran the numbers for household income in March. Since then the government has announced a 1.25% rise in both employer and employee payroll taxes, to take effect next April, in order to pay for social care and help clear a post-pandemic health-care backlog. And the OBR, like the Bank of England, underestimated how quickly inflation would increase as the economy recovered.
Mr Johnson points to rising wages as evidence that voters will soon feel better off despite rising prices. And he has sought to draw a political dividing line with the Labour Party over the issue of immigration. In his speech he brushed aside concerns about stretched supply chains that have seen petrol pumps run dry and supermarkets struggle to fill shelves in recent weeks. This is part of a remarkable pivot: having previously said that staff shortages were nothing to do with Brexit, he now argues that these shortages are in fact among Brexit’s main benefits. The logic is that without an endless supply of European immigrants, firms will be forced to raise wages and improve working conditions in order to attract British workers.
Such claims helped the prime minister win good headlines from his party’s conference. But in the longer term he may come to regret making higher living standards so central a measure of his success. As he emphasised in conference-season interviews, recent data on real wages has indeed been strong. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), real wages grew by 5.1% in the year to July. Over the late spring and early summer, the annual rate of growth in real weekly earnings was the highest in two decades.
But the numbers require careful handling and the ONS has plastered its recent releases with more than the usual number of caveats. At the moment, annual figures are artificially boosted by “base effects” because current readings are being compared with those from mid-2020, when the economic hit from the pandemic was at its worst. This is compounded by a “compositional effect”: low-paid workers were the most likely to lose their jobs during the recession, meaning that average wages for those still in work increased automatically, even without anyone being paid more. Underlying growth, therefore, is surely weaker than the headline measures. Data from Indeed, an online-recruitment company, show that wages on advertisements posted on its website rose by an average of just 0.8% between February and July, not accounting for inflation.
In fact, the best period for real wages may already be past. The annual rate of inflation was 3% in August, up from 2.1% in July. Analysts now expect an annual pace of over 4% by the end of autumn, driven by surging energy prices and disrupted supply chains. Higher prices will eat into real wage growth. Meanwhile, underlying wage growth may also be set to slow. The government furlough scheme, which covered part or all of the wages of workers temporarily sent home, closed last month. More than a million people were still on the scheme at the start of September, and many will now be seeking work. Increased slack in the jobs market should restrain pay growth in the months ahead.
Despite rising energy bills, empty petrol stations and supermarket shortages, the Conservatives have enjoyed an upbeat party conference. They have sought to turn a crisis into an opportunity by recasting a shortage of drivers for heavy-goods vehicles as an omen of good things to come for all workers. For the moment, this seems to be working, with the government maintaining a decent lead in the polls. But the opposition Labour Party is beginning to spy an opportunity. One shadow cabinet member riffed off Mr Johnson’s former career as a journalist, dubbing his approach as “government by newspaper column”. The prime minister may have marshalled the facts to present a plausible story. But as households feel the squeeze, they may start to doubt its conclusion. ■",1
1728,"THE ASSESSMENT of the science of climate change released by the IPCC in August looked at various future-emission scenarios. In every one the best estimate for the difference in temperature between the mid-19th and the mid-21st centuries was above 1.5°C. Only two scenarios, both with close to net-zero emissions by mid-century and net-negative ones thereafter, had best estimates lower than 2°C for the final two decades of the century.
What the report did not say was how the world would pay for the net-negative decades needed to provide a climate both stable and within the Paris temperature limits. In a net-zero economy, it is possible to imagine “polluter-pays” schemes under which emitters pay for the negative emissions that cancel out their activity. They might conceivably evolve from emission-trading schemes like the EU’s. But once you need to remove more CO2 than is being put in an insufficient number of polluters makes things trickier.

Some companies, including Microsoft and Ikea, plan to go net-negative at their own expense. Microsoft aims to remove from the atmosphere an amount of carbon equivalent to all the emissions it has been responsible for over its corporate life. But it is hardly likely that all big emitters will volunteer to behave so admirably.
An imaginative group of academics writing in the journal Nature recently described a polluter-pays scheme which might force companies to become at least somewhat carbon-negative. Well before net zero is reached, emissions would start to attract a “carbon-removal obligation” requiring later removal. To incentivise companies to act promptly, the obligations would grow over time: leave a tonne up in the air long enough and you would have to pull two tonnes out. It is an ingenious idea. But it would do nothing to remove emissions made before the scheme began.
It is hard to imagine negative emissions on a scale large enough to make up for overshooting the carbon budget being paid for by anyone except governments. Any agreement on how that should be done would surely reflect some version of “common but differentiated responsibilities”: countries disproportionately responsible for using up the carbon budget in the first place would be asked to take on most of the burden of dealing with the overshoot.In a world where rich countries had already invested heavily in helping poorer ones reduce emissions, that added expense might be borne willingly. But it is also possible that it would not.
What is more, in a world where some, presumably richer, countries have enough negative-emissions capability to get to net zero and beyond, other countries—either poorer or just more bloody-minded—might abandon further emissions reduction, gambling that the countries with negative-emissions capability would rather increase their use of that capability than see the CO2 level continue to rise.
They might win that gamble; they might not. It is all too easy to imagine a world where most people in poor countries continue to think that climate change is not their fault and someone else should sort it out, while people in richer countries don’t want to shoulder the full burden of doing so. A stand-off develops in which the overshoot is never sucked down and temperatures eventually stabilise at a level considerably higher than 2°C over pre-industrial levels—if they stabilise at all.
The alternative to this game of chicken would be to meet the Paris temperature limits through other means. Solar geoengineering is an approach to the climate that concentrates not on making it easier for the Earth to cool itself, as removing carbon dioxide does, but stopping it from warming so much in the first place. The way of doing this which has been studied in most detail, albeit almost entirely in models, is to create a thin layer of reflective particles in the stratosphere that reflects sunlight back into space before it warms the surface. Studies suggest that, for good or ill, such a scheme could be implemented by a relatively small fleet of purpose-built aircraft.
These ideas have, for understandable reasons, long been marginalised in policy circles. They reek of hubris and the potential for unintended consequences. And if, by providing another way of limiting temperature rises, they reduce the perceived urgency of curbing emissions, they might weaken or even stall the commitment to emissions reduction.
That would be disastrous. Though it has the opposite effect on temperature, the cooling offered by solar geoengineering is not, in physical terms, an exact counter of the warming created by greenhouse gases. One difference is seen in the world’s hydrological cycle; solar geoengineering tends to suppress precipitation. The more the world came to rely on it, the more this and other mismatches would become harmful. This, alongside the fact that it does nothing about ocean acidification, is a strong part of the reason why researchers looking seriously at solar geoengineering never advocate using it instead of mitigation. Those not turned off by it completely see it as a possible complement to mitigation, not as an alternative.
In this it is very like negative emissions—one reason they are sometimes called “carbon geoengineering”. The way a solar-geoengineering capability might reduce the incentive to continue with emissions reduction is similar to the way existing negative-emissions capacity might work. And in both cases that reduced ambition might well come about even if the proposed geoengineering did not.
A crucial difference between the two, though, is the cost of instigating them. It seems likely that putting a veil into the atmosphere would be comparatively cheap (in the tens of billions of dollars a year, perhaps even less), though the externalities not included in the cost might be high. Another difference is that negative emissions would affect the climate in more or less the same way whoever undertook them; the world’s carbon-dioxide level is what it is. Different sorts of solar geoengineering, though, would have distinctly different regional effects.
Design for living
If the world as a whole were able to design a solar-geoengineering scheme, studies suggest it could come up with one that provided climate benefits to almost everyone and serious problems to almost nobody. A plausible way to use such an optimal scheme might be to offset the temperature rise caused by overshooting the carbon budget. That would provide a sort of breathing space to allow the excess CO2 to be drawn down more slowly and cheaply than would be necessary if its warming effects were actually being felt. A comparatively gentle acceleration of chemical weathering, rather than a huge investment in DAC or other schemes, might prove sufficient. As those measures slowly wore the overshoot down the solar geoengineering could be reduced. When the CO2 level was low enough it would be phased out completely, leaving behind a stable climate.
But the world as a whole might not get to choose the wisest path. A small group of countries, or even a single large one, could undertake a solar-geoengineering scheme unilaterally. Such a club would be likely to optimise its own interests rather than those of the world. It might, for example, choose to cool some places to a degree that, because of geoengineering’s effects on the water cycle, risked desiccating others. That might lead to resentment, rancour or reprisals.
Nor would any given set of solar geoengineers be sure to get things their own way. The late Marty Weitzman, a pioneering economist of climate change, pointed out that though emission reductions (and by implication negative emissions), because of their cost, have a free-rider problem, solar geoengineering, because it looks cheap, has a “free-driver” problem. Where free-rider problems lead to underprovision (countries are unwilling to commit to cutting emissions when others do not, as 26 years of COPs has made clear) free-driver problems may lead to overprovision. Solar geoengineering looks cheap enough that countries wanting more of it can provide it unilaterally, whatever others think.
This implies that, other things being equal, the level of solar geoengineering would be a trade-off between the amount that the most enthusiastic countries wanted and the amount that the least enthusiastic would endure before taking decisive action, quite possibly through force of arms. Another game of chicken.
The difficulties involved in negative emissions and solar geoengineering are very different, and the second looks much more unfamiliar and threatening than the first. But in both cases the problem is fundamentally similar—and closely related to the contradiction between global temperature goals and national emissions-reduction commitments at the heart of the Paris agreement. The world has needs which can be agreed on; but the decisions necessary to meet those needs are made by countries which differ in their interests, their capabilities and the amount of persuasion they can exert or resist. The responsibilities may be common; the differentiation is endless.
Glasgow will show the degree to which national governments are able to deliver progress in terms of the increased ambition of their NDCs, the realisation of long-promised transfers of money from north to south, and workable rules for the parts of the Paris agreement which remain sketchy. The progress is unlikely to be spectacular, reinforcing the point that managing global issues like the climate purely through national lenses is impractical. But coming up with an alternative in which individual countries will allow the interests of others to be placed above their own is implausible. And if the world is to stabilise the climate at an acceptable level, something will have to give.
The climate crisis was brought about as part of the creation of a new world economy. Coming through it successfully may well require a new world politics. Failing to do so will be calamitous in terms of politics and economics alike.■

ON SEPTEMBER 2ND 1859 C.F. Herbert, prospecting for gold in south-eastern Australia, saw something sublime in the evening sky. “A scene of almost unspeakable beauty presented itself, lights of every imaginable colour were issuing from the southern heavens,” he would later recall. “The rationalist and pantheist saw nature in her most exquisite robes. The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and final dissolution.”
Those who saw cataclysm in the auroral display were not exactly wrong: just ahead of their time. The Carrington event, as the geomagnetic storm Herbert observed came to be known, was the result of 100m tonnes of charged particles thrown off by the Sun a few hours earlier slamming into Earth’s magnetosphere, a protective magnetic sheath generated by currents in the planet’s liquid core. The electromagnetic effects of the onslaught did not just produce a truly spectacular display of the Southern Lights (and the Northern ones, too, visible as far south as Colombia). They induced powerful currents in any electrical conductors to hand. Some telegraph networks took on a life of their own, no longer needing batteries to generate signals.

Such effects mattered little 20 years before the advent of the light bulb. In today’s ubiquitously, fundamentally and increasingly electrified world a “coronal mass ejection” (CME) as large as that of the Carrington event could cause all kinds of chaos. Induced currents would topple electrical grids. Satellites would have their circuitry fried or be dragged from the sky as the outer atmosphere, bloated by the storm’s energy, rose up towards them.
How bad the effects of an off-the-charts CME might prove is up for debate. Some say a really big storm would knock the power out in various places for a few hours, as a moderate one did in Quebec in 1989. Others predict something little short of the end of days. That the world will some day find out who is right, though, is beyond debate. Solar physicists put the odds of a Carrington-level geomagnetic storm some time in the next ten years at around one in ten. Eventually one will come.
Geomagnetic storms are one of a small set of events found in the historical and geological record that present plausible threats of catastrophe. Pandemics are another, giant volcanic eruptions a third. Seeing how well—or how poorly—countries are currently coping with the only one of these catastrophes of which they have prior experience raises the question of how they might cope with the others.
Technology plays a crucial role in the hazards such events generate. It can bring surcease, as a vaccine might for a pandemic. It can bring vulnerability, as electric grids have when it comes to geomagnetic storms. And it can also bring forth new risks of its own. The most obvious are the technologies of internal combustion and nuclear weaponry, which made possible catastrophic global warming and war on an unprecedented, environment-shattering scale. It is possible that further techno-disasters may lie ahead—and that they may be the most serious of all, putting the whole human future in jeopardy.
In a recent book, “The Precipice”, Toby Ord of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University defines an existential risk as one that “threatens the destruction of humanity’s long-term potential”. Some natural disasters could qualify. An impact like that of the 10km asteroid which ushered out the dinosaurs 66m years ago is one example. A burst of planet-scouring gamma rays from a nearby “hypernova” might be another. A volcanic “super-eruption” like the one at Yellowstone which covered half the continental United States with ash 630,000 years ago would probably not extinguish the human race; but it could easily bring civilisation to an end. Happily, though, such events are very rare. The very fact that humans have made it through hundreds of thousands of years of history and prehistory with their long-term potential intact argues that natural events which would end it all are not common.
Do you feel lucky, punk?
For already existing technologically mediated risks, such as those of nuclear war and climate collapse, there is no such reassuring record to point to, and Mr Ord duly rates them as having a higher chance of rising to the existential threat level. Higher still, he thinks, is the risk from technologies yet to come: advanced bioweapons which, unlike the opportunistic products of natural selection, are designed to be as devastating as possible; or artificial intelligences which, intentionally or incidentally, change the world in ways fundamentally inimical to their creators’ interests.
No one can calculate such risks, but it would be foolish to set them at exactly zero. Mr Ord reckons almost anyone looking at the century to come would have to concede “at least a one in 1,000 risk” of something like a runaway AI either completely eradicating humanity or permanently crippling its potential. His carefully reasoned, if clearly contestable, best guesses lead him to conclude that, taking all the risks he cites into account, the chances of humankind losing its future through such misadventure in the next 100 years stands at one in six. The roll of a single die; one spin of the revolver chamber.
Mr Ord is part of a movement which takes such gambles seriously in part because it sees the stakes as phenomenally high. Academics who worry about existential risk—the trend began, in its modern form, when Nick Bostrom, a Swedish philosopher, founded the Future of Humanity Institute in 2005—frequently apply a time-agnosticversion of utilitarianism which sees “humanity’s long-term potential” as something far grander than the lives of the billions on Earth today: trillions and trillions of happy lives of equal worth lived over countless millennia to come. By this logic actions which go even a minuscule way towards safeguarding that potential are precious beyond price. Mr Ord, one of the founders of the “effective altruism” movement, which advocates behaviour rooted in strongly evidence-based utilitarianism, sees a concern with existential risk as part of the same project.
Risks that are merely catastrophic, not existential, do not tend to be the subject of such philosophical rumination. They are more amenable to the sort of calculations found in the practice of politics and power. Take the risk of a nuclear attack. According to Ron Suskind, a reporter, in November 2001 Dick Cheney noted that America needed new ways to confront “low-probability, high-impact” events. “If there’s a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon,” the vice-president said, “we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response”. Such responses included new wars, new government agencies (the Department of Homeland Security) and new executive powers, including warrantless surveillance.
If every perceived 1% risk were met with such vigour the world would be a very different place—and not necessarily a safer one. But it is striking that some risks of similar magnitude are barely thought about at all. Imagine Mr Cheney was considering the possibility of losing a city over a 20-year period. What else puts a city’s worth of people and capital at a 1% risk every few decades? The sort of catastrophic risks that crop up every millennium or so, threatening millions of lives and cost trillions. Perhaps they should be treated equally seriously. As Rumtin Sepasspour of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University puts it: “Governments need to think about security as just one category of risk.”
Carrington events are a good example. The most devastating effect of a really large CME would probably be on the transformers in electrical grids: gigantic, purpose-built machines that step voltage down between the long-range transmission grid and the distribution grid which runs lower-voltage power into homes, businesses and hospitals.
Strong enough induced currents could damage some of these transformers beyond repair. Because it typically takes between six and 12 months to get a replacement transformer made—and only a few countries have the industrial capacity to make them—that could leave grids crippled for some time. “If you simultaneously lose the ability to pump water, to pump fuel, to communicate, lose eyes in the sky, you pretty quickly get into territory that’s never really been explored before,” says Dan Baker, the director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Stockpiling backup transformers could help mitigate some of those problems. But large transformers are not commodity items. “They don’t have a big warehouse holding these things ready to roll out,” says Mr Baker. Redundant local supplies, such as backup generators, would also help. Mr Baker is not sure, though, that enough is being invested in them.
Sudden impact
In general, scientists and policy wonks who think about these things suspect that grid operators are not as prepared as they should be for a Carrington level storm. But some see progress. William Murtagh, who works at the Space Weather Prediction Centre in Boulder, says American policy on space weather has come a long way, to the point where there are now bipartisan bills going through Congress and that grid operators are being required to certify the excess voltages their systems can cope with.
America does, at least, have a solid plan: the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, published in March 2019. It also has an early warning system. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the space-weather centre in Boulder, also runs a satellite called DSCOVR. Rather than orbit the Earth, DSCOVR circles a point on a line between the Earth and the Sun—the point about 1.5m kilometres inward from Earth where the two bodies’ gravitational attractions balance each other out. Conceived of mainly as a way of looking back at an Earth spinning in eternal sunshine, DSCOVR also measures the stream of charged particles flowing past it from the Sun. When a storm passes by, the satellite’s operators down in Boulder will hear about its approach from DSCOVR between 15 minutes and an hour before the brunt of it hits the magnetosphere, depending on its speed.
There is little planning anywhere for what to do in response to a volcanic eruption large enough to cool and dry the climate around the world, as the eruption of Tambora, a volcano in Indonesia, did in 1815. The fact that the stratospheric sulphate particles which bring about such cooling leave a distinctive residue in glaciers and ice sheets reveals the frequency of these eruptions (see chart 1). But there is no pattern which says when another one might be due.

Careful remote monitoring of the world’s volcanoes, including those that are apparently dormant, should reveal if one is likely to blow in a big way. Again, satellites can play a key role. A technique called radar interferometry makes it possible to see when mountains start to deform as a result of the pressure of the magma building up beneath and within them. Scientists at the University of Bristol are using such data from past eruptions to train machine-learning systems on how to see future ones. Very large eruptions should be fairly easy to anticipate; but quite how large one will prove, and thus quite what effects to expect, will be hard to say in advance.
There are also projects devoted to looking for potentially hazardous asteroids. Here, though, the threat is not what it was. When people began to worry about asteroid impacts in the 1980s, the focus was on events smaller than the dinosaur-killer—too rare to worry about—but still big enough to disturb the climate in the way a very large volcanic eruption does, and thus do damage worldwide rather than just wiping clean some random, and probably sparsely inhabited, part of the planet’s surface. Theoretical models of the population of near-Earth objects suggested there might be 1,000 or so big enough to wreak such havoc, of which only a hundred or so had been discovered. Subsequent observation has found most of the rest of them, and they are all, at the moment, keeping a safe distance. As of 2019 the data suggested that only around 43 near-Earth objects of a potentially climate-changing stature were still to be discovered, according to Alan Harris of MoreData!, a research outfit.
As the need to worry about big asteroids has diminished, though, interest in spotting smaller ones has grown—as has an urge to be able to swat them aside. Next year America will launch a space mission called DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) which will change the orbit of a small asteroid orbiting a larger one, thus demonstrating the first step towards a “planetary defence” capability. It is an exciting, dramatic idea. If your aim were to effectively fund ways of lowering the death toll in future catastrophes, though, it would probably not strike you as the best use of $300m. Investing in early-warning systems for pandemics (see article) would seem a much better bet.
Every which way
It is possible to imagine better early-warning systems for pandemics, solar storms and volcanic eruptions, and carefully considered plans which would use that knowledge to reduce the hazard. What of the other big bads?

Existing anthropogenic risks are already quite well dealt with. There are aspects of climate change that could and should be better monitored—methane sources, for example, and changes in soil moisture—but the subject is hardly systematically understudied. It is in the nature of nuclear weaponry that its possessors spend a great deal of time monitoring each other’s capacities and intentions. As for those trying to develop nuclear weaponry covertly, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation operates a remarkably acute network of monitoring stations that brings together seismometers, radioisotope sensors and detectors of low-frequency sound waves which makes setting off a nuclear weapon of any size without being noticed effectively impossible.

Hazards that do not yet exist but may soon come to pass present a harder problem. The prospect of synthetic biology producing advanced bioweaponry is a fitting target for traditional intelligence methods, coupled with the sort of monitoring that might be used to detect novel natural pathogens, too. Countermeasures might emerge from “precision medicine” approaches built around platform therapies which can be reprogammed for various diseases. Deadly AIs, though, are a different kettle of pseudofish. Today’s AI systems, powerful as they are at recognising patterns, are worrying only to the extent that people use them in worrying ways; in themselves they are no more dangerous, or sentient, than stamp collections. That may change. Most in the field seem to think that one day AIs will be able to give humans a real run for their money. But their views as to when vary widely (see chart 2). Such disparity does not mean no threat will emerge. It does suggest that no one really knows what it may look like.
As a field and a threat, though, AI, like synthetic biology, does have the advantage of emerging from an open academic culture. Its expert practitioners eschew closed publication and discussion. This makes it plausible, at least, to monitor both fields.
Getting such risks taken seriously will never be easy. It is to some extent contrary to human nature. Humans assume that the future will be like the past; they prepare for things they have experience of. Mr Murtagh says that grid operators at high latitudes take solar storms more seriously than others do because of experiences like that of Quebec in 1989. Countries hit hard by SARS have, by and large, done better against covid-19 than those which never had to get to grips with the previous pandemic. When it comes to the truly novel, no one will have that core of experience to build on.
Where experience fails, though, science and imagination may sometimes fill in. Humans often look to the future like Herbert’s superstitious and fanatical mates staring up at the Carrington event’s strange skies, filled with “dire forebodings”. But it can be seen in other ways. You do not have to believe in trillions of people living the good life for ever. Just that there are things to come which are worth caring about, and worth protecting from those threats that reason reveals.■",1
1730,"ON JULY 11TH thousands of protesters took to the streets spontaneously in more than 50 Cuban towns and cities. They had a long litany of grievances: recurring electricity shortages, empty grocery shops, a failing economy, a repressive government and an increasingly desperate situation regarding covid-19. In a display of discontent not seen on the communist island for perhaps six decades, people of all ages chanted and marched, some of them to the tune of clanging spoons and frying pans. They shouted “Patria y Vida!” (Fatherland and Life)—a riff on the revolutionary slogan “Patria o Muerte” (Fatherland or Death), and the name of a rap song which criticises the government—along with “Libertad!” (Freedom) and “Abajo la dictadura!” (Down with the dictatorship).
Although protests continue, by the next day cities were quieter as the police went from house to house, rounding up the demonstration leaders. Riot police spread out across cities, plainclothes officers took to the streets and pro-government mobs brandishing images of Fidel Castro were called in to chant revolutionary slogans and wave Cuban flags. Miguel Díaz-Canel, the president and first secretary of the Communist Party, appeared on television to declare: “Cuba belongs to its revolutionaries.” Around 150 people have gone missing, and one protester has been killed. There are rumours that young men are being forcibly conscripted into the army.

The big question is how much staying power the protests will have. The coming weeks will show whether the regime's stock response of swatting down any signs of dissent will work again. The government has little leeway to buy social peace. Cuba has been badly hit by covid-19 and by a precipitous drop in tourism, on which it heavily depends. A lack of foreign currency with which to buy imports has led to acute food shortages and blackouts. Under the administration of Donald Trump, the United States tightened sanctions on Cuba. These have added a little to the island’s longstanding economic troubles.

Cuba’s reluctance to buy foreign vaccines, born of a mix of autarky and a shortage of cash, means that only 16% of the population is fully inoculated. Home-grown vaccines are being developed, but have not yet been fully rolled out; meanwhile, pharmacies are short even of basics like aspirin. Whereas tourism has resumed in nearby places where covid-19 has receded, such as Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, Cuba is suffering from rising infections. Even the official data show the number of new cases doubling every seven days. In a video posted to Facebook, Lisveilys Echenique, who lives in the city of Ciego de Ávila, described how her brother spent 11 days battling covid-19 without treatment because he could get neither medicine nor a hospital bed. After he died, his corpse remained in her home for seven hours before an ambulance arrived.
The Cuban economy came close to collapse in the early 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union brought foreign aid to an abrupt halt. There were public protests then, too, which were quickly dispersed. But Cubans now have access to the internet and are adept at using it to mobilise. Videos of police violence and arbitrary arrests have been circulating rapidly in recent days. At one point in the afternoon of July 11th, as the protests reached their height, the authorities appeared to block all internet access. Some social-messaging sites have also been suspended.
But much as the government may wish to turn the internet off, it cannot afford to: the exorbitant access fees charged by the state telecoms monopoly are an important source of foreign exchange. The internet is also a vital conduit for remittances from Cubans abroad. Mobile data and Wi-Fi charges bring in perhaps $80m a month for the government, estimates Emilio Morales of Havana Consulting Group in Miami.
“The government has closed itself up like an oyster,” says José Jasán Nieves Cárdenas, editor of El Toque, a Cuban magazine mostly published online. “Instead of acknowledging that it has to come out and establish a dialogue with its people, it has chosen repression.” Tear gas and rubber bullets were used against crowds, although in some instances security officers were so outnumbered by protesters that they were forced to retreat. As things escalated, police cars were overturned and some dollar stores, symbols of the regime’s economic incompetence, were ransacked.
Mr Díaz-Canel blames Cuba’s troubles on the embargo imposed by the United States, as the government always does. He has ignored the complaints of the protesters, dismissing them as mercenaries, and offered excuses rather than plans for reform. After the president gave a speech on July 12th more protesters gathered outside the Capitol building in Havana. Other than stepping down, there is not much Mr Díaz-Canel could do to make amends to his people, says the owner of a small business. “You can’t cover the sun with one finger,” she says. Rumours are circulating that even members of the police are starting to defy their orders, as some think the protesters have a point.
Alfred Martínez Ramírez, a member of 27N, a group of activists, artists and intellectuals campaigning for greater freedom of expression, joined a protest outside the Ministry of Culture in November. Some 300 people were present, which at the time seemed a huge number. Cubans rarely protest, not least because unauthorised public gatherings are illegal. Seeing thousands of people on the streets of Havana and elsewhere in Cuba gives Mr Martínez Ramírez hope that his group is not alone, and that they may have even helped many others overcome their fear of dissent. “There has been an awakening,” he says.■

1731,"THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE has not had the greatest few years. In 2019, to great fanfare, it was given to Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, for his role in bringing about a peace deal with Eritrea, Ethiopia’s tiny neighbour. It was hailed as a landmark for the country. “We must plant seeds of love, forgiveness and reconciliation in the hearts and minds of our citizens”, said Mr Abiy, that December, in his lecture on receiving the prize. Sadly, Mr Abiy’s seed-planting phase did not last very long. Last year, disaffected soldiers in Tigray, a northern region of the country with a long history of controlling Ethiopia, rebelled. Mr Abiy launched a brutal police action in retaliation. Last month, the prime minister and Nobel laureate toured the battlefield in what has become a new Ethiopian civil war, promising to use rebels as “target practice.” 
The Nobel peace prize committee has been embarrassed before. Henry Kissinger won in 1973—while the United States, following his strategy, was carpet-bombing Cambodia. Among the bookies’ favourites this year were Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenage environmentalist; the World Health Organisation, for its work in helping to get the world vaccinated; and Alexei Navalny, an imprisoned Russian dissident who last year was poisoned with novichok, a nerve agent, and almost died. Instead the gongs have gone to two journalists: Dmitry Muratov, who edits Novaya Gazeta, a liberal Russian newspaper; and Maria Ressa, a former CNN anchor who founded and is the chief executive of Rappler, a website critical of the Philippine government.
Both journalists have done remarkable work in difficult times. Mr Muratov and his newspaper have long toiled to investigate and expose wrongdoing, even as the net has tightened on critics in Russia. In 2014 Novaya broke stories about the shooting down of MH17, a Malaysian Airlines flight, by Russian-backed militants in Ukraine, and then published an apology on behalf of Russia on its front page at a time when Russia’s government was insisting it had nothing to do with the plane going down. Six of the newspaper’s journalists have been murdered in the past three decades. In March noxious substances were sprayed into the newspapers’ offices in an attempt at intimidation. Dozens of Russian journalists have been designated as “foreign agents” by the state. “We’ve been experiencing enormous pressure, of a sort we never experienced before,” says Pavel Kanygin, one of the paper’s reporters.
Ms Ressa’s news organisation, Rappler, which started as a Facebook page in 2011, has been one of very few Philippine news organisations to openly criticise President Rodrigo Duterte’s government, publishing investigations into extrajudicial killings undertaken by the police as part of his war on drugs. It has been targeted by malicious tax investigations, as well as libel cases. Ms Ressa, who along with several other journalists was named a Time magazine person of the year in 2018, has been fighting several libel cases, which in the Philippines can result in prison sentences. Last year she was convicted of one case of “cyber libel”, which she is appealing, but which could put her in prison for up to six years. In 2016, Mr Duterte, then the president elect, responded to a question about media killings with the claim that “just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you’re a son of a bitch”.
Yet in Russia at least, many are disappointed with the committee’s choice not to give the prize to somebody higher profile, such as Mr Navalny, or Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who stood in the Belarussian election last year. Alexander Etkind, a Russian historian, said he believed Mr Muratov deserved his award, but he had nominated Mr Navalny and he was sorry “that the Nobel committee did not have courage to do the right thing.” Indeed the Kremlin seemed delighted it had not done so. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s press officer, congratulated Mr Muratov for his “talent” and “bravery”. With Mr Navalny still in prison and in poor health, a Nobel would have been deeply embarrassing to Mr Putin in a way that Mr Muratov’s is not. 
Both editors have accepted their awards graciously, speaking up for other journalists and victims of oppression. “I am laughing. I didn’t expect it at all. It’s madness over here right now,” Mr Muratov said, on a Telegram channel, promising to do more to represent independent Russian journalism. He dedicated the prize to the six Novaya journalists who have been murdered, and said he said he hoped it would help people who are critical of Russia’s government, particularly journalists and other news organisations accused of being foreign agents. He also said he thought Mr Navalny deserved it. Ms Ressa learned of her prize while taking part in an online panel on press freedom, and said that she was “in shock…I think it’s a recognition of how tough it is”.
The need to speak out for journalists is undeniable. In 2020, more than twice as many were murdered for doing their jobs as in 2019, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an NGO based in New York. At the end of 2020 over 270 journalists were imprisoned, according to the same organisation. That was the highest figure ever recorded by their annual census, which has been going for almost three decades. Highlighting the perils of being a journalist in repressive countries is no bad thing. Yet some will wonder if the Nobel Committee could not have been a little bolder. ■",1
1732,"Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, was shot dead at his private residence. The police said that they killed four suspects during a gun battle and had arrested two others. It was unclear who ordered the assassination, or why. Claude Joseph, the interim prime minister, who was due to be replaced this week, said he would take charge as interim president. The opposition had been seeking Mr Moïse’s removal from office, saying his term had expired. In February the government claimed it had uncovered an attempted coup against him.
American forces left Bagram airfield, near Kabul, which had been their biggest base in Afghanistan. A small number remain in the capital, largely to protect the American embassy. After 20 years America has effectively given up on the war in Afghanistan, which now looks likely to intensify. The emboldened Taliban have been seizing territory. Some of the official Afghan army have surrendered without a fight. Local warlords are raising militias to resist the jihadists.

In Brazil the Supreme Court authorised an investigation into Jair Bolsonaro for failing to comply with his public duty. The case claims that the president overlooked irregularities in a deal on a covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin. A senate inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic is also looking into allegations that one official asked for a $1-per-dose bribe to purchase the AstraZeneca vaccine. Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets, the third mass protest in just over a month to call for Mr Bolsonaro’s impeachment.

1733,"LONDON/MILAN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Italy on Sunday ended talks with UniCredit (CRDI.MI) over the sale of Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) (BMPS.MI) in a major setback to years-long efforts by the Rome government to return the ailing Tuscan bank to private hands.
Failure to bridge a multi-billion euro valuation gap between the parties leaves Italy unable to complete the restructuring of its banking system which it started six years ago.
The announcement confirmed what Reuters had exclusively reported from sources on Saturday.  read more 
Rome will now seek an extension of deadlines agreed with European Union authorities to re-privatise MPS and a Treasury official said it did not expect discussions to be difficult.
The Treasury will do its part to recapitalise MPS and plans to go ahead with the measures to improve the balance sheet which it had offered to UniCredit after MPS emerged as the most vulnerable euro zone lender in this summer's health check of the sector.
""The postponement will be accompanied by managerial measures that will strengthen the bank,"" the official said.
""European authorities are fully aware that we have seriously tried to conclude a transaction at market terms within the end of the year, and that this has not been possible, because the proposal we have received is not acceptable,"" he added.
Italy had started working towards re-privatising MPS not long after rescuing it in 2017 for 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion), proceeding as a first step to rid of most of its remaining soured debts.
Rome saw a merger with a stronger peer as the best way to fix the country's biggest banking woes and had singled out UniCredit after rival heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) pushed its market share to antitrust limits with last year's UBI takeover.
""Despite the effort from both sides ... the negotiations pertaining to the potential acquisition of a defined perimeter of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena will no longer continue,"" UniCredit and the Treasury said in a joint statement.
The news is likely to rock shares in the two banks on Monday and hit in particular MPS' riskier debt, which has suffered in recent months due to worries MPS' junior bondholders will be called to bear losses under European Union rules on state aid for banks if Italy puts more taxpayer money into MPS.
Early discussions to cut the state's 64% stake in MPS through a deal with UniCredit started more than a year ago, but the ousting of CEO Jean Pierre Mustier brought them to an abrupt halt.
In agreeing to enter exclusive talks with the Treasury in July, new UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel demanded the deal targeted only parts of MPS, in addition to being neutral for UniCredit's capital and offering a 10% earnings boost.
The Treasury calculated the assets selected by UniCredit had a market value of between 3.6 billion and 4.8 billion euros given 600 million euros in annual net income, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
That opened a yawning gap with UniCredit's 1.3 billion euro valuation of the same assets, the source added. UniCredit declined to comment.
The Treasury also opposed accounting adjustments UniCredit had factored into its 6.3 billion euro capital request on the basis of its own more conservative risk models, sources have said.
With the parties at odds also over the assets to be sold and the Treasury pushing UniCredit to take on MPS units it did not want, Rome concluded a merger was too costly an alternative for taxpayers.
MPS has plans to raise 2.5 billion euros in capital if it failed to find a buyer and the Treasury official said the government was ready to do its part on the basis of ""a credible business plan"".
Italy is likely to overhaul MPS' leadership to deliver the scheme devised as part of the UniCredi deal, which would see the bank's remaining soured loans transferred to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO and its legal risks carved out and guaranteed by the state, this source said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), which is yet to see a standalone plan according to a source close to the matter, has no immediate concern over MPS' capital position.

1734," (CNN Business)Apple plans to give customers the ability to repair their own devices amid growing pressure from regulators and consumers around the world for manufacturers to ease restrictions on fixing products.The company on Wednesday announced a new program that will make spare parts for Apple products available to purchase starting early next year. The program, known as Self Service Repair, will let users fix broken devices using repair manuals that Apple will post on its website. Apple (AAPL) plans to start with some components that tend to require replacement such as displays, batteries and camera modules. The company says it will have more than 200 parts and tools available at launch and plans for more to be added later next year. The repair program will initially be available only for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 users, but will later expand to Mac computers that use Apple's new in-house M1 chip. The company will only reveal the prices of its spare parts when the program formally launches next year, but Apple said it will charge individual users the same prices it currently charges independent repair providers. Apple's move comes as electronics manufacturers — as well as the makers of everything from tractors to hospital equipment — face increasing pressure to ease restrictions on independent device repair shops or DIY repairs, a push known as the ""right to repair"" movement. Companies have been criticized for using tactics that make it harder for independent repair businesses to access devices, such as using non-removable memory or batteries, or sealing devices with special glue. Critics argue these tactics can lead to more costs for consumers, hurt independent repair shops and be bad for the environment. President Joe Biden passed an executive order in July that directed the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules requiring companies to allow DIY repairs. Days later, the FTC unanimously voted to condemn existing repair restrictions by manufacturers, with the agency's chair, Lina Khan, vowing to ""root out"" illegal repair restrictions that may flout US antitrust and consumer protection laws.Regulators in the United Kingdom and Europe have also either already passed or are considering legislation to force device manufacturers to provide their customers with spare parts.It's not just regulators. One of the noteworthy advocates for the ""right to repair"" movement has been Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who said earlier this year that he was ""totally supportive"" of the cause. ""We wouldn't have had an Apple had I not grown up in a very open technology world,"" he said in a video on the celebrity shout-out website Cameo.iFixit, a popular online repair website for consumer electronics that has criticized Apple and other companies for not allowing self repairs, welcomed Wednesday's announcement. ""We're thrilled to see Apple admit what we've always known: Everyone's enough of a Genius to fix an iPhone,"" iFixit said on Twitter.Companies like Apple have previously argued their repair policies were in place to ensure the products are properly repaired. ""We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested,"" Apple COO Jeff Williams said in a 2019 release announcing Apple's independent repair shop partner program.On Wednesday, Williams touted Apple's announcement as giving ""customers even more choice if a repair is needed."" He also said the company ""has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we're providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.""Apple said there are more than 2,800 independent repair providers across 200 countries that have access to its parts and repair knowledge. For now, the Self Service Repair program will only be available in the United States at launch, but Apple said it plans to expand the program to other countries over the course of 2022. ",2
1735,"AT TWO MINUTES to midnight on September 1st, when the Supreme Court quietly let Senate Bill 8 go into effect, Texas became the most inhospitable state for a woman seeking an abortion. Challengers may still press their case. But in the meantime Senate Bill 8 prohibits abortion when a fetal heartbeat begins, at about six weeks’ gestation, and makes no exception for women who were impregnated via incest or rape. The law’s great peculiarity, though, is its enforcement mechanism, which is outsourced to anyone who espies someone “aiding or abetting” an abortion.
Health-care providers, Uber drivers, clergy, family members, friends—anyone who plays even a bit part in facilitating an abortion is subject to a $10,000 fine that becomes a bounty for the accuser and may close the offending clinic. A whistleblower website invites anonymous tips to nab those who are complicit in helping a woman terminate her pregnancy.

This dystopian enterprise has a practical purpose: deflecting legal challenges. If the state is not enforcing the law, defendants are harder to pinpoint. When Planned Parenthood and a coalition of abortion providers and pastors sued in July, they targeted one Mark Lee Dickson, an anti-abortion activist who had threatened to sue under the law, as well as a state judge and a county clerk who would be integral to enforcing the scheme. The legal strategy was novel by necessity.

Before the theory could be tested in district court, a circuit court abruptly cancelled the hearing. This spurred the ill-fated last-ditch plea to the Supreme Court to block the law before it took effect. The lawsuit may raise “serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law”—as it bans abortion three months earlier than Roe v Wade permits—wrote the majority. But since the state of Texas had argued that neither it nor its employees had the power to enforce the law, the justices declined to step in.
Chief Justice Roberts who, unusually, joined the minority, identified the catch-22 in this reasoning. The “statutory scheme before the Court is not only unusual”, he wrote, “but unprecedented”. As it seems specifically designed to “insulate the state from responsibility”, it would be better to freeze the law and subject it to “at least preliminary judicial consideration” before imposing it on Texas’s 7m women of reproductive age. Some scrutiny is important, he added, since the law may serve “as a model for action in other areas.”

The three liberal justices each penned dissents, too. For Justice Stephen Breyer, casually blessing the law will bring “imminent and serious harm”—indeed on the first day it came into force 50 of 55 women seeking care at a clinic in Fort Worth were turned away. Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused her five conservative colleagues—including the three appointed by Donald Trump—of a “breathtaking” act that rewards cynical lawmaking and undermines nearly half a century of abortion-rights rulings. Justice Elena Kagan added that the order came hastily and with a bare-bones explanation emblematic of recent shadow-docket rulings that are “unreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend”.
Senate Bill 8 may eventually run up against judicial resistance, but its impact could inspire other Republican states to take up similar measures. Roe itself is on the line next spring when the justices decide on the constitutionality of a 15-week ban in Mississippi. The court’s dismissiveness in the Texas case does not bode well for the survival of the 1973 precedent.■",1
1736,"WHEN MILLIONS of migrant workers were forced by India’s sudden covid lockdown to return to their villages from the cities where they worked, many feared destitution. But Aadhaar, the country’s pioneering biometric ID system, came to the rescue. Under an income scheme for farmers launched in 2014 that would have been impossible without Aadhaar, $1.5bn was transferred digitally and at speed into the bank accounts of 30m people, with little waste or fraud and almost no distribution cost.
Because 1bn accounts are linked to people’s Aadhaar identity numbers, India has been able to channel help to where it has been most needed with remarkable efficiency. Contrast that with America, where 90m paper cheques were laboriously sent through the mail, accompanied by a signed letter from President Donald Trump.

Covid has had a way both of exposing the weakest links in societies and of acting as a spur to innovation. Rich countries without national digital-ID systems can scrape through, thanks to myriad other ways people have of proving who they are—driving licences, credit cards, social-security numbers and so on. But for poor countries, the problem of getting covid-related help to their most vulnerable citizens is made infinitely more difficult when you do not know who they are or what services, such as health care and income support, they are entitled to.
Around the world, 1bn people have no formal proof of identity. More than 80% of them live in sub-Saharan Africa and the less well-off parts of Asia. Less than half of African children under five have their births registered. The poorest, women and those living in rural areas are least likely to have officially recognised IDs.
Something as seemingly straightforward but critically important as a vaccination registry to record who has had a jab and who has not, is easy to set up if you have a foundational digital-ID system to build it on, but much harder if you do not. Nandan Nilekani, the co-founder of Infosys, one of India’s largest IT-consulting and systems-integration firms, and the driving force behind Aadhaar, believes that the system will be crucial to authenticating digital certificates as a proof of vaccination.
Many governments in Africa and Asia have been inspired by the success of Aadhaar, which since its inception in 2009 has enrolled 1.3bn people. It has streamlined the delivery of services and payments, cut corruption, boosted financial inclusion and hugely raised participation in India’s digital economy. Before covid struck, encouraged by the launch of World Bank’s ID4D (“Identification for Development”) programme, which started in 2014, countries such as Morocco, the Philippines and Myanmar went to Delhi in search of help. But there is now a new sense of urgency.
However, Aadhaar is a complex system with its own set of application program interfaces, known as the India Stack, that could not easily be replicated. Having learned lessons from Aadhaar, Mr Nilekani proposed a different approach: building an open-source foundational ID platform that could be taken up by any country free of charge. The result is MOSIP, which stands for Modular Open Source Identity Platform.
With financial support from the World Bank, two countries—Morocco and the Philippines—are implementing national ID schemes based on MOSIP, which will be rolled out early next year. Three more—Ethiopia, Guinea and Sri Lanka—are working on pilots. Several others, including Ivory Coast, Togo and Tunisia, are keen on using MOSIP. There are plans for countries across west Africa to have a shared interoperable ID platform, allowing cross-border authentication. The aim is that by 2023, at least ten countries will be operating MOSIP-based digital-ID platforms and it will have become an international standard, each country having learned from the others’ deployments. And the covid emergency is lengthening the queue of countries at MOSIP’s door.
The MOSIP project, which got going in March 2018, is nested in Bangalore’s International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-B) and endowed with funding of $16m from the Omidyar Network, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Tata Trusts. What it set out to do was to give countries with far less IT capacity than India’s a basis for establishing a cost-effective foundational identity system that was, in effect, “Aadhaar in a box”. Bangalore, according to C.V. Madhukar, Omidyar’s lead on digital identity, was the obvious place to base MOSIP. It could draw on technical know-how from Mr Nilekani’s original Aadhaar team, who were mostly still there, and on the resources of the iSPIRT Foundation, an organisation of volunteer engineers who donate their time to build software as a public good.
From the outset the MOSIP group, which is led by S. Rajagopalan, the entrepreneurial head of IIIT-B’s Innovation Centre, was clear on two points. The first was that MOSIP should be a standard-bearer for “good” digital ID. It had to be designed with a “citizen-centred” approach that ensured safety (protecting individual privacy and ensuring inclusion) and accountability (policies to limit use cases to those which are of general benefit and which cannot be perverted for purposes such as political suppression).
Countries applying to use MOSIP must assure its governing executive committee that as well as having sufficient digital infrastructure (or adequate funding to put it in place), their intentions for the system are benign and the underlying policy framework is robust. It is not a guarantee against misuse, but it is a worthy statement of principle. 
The second was that MOSIP should be open-source, allowing all its protocols to be seen, developed and strengthened by collective effort. As Professor Rajagopalan says: “A lot of eyes are better than a few.” His vision is for MOSIP to become a thriving open-source project in which a community of developers and system integrators contribute to the long-term support and growth of the platform.
It was critical that implementing countries, though still needing to hire a professional systems integrator, would own the underlying identification platform including the software that supports it. Mr Madhukar notes that because national digital-ID systems are inherent monopolies, a key requirement for most countries is to avoid the perils of being locked into a single proprietary technology. MOSIP allows them to work with multiple application vendors, and remain in overall control of the system.
Because of its modular design (which separates the functions of each program into independent and interchangeable components) and configurability (which allows flexible solutions to real-world problems and simplifies deployment and maintenance), MOSIP can be adapted to different country contexts, laws and varying levels of digital infrastructure. Ease of customisation gives countries the option to pick the features they want to buy “off-the-shelf” and those they want to develop bespoke. For example, they can choose different modes of authentication, from biometrics to mobile one-time passwords. Another big decision that MOSIP leaves to its clients is whether to go for hosting the platform on national premises or the quicker, more scalable solution of the cloud. Either way, governments, rather than a third-party outfit, will own all their own data.
Over the next year or so, says Mr Madhukar, the MOSIP team will concentrate on “handholding” implementing countries and learning from them what works (and what does not) and further developing the architecture to integrate with a wide range of commercial software producers, while still avoiding the perils of vendor lock-in.
A big challenge for the future, as the number of countries wanting to use MOSIP grows, will be the capacity of local IT talent to build on the platform and create the data application layers to ensure interoperability with national registries and services. That will require the resources to train local providers and systems integrators, while also building a small community of developers that can be parachuted in to deal with specific problems. Without additional funding from philanthropic donors and the World Bank, or more help in kind from tech giants such as Google and Amazon, those efforts will stall.
That would be a pity. Chris Yiu, who leads the technology and policy team at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, is optimistic both about what digital ID in lower-income countries can achieve and how MOSIP can help. The institute is working with Oracle, a business computing firm, to establish vaccination registries across Africa. Mr Yiu says that “covid has played a forcing function” in making countries determined to run their health-care and welfare systems more efficiently and see digital-ID systems as the vital platform for doing so.
Other good things can come from that. Well-designed digital-ID systems, he argues, play a vital role in building trust in both government-to-citizen and citizen-to-citizen transactions, each of which are crucial drivers of social capital (those networks and relationships which are the bedrock of thriving societies) and economic development.",1
1737,"STANDING AT ABOUT five-foot-four, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Nigeria’s northern state of Kaduna, says he models himself on Deng Xiaoping, who put China on a path to growth after the misery of rule by Mao Zedong. Mr El-Rufai sees a new path for Kaduna and, some say, for Nigeria itself.
Mr El-Rufai prizes education: he has a law degree from London, a master’s in public administration from Harvard and is writing a doctorate at Maastricht university. He is usually addressed by the title “Mallam”, out of respect for his erudition, particularly in Koranic studies. So it may seem odd that one of his early acts as governor was to fire almost 22,000 primary-school teachers. Yet he had cause. Those he booted out had failed a test designed for nine-year-olds. Some couldn’t complete a comprehension test. Others couldn’t name a rectangle. Mr El-Rufai has sacked thousands more workers. And he is not done.

With two years left of his second term, the governor is determined to balance the state’s budget by reducing the number of people working for the government. This is something of a rarity in Nigeria, where the governor of another state recently boasted he had hired 38,000 aides, ostensibly to reduce poverty, arguing it was better to spend money on employing people than to invest in roads or ports.
When Nigeria locked down last year to slow the spread of covid-19, it quickly became clear that Kaduna’s administration was not noticeably worse with most of the state’s employees not working than when they were supposedly toiling in the service of taxpayers. Since then Mr El-Rufai has proposed to sack a further 7,000 government workers.
His latest move has provoked the trade unions, whose members went on strike under banners reading “Hell-Rufai”. Once seen as a liberal, he now has a reputation as a harsh disciplinarian. Yet the governor is undaunted. He has dared disgruntled workers to challenge him in court.
Though his means may be unpopular and his critics accuse him of riding roughshod over opponents, his case for streamlining the civil service is strong. Of the 50bn naira ($121m) that Kaduna will receive this year from the federal government (its main source of funds), it will spend about 80% on staff salaries. This is an improvement on last year, when personnel costs outstripped the federal allocation.
Mr El-Rufai argues that unless he can slim the payroll, he will not have the cash to invest in good things like hospitals and bridges. It could also free up funds to fight insecurity, a persistent scourge in Nigeria’s northern states, bedevilled by gangs of kidnappers and by fighting between crop farmers and cattle herders. Sectarian tension in the north between the Muslim majority and the Christian minority is another frequent source of violence. Since Mr El-Rufai was elected governor in 2015 the number of ethnic clashes has fallen.
The governor, who is thought to have presidential ambitions, has had little support for his reforms from the federal government or ruling party, of which he is a member. Yet he is pushing on regardless. He believes that just like Deng, who revoked many of Mao’s stifling economic policies, he may have to defy his party in order to force through his plans.
But Mr El-Rufai would do well to remember that he must worry about more than just his party. Unlike leaders of China, who can lock up critics and never face voters, he operates in a raucous democracy. In June his party lost a by-election in Kaduna, perhaps an early sign of a backlash against his policies. If he does not keep an eye on his dwindling popularity, he may soon have little chance to reform anything. ■",1
1738,"A NEW BUILDING at Hospital México, a public clinic in a quiet neighbourhood of San José, Costa Rica’s capital, would not look out of place in most rich countries. Behind its quiet exterior lies a bigger story. Excellent health care, free to all at the point of service, is one reason Ticos—as Costa Ricans are known—and their neighbours talk of the country’s exceptionalism. In Central America public services tend to be poor, patchy or absent altogether. By contrast all Ticos get state pensions. When they turn on the tap, drinkable water comes out.
Now the pandemic has turned what was already unsustainable into a debt crisis. Even before covid-19 the country of 5m had the third-highest government debt in Latin America and the highest interest payments. But last year its economy shrank by 4.5%, partly thanks to a reduction in tourism, while the fiscal deficit rose to 8.1% of GDP, up from 6.7% in 2019. Public debt has reached 68% of GDP. Unemployment has risen to 18%, from 12% last year.

The country has lurched from one fiscal crisis to the next for years, but the scale of this one prompted the government to agree, in January, to a loan from the IMF of $1.8bn, around 3% of GDP. It is dependent on a package of reforms which must be enacted in the coming weeks. The most controversial part of the deal, currently being debated by congress, is to reform public employment. The government spends more than half of its revenues on salaries for its workers, the highest share in the OECD, a club of rich countries that Costa Rica is in the process of joining. Public-sector pay is lavish: teachers in state schools make, on average, more than twice as much as their peers in private ones.
Much of this is thanks to top-ups to public-sector wages. A pay bump for getting married has been abolished, but others, such as for working in hot conditions, remain. The bill would cut these and instead pay a single salary. No one would be allowed to earn more than Carlos Alvarado, the president, as 2,200 of the 305,000 state workers currently do. Mr Alvarado says the IMF deal “is not only a fiscal discussion, it's a matter of equality”.

It is, however, controversial. “The social state is slipping away through our fingers like water,” claims Albino Vargas, the head of ANEP, a union that represents 17,000 public and private workers. Last year protests derailed talks for a loan.
By contrast, this deal is likely to pass. Many reforms have been toned down—for example, the measures to increase revenues, such as by raising a consumer tax, have been removed. The focus is on reducing spending, mainly through lowering the cost of state employees. Indeed, the most accurate criticism is that the deal is too timid. Past governments only took small steps to stave off sovereign default, says Kevin Casas, a former vice-president. This one is no better.
The true risk to the welfare state comes not from this deal, but from the lack of deeper structural change. That unhappy task will fall to the next government (elections are due in ten months). Mr Alvarado is weak; his party holds only 10 of 57 seats in the legislature. His government previously enacted a tax reform and a cap on spending linked to debt and economic growth in 2018. The IMF deal may merely be setting the scene for more to come.
Such reforms are urgently needed. The quality of public services is deteriorating. Costa Rica spends fully 7% of GDP on education, the highest share in the OECD after Scandinavian countries. Despite this it ranks second-lowest of the club’s members in the PISA rankings, which test the skills of 15-year-olds, just above Colombia.
Much could be achieved while still preserving the welfare state, thinks Juan Carlos Hidalgo, an analyst who is running for Costa Rica’s congress next year. Cracking down on tax evasion would help, as would raising taxes. Some state monopolies could be sold off. But without major changes, the country risks becoming more like its neighbours. For many Ticos, that is not nearly good enough. ■",1
1739,"ON OCTOBER 21ST a consortium led by Lockheed Martin, one of America’s biggest aerospace companies, announced plans to build a permanently crewed commercial space station called Starlab, and launch it into orbit around Earth by 2027. Not to be outdone, on the 25th, Blue Origin, a firm that is Jeff Bezos’s ticket into space, unveiled plans for a yet more ambitious effort. Orbital Reef, pictured above as an artist’s impression, is a joint venture with (among others) Lockheed’s competitor Boeing. It will host up to ten people and will serve, as Blue Origin put it, as a “mixed-use business park”. The hope is that this orbiting industrial estate will open by the end of the decade.
Private-enterprise missions to orbit are not new. Mr Bezos’s rival Elon Musk, for example, has been offering them, via his rocketry firm SpaceX, for several years. But these two projects, if they succeed, will be on a far grander scale. Eye-catching though they are, however, they are not alone. Several other firms, egged on in some cases by NASA, that country’s space agency, have similar ideas. The firms’ owners hope to make money. NASA hopes to save America’s amour propre. And, acting together, these motives seem likely, some time this decade, to result in the first real settlement of outer space by private enterprise.

The men in the high castles
The underlying reason for all this activity is the imminent death of the International Space Station (ISS). This intergovernmental but American-dominated effort, the first elements of which were launched in 1998, was designed to last about 15 years, so is already past its sell-by date. Cracks and air leaks have multiplied. And, on September 9th, the smell of smouldering plastic wafted through it, though no open flames broke out.
NASA believes that, with upgrades, the ISS can limp on until 2028, or perhaps a bit longer. But either way, it will not be long until thrusters on the most expensive object ever made push the whole caboodle to fiery doom over the Pacific Ocean. No other intergovernmental habitat will supersede it. But NASA is encouraging commercial replacements instead.
The agency’s plan is to pay the firms behind these replacements for services rendered, such as hosting astronauts or conducting research in the microgravity that the perpetual freefall of orbit offers. That, says Phil McAlister, a senior space-flight official at the agency, may save NASA as much as $1.5bn a year. But Mr McAlister also claims that commercial opportunities in orbit are now so abundant that industry should be able to support much of the cost of private space stations, even without government contracts.
NASA calls its side of this enterprise the Commercial Low-Earth-Orbit Destinations (CLD) project. Last year it awarded $140m to Axiom Space, a firm in Houston that is already manufacturing such a station. It will soon hand out a further $400m to two, three or possibly four of a dozen other firms which hope to enter the market. Officials at the agency are privately thrilled with the unexpectedly high number of bids they have received for a share of this money. But they are not commenting publicly about the competition until the winners are announced later this year.
Of Axiom’s project, the first module will, if all goes to plan, be launched in September 2024 and will dock at one of the ISS’s two ports. It will be joined, six and 12 months later, by a second and a third module. After a fourth and final module, equipped to generate extra solar power, arrives in 2027, Axiom Station, as the whole assembly will be known, will detach and become a “free flyer” with nearly double the usable volume of the ISS.
The cost of doing all this will be about $3bn, says Matt Ondler, Axiom’s top technologist. Though no trifle, that is but a small fraction of what the ISS has cost. Every year, NASA spends roughly $3.5bn merely to maintain and operate the station. And that covers only about three-quarters of the cost of doing so. The rest is provided by Canada, Japan, Russia and participating European countries.
Axiom’s lower budget is partly explained by elimination of the waste common in government spending. But the firm is also harnessing lessons from the ISS to cut costs for things that range from blocking radiation, via recycling urine to recovering water from rubbish. Beyond that, much kit is cheaper and better now than when the ISS was designed in the 1990s. Today’s solar panels generate, kilo for kilo, six times more power. And lots of the components developed for smartphones and cars will be used in Axiom Station. Mr Ondler reckons it will cost, per unit of capability, about a hundredth of the bill for the ISS.
Axiom’s competitors, for their part, have kept quiet about their stations’ expected costs, but all the firms envisage a range of ways to make money. Hosting astronauts, tourists and even marketing campaigns will be one source of revenue. Servicing and refuelling satellites could be another. Many people also believe there will be demand for pharmaceutical and biotechnological work in microgravity, including the 3D-printing of human organs for transplantation and the development of stem-cell therapies.
On Earth, gravity means that cells printed onto scaffolds intended to create structures that are the same shape as natural organs have to be suspended in a viscous gel, to stop them dripping off the scaffold. This means high pressure is required to force them through the nozzle of the printer that sprays them onto the scaffold, a process that damages a fair number of those cells. In orbit, though, nothing drips, so the gel is no longer needed. Cell cultures, meanwhile, benefit from microgravity because their components remain in suspension in their nutrient fluids, rather than tending to settle out, as happens in Earthbound fermentation tanks.
The firms also plan to host microgravity manufacturing. Axiom, for example, says one of its potential customers thinks it can produce better eyesight-restoring retinal implants in space than on Earth. Other firms with which it is in talks hope to harness freefall to make purer fibre optics for lasers and, more challengingly, to forge stronger alloys for things like jet turbines.
At first blush, all this sounds a bit like sci-fi. But the technology to achieve it exists. For one thing, robots operating in freefall can achieve extraordinary precision. As Christian Maender, head of “in-space” manufacturing at Axiom, puts it, “they need not fight the weight of their own systems”. Launch costs have fallen sharply too, especially since NASA gave privatisation a shot in the arm by ending its staggeringly expensive Space Shuttle programme in 2011. Mr Maender reckons the next decade will see them halved again. Investors, for their part, are enthused. Axiom says it has had to turn some away.
Who knows if the Moon’s a balloon?
Part of Blue Origin’s Orbital Reef is to be provided by Sierra Space, a division of an aerospace firm called Sierra Nevada Corporation which already had a separate project to make a space station out of big, inflatable bladders. Once ejected into space from a rocket’s fairing, such a bladder will expand into a habitat 11 metres long and with a diameter of eight metres, somewhat resembling a cylindrical paper lantern.
To stop its modules being punctured by bits of high-velocity orbiting debris and cosmic dust, Sierra has designed shielding that incorporates layers of Kevlar and Vectran—fabrics used in things like bulletproof jackets and the airbags that cushion the fall of spacecraft dropped onto Mars. The outer layers will break up these incoming objects. The smaller, and therefore less energetic, fragments that result will then be stopped by the underlying layers.
Sierra’s modules will be fitted out, by astronaut handymen and women, with a rigid internal structure that incorporates avionics and control interfaces. Crew quarters, galley, toilet and facilities for research, manufacturing and satellite-servicing can be installed as required (see picture below, of a ground-based mock-up). Connected together, three of these modules will provide nearly as much pressurised volume as does the ISS.

The ISS, however, took about 40 launches to assemble. Sierra reckons it can loft and equip three modules with just eight or nine launches. The firm plans to shuttle goods and crew between Earth and its orbital facilities using a spaceplane called Dream Chaser that it is developing. (Orbital Reef is to be supplied by Boeing’s Starliner capsule, but Dream Chaser might pitch in for that job, too.) Dream Chaser will be able to land on any long airport runway. That, Sierra hopes, will provide a competitive edge for the manufacture of fragile, urgently needed goods, not to mention providing a comfortable and convenient ride for rich space tourists.
Sierra’s plan is for Dream Chaser to make its much-delayed maiden flight next year, and to have its station operating in 2027, so that its “anchor” tenant, NASA, can move in before the ISS’s demise. Others, it hopes, will follow. Earlier this year, for example, the firm said it was working with Redwire Space, a company that is also part of the Orbital Reef project, and which has been using the ISS to test processes intended to manufacture speciality ceramics, crystals and fibre optics.
The second phase of NASA’s CLD plan is to award, in about 2025, big contracts for specific orbital services. The agency hopes that by the middle of the decade at least two companies will be far enough along to secure such contracts, and to begin offering services in orbit shortly thereafter. When the time comes to abandon the ISS, the agency is keen not to be left in the lurch with no human-suitable habitat in orbit around Earth. Experts caution, though, that the ageing space station might not make it to 2028. Some Russian officials, noting spreading cracks and other signs of senescence, have proposed that their country jump ship by 2025.
It could, therefore, get dicey. If no American firm is operating a space station by the time the ISS is abandoned, America’s leadership in space may suffer. To make matters worse from an American point of view, China’s new and expanding space station, Tiangong, could become fully operational next year. Todd Harrison, a space and defence expert at CSIS, an American think-tank, says China’s goal of signing up international partners for Tiangong involves “actively courting” America’s European allies. Were America to find itself bereft of a space station, Britain, France or Germany might, he reckons, join Tiangong.
That seems a stretch, diplomatically speaking, especially given other collaborations between NASA and Europe’s spacefaring powers. But even the raising of such ideas shows that times are changing. Prognosticators would, however, be wise to factor in the ambition and ingenuity of America’s aerospace industry. For an inkling of what might be achieved consider Nanoracks, a company based near Houston that is one of Lockheed Martin’s Starlab partners. In addition to Starlab, Nanoracks is at work on a completely different type of space station that is both more basic and more technologically challenging. This involves converting, in orbit, discarded rocket stages into stations it calls outposts.
The lathes of heaven
The idea of converting rocket stages harks back to Skylab, America’s first space station, which was built, on the ground, out of the third stage of a surplus Saturn V rocket. In this case, though, the conversion will be of the upper stage of one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9s, or a similar rocket, and will be done in space by a small robot affixed to the stage in question.
After the stage achieves orbit, the robot will cut metal and assemble parts to create a docking port, windows and other fixtures. When Jeffrey Manber, Nanoracks’ boss, pitched the idea a half decade ago, he says, “my company laughed at me”. NASA, however, was intrigued. The agency paid for a study on the feasibility of using a robot to convert the upper stage of an Atlas V. The results were promising.
NASA has therefore coughed up more than $12m for a test aloft, planned for January. If all goes well, a robot will soften a sample of metal in orbit by generating frictional heat with a spinning tool, and will then cut that metal without, it is hoped, creating scraps that could become projectiles dangerous to other satellites. This has never yet been done in space. A camera will capture the action, which, for extra safety, will take place inside a containment vessel. A welding test will be launched later, says Robbie Harris, Nanoracks’ head of technology for outposts.
If Mr Manber’s proposal works, building private space stations could become (at least by the standards of space flight) cheap indeed. And the cheaper those stations get, the more uses they may be put to. Orbiting greenhouses intended to develop hardy crops are one idea. Biopharmaceutical laboratories are another. A third, for the truly adventurous, is honeymoon hotels in space. How that will work out in practice remains to be seen. The accommodation will be cramped, for sure, and the champagne may have an unnerving tendency to float out of its glasses. But there is no question that, viewed from out of the porthole at least, the Earth will be moving. ■",1
1740,"UNTIL RECENTLY Li Guangman, the retired editor of an obscure state-owned newspaper who writes leftist screeds online for a few fellow travellers, was unknown to the general public. That changed on August 29th, when the country’s biggest state and party media outlets circulated an incendiary blog post by Mr Li to their huge audiences, causing many to assume his views had official support. This prompted such a stir that a prominent state-media figure—Hu Xijin, editor of Global Times, a jingoistic party tabloid—felt compelled to post a scathing rebuttal.
The episode may have offered a rare glimpse of uncertainty in elite party circles about what exactly President Xi Jinping wants. A year before he is expected to claim a third five-year term as party secretary, Mr Xi is undertaking a populist campaign against inequality, under the slogan “common prosperity for all”. It is unclear how far he intends to take it.

Mr Li hopes very far. Writing under the title “Everyone can feel that a profound change is taking place!”, his article relished recent crackdowns on big business, celebrities and the super-rich. He suggested it was only the beginning of an anti-capitalist, anti-Western campaign that would bring the Communist Party back to its socialist roots. The country was experiencing a moment of “profound revolution”, he wrote. The “red” would soon return and China would no longer be “a paradise for capitalists to get rich overnight” nor “a paradise for effeminate men”.
But Mr Li’s views were too radical even for an establishment populist firebrand like Mr Hu. On September 2nd he wrote a blog post disputing that a “revolution” is at hand, and, in a veiled reference to the excesses of the disastrous Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, called the rhetoric inflammatory. “I am worried that such language will stir up some historical memories,” triggering “confusion and panic”, he wrote. Both posts are still accessible online.
It is highly unusual for state media to promote the rants of obscure bloggers. “He’s a nobody,” says Jude Blanchette of CSIS, a think-tank, and author of “China’s New Red Guards”, a book about neo-Maoists. And Mr Hu’s rebuke of an officially blessed essay was no less rare. What does it all mean?
One commentator with a large following among government officials argues it does not mean much. Ren Yi, whose pen name is Chairman Rabbit, says he believes the initial promotion of Mr Li’s post was “an accident”, and that no senior leaders were pushing it. “Now you are seeing officials doing a lot to calm people down,” says Mr Ren, adding that he was “disgusted” by the piece’s anti-capitalist language. On September 2nd Mr Xi gave a speech announcing a new stock exchange in Beijing to support small business. Four days later Liu He, an economic adviser to Mr Xi, said the private sector was an essential part of the economy and should be given “vigorous” support.
The targets of Mr Xi’s crackdowns might not be so easily comforted. Consider what happened in August. A party commission meditated on Mr Xi’s desire to achieve shared prosperity for all, and resolved that the rich would have to pay more. Tencent, a tech giant, promptly pledged $7.7bn to social programmes. Zheng Shuang, a famous actress, was fined $46m for tax evasion. The Supreme People’s Court declared illegal the 72-hour work week, a fixture in China’s gig economy.
Mr Xi is walking a fine line, needing to show he understands popular anger about inequality without scaring the horses in the new economy. Mr Blanchette sees the debate as a reflection of uncertainty within the establishment about the intensity of Mr Xi’s campaign.
State interventions are immensely popular with leftists like Mr Li, and he has received plenty of online support. One blogger, writing under the pen name “Little Z, a citizen observer”, concluded that Mr Li was “too radical” and Mr Hu “too conservative”. But Little Z mostly supported Mr Li. The “thunderbolt” of recent regulatory actions was an “exciting” harbinger of further coercive measures to reduce the wealth gap, he wrote. “This is only the prologue.” ■",1
1741,"A picture showing a grinning Prince Andrew was on display at Jeffery Epstein's notorious 'Pleasure Palace' where he was accused of molesting teenage girls.
The image, which sat next to a framed photograph of billionaire paedophile Epstein at his former Florida retreat in Palm Beach, shows a smiling Andrew apparently in military uniform in his younger years.
The Duke of York, 61, had previously denied making frequent visits to Epstein's Florida home, despite the former housekeeper Juan Alessi claiming Andrew spent 'weeks at a time' at the property when he was working there.
Sources warned the revelation of a picture being proudly displayed at Epstein's home was 'incredibly damaging' for the embattled royal.
One told the Sun: 'Epstein cultivated powerful friends and would show them off in pictures around all of his homes.
'This is incredibly damaging for Prince Andrew because it shows how highly Jeffrey prized his friendship with a senior member of the Royal Family. His picture was shown off in Jeffrey's home like a trophy.'
Sources indicated the scandal-hit royal faces further public scrutiny as news of the picture emerged.
The source continued: 'Andrew's reputation is hit every time something like this emerges - and he is already facing another year of further lurid headlines.'
In his 2019 Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew admitted he had visited Epstein's Florida home, but denied making repeated visits.
He explained: 'I definitely did not visit his Palm Beach house three or four times a year, absolutely not. In total, probably four times in total throughout the time that I knew him.
'In fact probably that was the place that...if you see what I mean, he was in the house more there than in other...in other places that I was at. But it was usually because I was going...I was going through and on somewhere else so it was a day, that was it.'  
Other newly released pictures showed the financier donning a kilt as he poses with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is pictured elsewhere riding a motorbike near Scotland's Skibo Castle. 
Friday marked the latest development in the Epstein saga, as the Duke of York faces a US lawsuit from Virginia Roberts Giuffre who claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew.
The Duke of York also faced a fresh headache this week when campaigners and experts warned his finances should be investigated by MPs and tax authorities.
Prince Andrew faced mounting scrutiny on Tuesday over whether he broke the Royal Family’s conduct rules by accepting a £1.5million off-shore payment from Tory donor and long-term friend David Rowland.
The Queen’s scandal-hit second son received the payment days before he paid off a loan from the financier’s own Luxembourg bank.
Buckingham Palace conduct rules state that royals should ‘never accept gifts of money, or money equivalent, in connection with an official engagement or duty’.
The Duke of York has previously been accused of attending naked pool parties and receiving massages by Epstein's former butler Juan Alessi, 70.  
Alessi, who started working for Epstein in 1991, has previously been interviewed by the FBI, police and victims' lawyers and said the Prince stayed for 'weeks at a time' in a sworn statement to Palm Beach police in 2005.  
Prince Andrew has consistently denied all sexual allegations made against him.  
Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges that alleged he abused women and girls under the age 18 at the Florida estate and his Manhattan mansion in the early 2000s. 
The waterfront property became the epicentre where he groomed and sexually assaulted underage girls and women as part of a sprawling sex trafficking scheme, prosecutors said.
The house was where the crimes that would eventually lead to his downfall were first reported in 2005.
Epstein had been recruiting underage girls for 'massages' from Palm Beach high school and one eventually confessed to her mother what was going on, who then went to the police.
The girls would be hired to massage Epstein in their underwear or totally naked. Often the massages progressed to sexual touching as Epstein allegedly used vibrators on the girls and masturbated.
He paid them hundreds of dollars at a time with another $200 going to other schoolgirls who recruited them to go to mansion on Palm Beach's El Brillo Way.
Dozens of victims were underprivileged middle and high school girls recruited in and around Palm Beach County between 1998 and 2006.
Earlier this year, demolition crews ripped down the notorious Palm Beach mansion where the financier sexually assaulted young girls. 
The property, which had stood since 1952 and was bought by Epstein in 1990 for around £2million, included a main house, a pool cabana building and another staff house - all of which were demolished.  
Developer Todd Michael Glaser purchased the sprawling Palm Beach estate for $18.5million (£13.7m) and he sighed 'finally' as the first bulldozers began raising the house of horrors to the ground on April 18.

1742,"HUAWEI, A CHINESE firm emblematic of the breakdown in Sino-American relations, makes for a perfect business-school case study. Less than two years ago the company, based in the southern boom town of Shenzhen, had not only surpassed Nokia and Ericsson, its Nordic rivals, to become the world’s leading supplier of telecoms infrastructure. It had also overtaken Samsung to become the biggest seller of mobile phones. Like all good case studies, it has vivid characters, from its founder, Ren Zhengfei, a former army officer and engineer, to his daughter, Meng Wanzhou, just freed from a starring role in the first prisoner-exchange drama of the tech cold war. It is a groundbreaking firm. Like Japan’s Sony in the 1980s, it helped change the perception of its home country from one of cheap knock-offs to eye-catching innovation. And its very future may be in peril. With the long arm of American law enforcement around its neck, it is being throttled by a lack access to cutting-edge technology, such as 5G smartphone chips.
The question is what Huawei ought to do next. Should it tough out American sanctions and hope, as Victor Zhang, its global vice-president, puts it, that its research and development (R) budget, a whopping $21.8bn last year, can “fertilise” a new array of business activities that will redefine its future? Or should it instead quietly break itself up, dispersing a 105,000-strong army of engineers to seed a flurry of new ventures? In short, should it remain a tall poppy or let a hundred smaller flowers bloom?

It is a fairly safe bet that Huawei will take the first option. After all, it is an employee-owned company with a fierce self-belief. It has a never-say-die business culture; its salespeople are renowned for drinking anyone under the table in pursuit of a deal. It could become a national champion for President Xi Jinping’s mission to make the country more self-reliant in technology. And the government in Beijing would hate the idea of it wilting under pressure from Uncle Sam.
The tough-it-out approach is strewn with difficulties, though. Since America’s government branded Huawei’s 5G gear a national-security threat in 2019, and a year later curtailed the firm’s access to chips made with American equipment, its smartphone business, which in 2020 generated more than half of revenues, has cratered. Sales have tumbled from more than 60m units in the last three months of 2019 to about 15m units in the third quarter of 2021, according to Dan Wang of Gavekal Dragenomics, a research firm. In China its latest phones lack 5G connectivity.
Although Huawei remains the world’s number-one supplier of telecoms gear, its sales and market share are shrinking as America’s allies bar it from their 5G networks and other customers fret about its long-term viability. Huawei is putting on a brave face, nonetheless. It is in its “second startup phase”, in Mr Zhang’s words. Each year it pours at least a tenth of its revenues into R (in 2020 the share reached almost 16%). This, Mr Zhang adds, will help build up new core ventures. It is expanding in areas from making cars smarter and helping coal mines become semi-autonomous to infrastructure for cloud-computing and regulating power supply in energy markets. None of these opportunities depends on cutting-edge semiconductors.
Promoting that startup culture in-house may work. But the new endeavours do not generate anything like the revenues of Huawei’s smartphone and networks businesses. One analyst describes the coal venture as “a dying company meets a dying industry”. A better, bolder way forward would be to embrace the Schumpetarian creed of “creative destruction”: let the old firm die so that new ones could emerge, dispersing capital, ideas and talent.
Silicon Valley provides a striking precedent. In 1957 the so-called “traitorous eight” walked out of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to found Fairchild Semiconductor. The “Fairchildren” became the backbone of the area’s high-tech, risk-taking culture, establishing Intel, a chip giant, and scores of other firms, including venture-capital veterans like Kleiner Perkins. Huawei’s engineers at HiSilicon, its chip-design unit, could do something similar. That could advance China’s growing ambitions in the chip industry, illustrated by the unveiling on October 19th by Alibaba, a tech giant, of a new, custom-built, state-of-the-art server chip.
Huawei has no plans for a HiSilicon spin-off, Mr Zhang says. The firm’s tactical retreat in the smartphone business illustrates what it may and may not be able to do. Last year it sold Honor, a niche smartphone brand, to give it the freedom to evade American export controls. Honor’s new phones now have access to American chips and the software and services of Google, an American tech giant, that Huawei still does not. Despite the backing of Shenzhen’s government, which invites questions about just how entrepreneurial Honor will be, the industry’s reaction to the divestiture has been “really positive” both inside and outside China, reports Ben Stanton of Canalys, a telecoms-research firm. Moreover, he reckons, Huawei’s best smartphone engineers have moved to Honor, keeping alive the older firm’s engineering and sales culture.
Tall-poppy syndrome
Unsurprisingly, Honor has also attracted the attention of America’s foreign-policy hawks, including Marco Rubio, a Republican senator who on October 14th called it an “arm of the Chinese Communist Party” and a foreign-policy threat, and urged President Joe Biden’s administration to blacklist it. This is a reminder of how hard it will be for any firm in Huawei’s shadow to shake off such accusations, whether true or not. Better for its engineers to roam free instead. They are likely to be more creative within small groups than inside a corporation—all the more so if what Mr Wang calls “China’s Sputnik moment” engenders a burst of domestic innovation. Huawei’s liberated brain-boxes may then also teach America a lesson in how counterproductive knee-jerk technonationalism can be. ■

1743," (CNN)Now that President Joe Biden has signed his highly sought-after infrastructure bill into law, it is time for Democrats to go out and sell the accomplishment.Building Back Together, the pro-Biden outside organization that formed earlier this year with the White House's blessing, is starting that work with a $10 million ad campaign to tout the infrastructure proposal across the country, including in Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- all states with key Senate races in 2022. If Congress can pass the companion social spending bill currently being negotiated on Capitol Hill, the group plans to use the campaign to tout the possible the legislative accomplishment.The group's first ad of the campaign -- titled ""Long Time Coming"" -- features video of the bipartisan bill signing and focuses on how the law will address supply chain issues in the United States, fix decaying roads and bridges and replace lead pipes to provide clean drinking water.The ad campaign will run through Thanksgiving and air spots in battleground states during highly watched television events, like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and multiple Thanksgiving Day NFL clashes, including Las Vegas Raiders vs. Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears vs. Detroit Lions.""Our goal is to make sure that folks know exactly what has been delivered to them,"" said Danielle Melfi, executive director of Building Back Together. ""We want to make sure we are taking that agenda straight to the American people, not wasting any time to communicate about this president delivering.""Building Back Together also plans to put up billboards near infrastructure projects that were made possible by the newly passed legislation.Biden signed the infrastructure bill on Monday, delivering on his campaign promise to strike a bipartisan deal that addresses the county's aging roads, bridges, and waterways. The President signed the bill in a rare gathering at the White House where he was flanked by both Democrats and Republicans who voted for the bill. The White House now turns its focus to passing a broader social spending bill that has yet to garner the same kind of support from both parties.The legislative win comes days after the Democratic Party suffered a significant defeat in the Virginia gubernatorial election and narrowly won a closer-than-expected race for New Jersey's top executive position. The struggles are seen as warning signs for Democrats headed into the 2022 election cycle. History shows that the party in power -- Democrats control the White House, Senate and House -- often loses seats in the subsequent midterms. Biden's approval has also slumped in recent months. A CNN Poll of Polls, an average of the six most recent nonpartisan, national surveys of adults on Biden's job approval, found that 45% of Americans approve how he is handling his job, compared to 52% of Americans who disapprove of the job he is doing.Top operatives throughout the Democratic Party now believe that selling the infrastructure bill will be critical if the party will be able to stave off historic trends and have a stronger than expected showing in the 2022 midterms. Republican have looked to counter that messaging by highlighting concerns around inflation and a rising cost of living, while Democrats argue passing the two spending bills are the best way to curb rising prices.""We're confident that we're able to make a very clear argument that this is going to lower your costs,"" said Matt Barreto, a senior adviser for Building Back Together. ""People are aware and concerned about costs today, and it is something that infrastructure is, first of all, immediately can start addressing... and the Build Back Better Act is going to continue that.""Biden himself has acknowledged the importance of passing these bills, telling Democrats in the House of Representatives in his final push to pass the bills that he didn't ""think it's hyperbole to say that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week.""""In less than a year, voters will have to rehire the Democratic majority or hire a new Republican one - and Democrats building roads, rebuilding bridges and expanding internet can become a centerpiece of that performance review,"" said Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist. ""If anyone has doubts about the politics of this, you need to only remember how desperate Donald Trump was to do what Joe Biden just got done.""And Building Back Together will be far from alone in selling this bill.Biden himself will stump across the country to sell the accomplishment. The President visited a bridge in Woodstock, New Hampshire, on Tuesday and plans to visit Detroit to tout electric vehicles on Wednesday -- visiting states with significant midterm races. Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as several Cabinet officials, will also hit the road, hoping to tout the local implications in the bill.The Democratic National Committee, too, has pledged to take the bill to the American people in the coming months, with an aide saying the committee plans to stretch out the messaging around the bill to create a ""constant low simmer of engagement around President Biden's achievement, instead of coming out of the gate all at once and then teetering off.""All of this represents an attempt to learn lessons from the past. Democrats believe that former President Barack Obama's administration did not successfully sell the $800 billion Recovery Act passed in 2009 and the fight over the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care overhaul signed into law in 2010, leading Democrats to take significant losses in the 2010 midterms. That cycle, Republicans used the complicated bills as an indictment of Washington, allowing Republicans to take control of the House and narrow the Democratic margin in the Senate. Obama later described the midterms as a ""shellacking.""David Axelrod, Obama's longtime adviser, said selling the infrastructure plan is dramatically different than a complicated health care law, giving him hope that Biden could see success where Obama did not.""The Affordable Care Act was a different challenge because many of its main provisions would not be enacted or felt for years,"" said Axelrod, a CNN contributor. ""In the case of the infrastructure bill, there should be visible projects underway relatively swiftly --physical evidence of progress. The task is to link those community improvements to this bill and this president in the minds of voters.""Melfi said Democrats have ""certainly learned our lesson from that fight,"" noting that one key difference is the broad popularity of infrastructure when compared to the Affordable Care Act.""Each piece of the agenda resonates with Americans across the country and across ideology. But we need to make sure we take credit for it,"" she said. ""We need to make sure folks know what is in this package and how it makes their lives better. And that's why we're getting started early.""This story has been updated.",2
1744,"FOR SEVERAL big reasons it is misleading, even morally indecent, when commentators assert that China is embarking on a new Cultural Revolution. It is true that the Communist Party is today more visible and assertive than at any time since Mao Zedong’s death in 1976. After Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012, he unblushingly re-emphasised the party’s authority over everything from the machinery of state and the armed forces to the judiciary, universities and news media.
It is also true that the rich and famous are under harsher scrutiny than they have known for decades. Tycoons and film stars have received painful reminders that they enjoy their success at the party’s pleasure. Some have lost fortunes or seen careers ended for defying China’s leaders, or for provoking public opinion with displays of swaggering privilege. Others have hastened to donate money and time to patriotic causes. New rules ban effeminate actors from television and curb how many hours youngsters spend on video games. State power is now invested in one man, Mr Xi, in a way not seen since the Mao era. Whether issuing textbooks in Xi Jinping Thought to six-year-old children or using smartphone apps to ensure that officials study Mr Xi’s wisdom, the leader’s sternly paternal presence is felt in every corner of life.

Yet this is not a return of the Cultural Revolution. Most simply, between 1966 and 1976 Mao and his inner circle unleashed such horrors on China that it dishonours their victims to take that decade’s name in vain. Scholars outside China, drawing on often-secret official reports from the 1980s, estimate that 1.6m died, with the lives of many millions more ruined. Much attention has been paid to the youngest Red Guards: Mao-revering students or youths who persecuted everyone from ex-landlords to intellectuals and artists, religious believers and, not least, officials accused of being reactionary. But more casualties died in fighting between rival, adult Red Guard factions or with army units. The violence at times resembled a civil war, set in motion after Mao came to doubt the loyalty and revolutionary fervour of the ruling establishment. In contrast, Mr Xi and his inner circle are iron-fisted party-builders, not friends to rebels. They have purged internal rivals, dissenters and the corrupt. The party is now attacking what it deems the excesses of capitalism. The goal is stability and conformity, with all China marching in lockstep towards national greatness.
Those are large reasons to avoid miscasting Mr Xi as a second Mao. But there are myriad smaller ones, too. By way of a case study, consider an ongoing campaign against “superstitious” ways of mourning the dead, specifically by burning imitation banknotes and paper models of goods that loved-ones might need in the afterlife. In addition to funeral offerings, goods are burned for the dead at various annual holidays. One coming soon is Hanyi Jie, or the Winter Clothing Festival, when paper replicas of warm clothes may be seen burning on city pavements or in village courtyards. In August nationwide debate was sparked by news reports that Shanxi, a northern province, had drafted rules banning the making or selling of funeral supplies, such as paper models of people, horses and houses; or imitation money. This was not the first such online uproar. Other provinces, cities and counties have tried to stop or restrict the burning of paper offerings several times. Officials call the practice superstitious, a source of air pollution, a fire hazard and extravagant, scolding citizens to spend money on caring for the old, not when burying them.
China’s best-known paper funeral-goods come from one place. Mibeizhuang, an unlovely village in Hebei province 120km south of Beijing, was famed for silk flowers as far back the Qing dynasty. Locals boast that wreaths at Mao’s funeral came from Mibeizhuang. The village became a nationwide hub for funeral-goods when market reforms began in the 1980s. When Chaguan visited on a recent weekday, shopkeepers had bundles of paper suits and fur-collared coats ready for Hanyi Jie. A group of four men, funeral organisers from Wu’an, a rural town 400km to the south-west, loaded a small truck with cardboard models of trees covered in gold coins, food-stuffed fridges, televisions and pink, colonnaded mansions. A set of such models sells for less than 50 yuan ($7.76).
For centuries in China, honouring the dead lay at the heart of codes of virtuous behaviour. In imperial times, children studied models of filial piety including Dong Yong, a man so poor that he sold himself into servitude to bury his father properly. During the Cultural Revolution, ancestral and clan temples were ransacked, while family altars in Chinese homes were smashed by Red Guards or hidden for safety by their owners. When victims of Maoist violence were burned or buried without ceremony, the lack of proper rites was an extra stab of agony for grieving families.
The party will not admit it, but Mao traumatised China
Today, once-cherished customs have a markedly weaker grip. Asked whether customers believe that burned funeral-goods reach relatives in the afterlife, traders in Mibeizhuang are incredulous. “What day and age is this? It is just a tradition,” says one. A third-generation seller of paper offerings scoffs: “I don’t even believe in it. Spending money on this stuff is like throwing it away.”
The traders have watched injunctions against their industry tightening for years, especially in cities. They are cynical, saying that officials who oppose burning funeral-goods will sneak home to burn paper models for their own parents. But they are resigned to the possibility that their trade may end one day. “We set off firecrackers for thousands of years. Now it is not allowed and has stopped,” explains one, calling modern-day Chinese “obedient”.
It is hard to start new rows about feudal superstition, precisely because the Cultural Revolution tore up so many roots that tied Chinese to the past. Today’s China is bossy, socially conservative and relentlessly controlling. Its rise as an authoritarian giant is disruptive enough without mistaking it for Maoist fanaticism.■",1
1745,"IMAGINE, IF YOU will, a toy boat that might fit in the palm of your hand. At mid-ship add a squat spool of sewing thread lying on its side. Scale that up about a thousand-fold and the result is the 150-metre-long Nexans Aurora. The thread in question is kilometres of high-voltage power line ready to be deployed from the aft of the ship across the sea floor. Each cable, weighing a hefty 150kg per metre and thick as a tree trunk, is a woven mix of aluminium, steel, lead and insulating material. The single stretch loaded up in a bobbin nearly 30 metres across is as heavy as the Eiffel Tower.

The ways electricity is both consumed (more of it, notably by cars) and produced (also more of it, increasingly through renewable sources, see chart 1) are changing. Balancing the supply and demand of energy is never easy, as recent mayhem in European gas prices have shown. It is all the more complex for electricity, which is trickier to store than not just gas, but also coal, diesel or wood chips. Renewables add more wrinkles: wind blows haphazardly; the sun can be obscured by clouds or night. As a result, most of the power that is produced has to be consumed immediately, and mostly in the place that produces it.
The idea of separating consumption from production in time—using giant batteries or other storage—has received plenty of attention from entrepreneurs, politicians and investors. But this is currently impractical at scale. So the notion of separating the two in space instead is gaining ground. It requires an upgrade in the behind-the-scenes wiring that carries power from where it is made to where it is used. The task can involve plugging an offshore wind farm into the main grid. Also needed are connections joining up national networks, often within blocs where most of today’s electricity trade takes place, notably the EU.

Either way, cables are needed, and boats to lay some of them. The potential is vast. Just 4.3% of power generated in 2018 by members of the OECD, a club of industrialised countries, was exported, up from 2% in the 1970s but a far cry from a fungible commodity like oil.

All this has resulted in surging order-books for cable-makers and -layers like Nexans, the Nexans Aurora’s eponymous French owner. Credit Suisse, a bank, forecasts undersea wiring alone to bring in revenue of around €5.5bn ($6.4bn) in 2022, up from €4.5bn this year. It expects cable firms’ revenues from offshore wind installations to more than treble in size between 2020 and 2035. Investor enthusiasm around electric cables has sent share prices of Nexans and the industry’s two other European giants, NKT and Prysmian, up by 48-125% in the past two years (see chart 2). In February Nexans announced that it would soon spin out its non-electric cables business (catering to industry and data centres) to focus on transmission lines.
Power imbalance
Satisfying see-sawing electricity demand is complicated but well understood. British grid managers have long known how to turn on power plants just as soap-operas end and tea-craving viewers turn on their kettles. Connecting power grids with different production and consumption patterns is equivalent, matching supply and demand by transferring electricity across distance instead.
Take Denmark. It has installed enough wind turbines that, when it blows, no other source of electric power is required. But it needs a Plan B, given the fickleness of wind. Without batteries it could keep old fossil-fuel plants open, and use them intermittently. A more elegant solution is a cable to Norway, which has ample hydroelectric potential. When the wind blows, both places can use Danish wind power, keeping Norwegian water in reservoirs. On calm days the Norwegian lakes are drained a bit faster to succour Denmark.
Further links from Denmark to Holland, Sweden, Germany and Britain (planned for 2023) provide yet more options. Add enough links to enough places, and electricity becomes a tradable commodity. For a local grid manager, reducing carbon emissions becomes a case of buying and selling the right contract rather than building a solar or wind farm in the wrong place.
That prospect means such interconnections are surging. Europe is the new frontier of cable-laying. Electrification, notably through renewables, is a key plank of its ambitions to reach “net zero” emissions by 2050. National grids have been compelled by EU rules to integrate into a single network, often backed with public cash. The continent’s scraggy coastline means lots of wind power—and also the opportunity to deploy electric cables at sea, away from where anyone might object to them being laid.
Shifting power-generation dynamics play a part. Germany, for example, was once a big exporter of power but is becoming an importer as it finishes shutting down its nuclear plants and phases out coal. The green push also means electricity is being generated in all the wrong places. In Italy, power plants were built near where industry was located, mostly in the north of the country. Now the wind blows and sun shines mainly in the less-developed south. “The shift to renewables means we need more rebalancing, more transition,” says Stefano Antonio Donnarumma of Terna, an Italian manager of transmission lines.
As a result, the making and deploying of electric cable is one of the rare industrial sectors that European firms dominate. Prysmian is Italian, NKT is Danish and Nexans is French. They have around 80% market share outside China, where demand is largely met locally. Beyond merely manufacturing woven metal wires (among other products), they lay them as well, commissioning and operating ships like the Nexans Aurora, a €170m craft fitted up the coast from an existing Nexans factory in Halden, Norway.
Advances in undersea cable-laying have helped open up the prospect of new and novel interconnections. Whereas previous generations of ships risked tipping over if sending wires much below 1,200 metres, the Nexans Aurora and a flotilla of similar ships from its rivals can lay wires at depths of 3,000 metres. (An accompanying robot can lay a trench in shallower waters, the better to protect against stray anchors and fishing nets.) That opens up the Mediterranean. This week the Nexans Aurora was preparing to deploy her first cable, connecting the island of Crete to the Greek mainland.
Longer cables mean fewer legs of 100km or so that need to be stitched together. The viability of much longer interconnectors is being mooted as a result. A 720km Norway-to-Britain link started operating this month. Many are in various stages of planning, for example hooking up Greece and Israel, or Ireland and France. Others are more speculative, such as a 3,800km cable linking the sun-baked solar fields of Morocco with Britain. Another consortium wants to link Australia, Indonesia and Singapore, a 4,200km project.
Christopher Guérin, boss of Nexans, says 72,000km of such interconnection cables will be laid in the decade to 2030, a seven-fold increase. That comes on top of wiring needed to upgrade antiquated connections on land, many of which are past their sell-by date. A power crisis in Texas earlier this year helped unlock stimulus funds for grid upgrades in America, too.
A more immediate opportunity is hooking up wind farms to onshore power grids. Cable salesmen are cheered by the fact that more and more such facilities are being developed far out at sea. The possibility of floating wind farms, which could be farther away still, will add to their order books. The International Energy Agency, a rich-country energy club, estimates 80 gigawatts of offshore wind farms will have to be installed every year by 2030 to meet decarbonisation targets. Each gigawatt of offshore capacity requires around €250m of cable input including the installation, says Max Yates of Credit Suisse. The cable costs roughly as much as the foundations, both second only to the turbine itself.
The urgency of this global rewiring effort is almost imperceptible from the deck of the Nexans Aurora. Spools release their wire at a leisurely pace: 10-12km a day is considered tidy work. But the future energy highways are at last becoming a reality. Steady as she goes.",1
1746,"THE ADVISORY Committee to Inspect National Security Aspects of Foreign Investments is the dull title for one of the more secret and sensitive bodies in the Israeli government. Its membership is unknown and meetings are held under a blanket of opacity. It is essentially a committee to assess deals with China. It was set up in 2020 after pressure from America, which was concerned that China could be getting Israeli weapons technology. The committee’s chilling effect on trade and ties with China is already being felt.
Although there is no official policy or written directive banning Chinese investments in key areas of the economy, there has been a marked slowdown in new deals. “The Americans made it clear to us that they would not accept any Chinese involvement in critical infrastructure and Israel belatedly got the message,” says a former Israeli minister in the government that left office on June 13th.

In May 2020, for instance, Israel rejected a bid by Hutchison Water, a Chinese firm, to build a desalination plant. Chinese firms are still involved in previously signed infrastructure projects, including the new Tel Aviv light-rail network. But Israel, under American pressure, is discreetly trying to replace the Shanghai International Port Group, which is set to manage a new container terminal in Haifa Port, with an Emirati company.
“In the past we got a lot less guidance from the government on how to do business with China,” says one Israeli executive who has spent over a decade working on Chinese investment. “Now things are a lot clearer. They can invest in fields like foodtech and fintech, but not in anything cyber- or security-related and not in infrastructure.” Chinese investment in Israeli tech companies has fallen from 72 deals in 2018 to 45 in 2020. This can be explained partly by the pandemic and new regulations within China on foreign-currency transfers, but also by what one Israeli diplomat calls the “recalibration of relations”.
“Under Netanyahu, Israel felt that it could have its cake and eat it—do business with the Chinese without the Americans being angry with us,” says Doron Ella, an expert on Israel-China relations at the Institute for National Security Studies, a think-tank in Tel Aviv. “It took Israel time to realise the extent to which the US now sees China as its chief rival.” ■",1
1747,"WHEN DONALD TRUMP descended his escalator six years ago and inveighed against Mexican rapist immigrants, it was assumed that Hispanic voters would take offence. But a short hop across the Hudson river, in heavily Hispanic Passaic City, Angel Castillo loved what he heard. “Trump kept it real,” recalled the 43-year-old immigrant, over a cup of strong Dominican coffee in his small family restaurant, El Primito. “He didn’t say all Latinos are rapists. He said a lot of those coming over the border are rapists and drug-dealers and he’s right.”
Though a registered Democrat, Mr Castillo resolved to vote Republican thenceforth. Many of his relatives (a few of whom are illegal immigrants) were horrified: “People said you’re crazy, you’re voting for a racist.” Yet his wife, mother, brother, sister and teenage daughter followed his lead. This puts them in the most intriguing, hotly studied and potentially decisive cohort in American politics: Hispanic Trump voters.

Their emergence as a major electoral force was the big surprise of last year’s election. It saw a huge turnout by Hispanic voters, helping Joe Biden to victory in Arizona and Nevada. Yet it also featured a pronounced Hispanic tilt to Mr Trump. Initially thought to have been a localised phenomenon—which cost Mr Biden Florida and any hope of victory in Texas—it turned out to be nationwide. With around 38% of the Hispanic vote, Mr Trump won a higher share than any recent Republican presidential candidate apart from George W. Bush, a pro-immigrant Texan, in 2004. And last week’s elections in New Jersey—including Governor Phil Murphy’s brush with political death—suggests the shift may endure.
Passaic City, a decaying factory-town where seven in ten voters are Latino, helps illustrate it. In 2016 Mr Trump won 22% of the vote there, almost the same as Mitt Romney had. Four years of relentless immigrant-bashing and race-baiting later, he bagged 36%. Mr Murphy’s Republican challenger, Jack Ciattarelli, appears to have held on to that gain; when vote-counting finishes, a third of the commissioners of Passaic County could be Republican.
The overarching explanation for this development is suggested by the many alternative cuisines, Mexican, Colombian, Peruvian, Venezuelan, Puerto Rican, available within a few steps of El Primito. Hispanics are incomparably more diverse than the earlier waves of immigrants—Irish, Italian, Polish, Hungarian—who turned Passaic from a 19th-century fur trading-post into an industrial hub. They also lack the labour unions that bound those hordes into the Democratic fold. The assumption that Mr Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric would make Hispanics recoil in unison took too little note of their differences. While some have done so—especially young, college-educated Hispanics—the extreme polarisation of the Trump era has pushed others to the right.
Ronald Reagan quipped that hard-working, religious, communism-hating Hispanics were Republican even if they didn’t know it. In his different way, Mr Trump has hammered those same issues. He endeared himself to Miami’s Cuban exiles by calling the Democrats socialists. His claim to defend Christianity wooed Hispanic evangelicals everywhere. Hector Fernandez, a 69-year-old evangelical minister in Passaic, was another first-time Republican voter in 2016. “I don’t love the Republicans but my Christian values compel me to vote for them,” he said—and estimated that over half his congregation voted for Mr Trump last year.
The former president’s strong ratings on the economy, based on his wealth and claim to be a job-creating genius, also attracted the community. “Imagine coming to America from a poor country and seeing Trump’s name on a building!” says Passaic’s thoughtful mayor, Hector C. Lora, a son of Dominican immigrants. Mr Trump’s pivot to raging against economic lockdowns after covid-19 hit probably increased that advantage. Hispanics typically own small businesses, which were hard-hit by the lockdowns, the mayor noted. They also have reason to dislike government diktat.
The excesses of Latin politics perhaps also made it easy for some Hispanics to shrug off Mr Trump’s bigotry. “We are used to vitriolic rhetoric,” says Mr Lora. Yet others liked it—as Mr Castillo illustrates. “Immigrants used to come here to work,” said the restaurateur. “Now they come here and jump straight into government assistance, just like other races in this country.” You need not be Anglophone or America-born to find Mr Trump’s white nationalism and nativism seductive. And Hispanic Trump fans are just as easily radicalised as whites. Mr Castillo is a covid anti-vaxxer who suggests that Mr Biden’s election was not on the level.
It is hard to exaggerate the importance of this development. Republican strategists had considered Mr Trump’s chauvinism incompatible with the coalition-expanding embrace of diversity many recommended after Mr Romney’s defeat. But it appears not to be—and for Democrats that looks disastrous.
The party’s decades-long decline in the white, conservative and electorally crucial Midwest appears irreversible. Even if it could excise its leftist fringe—a kiss of death in such places—mainstream liberal causes such as minority, immigrant and reproductive rights are too toxic there for Democrats to progress. To remain competitive, they must therefore build new strongholds in diverse states such as Florida and Texas. But, as Mr Biden’s failures showed, this requires them to maintain Obama-esque levels of Hispanic support.
The dwindling Democratic majority
Harping on immigration reform, the Democrats’ default response, will not deliver that. Millions of Hispanics are hardly concerned with the issue. Yet it is hard to identify a liberal approach to the diverse and fracturing Hispanic community that would be more popular. Democrats had hoped Hispanics would compensate for the illiberal drift of working-class whites. Yet a sizeable minority of them appear to be following the same inexorable course.■

Sir David Amess, who represented the town of Southend, to the east of London, was stabbed to death while holding one of his weekly consultations with constituents.

Health-service leaders in Britain called for the immediate reimposition of pandemic measures, such as masks in public places and work-from-home orders. Deaths from covid-19 are at their highest level since March, though still less than 10% of the peak in January. The government said infections could reach 100,000 a day over the winter, but it was not planning to reintroduce restrictions. The British Medical Association described that as “wilfully negligent”.
In Russia Vladimir Putin backed a plan to keep workers at home for a week to curb a tide of covid-19 infections. It will be the closest Russia has come to a lockdown.
The European Parliament awarded its annual Sakharov prize to Alexei Navalny, Russia’s leading opposition figure, who has been imprisoned after surviving an assassination attempt by Russian agents.
Ursula von der Leyen vowed that the European Commission will punish Poland after its constitutional court, acting on a legal request from the prime minister, ruled that parts of the EU treaties are not compatible with Polish law. The commission president’s threat is directed against Polish access to some €57bn ($66bn) in funds for recovery from the pandemic.
A primary involving members of six opposition parties in Hungary chose Peter Marki-Zay, the mayor of a small town, as their joint candidate to take on Viktor Orban, the prime minister, in elections due next spring. The parties will also field joint candidates for all parliamentary seats. 
A panel of senators in Brazil recommended in a draft report that Jair Bolsonaro, the president, be charged with crimes against humanity, among other things, for playing down the covid-19 virus and failing to tackle it. Mr Bolsonaro, who has told Brazilians to “stop whining” about the disease, is unlikely to stand trial. More than 600,000 of his countrymen have died.
Thousands of people protested in El Salvador against President Nayib Bukele. Salvadoreans are angry about the introduction of bitcoin as legal tender and decisions that have eroded democracy, such as the dismissal of judges. Responding to the protests, Mr Bukele changed his Twitter profile to “Emperor of El Salvador”.
A group of 17 American and Canadian missionaries, including children, were abducted by a gang in Haiti. The Caribbean country already had one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world, but the security situation has deteriorated since the assassination in July of the then president, Jovenel Moïse. Emboldened gangs are vying for territory.
Seven people were killed and dozens injured in Lebanon when gunfire broke out at a protest against the judge investigating last year’s explosion at Beirut’s port. The rally was organised by the country’s two main Shia parties, Hizbullah and Amal, which are unhappy with the probe. They blamed the violence on a Christian faction, which denied involvement.
A bomb attack on an army bus in Damascus killed 14 people, according to Syrian state media. Though the country is still fighting a decade-old civil war, attacks in the capital have become rare. No group claimed responsibility, but the army responded by shelling the opposition-held Idlib region, reportedly killing ten people.
The Democratic Republic of Congo accused Rwandan troops of crossing its border and invading several villages, leading to clashes with Congolese soldiers. Rwanda said its men were only chasing smugglers and that it wished to maintain friendly relations.
Ethiopia bombed Mekelle, the main city in the breakaway province of Tigray, in an escalation of the year-long civil war. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, also threatened to stop all food aid coming into the country. That would further hamper efforts to avert famine in Tigray, which is under a blockade.
Deleting its profile
Microsoft said it would shut down its local version in China of LinkedIn, a professional networking site. A LinkedIn executive wrote that the service was facing a “significantly more challenging operating environment” there.
China denied reports that it had tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August. It was subsequently reported that there had been two tests, the first in July.

North Korea confirmed that it had tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it is prohibited from doing by the UN. The missile landed in the Sea of Japan. The launch comes against a backdrop of increasing missile tests by both North and South Korea in recent weeks, causing concern about an accelerating arms race.
Floods and landslides killed more than 150 people in India and Nepal after heavy rain that lasted several days. The subcontinent’s monsoon generally recedes by October, but changing weather patterns have made it more unpredictable.
India has now dispensed 1bn covid-19 vaccines. More than 60% of the population has received one jab, and around a quarter have had two doses.
America’s Justice Department asked the federal Supreme Court to suspend a law in Texas that in effect bans  abortion, arguing that it contravenes decades of constitutional precedent. The law has been crafted in such a way as to allow private citizens to sue anyone who assists in an abortion. Its backers say that is legally a deterrent, and not a ban.",1
1749,"THE FACTS are damning. Owen Paterson, a former Tory Cabinet minister now on the backbenches, was paid £9,000 ($12,700) a month for consulting work by two companies, one and a half times his parliamentary salary. And, sure enough, he earned his keep by lobbying ministers and officials on their behalf. The commissioner for standards, an independent officer, concluded that he had brought Parliament into disrepute.
Its cross-party standards committee recommended a 30-day suspension. But on November 3rd, in a scheme cooked up barely 24 hours earlier, Tory MPs voted, under instruction from the government, to sidestep the whole sleazy mess by creating a new committee to examine the way MPs are overseen. Mr Paterson’s case will thus be reconsidered. It was as if an appellate court had found a guilty verdict legally correct but unpalatable, and decided to change the law rather than pass sentence.

Mr Paterson’s defenders argued not on substance but on procedures, which they said were unfair, even though Parliament wrote them and could have changed them at any time in the past. Some said he had been treated more harshly because he was a Conservative and a Brexiteer—the standards committee is chaired by a (respected) Labour MP. Yet Mr Paterson blatantly broke the rules. This week’s vote compounded his offences by also, shamelessly, bringing Parliament into disrepute.
This tawdry episode adds to a pattern set by the government of Boris Johnson. Having strode victorious into Downing Street as one of the architects of Brexit, the prime minister behaves as if laws are for other people. Lord Frost, the government’s Brexit negotiator, is demanding that the EU rewrite aspects of the withdrawal treaty relating to Northern Ireland that Britain signed up to in a push to get Brexit done. In September 2020 Sir Jonathan Jones, the head of the government legal service, advised that the government’s plan to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal deal would break international law. Mr Johnson ignored his advice, so Sir Jonathan felt obliged to resign.
The prime minister is also seeking to undermine Britain’s precarious system of checks and balances. When officials responsible for holding ministers to account have tried to do their job, they are made to suffer. Two months after Sir Jonathan quit, an independent adviser on the ministerial code reported that Priti Patel, the home secretary, had bullied underlings. When Mr Johnson said he would ignore that report, too, the official followed Sir Jonathan out of the door.
The government is neutering independent bodies supposed to hold it to account. It wants to put the Electoral Commission, a watchdog, under the thumb of a Conservative-dominated committee of MPs, and to strip it of the power to initiate criminal prosecutions. It is trying to parachute in Paul Dacre, a former editor of the Daily Mail, a tub-thumping Brexiteer and all-round scourge of liberals, as the boss of Ofcom, the media regulator, even though the appointment panel concluded that his lack of impartiality made him “unappointable”. The MP who leads the parliamentary committee concerned with culture and the media has said publicly that, in choosing its next political editor, the BBC should pick a Brexiteer.
The government is also trying to tame the courts. It wants to tighten rules governing judicial review of public bodies’ decisions. An egregious proposal by the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, would make it easier and quicker to change court rulings that it deems to be wrong. Rather than defending judicial independence, the attorney-general, Suella Braverman, has joined the attack, implying that in some cases related to Brexit pro-European sentiment meant judges had entered the political arena.
As we write this, the government was starting to have second thoughts about Mr Paterson. After a furious backlash and opposition threats to boycott the new committee, it pledged to seek cross-party support for changes to the system. It is not too late for Mr Johnson to learn the moral from this sleazy affair. Britain’s constitution grants the executive great latitude. Having brought Britain out of the EU against the wishes of the “liberal elite”—by which they mean everyone from judges to journalists—Brexiteers see themselves as beholden to no one. If the government continues to act as if rules are for losers, it will bring democracy itself into disrepute. ■

1750,"AS THE COVID-19 pandemic abates and athletes everywhere prepare to return to the arena, new light is being shed on a serious risk they face. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of four that hold the knee together. Tearing it, as at least 2m people do every year, is among the most immobilising injuries someone can sustain. ACL tears are usually a consequence of an awkward movement in a fast-paced game such as football. The surgery and rehabilitation needed cost billions of dollars a year. It is becoming increasingly clear just how devastating—and possibly preventable—this injury really is.
Doctors have always recognised ACL tears as serious, but used to think that returning to the fray was possible six months after surgery. Elizabeth Gardner, head orthopaedic surgeon at Yale University Athletics, reckons, however, that nine months to a year is more realistic. That is a significant chunk of an athlete’s career. Even then, surgery alone is no guarantee of recovery. Re-tear rates are as high as 20%, “a lot higher than you would expect for a surgery that we think we do really well and is so ridiculously well studied”, Dr Gardner says. On top of this, recent investigations suggest that as many as three-quarters of those who suffer an ACL tear go on to develop arthritis of the knee 15-20 years later.

ACL tears are increasingly frequent. In 2018 researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital found that, over the course of a decade, the number of them relative to other orthopaedic problems had tripled among Americans aged under 18. This may be a consequence of moves towards single-sport specialisation in American schools. The reduced variety of body-movements thus engendered tends to focus strain repeatedly on particular parts of the body.
Recent studies in countries around the world, including Australia, Finland and Norway, support the idea that more young people than ever before are sustaining ACL injuries. Australia’s sports authorities, in particular, are trying to discourage overspecialisation by schools. Another reason for the increase may be artificial turf, which has become much more widespread in schools in the past couple of decades. There is evidence that in some sports, notably American football, this surface is linked with a higher rate of ACL injuries.
One of the most curious features of ACL tears, though, is that they afflict women far more often than men—as much as eight times more, some investigations suggest. Why, is the subject of intensive research. But a clue may lie in an apparent connection with the menstrual cycle.
A study published in 2013, of a group of women skiers in the Alps, found, for example, that those in the pre-ovulatory stage of their cycles were more than twice as likely to suffer an ACL tear than were those in the post-ovulatory stage. A four-year survey of 113 female England footballers, published in March, also found a clear correlation. Muscle and tendon injuries were far more common in the late follicular phase of the cycle, just prior to ovulation, than in the other phases.
Ex-cruciating
The reason for this menstrual-cycle link is unclear. The body’s oestrogen levels spike just before ovulation—the point when tear-frequency rises—and the ACL has oestrogen receptors, so this might help explain what is happening. But the ACL is not alone among ligaments in sporting such receptors, and uncertainty remains about the true connection.
Other contributory factors to women’s higher ACL-tear rates may be female body shapes and movement patterns. Compared with men, women have wider hips, more-inverted knees and “over-dominant” quad muscles (meaning that the quadriceps femoris muscle group in front of the thigh bone is relatively stronger than the hamstring group behind it). All these things put pressure on the elaborate workings of the knee joint. Women also tend to land in a more flat-footed manner than men do, and to pivot more awkwardly.
Anatomy is what it is, so not much can be done about sex differences in hip shape and knee orientation. All athletes, however, can be trained how to move more safely, and this is particularly relevant for women. Straightforward exercise classes in balance and agility have been found to reduce ACL tears by 50%. Strengthening the muscles around the knee—especially the hamstring—with focused exercises is another way to reduce the chances of a tear.
Dealing with the menstrual cycle has, in the past, been trickier, since it entails individual athletes keeping detailed track of their cycles. Modern gadgetry makes this easier. For example, the American women’s football team (proper football, not the gridiron sort), who are the current world champions, use FitrWoman, an app that monitors a user’s cycle and tells her on which days it may be risky to train intensely. This is something that the team’s quondam high-performance coach, Dawn Scott, reckons contributed to their retention of the World Cup in 2019. And back in football’s home country, England, FitrWoman is also making a mark. The women’s team at Chelsea football club, who won this year’s Super League, have adopted the app as well.
This is the sort of thing that could be encouraged more widely, by introducing it into school and college sports. That does, though, require an awareness of the problem—and this is still lacking. In 2019, for example, St Mary’s University, Twickenham, in England, conducted a survey of more than 14,000 female athletes. It revealed that 81% of those with coaches never discussed with them the impact of their menstrual cycles on training. Nearly three-quarters said they had received no education regarding the cycle’s effect on their exercise regimes and fitness, and vice versa.
The topic of menses can be taboo even at the highest level of sport. In 2015 Heather Watson, a British tennis player, withdrew from the Australian Open citing “girl things”. She was applauded for publicly linking her performance to her period, even in the vaguest of terms, which is still a rarity among professional athletes. From the top to the bottom of women’s sport, then, a bit more openness and physiological realism might work wonders for knee preservation and the avoidance of problems in later life. Considering the rigour of modern athletes’ training regimes, it is surprising this is not already happening. ■

1751,"Three Colorado teenagers were wounded during a shootout in an Aurora high school parking lot Friday less than a week after six teens were hit by bullets in a drive-by at a different school - in the city that gained infamy eight years ago when a dozen people were killed at a movie theater during a midnight screening of Batman.
Two students from Hinkley High and one from the nearby APS Avenues High School were rushed to the hospital, with one of the teens believed to be the suspect that opened fire on the other two before being shot. 
'We have kids shooting each other with no concern for life whatsoever,' Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said. 
Wilson said multiple people were firing shots during the fight before a school security officer 'heroically' came out to return fire and end the gun battle.  
Wilson would not say if the security officer wounded any of the students, but he applied a tourniquet to one of the victims as emergency responders arrived at the scene. 
The school was placed on lockdown before students were released to their homes.
None of the shooting victims were identified. 
Police have taken possession of a white pickup truck believed to be involved in the incident. 
The shootings come less than a week after six teenagers were injured in a drive-by shooting on Monday near Aurora Central High School.
'This is the second shooting in Aurora this week that has impacted students' ability to feel safe at school,' Aurora's District Attorney John Keller said in a statement. 
'No Child or teenager should be fearful just going to class - a normal activity we can all relate to. Our community rightly is demanding an end to this violence, and we will stand with them in using every tool we have to prosecute aggressively anyone connected to these attacks on students.'  
Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly called the two recent shootings 'heartbreaking.' 
'I cannot begin to imagine the pain and anguish experienced by the victims and their families. We must commit our time and resources to the city’s Youth Violence Prevention Program and our public safety partners to identify ways for increased involvement and better solutions,' Twombly said in a statement.  
Monday's victims, aged 14 to 18, were shot by 'multiple gunmen' at Nome Park, which is adjacent to the Aurora Central High School, police said.
‘I need us all to be outraged by what happened here today,’ Wilson told reporters at a news conference after the shootings. 
Investigators recovered various calibers of bullets from the scene, leading them to believe multiple gunmen opened fire, although no arrests had been made yet.
Witnesses recalled hearing upward of 50 gunshots as students fled the park at around 12:45 p.m. Monday, Fox 31 reported. 
School resource officers applied a tourniquet to two injured teenagers, one of whom was taken to a hospital for emergency surgery, Wilson said, adding that none of the victims suffered life-threatening injures. 
The victims were a 14-year-old boy, a 15-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl, a 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old boy, police said. None of them were identified. 
A nurse who lives in the area heard the barrage of gunfire and rushed to the victims' aid. 
'One was shot in the arm. Her arm was injured badly. Another boy was shot in the back and on his leg,' she told KDVR
'So, we did put a tourniquet on his leg. Applied pressure on his back, tourniquet on the girl’s arm. Another girl had multiple injuries on her back.'   
Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman issued a statement following Monday's shooting.
'My prayers are with the injured and their families,' he tweeted.
‘As the facts surrounding this incident become known, I look forward to hearing from our Chief of Police and from our District Attorney about what actions will be taken to apprehend and prosecute, to the fullest extent of the law, those responsible for this incident.'
Aurora, a city of approximately 336,000 located about 30 miles east of Denver, was the site of the second deadliest shooting in Colorado history after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. 
On July 20, 2012, James Holmes, dressed in tactical gear, barged into a midnight screening of Dark Knight Rises at Century 16 movie theater and opened fire on the audience, killing 12 and injuring 70 others.  
Holmes was later convicted of multiple counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to 12 life sentences.  ",3
1752,"A father has died just three weeks after being diagnosed with cancer.
Jamie Christie, 40, who worked in a steel plant in Scunthorpe, Linconshire, lost his battle with the disease on November 12, nine days after marrying long-term girlfriend Sophie Christie in an emotional service. 
Friends and family rushed to organise the wedding after Jamie, who has eight-year-old son Dudley, discovered on October 21 that he had oesophageal cancer which had spread to his spine, liver, and other organs. 
Oesophageal cancer, which typically affects people in their 60s and 70s, is difficult to detect in the early stages due to a lack of symptoms. 
Jamie, described as a 'gentle giant' by friends, went to the doctor after feeling unwell and experiencing symptoms. 
Since his death, Jamie's friends have set up a donation page to raise money to support his wife and son.   
His close friend Lee Gibb, 40, said it was 'crazy' how quickly his health had declined. 
Lee said: 'He was probably one of the fittest people you've ever met in your life.
'He was a gym enthusiast, he was a boxer, and he used to play rugby for Scunthorpe rugby club. He was a sportsman, and he didn't smoke. It's just been absolutely crazy.'
Lee explained Jamie was diagnosed after he went to the doctors to undergo tests. 
He continued: 'They then gave him two to eight weeks to live - he was absolutely riddled with cancer. The doctor has even said, ""We can't believe he's stood in front of us.""'
Within a matter of days, Jamie's friends put a plan in place for him to wed his long-term girlfriend, Sophie, who he had been in a relationship with for years.
The couple chose Scunthorpe Rugby Club as their marriage venue, where Jamie played regularly, and the event was fixed for November 3.
Oesophageal cancer is a disease caused by tumours growing in the food pipe between the mouth and stomach.
The cancer is most common among people in their 60s and 70s and affects more men than it does women.
Oesophageal cancer can be hard to spot because it doesn't cause any symptoms in its earlier stages, and only becomes noticed once the tumour has grown.
Symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, persistent indigestion or heartburn, loss of appetite, weight loss, and pain in the torso, chest or back. 
Survival rates are not high for oesophageal cancer, with only 12 per cent of people surviving for 10 years after a diagnosis.
Six out of 10 patients die within a year of being diagnosed, according to Cancer Research UK.
The exact cause of the disease isn't well known but smoking, drinking too much alcohol, being overweight or having an unhealthy diet are believed to increase someone's risk of getting it.

On the day itself, Lee said that despite his physical struggles, he'd never Jamie looking so happy.
He said: 'I've never seen him smile so much in my life, and I've known him for 30 years. You could see that the cancer was attacking him, and you could see his weight loss and the tiredness in his eyes and everything else.
'But the smile on his face will stay with me for the rest of my life. He just smiled from morning until night.'
He added: 'Jamie was just a strong character. He didn't whinge about what was going on. He didn't shed a tear at the wedding about it. He just stayed strong all the way through to the end.'
Lee said that though they did everything they could to make it a celebratory day, for many at the event, it also felt like a final 'goodbye'.
'We had him up singing, we tried to make it the best we could for him, but it was also a goodbye for a lot of people as well.
'It was a crazy day, but we all put our brave faces on for Sophie and Jamie and celebrated the wedding.'
Jamie died on November 12, nine days after his wedding, and Lee and his other close friends were informed soon after.
He said: 'Jamie passed on the Friday at 9:45 at night. The family kept it quiet until the Saturday morning, then we rang each other. We all met at the pub on Sunday and raised a glass to him.
He added: 'Our social media in our area has been taken over by Jamie since he passed away. It's just everywhere and everyone. I've never seen anything like it after someone's passing.'

1753,"FOR CHINESE leaders, the rows about AUKUS, a new security pact between America, Australia and Britain, confirm cherished prejudices about the Western world. China has always believed that America’s network of global alliances is a cover for hegemony, even if American leaders offer warm words about defending universal values, standing up for friends and opposing “attempts by stronger countries to dominate weaker ones”, as President Joe Biden did at the UN on September 21st.
Chinese suspicions are, in this case, bolstered by French anger over AUKUS, which was born out of Australia’s decision to break a deal to buy diesel-electric submarines from France, in favour of buying nuclear-powered ones from America. When a French government minister accused Britain of returning to the American fold and “accepting a form of vassal status”, that was a vindication for China. Indeed, the Frenchman’s attack could be printed, without alteration, in the People’s Daily, a mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party. For all that, at least to date, the Chinese official response has been a study in caution, avoiding loud expressions of solidarity with France. That is revealing, because China normally praises French leaders when they call for Europe to pursue “strategic autonomy” in its foreign and security policies. Chinese diplomats know that France’s vision of autonomy is code for avoiding over-reliance on America.

Instead, China has so far pursued narrower, rather technical lines of attack on AUKUS, related to the eight nuclear-propelled submarines that Australia is to buy from America. China’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a nuclear watchdog, accused America of undermining non-proliferation work by transferring nuclear know-how and weapons-grade uranium to Australia, saying this would make it harder to stop Iran and North Korea from seeking similar technologies. The foreign ministry in Beijing added some tut-tutting about countries forming small cliques. By the standards of recent America-bashing in China, such grumbles barely count as throat-clearing.
After speaking to various wise owls in Beijing, both Chinese and foreign, Chaguan has explanations to offer. It is true that AUKUS confirms prejudices dear to Chinese officials and scholars. The first of these is that power is the driver of geopolitics, even if smaller countries talk of putting their faith in multinational co-operation, the rules-based order and other pretty phrases. If Australia would rather be America’s vassal than France’s partner, that merely confirms China’s bleak, might-makes-right worldview. That view is reflected in lectures that China delivers to envoys in Beijing. With tiresome regularity, it is the lot of Western ambassadors to be informed that, if their small or midsized home country has dared to challenge China, it can only be because their government is foolishly trying to please America, whose hand is behind all of China’s troubles.

The AUKUS pact also reinforces a talking point that the Western world is far from united about China, especially when it comes to speaking out about questions of principle, such as the crushing of Hong Kong’s democratic opposition or the repression of Muslims in Xinjiang. These are mostly Anglo-Saxon obsessions, Chinese diplomats and scholars like to suggest. Alas, they sigh, Americans, the British and their friends in the Anglosphere think it is their birthright to run the world, like some gang of finger-wagging missionaries or sunburnt colonial administrators. Chinese officials praise leaders whom they see as more focused on business interests, such as Angela Merkel in Germany.
Still, China has not hastened to woo France in its hour of wrath. For one thing, China may see a benefit in letting Western powers feud, uninterrupted. For another, France’s furious response is a bit undignified. In Chinese culture, a public tantrum may signal nao xiu cheng nu, or “from shame to rage”, meaning the specific form of high-decibel meltdown staged by someone facing humiliation. Ticking off reasons why France might be cross, a Chinese scholar lists the cancelled contract worth tens of billions of dollars, and a “loss of face” caused by Australia’s hint that French submarines are not capable enough to deter China.
Nor is AUKUS hailed as a chance to divide the West. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing, notes China’s relatively weak anti-submarine capabilities. “For Australia to have nuclear submarines is very dangerous for China,” he says. “They are not needed for Australia’s national defence. This is about China.”
An arms race looms
Chinese leaders have a double view of America. They remain exceedingly wary of American areas of strength, from its armed forces to its high technology. Chinese leaders can see for themselves America’s robust economic growth, compared with Europe or Japan. Yet they increasingly believe that Western societies are growing decadent. “The key competition between China and the US is about domestic governance,” explains Professor Wang, before listing America’s failings, from economic and racial inequalities to its handling of covid-19. “In the view of the Chinese ruling elite, US domestic governance is in serious trouble,” he says.
In Beijing it is seen as enraging that this failing ex-hegemon remains strong enough to defy or dream of containing China. Mr Biden is called a weak, transitional figure. Chinese diplomats have treated his envoys, including his secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, and climate envoy, John Kerry, with studied belligerence. Under President Xi Jinping, a stern autocrat, China is impatient with being criticised. It rejects Mr Biden’s assertion that the relationship can be at once sharply competitive and co-operative when needed. Above all, China is sure that America is trying to create alliances to stop its rise. A cautious initial reaction to AUKUS should not be misread. Discretion is not the same as calm. ■",1
1754,"CORRUPTION, AUTOCRACY, overbearing government—these were the perils many hoped eastern Europe was escaping when its fledgling democracies joined the European Union in the early 2000s. Instead, the rest of Europe now worries, the eastern members have simply smuggled these vices into the EU.
One of the biggest offenders is Poland. First the government in Warsaw stacked its constitutional court with pliant judges and then got them to rule that the Polish constitution can override the European treaties—an assault on a basic principle of EU membership. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s long-serving prime minister, has bullied political opponents, critical media outlets and gay Hungarians, among others.

Sleaze, meanwhile, is smothering economies across much of the former Soviet empire. The most motivated citizens vote with their feet and seek a better future in the West, hollowing out the places they leave behind. That can become a self-reinforcing dynamic, giving a boost to conservative, rural, populist outfits, such as Law and Justice, Poland’s ruling party, Mr Orban’s Fidesz or GERB, the Bulgarian group headed by Boyko Borisov, a former prime minister and prime figure in various scandals.
Until this month, there had been only the odd flicker of resistance amid the gloom of bad government. One came in 2019, with the election of Zuzana Caputova, an environmental and anti-corruption campaigner, as president of Slovakia. Last year another activist was elected president of nearby Moldova (which is not a part of the EU). And earlier this year Mr Borisov failed to win a fourth term as Bulgaria’s prime minister—although his opponents have not yet managed to form a government.
October has seen a refreshing change of pace. On the 9th Andrej Babis, the Czech Republic’s plutocratic leader, fared badly at the polls. He now looks set to be ousted as prime minister by a rival coalition (though he may step in as temporary president, since the incumbent is ill). One of the factors that seems to have led to his defeat was his appearance in the Pandora papers, a trove of documents revealing public figures’ use of shell companies, tax havens and other tricks of the footloose rich. Mr Babis, like Mr Borisov, denies any wrongdoing.
The same day, in an unrelated corruption scandal, the chancellor of Austria, Sebastian Kurz, resigned after his coalition partners threatened to bring down the government if he did not. Mr Kurz also insists he has done nothing wrong. Across central and eastern Europe, voters’ tolerance for the alleged shenanigans of their rulers seems to be running out.
Even Mr Orban is under pressure. Hungary’s six main opposition parties, generally as much at each other’s throats as at his, have at last managed what they had previously always failed to do: to form a united front. In a process that was admittedly a little fractious, they agreed not to compete against one another in parliamentary elections and selected a joint candidate for prime minister. Fidesz’s fourth electoral triumph in a row no longer seems inevitable.
At the same time, and none too soon, the EU itself is getting tough with Hungary and Poland. The European Commission is sitting on hundreds of billions of euros allocated to help escape the slump brought on by the pandemic. Each member country is entitled to a big dollop, but the commission must approve their spending plans before it disburses the cash. Citing problems with the rule of law, it has so far refused to give Hungary or Poland their share. If the courts are unsound, the thinking runs, then the EU’s cash is unsafe. It may use a similar argument to delay the distribution of other funds.
The row seems arcane, but it may be the first moment the EU has done more than tut-tut about the erosion of democracy in its eastern half. How far it is willing to go remains to be seen. But if its leaders’ constant talk of European values is to have any meaning, it will have to be firm. Glory to October! ■",1
1755,"SET OUT for a shopping trip with $100 and you can snap up a pair of Levi’s jeans or half an Hermès necktie. Or you could pop into Primark and fill a wardrobe. The discount purveyor of fast fashion, which is expanding in America from its base in Europe, will flog you a T-shirt for $3.50 and trousers for a tenner. Such prices seem too good to be true to campaigners, who assume they can only be the result of corner-cutting in a sector rife with dodgy labour practices. Rivals such as Zara of Spain and H of Sweden, which used to be considered cheap before Primark came along, already run tight ships and squeeze suppliers hard. What is Primark doing so differently that it can sell wares for less and still make money?
A lot, it turns out. Though Primark looks as if it is in the same trade as its budget rivals, beneath the seams its business model could not be more different. On strategic decisions the firm has zigged when much of the apparel industry has zagged. As other firms try new approaches, such as rejigging their business for the internet age, Primark has doggedly stuck to a stack-it-high-sell-it-cheap approach to retailing that would feel familiar to the manager of its first store, opened in Ireland in 1969. The strategy has limitations, particularly when it comes to new growth. But for now—and notwithstanding the odd pandemic—it is proving its worth.

The giants of fast fashion have grown by embracing speed. Starting in the 2000s Inditex, which owns Zara, made a name for itself by raising the metabolism of the apparel sector. Previously shoppers had to wait entire seasons for high-street brands to replicate the catwalk’s new looks. It took at least that long to get fresh frocks made and shipped from distant Asian factories with long lead times. Zara stole a march on the industry by manufacturing some of its collection in Europe, allowing it to get designs in shops in just a few weeks. Like a hot pair of heels, the business model was soon aped across the industry. When impatient consumers moved online, Zara, H and others hurriedly followed them there—never mind the iffy economics of home delivery.
Primark, which is part of Associated British Foods, a conglomerate worth £16bn ($22bn) that also sells bread and Twinings tea, has stayed in the slower lane. Its bet is, broadly, that shoppers will accept being a little less cutting-edge in return for big savings. Designs are simple to keep stitching costs down. Where fancier rivals boast that every shop has a unique assortment of regularly updated goods, Primark orders millions of the same frocks months before they arrive on the shelves. That is a lifetime in the age of Instagram influencers. But it lets Primark charge frock-bottom prices.
This strategy allows it to concentrate manufacturing in lower-cost countries, notably Bangladesh, where monthly wages in the garment sector start at around $100. These are often the same factories used by other global retailers, which ought to blunt criticism that Primark is an outlier when it comes to labour practices. The firm does sensible things like limit subcontracting and conducts lots of audits to ensure working conditions are adequate. And its slower approach means orders can be placed in fashion’s off-peak periods, when factories are grateful for the work. Manufacturers know they can keep staff busy stitching Primark dresses during lean weeks, while slotting in more lucrative short-turnaround runs for less patient brands. Clothes are shipped to end markets by the slow boat.
The cost savings are passed on to consumers, with some left over for shareholders. Before the pandemic jumbled up everyone’s books Primark reported a gross margin—sales minus the cost of stuff sold—of 41%. That is well short of Inditex’s 57% or H’s 53%. But Primark’s parsimonious nature extends to operating expenses. It has relentlessly squeezed the costs of marketing and selling goods. Factor this in and it ends up with an “EBIT” margin of around 12%—in line with the industry standard.
Some of this is down to common-or-garden penny-pinching. While H spends 4% of total sales on marketing, Primark runs almost no ads. In an industry that often discounts, which crimps margins, Primark assumes its prices are already low enough. Outside Britain its outlets are enormous—on average, nearly six times the size of those run by Inditex—and often in out-of-town malls where rents are cheap. The jumble-emporium vibe they exude works: Primark sells about ten times as many items as H per square metre of shop, according to Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein, a broker. On a recent visit, a young shopper in front of Schumpeter in the queue to the fitting rooms took in 14 items.
Where Primark has strayed furthest from the fashion pack is in its refusal to sell anything online, which it sees as unfeasible at its price points. That has kept margins plump as the company avoided a wodge of spending on developing apps and fulfilment capabilities. The lack of an online presence meant that Primark lost up to 100% of sales as the pandemic shut shops around the world. Extended closures, especially in Britain, home to about half of its 380 outlets, cost it £3bn in sales and perhaps £1bn in profit.
Hare-brained or smart as a tortoise?
Primark’s cost-slashing strategy is so multifaceted as to be virtually impossible for rivals to replicate, argues Ms Sherman. Still, its idiosyncrasies hit limits of their own. The pace of expansion of shops, which is limited to Europe and America, feels glacial to investors—but go any faster and the model’s delicate economics may stop working. Critics wonder about the environmental sustainability of $1 knickers. And new online rivals look menacing, particularly Shein, a fast-growing Chinese super-discounter.
Yet the queues outside Primark shops as they reopened after shutdowns suggest that some punters cannot wait to splurge in person. Sales are now higher than before the pandemic, helped by the covid-linked disappearance of some once-fearsome rivals, such as Topshop in Britain. In the world of fast fashion, slow, steady and cheap can be a winning strategy. ■

1756,"AS GOVERNMENTS SPEND more, it becomes increasingly important that they design their taxes carefully. Large European welfare states such as Sweden or Germany rely on growth-friendly value-added taxes (VATs) to help raise the vast quantities of cash they dole out. America can get away with a tax system that is grossly inefficient and needlessly complex only because the amount of revenue it raises overall is relatively small.
Small, but growing. Democrats in the House of Representatives are working out how to pay for President Joe Biden’s proposed social-spending bill, under which America would take a step in the direction of Europe with cash handouts for parents, child-care subsidies, green investment and more money for health care. The bill will probably be watered down in the Senate, but its present size is $3.5trn (1.2% of projected GDP) over the next decade. To help pay for it, lawmakers are proposing the biggest rise in taxes since 1993.

The plan does little to move towards the efficient taxation that would be necessary were America ever to have the European-style welfare state to which many Democrats aspire. That is because the proposals have been crafted with the goal of raising taxes only on households with incomes in excess of $400,000. The left thinks the rich do not pay their fair share. They would like to raise the top rate of federal income tax from 37% to 39.6%, and introduce a new 3% levy on earnings over $5m. They also want to raise the rate of federal tax on corporate profits in excess of $5m, from 21% to 26.5% (glossing over the fact that wages will fall at least a bit as a result). The plan would raise the rate of capital-gains tax and introduce various new levies.
The federal government has some scope to raise more money from high earners. But the idea that the main problem with the existing system that tax rates are too flat is wrong. In 2018 the lowest fifth of earners on average paid no net federal taxes at all. The top 1% paid a total rate (ie, after all deductions) of 30%, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Include state and local levies, and high earners face a marginal tax rate on each extra dollar they take home—the rate that matters for work incentives—which is middling by rich-country standards. Tax refunds for poor families are exceptionally generous. In 2019 a single parent of two children earning two-thirds of average pay faced total net labour taxes of only 10%, according to analysis by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. In egalitarian Sweden the rate was nearly 33%.

Inefficiency is a bigger problem in America than the failure of rates to be sufficiently progressive. Myriad deductions allow the very rich to disguise labour income as lightly taxed capital income. And unwillingness to levy a VAT, which is a tax on consumption, means America relies on taxes that deter work and investment. America is one of only three rich countries to collect more than 70% of its tax revenue from labour income and corporate profits. Sales taxes, levied by states and localities, are the only significant taxes on consumption.
The plan does far too little to boost efficiency. On the upside it would curtail the carried-interest loophole which lets investment managers class their fees as capital gains not income. It would reduce tax evasion by increasing enforcement, such as through audits of the tax-returns of high-earners, which more than pays for itself. And it would try to get more money from “pass through” companies, shells which let many professionals treat their income as business profits, incurring a lower tax rate.
Yet much is wrong with the Democrats’ plans. They appear to have forgone closing one of the most costly loopholes, which writes off capital gains when assets are inherited. The rise in corporation tax would take the total rate, including average state and local levies, to 31%, the third-highest among rich countries. In the House they seem uninterested in a carbon tax to combat climate change. And although it is not yet in the plan, they are talking about lifting the cap on an exemption, from federally taxable income, of money used to pay state and local taxes. The cap was introduced in 2017 under Donald Trump. Lifting it would further subsidise high-tax states and almost exclusively benefit the rich. Democrats would be raising top income-tax rates while narrowing the tax base—the opposite of good tax policy.
America’s economy would survive these proposals. But its creaky and cumbersome tax code should not be asked to support the size of government that many Democrats want in the long term, which includes, say, government-funded universal health care. Republicans know this is implausible. They typically oppose VAT because they see it as too convenient a source of funds. Democrats dislike the tax because it is mildly regressive. But there is a reason VATs underpin European-style welfare states: there is no desirable alternative. ■

1757,"“BABA KOBE ashbe?” (“When will Daddy come?”), asks the youngest daughter of Sajedul Islam Sumon. No one has an answer, but she keeps asking anyway. Her family’s life—and hers—revolves around his absence. Now eight, she was just one when security forces came to their suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, and bundled her father, a local leader for an opposition party, into the back of a van. That was the last time he was seen or heard from.
Mr Sumon’s tale, in a new report on enforced disappearances in Bangladesh, is a chilling example of what can happen to those who oppose or criticise the government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed. Under her 12-year tenure at least 600 Bangladeshis are reckoned to have been “disappeared”.

Many have eventually re-emerged. Some have been implausibly “found” and produced in court—like Shafiqul Islam Kajol, a photojournalist who, 53 days after he went missing in March last year, turned up blindfolded, his legs and arms bound, in a no-man’s land between Bangladesh and India. Police took him into custody, slapping a trespassing charge on to his original crime of posting on Facebook about a sex scandal involving a politician in the ruling party. Others, like Aminul Islam, have returned in body bags. He was a labour activist whose tortured remains were found dumped on the edge of Dhaka, days after his abduction in 2012. Eighty-six victims, including Mr Sumon, are still missing.
While these numbers may seem small in a country of 170m, fear of being goom (disappeared) muzzles millions of voices. Disappearances, along with an array of other human-rights abuses, are not new in Bangladesh. Under previous governments, including those led by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the ruling Awami League, dissidents vanished and were killed. But since 2009, the year Sheikh Hasina took office for a second time, state-sponsored abductions have become a systematic tool of oppression, says Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the advocacy group behind the report.
Bangladesh’s is not the only South Asian state that covertly kidnaps its citizens. Yet, says Ms Ganguly, such actions elsewhere are usually linked to civil strife or insurgencies. Bangladesh is alone in “so blatantly” targeting political opponents and critics for secret detentions. Disappearances have shot up most in the run-up to elections, with over 130 before the 2014 vote and 98 in the year leading up to the ballot in 2018.
Despite such brazenness, ruling-party politicians deny or play down the abductions. In 2017 Sheikh Hasina claimed that Bangladesh’s enforced disappearances paled in comparison with Britain’s, bogusly citing data for missing persons. Her son, Sajeeb Wazed, recently penned an article for the Diplomat, an online news site, calling the “disappearances” comical. Many of the vanished were fugitives who, he joked, had gone into hiding to escape arrest.
Such mocking attitudes percolate down through the state apparatus. When Marufa Islam Ruma sought answers about her missing husband, Mofizul Islam Rashed, security-force officers jeered that he had probably run off with another woman. Years after Mr Sumon’s disappearance, a senior officer came to his family’s home and theatrically walked around the house shouting “Where is Sumon? Let him out, I need to speak to him!”, recalls his niece.
The families interviewed for the report named the Rapid Action Battalion, an elite police squad, as being behind the abductions. But other security units are guilty too, say various rights groups. And they all operate with impunity.
Some families give up or do not try in the first place, says Afroja Islam Akhi, Mr Sumon’s sister, who runs Mayer Dak, an organisation for the families of vanished Bangladeshis. They know their questions may bring punitive repercussions rather than helpful answers. She reckons the number of disappeared is far higher than the 600 known about. “Only God knows the accurate tally.”■",1
1758,"CCTV captured the shocking moment a boxing promotor dodged death by inches after a speeding driver crashed into his car at 80mph a split second after he got out of the way.
Footage on CCTV shows boxing promotor Andy Booker jumping into his parked car as a manic driver slams into his car.  
The crash happened on 6.45 pm on Wednesday night in Askern, Doncaster in South Yorkshire.
In the video, the speeding driver hits an oncoming white van before hitting Mr Booker's parked car and the boxing promoter darts into his car just in time. 
Mr Booker's car lights flash while the other driver hits a wall further down Moss Road.
Both cars are then filmed wrecked at the scene after the crash.
Mr Booker, who says he is friends with former World Heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, said: 'Well that was close I just managed to get in my car as he hit me at about 80 miles an hour or he would have gone straight over me.
'Cop said a split second and it would have been a different ending.
'It was so close I only just managed to get in my car.' 
A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said they received a call to report that a car believed to have been used in an earlier assault was in collision with another car before veering into a wall further down Moss Road.
They said: 'The occupants all fled on foot before officers arrived.
'They are described to have been wearing dark clothing and approximately five foot 11 in height.
'Two of the occupants were seen fleeing down Marlborough Road.
'Enquiries at both scenes continue at this time.'
Police are asking anyone in the area at the time who saw or hear anything suspicious or who has dash cam or CCTV footage which may have caught the incident which could assist with enquiries to call 101, quoting 774 of November 17.",3
1759,"A  MILE FROM the White House stands the Capital One Arena, a 20,000-seat stadium for basketball and ice-hockey games. The arena is in the Chinatown district of Washington, surrounded by Chinese restaurants and the “Friendship Archway”, built to celebrate the American and Chinese capitals becoming sister cities in 1984. One afternoon in March, this correspondent arrived at the arena and went to buy a Diet Coke from the Walgreens opposite. Once at the till she tapped on the azure blue Alipay app: up popped a QR code, scanned by the checkout worker to collect payment. The transaction took a second.
Had it been possible to enter the stadium it would have been just as easy to use Alipay, the payment platform started by Alibaba, to buy tickets or snacks. Nor is the Walgreens in Chinatown unique in accepting the app. Around 7,000 of them across America take it, as do shopping centres like Pier 39, in San Francisco, and several Chinese restaurants in New York and Boston.

These merchants want to make shopping easier for Chinese tourists, not to persuade Americans to use Alipay. The payment app is not easy for English-speakers (even in “English” mode most of the interface is in Chinese characters, so non-natives need screenshots reliant on Google translate). But its growing acceptance outside China, where Alipay and its rival WeChat Pay process 90% of mobile transactions, augurs a shift in financial power.

The dollar is pervasive because everyone uses it as their “unit of account”. Oil is invoiced in dollars. Most global trade is paid for in dollars. Most cross-border financial contracts are in dollars. Global travellers keep $100 bills in their socks. Financial markets and trade have grown faster than the global economy for decades, making the dollar ever more dominant. This gives America a clout it exploits through its use of sanctions, as well as unrivalled insight into global finance.
It is hard to see all this giving way to the yuan. But the way a transition could start, says Jean-Pierre Landau, formerly at the Banque de France, is with tourists. “If you have hundreds of millions of tourists moving around South-East Asia, asking to use their Alipay and attracting more attention to the app then, perhaps, progressively, they might want to denominate transactions in yuan.” First knick-knacks and museum tickets are sold in yuan. Then businesses start invoicing trade in the Chinese currency. Eventually they write financial contracts in it.
Digital money could thus threaten dollar hegemony. But the motive of many places, including China, for issuing their own digital currencies are mainly defensive. China is resisting the disappearance of public money as cash falls out of use. It is also fighting the concentration of power in the hands of data-savvy tech firms. Perhaps digital money will be used to promote a currency, says Mr Landau, but it can also be a defence against competition from a digital dollar.
A first reason to create a digital currency is “to protect or safeguard our monetary sovereignty,” said Mu Changchun, the Chinese central bank’s digital-currency boss, in March. He thinks most central banks are keen because they fear a digital dollar. “Digital currency supplied by one central bank should not impede another central bank’s ability to carry out its mandate for monetary and financial stability,” he said.
Indeed, if internationalisation were their goal, it is difficult to see how China’s tighter restrictions on Tencent and Ant would help to reach it. Since 2018 they have had to clear all mobile payments through a central clearing party, in effect overseen by regulators. The government has also demanded that they hand over data on their customers’ transactions and borrowing. “You have to think twice before allowing a payments network with its headquarters in China, where privacy laws are different,” comments Mr Landau.
“There are two possible rationales for the government to intervene in this way,” says Markus Brunnermeier of Princeton. “The first is that big tech firms should not monopolise the data, and one way to do that is to have them give it to the government...the second is surveillance by the government.” Another is to maintain capital controls. A third of economists polled by Mr Brunnermeier think capital controls are an insuperable obstacle to internationalisation of the yuan. Yet it is clear that the Chinese authorities are desperate to keep them, even at the expense of the currency’s international role.
A bigger risk is what happens when other currencies go digital. Had Diem, the idea proposed by Facebook, been operating when Turkey’s president sacked the head of its central bank in March, it would have been easy for millions of Turks to move their money into dollars or euros. It might also have been possible for businesses to start showing QR codes to accept dollars.
“It feels very significant that the countries which, apart from China, are most advanced, most active and most interested in CBDCs are the medium-sized emerging economies,” says Mr Landau. “They are too big to accept the loss of monetary autonomy, and sufficiently small to be exposed to the risk of foreign-currency competition.” They may feel they have no choice.■",1
1760,"APAPER PUBLISHED by three economists in early 2015 came to a hard-nosed conclusion. It looked at what had caused a surge in employment in America over the previous year. The jobs boom coincided with a cold-hearted Republican reform to make unemployment benefits less generous. The authors demonstrated, convincingly, that the one had caused the other, with the benefit cut leading to the creation of 1.8m extra jobs in 2014—about two-thirds of the total.
The notion that lavish welfare benefits discourage work, so that cutting them makes people look harder for a job, is widely accepted not just by economists but by most politicians and voters. Nobody nowadays wins election by promising to lavish the unemployed with public funds. So it is surprising to find that the country with the world’s most generous offer to the out-of-work also has one of its best-functioning labour markets. 

Danish benefits are worth more than 80% of previous earnings after six months out of work, compared with 60% across the rich world and less than 50% in Britain (America is even stingier). For Danish parents who lose their jobs, replacement rates can approach 100%.

The generosity of Denmark’s unemployment system is the flipside of its liberal regulation of employment contracts—a combination called “flexicurity”. Danish employers can hire and fire workers pretty much as they please. Jobs therefore come and go, but people’s incomes are stable. Yet the state’s munificence has not produced a class of feckless drifters. Denmark’s unemployment rate is lower than the rich-world average and its working-age employment rate is higher. Long-term unemployment is low. When Danish people lose a job, they find a new one faster than almost anyone else in the world, according to the OECD. 
That is because Denmark makes it hard for people to live off welfare. Recipients must submit a CV to a coach within two weeks of becoming unemployed. They can be struck off for not trying hard enough to search for work or to keep up with adult-education programmes. As a share of GDP Denmark spends four times as much as the average OECD country, and more than any single one, on “active labour-market policies” to make people more employable. 
This offers a tough lesson for those arguing for more generous welfare states. Simply boosting benefits may dissuade employment, as it did in America before 2014. To stop this happening requires massive investment in training, monitoring and enforcement of the rules for those out of work—spending money to avoid wasting it, in other words. The world’s best welfare system does not come cheap.

1761,"IT WAS DIFFICULT to tell the smells apart. For months the town of Agareb, near Tunisia’s coast, had reeked of rubbish because of an overflowing landfill. In September the authorities closed the site, which residents were calling a danger to public health. But this month, after trash had piled up in the streets, it was reopened. Protesters cried foul and on November 10th clashed with security forces. Along with the stench of tear-gas and garbage, a new smell filled the air: burning tyres.
One person was killed and a police station was ransacked. It was the worst violence in Tunisia since President Kais Saied suspended parliament and grabbed power in July. Critics called his actions a coup. But many in Agareb applauded him. The town of 40,000 has long been neglected. Its poor residents have grown disillusioned with the country’s decade-old democracy. They say they voted overwhelmingly for Mr Saied in 2019, hoping he would clean up corruption. If he had to act like an authoritarian to do it, so be it.

That was how most of them felt in July. Now they have changed their minds. The people of Agareb are calling Mr Saied a dictator. For it was he who overruled the local authorities and reopened the landfill, in part to provide relief for nearby Sfax. Tunisia’s second city and industrial powerhouse had been suffering under even bigger mountains of uncollected garbage.
Residents of Agareb say the landfill, opened in 2008, was meant to be in use for only five years. A judge ordered it closed in 2019, to no avail. Now it is not only overflowing, but full of dangerous industrial and medical waste, including amputated body parts and fetuses, say activists. They claim the dump has spread disease including respiratory ailments and cancer.
Tunisia collects around 2.5m tonnes of waste every year. Little of it is recycled. Much of it ends up in one of 13 official landfills without being properly treated. A lot of it just piles up in the streets. Even in Tunis, the capital, less than two-thirds of the waste is collected, says the World Bank. In Sfax province the local government refused to collect rubbish after the Agareb landfill was closed.
Collecting trash can be profitable. But the big contracts offered to waste-management companies have been controversial. Elyes Fakhfakh resigned last year as prime minister after he was accused of concealing a conflict of interest in awarding such deals (he denies wrongdoing). His opponents also have links to businessmen with fingers in the waste-management pie.
Last summer an Italian company sent nearly 300 containers of “plastic trash” to Tunisia. A Tunisian firm had agreed to recycle it for a fee. But the trash was mostly household waste, of the sort now piling up on Tunisian streets. The deal violated international treaties, as well as Tunisian law. Twenty-six people, including a former environment minister, were arrested.
The waste-management scandal typifies Tunisia’s corruption and mismanagement, with the burden falling mostly on the poor. It was hoped that Mr Saied’s government would do better. But cleaning up Tunisia is proving to be as hard as ever. Many of the country’s landfills are in poorer areas like Agareb. Any of such places could be the next to erupt. ■",1
1762,"WHEN NILUFER KURBANOVA’S doctor told her she was going to have a boy, he expected a tip for delivering the good news. He did not get one.
Ms Kurbanova does not believe, as many older Georgians do, that sons are better than daughters. Some families feel they need a male child to carry on the bloodline; Ms Kurbanova thinks this is hokum. Traditional families expect sons to look after their parents in their old age, whereas a daughter would look after her husband’s parents. Ms Kurbanova does not see why it has to be that way.

For centuries Georgians strongly preferred boys. When Georgia was part of the Soviet Union, from 1921 to 1991, its communist rulers suppressed some old sexist customs (such as kidnapping brides) and declared that women were equal, even if they did not always uphold the ideal. In any case, practically no one had access to sex-detecting ultrasound machines in those days. This was partly because they could not afford them, and partly because the West restricted exports since some of the machines’ parts had military uses.
That changed when the Soviet Union imploded. Ultrasound became widely available. And patriarchal values made a comeback, perhaps because the collapse of a bossy state prompted Georgians to seek guidance elsewhere. Many turned to the church and to their families. Traditional values, combined with modern technology, led to a surge in the abortion of girl babies. Georgia’s sex ratio swung wildly. In 1991 there were roughly 105 boys born for every 100 girls. (This is the natural rate, since more boys die in childhood and the numbers even out by the time they reach reproductive age.) By 2004 there were 115 boys born for every 100 girls.
But since then the sex ratio at birth has returned closer to normal. For the past five years it has hovered around 107 (though in 2020 it reached 109). In neighbouring Azerbaijan, where sex-selective abortion is still rife, it is 114. In China, it is 112.
Several factors may explain why Georgians started valuing girl babies again. After the initial post-communist turmoil, women’s wages rose, giving them more bargaining power at home. This made it easier for them to overrule husbands who wanted to abort a girl (son preference is more common among Georgian men than women). It also planted the idea in parental heads that a daughter may grow up to earn serious money, and therefore be able to support them in their old age.
Changes in the fertility rate made a difference, too. In 1990 the average Georgian woman had 2.2 children. That plummeted to 1.6 in 2001, as economic turbulence made couples nervous about the future. The patriarch of Georgia’s Orthodox Church was so alarmed that in 2007 he vowed personally to baptise any couple’s third or subsequent child. Whether that helped or not, the fertility rate rebounded to 2.1 in 2019, as the country grew more prosperous. If a family is going to have only one child, a father who passionately wants a son is more likely to insist that the child is a boy.
Even if attitudes grow less sexist, however, Georgians must still face the consequences of the biases of a generation ago. Some regions are already facing a shortage of brides. And next year, Georgians born in the most skewed birth cohort will turn 18. Men who wish to get married may find they need to emigrate. ■",1
1763,"A DENSE, COMPACT town of 58,000 people near the gateway to Andalucía from Spain’s central plateau, Linares has been successively a centre of lead mining, a railway hub and the site of a large factory making Santana jeeps. Today it is known for having the highest unemployment rate in Spain, at 33%. The Santana factory, with more than 2,000 jobs in its heyday, closed in 2011. A large Corte Inglés department store shut in March and stands in the main square, decaying like a rotten tooth. “I’ve been looking for work for months,” says Carlos Márquez, aged 21, who lost his pre-pandemic job selling mobile phones in a hypermarket. “There’s nothing in Linares. I would have to go somewhere else.”
The town’s reputation is overdone, insists Raúl Caro-Accino, the mayor. He points to technology businesses in industrial estates on the outskirts, with more to come. Unemployment is in line with elsewhere in southern and western Spain, the mayor insists. “We have a problem of unqualified labour,” he admits. That goes for much of the country.

Spain has long stood out in Europe for its chronic high unemployment, especially among young people, and for the high percentage of workers on temporary contracts (currently 25% of all those with jobs). The slump occasioned by the financial crisis of 2007-09 saw millions join the jobless, though it was followed by a strong recovery (see chart). Once again, the pandemic has hit Spain’s economy harder than those of its European neighbours—mainly because of its heavy dependence on tourism and vulnerable small businesses. A recovery is now under way. But only around half of the number of foreign tourists who visited in 2019 are likely to come this summer.

There are two bright spots. In contrast to 2007-09, the government has been providing emergency support: credit guarantees for firms and a state-financed furlough scheme which at its peak last year paid most of the salaries of 3.4m workers. Only 360,000 still need this help; the rest are back at their jobs. “This is the first recession in which employment and tax revenues have fallen less than the fall in GDP,” says Nadia Calviño, the economy minister.
The second boost is that over the next three years Spain is due to receive €70bn ($83bn) in grants from the EU’s Next Generation recovery scheme, along with a similar amount of soft loans. Much of this will go on big projects aimed at creating a greener, more digital economy, such as one for electric cars and a battery factory. But there will be plenty of money, too, for overhauling public administration and vocational training, and for active labour-market policies to help the unemployed find jobs. It is a peerless opportunity to tackle Spain’s chronic joblessness.
The aid is tied to reforms, especially of the labour market and pensions. And on these matters the left-wing coalition government of Pedro Sánchez is divided. The European Commission reckons Spain needs to make its labour market more flexible while tackling the abuse of temporary contracts. But Yolanda Díaz, the labour minister chosen by Podemos, the coalition’s junior, far-left partner, wants to repeal a 2012 reform which introduced some flexibility, giving firm-level agreements on wages priority over industry-wide ones and cutting severance pay, though to levels that are still generous. This commitment is backed by the trade unions and is in the coalition agreement between Mr Sánchez’s Socialists and Podemos. Ms Díaz also wants to abolish temporary contracts. “These proposals would lead to the most restrictive and rigid labour-market regime” in Europe, says Marcel Jansen of Fedea, a think-tank. They risk destroying jobs rather than creating them.
Ms Calviño, a former budget director at the European Commission, leads the government’s reformist wing. She says Spain needs a bundle of measures that strike a balance between flexibility and curbing temporary contracts. She hopes to agree on these by the end of this year in talks with the unions and business. In a reshuffle in July she became first deputy prime minister. Since the EU can cut off funds if constructive reforms are not approved, she is likely to prevail over Ms Díaz, though not totally. The unions have influence, too. It is a strength of the Socialists that, unlike some other social-democratic parties, they have retained a working-class base. “It’s very hard for a government with a feeble majority to agree on reforms that comply with the European agenda,” notes Mr Jansen.
Training and education need a radical shake-up too. A third of young Spaniards leave school without any qualification, while only a quarter of school-leavers enter vocational training, compared with half in Germany, points out Manuel Pérez-Sala of the Círculo de Empresarios, a business think-tank. Much of the €6bn a year Spain spends helping people find jobs is wasted. Under European pressure the government recently reinstated a policy of linking the funding of training to results. New laws on education and training may help, if fully implemented.
Another doubt is over how the EU money is administered. The opposition complains that control is centralised in the Moncloa, the prime-ministerial complex. Regional governments want their share. “I think they have understood that this is a co-ordinated national plan,” says Ms Calviño. It has usually taken Spain a long time to spend EU structural funds. In Linares, the mayor is sceptical. “We need a more flexible administrative structure,” he says. “The province is frustrated because it was promised things that didn’t happen.” In the end the proof of the EU’s efforts will be measured not just in a greener economy but in whether places like Linares have a more productive workforce. ■

1764,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",0
1765,"FLANKED BY THE leaders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, hailed the opening of the Svilaj bridge, linking the two countries. It was part of her tour of the western Balkan region, a term used by the EU to define the Balkan countries that have not yet joined the club and which have sat waiting on the doorstep since being promised eventual membership back in 2003. The happy integration between the EU and its Balkan neighbours was cast as nothing less than inevitable. “All the western Balkans belong in the European Union,” said Mrs von der Leyen. “It’s in our common interest, but I also believe it’s our destiny.”
Kind words collided with reality a week later. At a summit in Slovenia on October 6th of all 27 EU leaders and their six counterparts from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, the prospect of new countries joining the EU any time soon was absent. Instead, the western Balkan countries emerged with a pledge to cut roaming fees when their citizens visit the EU. An attempt by Slovenia to guarantee their membership by the end of the decade was dismissed as an outrageous publicity stunt. Literal bridge building was not accompanied by the metaphorical kind.

Enlargement of the EU is, bluntly, dead. Across the western Balkans, governments are hurt. North Macedonia may have dutifully jumped through every hoop required to begin accession talks, including changing its name to settle a dispute with Greece. Yet an arcane row about the origins of the Macedonian language led to Bulgaria vetoing the start of negotiations. Albania, whose application is linked to North Macedonia’s in a futile attempt to stop such political gamesmanship, is also stuck. Its prime minister compared its relationship with the EU to a failing marriage. Normally, there is at least a wedding first. The EU wants to be a global force, but it is in danger of losing control of its own backyard.
A realistic prospect of joining the EU is the bloc’s main tool for dealing with its neighbours. Yet at the moment, all sides know it is a fantasy. Countries such as France are deeply sceptical, preferring a deeper EU to a wider one. Diplomats from other cautious countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands insist their governments are fine with the idea of enlargement, as long as stringent criteria are met. Domestic politicians are, however, not always so nuanced. There is no chance of new countries joining the EU, even while the club’s leadership says otherwise.
This is a problem. If incentives for good behaviour disappear, so do disincentives for bad behaviour. Tantrums in the western Balkans are now common, in the knowledge there is little to be lost. Why bother taking on vested interests or reforming the judicial system for naught? Those with little to lose have least to fear. Hence a row over number plates between Serbia and Kosovo led to special forces being deployed at the border. In the western Balkans, damned foolish things happen increasingly often.
Sceptics insist that the club cannot digest new members. Former poster-children of EU enlargement, such as Poland, have become problem children. An EU without Poland or Hungary would spend less time worrying about nobbled judges or dodgy use of funds within the club. It is easy to find diplomats who think enlargement was a mistake. But this counterfactual is one that leaves the EU with an even more troublesome frontier. If the EU’s eastern members had remained outside the club, they might have followed the trajectories of other countries beyond the EU bubble, such as Ukraine. Exclusion is no happy solution.
A sense of perspective comes from across the Atlantic. American diplomats remind their more sceptical European counterparts that life would be much easier with the western Balkans firmly inside the European tent, rather than outside getting wet, with other countries offering shelter. Montenegro has already got itself into trouble with a $1bn loan from China. Serbia has become a canny diplomat, accepting vaccines from everywhere and then distributing them to neighbours. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, sees Bosnia as a font of Islamist instability. In short, it is not a region that the EU can afford to lose.
Instead, a dangerous complacency lurks among EU governments. The EU has dished out vaccines. It accounts for almost 70% of trade in the region. It invests about €3bn ($3.5bn) a year, which is a fair sum for a poor region of 20m people. Whatever Russia and China can offer, the EU can more than match, runs the logic. Threats of a geopolitical switch are brushed off by EU officials as diplomatic bravado by their Balkan peers.
Size does matter
Attention thus drifts elsewhere. Leaders would rather focus on the other side of the world, instead of the EU’s chaotic courtyard. On the eve of the Slovenian summit, leaders discussed the club’s strategy in the Pacific, which is a far sexier topic for those who dream of European might. The idea of spending hours discussing Kosovan number plates or the etymology of Macedonian words makes the eyes of European leaders roll into the back of their heads. In the Pacific leaders see history being made. In the Balkans they see history being repeated—to the point of tedium.
Yet it is the western Balkans that is the more pressing test of the EU’s foreign-policy capability, rather than seemingly larger and more global topics. A coherent common policy on North Macedonia, Albania and their neighbours should be simple, compared with more difficult choices that lie ahead for the EU. At the moment, the EU’s China policy designates the country as partner, competitor and rival. Eventually it will have to pick, deciding what is in its collective interest. So the club may be better advised to begin with what should be the easier choices. If the EU wants to be a global power, it needs to become a local one first. A revived enlargement policy is the place to start. ■",1
1766,"NO ONE COULD blame Morocco. In 2016 the kingdom was due to host an Arab League summit, an expensive undertaking. The meetings are so dull that some heads of state fall asleep. So in February, two months beforehand, Morocco said it could not be bothered to play host. “This summit will be just another occasion to approve ordinary resolutions and to pronounce speeches that give a false impression of unity,” the kingdom said. Leaders ended up gathering in a tent in Mauritania instead.
Founded in 1945, the Arab League was one of the first multilateral bodies set up after the second world war. It expanded rapidly over the next few decades, adding members and striking treaties on defence and commerce. Members proposed a common market in 1953 and signed an economic unity agreement in 1957, the year when six European countries signed the Treaty of Rome that set up what became the European Union. The aspiration, in the Middle East as in Europe, was to pull down trade barriers and link regional economies. Almost 70 years later, none of that has happened.

Consider trade: Arab countries do pitifully little business with each other. Less than 5% of the Arab world’s non-oil trade is internal, estimates Alain Bejjani, chief executive of Majid Al Futtaim, a retailer in Dubai. EU members send at least one-third of their exports inside the bloc; in ASEAN around 20% of trade is similarly internal. Within the Arab world tariffs remain high, and poor infrastructure makes trade more expensive. French-speaking countries in north Africa have lower trade costs with Europe than with each other. Despite talk of a Schengen-style free-movement zone, travel remains difficult. A citizen of America may travel to 16 of the 22 members of the Arab League without applying for a visa. A citizen of Egypt, where the Arab League is based, may visit only six. Israelis enjoy more travel privileges in Arab states than Syrians.

The league has not been much good at diplomacy, either. In 2011 it tried to mediate in Syria. Mr Assad agreed to halt attacks on protesters and free political prisoners; the league deployed observers to verify. The monitoring mission lasted barely a month, but there were few consequences. The league froze Syria’s membership and voted for sanctions on Syrian officials, yet many Arab states maintained ties with Mr Assad’s regime.
The Arab Peace Initiative, which the league endorsed in 2002, seemed to be one of its few meaningful ventures: it promised Israel normal relations if it ended the occupation of Palestinian territory. This has not happened, but last year four Arab states went ahead and normalised relations with Israel anyway. The league has been on the sidelines during the covid-19 pandemic, co-ordinating neither economic stimulus nor distribution of vaccines.
The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) had a more hopeful start. When founded in 1981, three of its six members had been independent for only a decade. Most were small states, satellites orbiting a much larger Saudi Arabia. Integration was logical. The GCC is the closest thing in the Arab world to a multilateral institution. Citizens of its six stable monarchies enjoy free movement and the right to work across the bloc. A customs union and unified standards have eased internal trade. The bloc boasts a joint military force, known as Peninsula Shield. Though it accounts for only 13% of the Arab world’s population, its oil and gas resources have made it an economic heavyweight. In 2020 the GCC accounted for 71% of the Arab world’s foreign trade, up from 61% in 2000. It drew 59% of the region’s foreign direct investment.
Yet efforts at deeper unity have gone nowhere. Talk of a common currency remains just that. Big infrastructure projects, such as a railway network connecting the six Gulf states, are behind schedule. Peninsula Shield was not strong enough to shield the peninsula when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Its main accomplishment was to smash a popular uprising in Bahrain in 2011: less a tool of defence than one for internal repression.
In 2017 three members of the GCC—Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE—imposed a travel and trade embargo on Qatar, a fellow member. The blockade was meant to compel Qatar to abandon its pro-Islamist foreign policy and tone down its media. It was not the first dispute with Qatar, long the bête noire of the Gulf. Nor was it successful: the blockade was abandoned in January having secured no substantive concessions. But it caused a schism that paralysed the GCC. Saudi Arabia and the UAE even formed a “co-ordination council”, a sort of mini-GCC, to bypass the larger body.
The largest Gulf states, in population and GDP, are natural partners. Even they cannot see eye-to-eye. In the past few years they have disagreed over the war in Yemen, which the UAE started leaving in 2019; over how to embrace Israel, which the UAE did last year; and over production caps at OPEC, from which the UAE is contemplating withdrawal. The biggest dispute is not political but economic. On July 3rd Saudi Arabia imposed tariffs on goods manufactured in free zones in the UAE, where many foreign firms are based, making a mockery of the GCC’s customs union. Lorries backed up on the border as firms tried to work out the rules.
It was a sign of further friction to come. The Saudis are desperate to diversify their oil-bound economy. Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince, has made this his priority, announcing trillions of rials in investments. The kingdom’s once-activist foreign policy has taken a back seat to building tourist resorts and fanciful robot-filled cities. “The options are already limited. You’re running a risk that your main source of wealth will become, very quickly, a stranded asset,” says Nasser Saidi, an economist in Dubai. In the short term, the easiest way to diversify is to steal business from the UAE, which is further along with post-oil plans. Officials in both countries insist this need not be a zero-sum game. But it will be a fierce competition that will test the GCC’s unity. There is precious little of that across the region, even in the country that was once the beating heart of Arabism.■

1767,"IN DHAKA, BANGLADESH’S teeming capital of 18m, face masks are everywhere. They can be seen under the chins of street hawkers, poking out from the pockets of rickshaw-pullers and dangling on the wrists of factory workers. A rarer sight is a mask covering both mouth and nose.
The usual methods for curbing the spread of covid-19 are less effective in South Asia, home to about 1.8bn people. Lockdowns work but devastate families and businesses. The region’s governments cannot afford to pay people to sit at home. Vaccination efforts suffer from supply and distribution problems; less than 15% of over-11s are fully jabbed, compared with more than 60% in the EU. Until that number rises, masks are the best weapon. But habits are hard to change.

A new study—the largest yet—into the efficacy of face masks in preventing transmission of covid suggests that attitudes can indeed be shifted, and cheaply. Researchers from Yale and Stanford universities, and from Innovations for Poverty Action, an American NGO, tracked the mask use of some 342,000 people across 600 Bangladeshi villages for eight weeks late last year. At the start of the study, they gave free masks to half those people and followed up regularly with reminders. The other half they simply observed.
The results are encouraging. Proper mask-wearing among the intervention group tripled over the course of the study, to 42%. The rise was sustained over the two-month period of the study and lingered for another two weeks after reminders had stopped. Moreover, the masks programme reduced symptomatic infections by 9.3%, and by 34% among people over 60 who were given surgical masks rather than cloth ones. Cases probably dropped among their younger family members too, says Mushiq Mobarak, the study’s co-author, but tracking asymptomatic infections—more common among the young—was beyond the researchers’ budget.
The study’s authors found that it is possible to persuade people to wear masks with simple, low-tech measures: by supplying them free of charge, providing information about why wearing them properly is important and by having the message reinforced by role models. In rural Bangladesh a famous cricket player and the local religious leader did the trick. There was also a mechanism to reinforce good behaviour, in the form of someone in the village gently nudging the careless.

Hiring these nudgers is the biggest expense. The rest is cheap. Each surgical mask costs just five cents. Researchers found that although this type of mask is often seen as single-use, it is still effective after many washes, reducing the cost further. The model is “really big bang for your buck”, says Asif Saleh, the head of BRAC, a big Bangladeshi NGO.
The organisation is rolling the scheme out to a whopping 80m Bangladeshis—about half the population—for the bargain-basement price of $6.5m, or $0.08 per person. Non-profits and governments across India, Nepal and Pakistan will take it to another 20m people. “This needs to be an ongoing effort,” says Mr Saleh, since, although highly vaccinated rich countries are getting back to a semblance of normal life, that is a long way off for South Asia. ■
Correction (September 24th 2021): A previous version of this piece miscalculated the cost per person of covering 80m people for $6.5m. It is $0.08, not $0.42. This has been amended.

1768,"IN MARCH, WHEN Tashnuva Anan Shishir appeared on Bangladeshi television screens, she created history as the country’s first transgender news anchor. A few weeks later a madrassa exclusively for khwaja saras opened in Pakistan. In India “Phirki”, a television show that ran for 225 episodes last year, portrayed in unprecedented detail the lives of hijras.
South Asia has a plethora of terms for people who identify neither as male nor female. Apart from hijra (which is the best known) and khwaja sara (which is mostly used in Pakistan), they include aravani, kinnar, kothi and shiv-shakthi. Many advocacy groups and NGOs favour “transgender”, while governments prefer “third gender”. Estimates of the number of non-binary people in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan run from 500,000 to several million.

Since 2014 all three countries have recognised third gender as a legal category. In 2016 a small group of Muslim clerics in Pakistan set a precedent by ruling that hijras can marry and be buried with other Muslims. By 2019 India and Pakistan had both passed transgender protection acts. Bangladesh introduced a scheme to hire hijras for government jobs in 2015, and earlier this year started offering generous tax breaks to companies that employ them.
The creative and legislative energy has, however, also highlighted the problems inherent in naming and defining gender identities. Many of the people who ought to benefit from the new laws are riled by what they see as lawmakers’ perpetuation of long-held misconceptions, such as the idea that hijras are intersex (of indeterminate gender). Most hijras are deemed male at birth but feel female, and are usually attracted to men. Other critics find modern gender discourse troublesome. They object to the idea that “hijra” and “transgender” are synonymous, and worry that the foreign import risks lowering hijras’ status.
South Asia has a long history of gender diversity. Hijras feature in the mythology surrounding Ram, an important Hindu deity, who is said to have rewarded their devotion with spiritual gifts. Records from the 18th century describe effeminate men, dressed as women, who offered blessings at births and marriages in elite society. In some parts of the subcontinent, hijra communities led by gurus were granted rent-free land and the right to collect donations, says Jessica Hinchy of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, the author of a book on hijras in colonial India. Belief in their power to impart blessings (and curses) remains part of the culture in India, as well as in Muslim-majority Bangladesh and Pakistan.
In the 19th century, however, British colonial rule reversed their fortunes. Hijras were relabelled eunuchs, a term normally reserved for castrated men. By the 1850s hijras had lost their state patronage. They fell foul of new legislation, including Section 377 of the Indian penal code of 1861, which outlawed homosexuality, and various iterations of the Criminal Tribes Act, which forced “eunuchs”, along with other groups deemed hereditarily criminal, to register themselves. It also made it illegal for them to dance in public, dress in women’s clothes or reside with children.
The declining status of hijras continued well into the 20th century. Growing up in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Faraz Khan was used to seeing khwaja saras invited to offer blessings for marriages and births. Now they would not be welcome at a private party, says Mr Khan, whose investment firm, Seed Ventures, has a special focus on trans-owned businesses. It “wouldn’t be seen as classy enough”.
The region’s governments are keen to defend the rights of hijras, who remain a highly visible minority. It is also a politically palatable way for them to show off their progressive credentials, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan, where homosexuality remains illegal. Many South Asian Muslims believe that if God made the body a certain way, his followers must accept it. Being born intersex—unlike being gay—therefore breaks no religious codes. Unsurprisingly, some hijras are reluctant to debunk the intersex myth or to associate too closely with gay and lesbian groups. “We talk about LGBTQ,” says Zerine (not her real name), a Bangladeshi lesbian and activist, but the term “doesn’t mean much in reality: the situations of each community are completely separate.”
Steps like tax breaks are welcomed by hijras. Other efforts, however, are hobbled by the drafters’ limited understanding of the people they wish to help. To enjoy the protection offered by the new act, India’s third gender is required to register as trans, a process that, for some, requires medical proof of gender reassignment, which most hijras do not undergo. Bangladesh’s government-jobs scheme failed because hijras had to prove they were intersex.
Attempts to relabel hijras have also proved divisive. “Transgender” arrived in South Asia after the term gained currency globally, especially in recent years. Some local activists and organisations adopted it pragmatically: it was more appealing to international funders. Others have embraced it as a route to progress. Using a global term and being connected to a global movement is “empowering”, says Hochemin Islam, a transgender nurse and activist from Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital. Governments and the media, keen to be seen as on trend, increasingly use the term, too.
Yet transgender is also used to denote respectability. The “I am not a hijra” campaign, organised by an advocacy group in India in 2016, showed trans Indians holding placards with statements like “I earn a six-figure salary, I am not a hijra”. Whatever the intentions, it ended up stigmatising hijras, says Aniruddha Dutta of the University of Iowa. Adnan Hossain of Utrecht University notes that hijra, unlike “transgender” in the West, is also a class identity.
Many hijras also describe themselves as transgender, such as Saro Imran, who runs a skills-training centre for trans people in Multan, in the Pakistani state of Punjab. Some undergo sex-change operations, or aspire to. But many others, like Srabonti Srabon, a Bangladeshi hijra, shun both. Hijra is an identity unto itself: they come from poor families where they are not understood or accepted, she says. Leaving, or being kicked out, is a vital part of this identity. So is being initiated into a tightly knit clan of hijras and learning its traditions and rituals under the tutelage of aguru. “This culture is 2,000 years old. Trans is a fairly recent phenomenon,” says Ms Srabon. “They cannot be clubbed together.”■",1
1769,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. To see them visit our hub
THE PLACE that is now known as George Floyd Square is these days blocked to cars, creating an effective memorial. Walk in from the Powderhorn Park end and you see posters giving advice about proper behaviour, rather like those signs outside a church advising that shorts and flash-photography are forbidden. A few doors down from the Cup Foods grocery store, the last place that Mr Floyd entered before he was murdered, an arts centre has been converted into a museum for all the protest signs that were waved on the street outside. Within the arts centre there is discussion of the importance of protest gardening. In a park nearby stand around 150 white plastic headstones, each of them marked with the name of an African-American killed by the police, their dates, a fist that was the emblem of the Black Panther party and the words “Rest in Power”. The combination of hippydom with symbols that are drawn from black radicalism gives the place something of the feel of the 1960s.
Powderhorn is nothing like such places as West Baltimore, Chicago’s South Side or East Cleveland, where neighbourhoods are full of abandoned houses, entrenched poverty, violence and heavy-handed policing. About half its residents are white, 30% Hispanic and 15% African-American, a patchwork that is as rare in Minneapolis as in other cities. Barbecue restaurants run by African-Americans coexist with places selling tacos and cafés in which everything is vegan, fair trade or both. This menu echoes the alliance of white liberals with African-Americans and Hispanics that keeps Democrats in power in almost all of America’s big cities. In Minneapolis the mayor, Jacob Frey, is young, Jewish and progressive, and the chief of police, Medaria Arradondo, is an African-American. This alliance can be uneasy—Nakima Levy Armstrong, a lawyer-professor turned activist, accuses the city council of being obsessed with “bike lanes and things white folks care about”. But it mostly holds together.

Minneapolis is an unlikely avatar of American racism. The city to which Mr Floyd moved from Houston was built by Scandinavian immigrants, who exploited the steep natural weir on the Mississippi river to create the milling capital of the world. These immigrants brought with them a distinctively Scandinavian form of capitalism. There is still an expectation that large companies will give away 5% of their pre-tax profits, and the chamber of commerce compiles a list of companies that have done so. “The list is long and you do not want to not be on it,” says David Mortenson, boss of Mortenson, a Fortune 500 construction company founded by his Swedish great-grandfather that is based in the city. One of these causes is refugee resettlement. Minnesota is home to large Hmong and Somali refugees from civil wars. Both groups are thriving: from time to time delegations of Swedes visit to try to work out why Somalis do so much better in Minneapolis than they do in Malmo.

Within this progressive utopia, though, are areas of concentrated poverty, where inhabitants are segregated by race and a boy is more likely as an adult to go to prison than to own a home or get married. Head north from Powderhorn Park towards downtown, where the old brick mills and warehouses on the Mississippi have been converted into attractive apartments and offices, and you find yourself in Phillips. Number-crunching by Raj Chetty and colleagues at Harvard University found that a black child born poor here 35 years ago would live today in a household where the average annual income is just $23,000 (£17,000). The number is a bit lower for boys, slightly higher for girls.
This poverty, passed from parent to child, is a feature of many big cities. Mr Floyd was raised in public housing in Houston, but seemed to find an exit via a sports scholarship to a community college in Florida. When that did not work out he bounced between part-time work, jail and struggles with drugs, finding hope through a religious awakening and moving to Minneapolis to start afresh. One of his jobs there was at a nightclub where Derek Chauvin worked off duty. Mr Floyd left one neighbourhood scarred by deep poverty only to land in another.
A pattern of deprivation
The persistence of deprivation in the same places, generation after generation, reflects how cities were settled. The South, where a majority of African-Americans still live, had formal segregation. Something similar was created in the north after the great migration of 6m black people, who moved from the bayous to the great lakes between 1916 and 1970 to flee Jim Crow and get better jobs. On arrival in Minneapolis, blacks who tried to make their homes in white areas were chased out by mobs and lawyers.
Even in the north, the threat of extreme violence was never far away. Although most of the 4,400-odd lynchings recorded by the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, took place in the South, this was a northern phenomenon too. In Duluth, a city in northern Minnesota, six African-American circus workers were accused in 1920 of raping a white woman. An examination by a physician found no evidence of this. Three were lynched anyway. A black-and-white photograph shows two men stripped to the waist and hanging by ropes from a pole, with a third man dead on the ground. They are surrounded by a large group of white men in suits and hats, some of them smiling. Duluth has had an awokening too: it put up a memorial to the victims last October.
Racial boundaries were often enforced by restrictive covenants on homes. The Mapping Prejudice project at the University of Minnesota has uncovered thousands of these, forming a ring around downtown Minneapolis. One clause in such a deed reads: “This property shall not be sold, mortgaged or leased to or occupied by any person or persons other than members of the Caucasian race.” These clauses reflected racial classifications common at the time. Some referred to Aryans, the category placed first by the Minnesota Eugenics Society run by Charles Fremont Dight, who believed the key to progress was a mix of socialism with state-sponsored sterilisation of the feeble-minded. He counted Adolf Hitler among his correspondents.
When the Federal Housing Administration, created as part of the New Deal, began to underwrite mortgages in the 1930s, these racial covenants helped determine where to lend—and where not to. Light-skinned borrowers received subsidised credit to buy or build new homes, dark-skinned ones did not. In 1948, in Shelley v Kraemer, the Supreme Court ruled that such covenants, which were common in most big cities, could not be enforced. But anyone who sold to a black family could still be sued for damaging the value of nearby properties.
This practice was only finally stopped by the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But after the act was passed, a large number of whites fled to the suburbs, sometimes along new federal highways that were either built right through black neighbourhoods or were actively planned to wall them in. Chicago constructed a 14-lane expressway that separated a predominantly black neighbourhood with lots of public housing from the rest of the city. In Montgomery, Alabama, the federal highway follows a snaking path that seems to make little sense—unless you know which parts of town were black and which white.

Despite this, the first half of the 20th century and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked big progress for African-Americans. In 1900 life expectancy for black Americans was just 33 years, against 48 for white ones. By 1960 the gap had narrowed to seven years. After that, progress stalled. One of the most counter-intuitive facts about economic progress for African-Americans is that most of it happened before the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s. Rates of black home-ownership in 2021 are lower than rates of white home-ownership were in 1870. In Minneapolis, three-quarters of white families own homes but only a quarter of black families do, the second widest gap in the country. A survey by Robert Putnam and Shaylyn Romney Garrett in their book “The Upswing” concluded that there was “essentially no relative economic progress” for black men after 1970.
This presents a paradox. All but the most determined pessimist would concede that racism has declined since Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968. So why have the life prospects of African-Americans, particularly men, stopped improving? The answer often given by campaigners is still racism, but transmuted into a new hidden and insidious form. This is true, yet it is more complicated than that word implies.
The great stalling
Shortly after African-Americans were guaranteed voting rights by Lyndon Johnson and a coalition of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, the great migration ended. Deindustrialisation swept through northern cities that would soon form the rustbelt. Racism did not do this: recession, shifting trade patterns, technological change and the appeal of non-unionised workforces in the South were more responsible. But, as the sociologist William Julius Wilson puts it, racist housing policies had put African-Americans in places where job losses were worst, and racist education policies had over generations left them with fewer skills to adjust and compete. Decades later the scarring is still visible. Only 60% of African-American men are employed, compared with 66% of white men and 73% of Hispanics.
At the same time two things happened to black neighbourhoods. The first was a crime spike, the causes of which are still disputed. African-American men were more likely to be both victims and perpetrators. For black men who dropped out of high school, a spell in prison became a normal stop on the road to middle age, damaging their prospects on release and making African-American families less stable. By the mid-2000s two in every 100 black men were behind bars (the share has since fallen). The spree of lawlessness began to wane in the 1990s, for reasons that were as mysterious as they were welcome. But crime remains higher in predominantly African-American spots: 40% of black Americans say they are afraid to walk around after dark, compared with 30% of whites. This is one reason why defunding the police is so unpopular in black neighbourhoods.
The second big change was that not only did many whites leave for the suburbs, but so did many middle-class African-Americans who could get out. Thus began also a reverse migration to the South. In northern cities where the population has shrunk, residential segregation is harder to undo because little new housing is now being built. Minneapolis, which in the 1970s built the majority of its public housing in the suburbs, now builds it in more deprived areas, concentrating poverty there. The city and state also paused a politically awkward effort to integrate schools. As a result, even as cities have grown more diverse and gentrified, at a neighbourhood level black-white residential segregation is still stuck in the 1970s.
Those left behind have not fared well. Black boys born 30 years ago in the area now known as George Floyd Square would go on to live in households with an average annual income of $17,000 a year in their 30s. One in ten would spend time in prison. This was the neighbourhood where Mr Floyd found himself outside Cup Foods that night in May 2020, with a police officer on top of him. But what brought Derek Chauvin there?■

1770,"“YOU ARE a twenty-first century American hero,” Ed Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said on October 5th. He was not addressing the founder of one of the country’s largest companies, Facebook, but the woman who found fault with it. Frances Haugen, who previously worked at the social-media giant before becoming a whistleblower, testified in front of a Senate subcommittee for over three hours, highlighting Facebook’s “moral bankruptcy” and the firm’s downplaying of its harmful impact, including fanning teenage depression and ethnic violence.
The public has long suspected Facebook of two-faced toxicity but lacked fresh internal communiqués to prove it. That changed when Ms Haugen released a trove of corporate documents to regulators and the Wall Street Journal. Facebook’s own private research, for example, found that its photo-sharing site, Instagram, worsened teens’ suicidal thoughts and eating disorders, yet it still prioritised sending young users engaging content that stoked their anxiety, all while proceeding to develop a version of its site for those under the age of 13. (Facebook has since paused those plans, due to public pressure.)

Senators, who cannot agree on such uncontroversial things as paying for the government’s expenses, united against a common enemy and promised Ms Haugen that they would hold Facebook to account. Could that happen at last?
Facebook has survived scandals before. Congress has repeatedly called in tech bosses for angry questioning and public shaming without taking direct action afterward. Congressional hearings “have become like ‘Groundhog Day’ and haven’t really mattered”, is how Paul Gallant of Cowen Washington Research Group, which tracks tech policy, bluntly puts it. In 2018 a different whistleblower outed Facebook for its sketchy collaboration with a research organisation, Cambridge Analytica, which allowed users’ data to be collected without their consent and used for political profiling by Donald Trump’s campaign. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, went to Washington to apologise, and in 2019 America’s consumer-protection agency, the Federal Trade Commission, agreed to a $5bn settlement with Facebook. That is the largest fine ever levied against a tech firm. However, no laws were ever changed to rein in the company’s misbehaviour.
This new whistleblowing incident could be a turning point, says Blair Levin, a former chief-of-staff to the Federal Communications Commission and now of New Street Research, a private company. Social media’s harmful effects on children and teenagers is a concern that transcends partisanship and is easier to understand than sneaky data-gathering, viral misinformation and other social-networking sins.
If Congress does follow through with legislation, it is likely to focus narrowly on protecting children online, as opposed to broader reforms, for which there is still no political consensus. For example, Congress could update and strengthen the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which was passed in 1998 and bars data-collection of children under the age of 13. Some want to extend protections to teenagers over the age of 13, as well. Other legislative proposals take aim at marketing and design features that make social media so addictive for the young.
However, Ms Haugen’s most significant impact on big tech may be inspiring others to come forward and blow the whistle on their employers’ practices. Whistleblower Aid, a legal support group that has helped Ms Haugen’s case, has seen more inbound calls since her revelations were made public. “A case like this one opens the floodgates and will trigger hundreds more cases,” predicts Steve Kohn, a lawyer who has represented several high-profile whistleblowers. Just look at Swiss banking or pharma to understand the viral spread of whistleblowing, he says. According to Siri Nelson of the National Whistleblower Centre, a legal defence firm, whistleblowers do not just change companies: they “change whole industries.”
There are several factors that make tech ripe for whistleblowing. One is the industry’s culture of flouting rules. Another is a legal framework that makes whistleblowing less intimidating than it used to be. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in 2010, gives greater protections to whistleblowers by preventing retaliation from employers and by offering monetary rewards to successful cases of up to 30% of the money collected from sanctions against a firm. To date, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paid out $1bn to 207 whistleblowers, including more than $500m in its 2021 fiscal year.
If the threat of public shaming encourages corporate accountability, that is a good thing. But it could also make tech less inclusive and transparent, predicts Matt Perault, a former Facebook executive who is director of the Centre for Technology Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People may become less willing to share ideas if they worry about public leaks; companies may become less open with their staff; and executives could start including only a handful of trusted senior staff in meetings that might have otherwise been less restricted.
Executives are going to have to get used to more leaks. Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice-president of policy and global affairs, has defended the company and pushed back against Ms Haugen’s allegations in a memo to the company’s staff, in which he pointed out that last year the company removed 30m posts that violated its policies on terrorism and 19m posts that crossed company lines for inciting hatred. It was barely any time at all before the memo was shared with journalists. Facebook and other big tech firms, which have been criticised for violating people’s privacy online, can no longer count on any privacy either. ■

Vladimir Putin used his state-of-the-union speech to warn the West against “crossing the red line”, saying that this would trigger a “swift and tough” response. Tensions have risen, following the imposition of additional sanctions by America in response to political meddling by Russia. Mr Putin has amassed troops on Russia's border with Ukraine, though it is not clear what he aims to do with them.
At the same time, concerns grew for the health of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s leading opposition figure, who is in prison and on hunger strike. Thousands of Mr Navalny’s supporters responded to Mr Putin’s speech with demonstrations in several cities.

A jury found Derek Chauvin guilty of the murder of George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis last year, when the policeman knelt on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. In a remarkable statement made while the jury was deliberating, the judge singled out comments by Maxine Waters, a Democratic congresswoman, as possible grounds for Mr Chauvin to appeal. Ms Waters had urged protesters to “get more confrontational” if Mr Chauvin was acquitted.

1772,"DECISIONS ABOUT medical treatments are usually made in doctors’ offices, not the Victorian splendour of the High Court in London. But in 2020, three judges ruled that children under 16 would be unlikely to be able to consent to one particular medical treatment—the administration of puberty-blocking drugs to those suffering from gender dysphoria, a deep discomfort with one’s sex.
On September 17th the Court of Appeal overturned that ruling, saying that decisions about whether to prescribe puberty-blockers should be left to doctors. The ruling might seem of interest only to specialist medical lawyers. But the legal saga has been watched around the world, for gender dysphoria is a fast-growing diagnosis and the treatments prescribed for it are controversial. Referrals to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), England’s only dedicated youth clinic, have risen from 77 in 2009-10 to 2,383 in 2020-21. Other rich countries have seen similarly sharp rises.

Proponents describe the treatments as life-saving. Sceptics point to the lack of clinical evidence showing that they work, and to worries about severe side-effects later in life. After the original ruling, GIDS suspended puberty-blocker treatments for new patients.
The original case had been brought by Mrs A, the unnamed mother of a child with gender dysphoria, and Keira Bell, a 24-year-old who had been prescribed puberty blockers at GIDS at the age of 16. Ms Bell went on to take cross-sex hormones and to have her breasts surgically removed, only later to regret both decisions. The original ruling referred to the lack of evidence regarding whether puberty blockers actually help alleviate gender dysphoria, and noted that almost all patients prescribed them go on to take cross-sex hormones. These lead to irreversible changes, including the development of cross-sex characteristics such as breasts and beards, and raise the risk of infertility. With all that in mind, the judges ruled that under-16s were unlikely to be able to understand and weigh up the lifelong consequences sufficiently well to consent to taking them.
The Court of Appeal however, decided that the lower court had, in thus venturing into clinical waters, gone beyond its proper remit. Previous case law, it said, had established that decisions about the wisdom or otherwise of medical treatments—even controversial or disputed ones—were best left to doctors. It noted that the original judgment had not found that the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust (which runs GIDS) had broken the law, and ruled that the case should have been dismissed as soon as that had been established.
Ms Bell’s supporters hope to appeal to the Supreme Court. But most lawyers seem to think a further appeal would have little chance of success. “I found the Court of Appeal’s judgment a very compelling read,” says one who has followed the case closely. It is unlikely, says another, that the Supreme Court would want to revisit what is widely seen as a settled area of law.
But kicking decisions back to doctors does not mean that the wider argument about puberty blockers is over. Medical opinion in several countries is becoming more cautious. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reviews the scientific underpinning of medical treatments in Britain. In March it said that the standard of evidence for puberty blockers, and for cross-sex hormones prescribed to teenagers, was “very low”. In the same month the prestigious Karolinska Hospital in Sweden cited lack of evidence in its decision to stop prescribing puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones to teenagers, except in clinical trials. Finland recently revised its guidelines to prioritise talking therapies over drugs. An NHS review of gender medicine is due to report later this year.
And the Court of Appeal noted that, although medicine is generally best left to doctors, there are limits to their discretion. “Clinicians”, it wrote, “would be alive to the possibility of regulatory or civil action which allows the issue of whether consent has been properly obtained to be tested in individual cases.” The arguments are far from over. ■",1
1773,"“I DON’T SEE how Nicolás Maduro has the capacity to stay for an extended time in government,” said Henrique Capriles, a former presidential candidate, in 2013. “It’s near the end for Maduro,” concluded Ian Bremmer, a political scientist, in 2017. “Maduro’s days are numbered,” promised Mike Pompeo, then the United States’ secretary of state, in 2019.
Venezuela’s president has had the satisfaction of proving them all wrong. Mr Maduro’s demeanour during broadcasts on state TV these days is one of avuncular calm. In October he took viewers on a tour of the presidential palace to show off garish Christmas decorations. “How cute!” he exclaimed, as he pointed at a plastic deer.

Such festive cheer is rare outside the palace. Mr Maduro has overseen one of the worst recessions in world history. Under his incompetent management, Venezuela’s economy has shrunk by 75%. Some 6m people have emigrated: more than a fifth of the population. If fair elections for president were held, it is almost inconceivable that he would win. His support in opinion polls hovers near 15%. But Mr Maduro doesn’t let the little people tell him what to do. Over the past five years his regime has turned from somewhat authoritarian to blatantly so. When Venezuelans go to the polls for municipal elections on November 21st, it is highly unlikely that the opposition—who, for a change, are taking part—will get very far. Here are six steps Mr Maduro has taken on the path to autocracy.
Step by step
Most importantly, he has continued and extended the subversion of institutions that began under his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, who was president from 1999 to 2013. After Mr Maduro’s United Socialist Party lost control of parliament in 2015 (in what most observers rate as the last remotely fair election), various measures were put in place to stop the opposition from achieving anything. The Supreme Court was stuffed with loyalist judges. In 2017 the elected parliament was dissolved and replaced with a rubber-stamp constituent assembly. The parliament was later re-established, with a socialist majority, after an unfair election. The electoral authority which oversaw all these changes is flagrantly biased.
Meanwhile, the regime has tightened its grip on broadcast media. Private channels are run by people who sympathise with the regime or who have decided to toe the line. The government has closed down almost all newspapers. Opposition parties are meant to be given equal access to the media ahead of elections, such as those in November, but in practice they are almost completely excluded. An analysis of recent coverage by the main state-owned television channel found that the opposition was not mentioned at all on three of the nine days examined. The rest of the time it is referred to only briefly and disparagingly, as “radical” or “extreme”. Several websites that are critical of Mr Maduro’s regime are blocked.
Having inherited his job from a military man who was both the perpetrator (in 1992) and target (in 2002) of attempted coups, Mr Maduro is keen to avoid any similar unpleasantness. Chávez, while president, created an army loyal to himself, not Venezuela. Mr Maduro gets help from Cuban spies to find and purge potentially troublesome officers. “Believe me, he can be totally ruthless if he needs to be,” says a former government official.
Dozens of officers have been locked up. Some have allegedly been tortured. Last month General Raúl Baduel died in a detention centre run by the security services. A former defence minister, who helped reinstate Chávez as president after the coup plot in 2002, he began to disagree with his former boss in 2007. For most of the rest of his life he was imprisoned on unproven corruption charges, despite pleas from his family for mercy. His daughter says he was murdered. (The government says he died of covid-19.)
Officers who support the regime tend to prosper. Under Mr Maduro, the armed forces have informal control of gold- and diamond-mining, for reasons no one can quite explain. Venezuela’s oil industry is not as lucrative as it used to be, thanks to sanctions and mismanagement, but the regime has other ways to reward loyalty. One is to grant cronies permission to build homes in national parks. Officers and officials are thought to be among the owners of lavish mansions that have sprouted in areas supposedly off-limits to construction, including the Caribbean archipelago of Los Roques and the supposedly protected mountain above Caracas.
Some speculated that when Mr Maduro wrecked the economy, it would provoke a mass uprising against his regime. It did not. Many of the angriest and most energetic Venezuelans fled abroad, and now send home cash that helps their relatives survive. Those who stayed have become increasingly dependent upon the state. If they were to rebel, they fear it would let them starve. In 2016 Mr Maduro introduced bi-monthly hand-outs of food. To qualify, recipients need to have an identity card which party loyalists often inspect on election days. The message is clear: with loyalty comes food.
Perhaps Mr Maduro’s most surprising move has been his embrace of the US dollar. Having previously denounced the currency as an imperialist tool, he now says “thank God” it exists. The change happened in 2019, during a six-day power cut which made electronic payments impossible. That forced people to accept the dollar, technically in breach of the law. Since then, the regime has abandoned price controls and a fixed exchange rate and instead embraced the greenback. As of June around 70% of transactions were carried out in dollars. The policy has reduced annual inflation from a peak of over 2,000,000% in 2019 to under 2,000%, which by Mr Maduro’s standards is a success.
The use of dollars has helped simplify the sending of remittances. It has also made life for middle-class folk slightly more tolerable. Across the country, casinos are being re-opened. In the relatively wealthy bubble of eastern Caracas hard-currency stores sell everything from designer ski-wear to organic maple syrup. Cynics call the process pax bodegónica, or peace through delicatessens.
Unlike, say, Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, Venezuela still pretends it is a democracy. At the start of the 24-day campaigning period before the elections this month Mr Maduro implored people to participate. Voting was “the best demonstration of love for Venezuelan democracy”. But his regime has also shown that, when it is at risk of losing an election, it will cheat, ignore the results, or both.
The tactic has not only enabled the regime to survive. It also appears to have convinced a lot of Venezuelans that democracy does not work. In a survey in October by the Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas, just half of respondents said democracy was their preferred form of government, a fall of 18 percentage points since Mr Maduro took office.■",1
1774,"IT IS STANDARD practice for the party that wins the White House to lose the Virginia governor’s race the following year. But it is rare for the margin of victory to swing by 13 percentage points. Republicans accomplished that feat in Virginia on Tuesday night when Glenn Youngkin, a businessman and political newcomer, beat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, gathering roughly 51% of the vote to Mr McAuliffe’s 48%. It was the first time Republicans have won the state’s governorship since 2009.
A number of factors led Virginia’s voters to Mr Youngkin, a former chief executive of the Carlyle Group, a private-equity firm. The most obvious was the Democrats’ unpopularity nationally. Joe Biden’s job approval at this stage in his presidency is worse than that of any of his predecessors save Donald Trump. According to The Economist’s polling with YouGov, the share of Americans who disapprove of Mr Biden is six percentage points higher than the share who approve of him: a net rating of minus six.

Mr Biden, and by proxy Mr McAuliffe, is especially unpopular among political independents, who vote in droves in the suburban and exurban counties of Virginia that ring Washington, DC. Though blue overall, these counties—particularly Loudoun and Fairfax, home to Mr Youngkin—swung hardest against the Democrats.
Our analysis of precinct-level returns from the governor’s race suggests the Democrats lost roughly five points of vote share where they are traditionally strongest, and about the same amount where Republicans tend to dominate. But the Democrats lost nearly ten points in the marginal counties that decide Virginia elections. There, many voters switched from backing Mr Biden last November to supporting Mr Youngkin.
Low turnout hurt Mr McAuliffe, too. Relative to the last election, the number of votes cast this year was lowest in the most Democratic counties. In the reddest areas of the state, turnout was about 60% of the level it was a year ago, whereas in the bluest places it struggled to hit 50%. This suggests Mr Youngkin’s victory came not only because he won over a surprising number of soft Democrats and independents, but also because the Democratic base did not show up.
Mr McAuliffe clearly knew of his troubles within his party weeks ago, and his campaign tried desperately to energise the dawdlers. His last-minute statewide Get Out The Vote tour featured appearances by Mr Biden, Barack Obama and the Dave Matthews Band, an inexplicably popular soft-rock outfit from Charlottesville—home to the University of Virginia, in the centre of the state.
Each candidate’s approach relied on elements of his party’s national message. Mr McAuliffe tried to yoke Mr Youngkin to Donald Trump, while Mr Youngkin warned Virginia parents that his opponent would indoctrinate their children with leftist dogma about race and gender. In the end it is hard to say exactly what mattered the most. Precinct-level results reveal only so much about how people felt about the candidates. One exit poll from CNN showed 51% of voters thought parents should have “a lot” of say over what is taught in schools, and of those voters 76% favoured Mr Youngkin. But 50% also thought the economy was going poorly, and nearly the same proportion of those voters went for Mr Youngkin.
The Virginia result is likely to confirm Republicans in their dismal conviction that waging culture war is the way to win. For their part, Democrats now confront urgent questions about how to increase turnout among their supporters in the cities and persuade independents and soft partisans in less dense areas. Those demographic trends tend not to change quickly, and may be harbingers of losses for the Democrats in the mid-term elections next year.",1
1775,"IN 1960 JOHN KENNEDY, the Democratic candidate for the American presidency, accused the incumbent Republican administration of having allowed a “missile gap” to open up between America and the Soviet Union. The idea seemed plausible. The Soviet Union’s success in launching the first satellite, Sputnik, on a rocket which could double as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had naturally led to speculation that it was far ahead of America in the deployment of such weapons.
Plausible, but wrong. Soviet ICBMs could be counted on the fingers of one hand. But although, by the final days of the campaign, President Dwight Eisenhower had strong evidence of this from the CORONA spy-satellite programme, he could make no mention of it. The ability to spot ICBM sites from space was so precious that it was worth risking the White House to keep it secret.

What was then world-historic is now the stuff of student projects—albeit an exceptional project for an exceptional student. When rumours of new Chinese ICBM launch sites fluttered through Washington, DC, earlier this year, Decker Eveleth applied himself to the problem. His resources were easily sourced satellite pictures; common sense, which told him the silos would be on flat land far from American radars in Japan and South Korea; and a degree of stick-with-it-ness sufficient to the challenge of systematically examining all the empty plains of western China.
Having slogged all across Inner Mongolia without luck, he hit gold in neighbouring Gansu. There, in the Gobi desert, he could see 120 missile silos under construction, the largest such effort mounted anywhere on Earth since the end of the cold war. A month later Matt Korda, a 26-year-old researcher at the Federation of American Scientists, an NGO, discovered the same telltale grid pattern in a secluded part of Xinjiang.
Mr Eveleth first dabbled in the interpretation of satellite data two years ago, when he was a sophomore in college. “A class had some very boring readings,” he says, “so I opened Google Earth.” That led him to Geo4Nonpro, a crowdsourced project which let budding hobbyists and seasoned experts collaborate to annotate satellite pictures of everything from uranium mines in India to chemical-weapon facilities in Syria. “It’s fun,” says Mr Eveleth. “There’s a happy feeling you get when you look at a site and think: I’m the first person to know what that is.”

Geo4Nonpro was run by the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), a part of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey, California. The CNS is a leader in gathering and analysing open-source intelligence (OSINT). It has pulled off some dramatic coups with satellite pictures, including on one occasion actually catching the launch of a North Korean missile in an image (pictured above) provided by Planet, a company in San Francisco.
Satellite data, though, is only one of the resources feeding a veritable boom in non-state OSINT. There are websites which track all sorts of useful goings-on, including the routes taken by aircraft and ships. There are vast searchable databases. Terabytes of footage from phones are uploaded to social-media sites every day, much of it handily tagged. “On their phone people have the same quality information I used to have to go into a secure facility for,” says Bruce Klingner, who worked as an analyst for the CIA and the Pentagon’s Defence Intelligence Agency for 20 years. “It's just really kind of mind-boggling.”
And it is not just the data. There are also tools and techniques for working with them—3D modelling packages, for example, which let you work out what sort of object might be throwing the shadow you see in a picture. And there are social media and institutional settings that let this be done collaboratively. Eclectic expertise and experience can easily be leveraged with less-well-versed enthusiasm and curiosity in the service of projects which link academics, activists, journalists and people who mix the attributes of all three groups. The intelligence world is thus being democratised, a development which is challenging governments, reshaping diplomacy and chipping away at the very idea of secrecy.
An archaeology of knowledge
When Eliot Higgins began analysing YouTube footage of weapons used in the Syrian civil war in the early 2010s it was seen as a “weird amateur hobby”, he says. But he saw their potential. In 2014 Mr Higgins founded Bellingcat, a collective of researchers, investigators and “citizen-journalists” funded by a range of charities which now has 18 full-time employees. In its first year it cut its teeth on an investigation into the shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines flight, MH17, over eastern Ukraine.
Local people had posted videos of a Russian missile launcher moving through the area. Mr Higgins and a band of volunteers roamed Google Earth to identify various trees, road bends and buildings visible in those videos so that they could say exactly where it had been when. Ukraine@war, an anonymous blogger, identified a specific field as the likely launch site. Photographs taken later showed the same launcher back in Russia—and missing one missile.
When a Ukraine International Airlines flight, PS752, crashed outside Tehran on January 8th 2020, five days after America had assassinated a leading Iranian general, Bellingcat was on the case again. So were the members of a channel on Slack, an instant-messaging and collaboration tool, called “Arms Control Wonk Podcast”: the podcast in question was founded by Jeffrey Lewis of CNS. The channel’s 1,000-strong membership bats around thoughts on everything from missile tests to the spread of covid-19, says Paddy Kerley, an Irish cyber-security professional who enjoys scrutinising North Korean nuclear facilities in his spare time. Others have equally esoteric interests. “There’s one guy reverse engineering a Sidewinder [missile] that he bought parts of on eBay—you know, normal things normal people do.” Membership costs $5 a month, $3 for students.
Photographs taken at the PS752 crash site showed the mangled parts of a rocket and damage that seemed consistent with a missile attack. Wary of misinformation, the Bellingcat team ran a search for previous uses of the same images. It came up blank, suggesting the photos were new.
A video posted anonymously to Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, showed a light streaking into the sky, a flash and a boom just prior to the crash. A series of nondescript apartment blocks and a construction site were visible in the foreground. The Slack team divided into groups to pan through freely available satellite images of Tehran looking for the same pattern. They lighted on a spot in a suburb to the west of Imam Khomeini International Airport (see illustration).

Locating that spot gave the analysts a bearing. The 11 seconds between the flash in the sky and the sound of the explosion provided a distance. According to FlightRadar24, a website which displays the transponder signals of aircraft, the location thus calculated sat on the flight path of PS752. It had been downed by a surface-to-air missile launched from nearby.
The next day Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that “intelligence from multiple sources” showed that the plane had been brought down by Iran's own air defences. Such accusations were “psychological warfare against Iran”, thundered an Iranian spokesman. But the evidence of what had actually happened continued to accumulate, thanks both to government briefings (the sorry chain of events had been captured by American spy satellites; the mobile-phone conversations of panicked revolutionary guards had been intercepted) and to the people using OSINT techniques. On January 11th Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, publicly acknowledged that a “disastrous mistake” had been made.
As in the case of MH17, the OSINT efforts were not the last word. But on both occasions the open availability of evidence gathered from diverse sources and analysed independently was incriminating in a way that parti-pris pronouncements from intelligence agencies would not have been on their own.
The order of things
In reacting to events such as the downing of aircraft, the OSINT community typically relies on data that are already out there. For other projects it acquires new data it expects to have use for—often from space. The capabilities that CORONA provided in the 1960s are now handily outstripped by a bevy of commercial satellite operators (see chart). Planet has been launching cameras on tiny “cubesats” since 2013 and now has a constellation of about 150 with which it aims to photograph all of the Earth’s land surface every day. Its cheaper images have a resolution of three metres per pixel, picking out objects the size of a car; its sharper ones are 50cm per pixel, showing more detail. Companies like Maxar, a maker of bigger American satellites, and Airbus, a European aerospace giant, provide higher-resolution images.

When, in the 1990s, the American government sought to encourage the development of such ventures, it imagined controls over the high-resolution stuff. That policy foundered when companies elsewhere began to sell high-resolution images on the open market; better that American companies be able to compete than that they go under. Though “shutter control” by the American government remains possible, the law it rests on is not used. Subtler suasion may be at play, though. Dr Lewis has the impression that some at the Pentagon have been less than pleased with some of the images published by his team; when the government is a big customer, such anger could matter to the revenue of the companies involved.
The government is a big customer because the commercial images provide a useful supplement to its classified in-house capabilities. They also provide a rhetorical resource: pictures bought commercially can be used publicly without revealing anything about classified capabilities. “We are providing a particular role in society that most open countries, including the United States, net benefit from,” says Will Marshall, the CEO of Planet. “It might occasionally expose something inconvenient for them, but that’s the new state of the world.”
You can look
If government is the biggest consumer, though, Dr Lewis may be the keenest. He and his colleagues have used data from Planet, Maxar, Airbus and others to analyse missile programmes in China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other countries. The evidence base they have built to further their work on non-proliferation has earned them an impressive reputation for unearthing missile launchers, rocket factories and nuclear plants.
“Overhead” imagery, as it is known, is not magic; it needs interpretation, and that means knowing what you are looking for. A haunting lesson comes from a second-world-war reconnaissance mission. In 1944 a plane sent to photograph a chemicals plant in northern Poland which the allies planned to bomb turned its cameras on early and captured images of a large industrial complex nearby. It was only three decades later that Dino Brugioni and Robert Poirier, a pair of CIA analysts working in their spare time, pointed out that those early frames were the first aerial images ever taken of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps.
Further flights took pictures of the roof vents where Zyklon-B crystals were inserted into the gas chambers; of long, snaking lines of prisoners; of smoke billowing from the pits behind Birkenau’s crematorium. None were recognised for what they were. “There simply was no historical or intelligence precedence [sic] for genocide on such a scale,” wrote Mr Brugioni in an essay in 1983. “Most World War II interpreters I have spoken to found the concept unbelievable, unimaginable, and completely incongruous.” Other intelligence officers had more sense of what was going on; but they did not know about the photos, and the interpreters did not know to ask them.
Today’s OSINT community does not suffer from such compartmentalisation, and it has sources on the ground from which it can learn more about structures seen from the sky. In 2017 reports of “counter-extremism” and “political education” camps built by China to detain Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, a western province, began circulating in local and foreign media outlets. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a think-tank, gathered this evidence in a single database, supplemented it with photographs shared on Chinese social media and started looking at satellite images for structures which fitted the bill. They identified 28.
China unwittingly made adding to the tally easy. In August 2018 journalists at BuzzFeed News noticed that Baidu Maps, a Chinese app, was systematically blotting out some places in Xinjiang. A number of the blots covered camps found by ASPI. Searching Baidu Maps for the easy-to-see blots and then looking at uncensored satellite data of the same spots revealed a gulag archipelago of several hundred more camps, most of them previously unknown.
Had China built such a machinery of repression three decades ago, stories from inmates and their relatives would doubtless have trickled out. America would have seen the facilities involved with its spy satellites, had it looked, and might have vouched for their existence. But the digital record furnishes evidence that is publicly accessible and visually compelling; nothing has done more to make the oppression of the Uyghurs international news.
Ever better hardware for phones, a technological trend which can be relied on, means ever better hardware for satellites. Planet’s cubesats are now far more capable than those it launched in 2013. Other companies are pioneering new forms of satellite observation. Capella, Ice-Eye, Umbra and Xpress-SAR are radar-satellite startups offering “synthetic aperture” technology which can take detailed pictures of surface features even through clouds, foliage and, sometimes, thin roofs. (It can also provide entirely unexpected insights. In 2018 Harel Dan, an analyst at a company in Israel, showed that the powerful radars used by American Patriot missile batteries interfered with the operations of a European radar satellite, Sentinel-1, thereby revealing hitherto unknown air-defence sites.)
Hyperspectral sensors, capable of making fine distinctions in the analysis of light beyond the visible blue, green and red bands, reveal things as diverse as wakes in turbid water, the health of crops or the difference between new and old paintwork. They may also show things which, wavelength-restricted as their own eyes are, human interpreters have yet to imagine. It is in part to guard against missing such things that satellite images are increasingly fed into machine-learning software which will see patterns humans might not pick out, or even think to look for.
This is not all being done for the benefit of spooks and their civilian OSINT counterparts. Seeing the world in detail and watching it change over time has all sorts of applications for agriculture, for investors, for commodity companies, for environmental monitoring of corporate activities and more. But OSINT is a happy fellow traveller.
But you better not touch
The infovorous energy and ecumenical spirit of online OSINT are not unprecedented. The men and women who staffed the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, America’s wartime proto-OSINT organisation, were “the greatest collection of individualists, international rolling stones, and slightly batty geniuses ever gathered together in one organisation”, remarked a journalist who visited their Washington office in 1943, a “unique combination of newspapermen and PhDs” consumed by “casual kidding in 17 foreign languages [and] the feeling that something big may come over at any minute”.
The same buzz is now replicated in online chats and Slack channels. To locate a tent from a scrap of road marker glimpsed through a gap in the canvas wins kudos. What other high jinks can compare with using Denis Rodman, a basketball player, to measure the size of an H-bomb? Photographs of Mr Rodman standing with Kim Jong Un allow a reliable estimate of the North Korean dictator’s height (it would be foolish to trust official statistics on such a matter). From Mr Kim’s height you can estimate the size of his head; from that you can get the size of nuclear weapons with which he has posed.

The techniques of OSINT are not only applicable in closed states and war zones. In 1978 William Arkin, who had until recently been an intelligence analyst tracking Soviet nuclear forces in East Germany for the American army, tried to work out where their NATO equivalents in the West were. He found what seemed to be telltale terms used in unclassified descriptions of some military units and found the addresses of the bases they were stationed at. In the antediluvian days before Google Earth he travelled round Germany looking at the sites thus identified. They turned out all to have a distinct double-fence security set-up and identical guard towers, measures which confirmed the presence of something particularly dangerous and worth protecting.
When Mr Arkin’s findings were published in 1981 America accused him of having used classified information from his army days. To avoid criminal charges he had to prove the information was all in the public domain. In a new book, “Restricted Data”, Alex Wellerstein, a historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology, describes the proceedings: “A colonel shouted the names of bases, and Arkin would then display the tangled web of documents proving that each base contained nuclear weapons.” As they ran through base after base, the colonel “slumped deeper and deeper into his seat”. Mr Arkin walked free.
Some may sympathise with the colonel. If OSINT makes keeping military secrets harder it may give comfort to enemies. “We often get complaints from professional photo interpreters, that they don’t like seeing their method described so explicitly in public”, says Dr Lewis, “because they think it might help the adversary.”
Many of his colleagues are acutely aware of these risks. Melissa Hanham of Stanford University says that when her OSINT work led her to a theory of why North Korea’s submarine-launched ballistic missiles were failing she decided that it would be wrong to publish it, lest it help the missileers. She is working with various OSINT organisations to develop a code of conduct for open-source researchers faced with such ethical quandaries.
The room for improvement that can be revealed by OSINT is not just in dictatorships. In early 2018 Nathan Ruser, then a student and now an analyst at ASPI, got interested in the data made publicly available by Strava, an app that allows users to log exercise routines. It showed joggers looping around New York’s Central Park, cyclists streaming down Shanghai’s Bund and swimmers thronging Bondi Beach. It also showed lonelier fitness regimes being pursued in various hotspots around the world, thus revealing what turned out to be CIA bases in Somalia and Djibouti and a Patriot missile battery in Yemen. Was this embarrassing? Yes. Is it likely to lead to better security in future? Again, yes.
If security services can benefit from OSINT, can they also use it to their own ends? When Bellingcat identified the two Russian agents who had poisoned Sergei Skripal, a Russian spy living in the English city of Salisbury, the Kremlin was apoplectic. “Bellingcat is closely connected with the intelligence services,” fumed Sergei Lavrov, the country’s foreign minister, “which uses it to channel information intended to influence public opinion.”
If such accusations were to stick, the organisation would be weakened. It is to give the lie to them that Bellingcat meticulously documents the databases it draws on, the methods it uses and the crosschecks by which it validates things. To plant a falsehood that passed muster would mean starting a paper trail years before: not impossible, but hard to do on the fly. And hard to get away with, too, in an open community full of frenemies eager to probe each other’s conclusions.
Why didn’t you tell the world?
The most general challenge posed by OSINT is the weakening of a certain sort of state power. Dr Wellerstein argues that treating secrecy as simply denying people information misses something crucial. “It's about the control of the information. It's about the ability to dole it out as you see fit to get your ends…and governments have always known this.” Dr Lewis was originally attracted to OSINT in the early 2000s by his frustration during the run-up to the Iraq war. He felt that civil society had no way to check dubious claims being made on the basis of intelligence released through choreographed public statements and secret briefings to news organisations. Now, to an increasing extent, it does.
In undermining state monopolies on intelligence, OSINT is increasingly capable of challenging the narratives states promulgate. The CNS and other OSINT groups, for example, have consistently provided a sense of North Korea’s nuclear abilities more realistic than that offered by recent American administrations, which repeatedly claimed they would not allow North Korea to develop capabilities which, judging by the OSINT evidence, it already had.
If revealing inconvenient truths undermines policies based on ignoring the facts, though, it is not necessarily a road to peace. A country given a bloody nose in a border skirmish might be less inclined to back down if its citizens are shown evidence of its failure. Secrecy enables face-saving, and thus de-escalation.
Consider the resolution of the Cuba crisis in 1962. The removal of Soviet nuclear weapons from the island was achieved through a deal which also saw America remove its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. This quid pro quo was kept secret for decades; Kennedy even lied about it to former presidents. “Any other course”, his aides later wrote, “would have had explosive and destructive effects on the security of the United States and its allies.” Secrecy enables malfeasance, perhaps, but it can also serve as a lubricant. In an age of OSINT the withdrawal of the Jupiters would quickly have become common knowledge.
But would the quid pro quo have been necessary at all in such an age? Cuba was a crisis because the missiles were already there when America first became aware of the situation. Today, one imagines, it would have been on the ball a lot earlier. And if, for some reason, it had missed what was under its nose, driven, chatty and motivated satellite-data wonks would have delighted in telling the government, the press or Twitter what was what. A reduced capacity for subterfuge may, in some cases, be a genuine loss. A lessened risk of strategic surprise is a real benefit. ■",1
1776,"REFRIGERATORS AND air-conditioners are old and clunky technology, and represent a field ripe for disruption. They consume a lot of electricity. And they generally rely on chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons which, if they leak into the atmosphere, have a potent greenhouse-warming effect. Buildings’ central-heating systems, meanwhile, are often powered by methane in the form of natural gas, which releases carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas, when it is burned, and also has a tendency to leak from the pipes that deliver it—which is unfortunate, because methane, too, is a greenhouse gas, and one much more potent than CO2.
One potential way of getting around all this might be to exploit what is known as the thermoelectric effect, a means of carrying heat from place to place as an electric current. Thermoelectric circuits can be used either to cool things down, or to heat them up. And a firm called Phononic, based in Durham, North Carolina, has developed a chip which does just that.

The thermoelectric effect was discovered in 1834 by Jean Charles Peltier, a French physicist. It happens in an electrical circuit that includes two materials of different conductivity. A flow of electrons from the more conductive to the less conductive causes cooling. A flow in the other direction causes heating.

The reason for this is that electrons are able to vibrate more freely when pushed into a conductive material. They thereby transfer energy to their surroundings, warming them. When shunted into a less conductive one, electrons’ vibrations are constrained, and they absorb energy from their surroundings, cooling those surroundings down. An array of thermoelectric circuits built with all the high-conductivity materials facing in one direction and all the low conductivity ones in the other can thus move heat in either direction, by switching the polarity of the current. For reasons buried in the mathematics of quantum physics, the heat thus flowing does so in discrete packages, called phonons. Hence the name of the firm.
The thermoelectric effect works best when the conductors involved are actually semiconductors, with bismuth and tin being common choices. Fancy cameras contain simple cooling chips which use these, as do some scientific instruments. But Phononic’s boss, Tony Atti, thinks that is small beer. Using the good offices of Fabrinet, a chipmaker in Thailand, he has started making more sophisticated versions at high volume, using the set of tools and techniques normally employed to etch information-processing circuits onto wafers made of silicon. In this case, though, the wafers are made of bismuth.
The results are, admittedly, still a long way from something that could heat or cool a building. But they are already finding lucrative employment in applications where space is at a premium. At the moment, the fastest-growing market is cooling the infrared lasers used to fire information-encoding photons through fibre-optic cables, for the long-distance transmission of data. They are also being used, though, in the 5G mobile-phone base stations now starting to blanket street corners, to keep the batteries of electric vehicles at optimal operating temperatures, and as components of the optical-frequency radar-like systems known as LIDAR, that help guide autonomous vehicles.
The crucial question from Mr Atti’s point of view is whether semiconductor-based thermoelectronics can break out of these niches and become more mainstream, in the way that semiconductor-based electronics and lighting have done. In particular, he would like to incorporate heat-pumping chips into buildings, to provide them with integral thermoregulation.
In their current form, thermoelectric chips are unlikely to replace conventional air conditioning and central heating because they cannot move heat over the distances required to pump it in and out of a building in bulk. But they could nonetheless be used as regulators. Instead of turning a big air-conditioning system on or off, to lower or raise the temperature by the small amounts required to maintain comfort, with all the cost that entails, thermoelectric chips might tweak matters by moving heat around locally.
Phononic has already run trials of such local-temperature-tweaking chips in Singapore, in partnership with Temasek, that country’s state-run investment fund. In 2019 SP Group, Singapore’s utility company, installed eight of the firm’s heat pumps, which comprise an array of chips pointed down at people, pumping heat out of the air above them, on the boardwalk on Clarke Quay in the city. Phononic claims the devices lowered the temperature in their vicinity by up to 10°C and, as a bonus, consequently reduced humidity by 15%. If that can be scaled up, it would certainly be a cool result. ■",1
1777,"ABBA’s new album Voyage has made history with its UK chart success.
The Waterloo hitmakers released their first album in 40 years earlier this month, and it soared to the top of the Official Albums Chart during its first week of release. 
The album marked ABBA’s 10th number one album in the UK, and it became 2021's fastest-selling album so far as it registered the biggest first week sales in four years.
But new data has also unveiled the album managed to top the album charts in 17 different countries, as it achieved worldwide sales in excess of 1 million copies in its first week, and has received more than 190 million combined streams to date. 
Speaking on the early success of Voyage, the band said: 'We are so happy that our fans seem to have enjoyed our new album as much as we enjoyed making it! 
'We are absolutely over the moon to have an album at the top of the charts again.'   
The news comes as the Mamma Mia singers also achieved new heights with their greatest hits album, GOLD, which reached a landmark BRIT Certified 20x Platinum in the UK this week. 
ABBA's GOLD was released in September 1992, debuting at Number 1, and has gone on to be the UK's second best-selling album of all time, falling only behind Queen’s greatest hits album. 
About the certification BPI's Rob Crutchley, who oversees The BRIT Certified Awards, said: 'Gold going 20x Platinum is an extraordinary achievement. 
'It shows – along with the great success of Voyage – just how well-loved Abba are and how their enduring appeal truly spans generations.'
Earlier this week ABBA announced details of their first ever Christmas single Little Things which will be released on CD through Universal Music Group on December 3.
The single appears on Voyage, and is a gentle reflection on the joy of Christmas morning and family time around this special time of year.",3
1778,"Jodhpur, India (CNN)The Child Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA) of 1929 set out to ""eradicate the evil of child marriage"" in India. Almost a century later, the south Asian nation remains home to a third of the world's child brides. As of 2017, 223 million girls and women who were married off before their 18th birthday lived in India, according to the United Nations agency, UNICEF. Only a fraction of the children entered into child marriages are boys. Between April 2019 and March 2020, Childline India received nearly nine times more complaints about the child marriage of girls than of boys.Not only did the CMRA not eradicate child marriage, the law also failed to provide a way out for those children who had already been forced into marriage.  So in 2007 the CMRA was repealed and replaced by the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), which recognized that child marriages were valid but voidable. Thanks to the PCMA, a victim of child marriage has up to two years after reaching adulthood to annul their union should they wish to -- or know to.  It is difficult to say how many young women have benefited from the annulment provision of the Act. There is not publicly available information and the Ministry of Women and Child Development has not responded to CNN's multiple requests for the number of child marriage annulments.  What is known is that at least 43 child marriages have been annulled. And what all of those stories have in common is tenacious child rights advocate named Kriti Bharti.  Married off at one  Bharti helped secure India's very first child marriage annulment and told CNN she has assisted in 42 other cases since discovering the annulment provision in the PCMA.In March 2012 she met 18-year-old Laxmi Sargara. Bharti, whose surname means ""India's daughter"" in Hindi, was 24 at the time and had just formally registered her organization, Saarthi Trust. Both women lived, and continue to live, in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, famous for its regal history and architecture, and in 2017 was home to 15 million women and girls who were married as children.Sargara had been one of them. She'd been married off at the age of one to a 3-year-old boy in a different village, but only learned of the union many years later when her in-laws came to tell her that in a few days' time she'd be moving in with them. In Rajasthan, it is not uncommon for children as young as one to be married in traditional ceremonies such as the mausar -- where a wedding takes place on the 12th day of mourning after the death of a family member. The child continues to live with their parents until their gauna -- the ritual where they are then sent to their in-laws' home after puberty. Frightened, Sargara told her parents she was going to visit her older brother in the city of Jodhpur, an hour away from their village. With his help, they reached out to Bharti, who was a social worker then with a reputation for helping child marriage victims delay their gauna. ""When Laxmi approached me, she wanted something permanent, and she didn't want a divorce for a marriage that she never consented to,"" Bharti recalls. ""After poring over hundreds of judgments and legal documents, we finally realized that there is a provision of annulment that she could use.""  ""We were using a law that no one had used before, that courts themselves did not know about,"" Bharti continues. ""Today when we file a case it's much easier but back then we were setting the precedent."" Confronting tradition Three years after that historic first annulment, Bharti met Santa Devi. Devi grew up in Rohicha Kallan, a village two hours from Jodhpur. People here are farmers or make handicrafts and furniture. After her uncle died, Devi was married in a mausar ceremony at just 11 months to a boy who was 10 at the time. Like Sargara, she would continue to be raised by her parents.  In 2010 at 15, Devi learned she was married to the 25-year-old man who she said had been following her everywhere she went and showing up outside her school for weeks. It was only when she told her father about him that she learned of her fate. ""This is what our elders have always done,"" Devi recalls him saying.  Devastated, Devi was desperate for a way out. Her search would lead her to Bharti who she calls ""didi"" -- older sister. ""Back then I couldn't speak up, I didn't even know Hindi, I had never even left my village. But when the groom's family pressured me to perform gauna, I knew I had to do something. We [Devi and a friend] looked everywhere for a solution and ultimately came across news articles of Kriti didi who nullifies child marriages,"" Devi explains.  After speaking with Devi's friend, Bharti agreed to help. They had to move quickly: Devi traveled to Jodhpur to meet Bharti and fill in the paperwork just six days before her 20th birthday, the cut-off age for annulment applications for Indian women.  Legally seeking to annul the marriage was one thing. Going up against rural institutions of power was quite another. When Devi told her father about her wish to have her marriage annulled, he met with Bharti and after being counselled by her, agreed to support his daughter. But when the village heard about what Devi had done, a meeting of the jati panchayat or caste council (made up of ""leading men of a group [who meet] to deal with the problems that affect the group"") was called and a fine of 16 lakh Rupees (about US$ 21,521) was imposed on Devi's father for breaking up a marriage. Once the jati panchayat was involved, and facing a fine and the prospect of expulsion from their village, Devi's father withdrew his support. Devi says he gave her an ultimatum: ""Rip the [annulment] papers, otherwise you are not my daughter"". ""My case was probably the worst one that didi has had to deal with...the jati panchayats gave us a lot of trouble. They threatened to kill me. If didi had not kept me with her they definitely would have killed me,"" Devi says.Caste panchayats, such as the one that fined Devi's father, act as parallel systems of law enforcement, imposing penalties ranging from fines to excommunication and even so-called honor killings, a euphemism for the brutal murders of women and girls, in contravention of the country's current laws.  ""Courts were established later, but jati panchayats have long existed so they take decisions as per tradition,"" says Bharti, explaining how these institutions preserve harmful cultural practices such as child marriage.  ""The law has not been an answer to the problem of child marriage,"" says Bharti Ali, founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights. ""[Child marriage] continues despite the law being there for a long time now"". A 2021 study (available only in Hindi) conducted by HAQ found that of 20 cases where child marriages were broken off, in seven instances the decision was made by jati panchayats. India's traditional divorce law was applied in three cases, but on only one occasion was the child marriage annulled. In all the other cases, agreements were reached between the families involved. Bharti explains that people turn to jati panchayats not knowing the difference between an annulment and a divorce and expecting divorces to be expensive, laborious processes. The caste council is also known on occasion to allow for child marriages to end but families never anticipate having to pay the fine known as the jhagda -- a Hindi word which literally translates as ""fight"".  ""The study clearly points out that decisions are taken by the panchayats. If we want these provisions of law [such as the PCMA] to be used we will have to figure out what are the local mechanisms and how can we link them to the courts,"" says Ali. But Bharti is less willing to work with these traditional institutions of power, arguing that women, perceived as having a lesser status in a patriarchal system and are therefore not allowed to attend the council meetings, do not get a fair hearing.  While she acknowledges that the legal framework isn't perfect, with the justice system often failing to treat child marriage victims as victims, she argues that the courts are still fairer. ""When you look at [formal] courts, although I agree that there is a lack of sensitivity, at least they hear both parties. Jati panchayats listen to the one who holds greater weight in society and they promote child marriage so we don't want to create a bridge with them,"" she says. What gives the panchayat power to make rulings as it does on child marriage is the fact that the customary practice remains ""largely acceptable"" as Ali puts it, in vast swathes of urban and rural India. ""Everyone belongs to a certain community. They carry a social identity with them so they first look at the interests of the community and then any other cause,"" she adds. Even Lakshman Jandu, a father who turned to Bharti for help with an annulment only after the jati panchayat asked him to pay a 15 lakh rupees (about $ 20,124) fine, admits that if his daughter's suitor had turned out to be ""a decent boy"" he would not have opposed the union. ""We didn't intend to get her married then but there was a lot of pressure from the community because the other family had another son that they wanted to marry off, so we said we'd get her married so long as their son completes his education,"" Jandu explains. ""But he got into a lot of bad habits, theft, breaking into people's houses, drinking...he was completely out of his parents' control,"" says the 54-year-old father who earns a living as a chauffeur. ""I don't see child marriage as bad but when the situation ends up like this then it is bad."" Jandu's experience confirms what Bharti has seen: that despite policymakers seeing the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act as ""the exit policy"" for all victims of a child marriage, their families -- whose support is often essential -- only use it if there is some other problem in the marriage, and not because a girl was married off as a child. ""In the beginning the parents are usually against it, they worry about what the jati panchayats and the community will say. So the first thing we do is counsel the parents,"" says Bharti.  'I want girls to speak up for themselves'Child marriage rates have been declining In India. In 1970, 74% of girls were married off before their 18th birthday and 42% before they turned 15. In 2015, those percentages had fallen to 27% and 7% respectively. The trend has been attributed to access to education, and ""public messaging around the illegality of child marriage"". Despite the decline there are still a lot of girls Bharti describes as forgotten.It is also true that in India marriage offers women security and status, so Bharti knows that the young women she works with are going to need equipping to navigate life on their own, or until they chose to remarry on their own terms. ""I tell all the girls that I will only take their case if they promise to continue their education,"" she says. ""I want them to get to a place where they are able to speak up for themselves and protest if they are ever pressured to get married again against their will.""  Devi, whose marriage was annulled in 2015, had to live with Bharti during the process of annulment and later at the shelter that Bharti runs. She says continuing with her education -- and Bharti's reputation -- gave her the confidence to eventually start going back to her village home.  ""I wanted to study and work like all girls dream of growing up and working, and I got to do exactly that,"" says Devi, who now works at an insurance company. ""Now I go home often, because I've made something of myself. Initially, people were scared if they heard about me visiting; they thought I would call didi. Young girls often come to me if they think a child marriage is going to take place and I give them didi's number."" Helping young women imagine a life for themselves after child marriage and then supporting them as they build that life has been rewarding for Bharti but it has also been risky. ""I may not get breakfast, lunch or dinner on some days, but I definitely receive threats on a daily basis,"" says Bharti, who lives with her mother. ""I have also had instances of receiving fake tips about a child marriage taking place in attempts to lure me to a certain location. Call it a gut feeling or intuition, luckily I've avoided the worst,"" she adds. When asked if she has been to the police to report any of the threats she receives, Bharti says doing so would only make it harder for her to interact with the people she is trying to help because it would alienate her from them.   She knows the risks she is taking to help girls use a little-known law to fight a long-held tradition, yet she does it anyway. ""[The law had previously forgotten] about girls once they are married off, but they are the ones who need our help the most... No one is immortal, so if I can help even 10 girls along the way, I'm happy to take the risk.""  Read more from the As Equals series ",2
1779,"IN SEPTEMBER 1995 Boris Johnson, a rising star of the Daily Telegraph’s comment pages, spent an evening with the Dulwich Labour Party. His trip to the south London suburb was an act of anthropology, undertaken to study a new tribe: the educated middle classes who had fallen hard for Tony Blair. Mr Johnson’s hosts plied him with Bulgarian red wine and taco crisps, and raged at the dying Conservative government. He was an observant visitor, recalls John McTernan, his chaperone and a future aide to Mr Blair.
Mr Johnson was a keen student of New Labour, whose era coincided with his own ascent to prominence. He was repelled by its “bare-faced quasi-messianic effrontery”, “spin-driven vanilla-flavoured candyfloss nothingness”, and assaults on fox-hunters and smokers. But he was mesmerised, too, for Mr Blair was a winner. Mr Johnson watched how “Supertone” ransacked the Tory wardrobe, played the press “like a master organist” and imposed a new doctrine on his party. (“In the game of political repression, the Burmese police have little to teach New Labour.”) As the years went on, scandals and sleaze seemed not to touch his popularity. In 2002, now editing the Spectator, a Tory-leaning weekly, Mr Johnson named Mr Blair parliamentarian of the year, hailing his “unchallenged dominance of the political landscape”.

These days the two premiers seem to occupy opposite ends of that landscape. Mr Blair marched into Afghanistan shoulder to shoulder with an American president; Mr Johnson, at odds with the White House, is forced to retreat. Mr Blair wanted Britain at the heart of Europe; Mr Johnson delivered Brexit. In university seminars Mr Blair is described as a centrist and Mr Johnson as a right-wing populist. One belongs to Clintonworld and the other is claimed by Trumpland. Mr Johnson’s ministers denounce the Supreme Court and Scottish and Welsh parliaments created by Mr Blair as constitutional vandalism, and stuff quangos once dominated by Blairites with their own fellow-travellers. Fourteen years into his retirement, Mr Blair still outshines Mr Johnson in intellectual discipline, darting ahead of a disorganised government with plans to fix covid-19 testing and vaccinations. They are ancien régime and brutish new order, separated by the Brexit revolution.
Yet the prism of Brexit refracts political hues into artificial separation. Seen through it, the past is distorted, too. Mr Johnson has learned much from Mr Blair. On the campaign trail and in the suburbs, the two men look more alike. That resemblance contains a warning for the prime minister.
Mr Johnson’s premiership, like Mr Blair’s, rests on a supersized personal mandate. His appeal runs deep into places where his party’s does not. (“They know that Tony won their seats,” Mr Johnson once said of Labour’s pliant MPs.) Both are instinctively comfortable in suburban England, never wagging the finger about how people should run their own lives. And they provoke a similar fury in their enemies, who give them the same epithet: liar.
Both focus ruthlessly on what they call “the people’s priorities”, namely jobs, health, crime and education. This is the terrain where elections are won and lost. Today’s Tory leaflets are reminiscent of New Labour’s early work, with endlessly repeated promises of more nurses, teachers and police officers. (Both men, notes Patrick Diamond, a former Blair aide, swept to office after a long period of tight public spending.) The skirmishes over flags and statues that dominate newspapers feature remarkably little. Mr Johnson’s campaign slogan in 2019 to “Get Brexit Done” was a promise to make the wrangling go away, not to prolong it.
Their methods are increasingly similar, too. Mr Johnson lampooned public-sector targets as Soviet and dehumanising. Now he has adopted them and asked Sir Michael Barber, who ran Mr Blair’s “delivery unit”, to construct another for him. Mr Blair declared Whitehall inert and unresponsive long before the same thought occurred to Dominic Cummings, the erratic aide who helped bring Mr Johnson to Downing Street.
Mr Johnson has episodes of Blairite centrism, making promises on climate change and obesity of the sort he once described as nanny-statism. Mr Blair, for his part, sometimes had a Johnsonesque populist streak, dubbing his project the “political arm of the British people”. He searched constantly for eye-catching initiatives that would convince voters that he was “on their side”. Yobs and nuisance neighbours were favourite targets. Mr Johnson once called this stuff authoritarian, ineffective and depressingly popular—but in office, he has embraced it. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is scarcely more draconian than her New Labour predecessors, who mooted tagging asylum-seekers as if they were criminals, or processing them overseas.
His final lesson
Mr Johnson revelled in Mr Blair’s downfall in 2007, squeezed out by his chancellor, Gordon Brown (“a blubfest of nauseating proportions”). Mr Blair left office frustrated. The retail offers that brought him to power—shorter waits for health care, smaller school classes—now seemed to him ridiculously modest. He settled too late on the structural reforms the public sector required, by which point his government was distrusted and tired, weighed by scandal and the war in Iraq.
The question, says Mr Diamond, is whether Mr Johnson is capable of becoming a reformer too. Despite a hiring spree, it will be hard to improve public services before the next election, since covid-19 has created long backlogs for practically everything. Sweeping reforms are in short supply. Tory MPs may neuter his overhauls of social care and planning law. Ideas to “level up” Britain’s poor regions are sparse. Mr Cummings, who had a Blairite appetite for fighting vested interests, has gone. And all the while the government acquires an air of fatigue and muck at remarkable speed. Mr Blair’s most important lesson is that it is not enough to win power: you must use it before it wanes. ■",1
1780,"LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates will require all gold refineries to undergo annual audits to ensure their suppliers are responsible, it told Reuters, in an effort to combat illicit trading.
Industry figures said this should raise standards in the UAE, one of the world's biggest bullion trade hubs, but may also shift flows of gold linked to crime or human rights abuses to other countries, for example in Africa, where the number of gold refineries is growing rapidly.
A Reuters investigation in 2019 found that UAE took in gold worth billions of dollars smuggled from Africa, some of it mined in grim and polluting conditions and countries in conflict.
Organisations including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental anti-money laundering monitor, are pressing the country to tighten rules and enforcement. UAE has said doing so is a national priority.
UAE's Economy Ministry told Reuters a UAE Good Delivery Standard would require refiners to properly scrutinize suppliers and prove to outside auditors they have done so.
""All gold refiners will be required to adhere to the responsible sourcing obligations,"" it said. ""The UAE Good Delivery Standard will also require annual compliance audits.""
The ministry said its goal was to bring the whole industry in line with responsible sourcing standards. It declined to comment further before an announcement at a precious metals industry conference in Dubai later this month.
CORE TO ECONOMY
Millions of people work in small scale gold mines that can be brutal on workers and leak toxic chemicals. The metal is often used to finance crime, conflict and terrorism.
The FATF last month placed Turkey on its ""grey list"" -- potentially eroding foreign investment -- due in part to ""serious issues of supervision"" in its gold trade.
Last year, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which runs the biggest responsible sourcing accreditation scheme for refineries, said it could stop refiners it certifies from taking gold from countries with inadequate controls.
UAE said it had taken numerous measures to combat illicit trading, including requirements for firms to register with anti-money laundering authorities and declare large cash transactions.
""The gold and precious metals industry is core to our economy,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi, who chairs a committee overseeing the gold trade, said in a statement to Reuters.
The good delivery standard ""will further strengthen the UAE's AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism) framework, which is a critical national priority and a central focus of the UAE leadership,"" Al Zeyoudi said.
SQUEEZING A BALLOON
UAE said its standard was an extension of the Dubai Good Delivery Standard, a voluntary accreditation scheme run by the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a UAE free trade zone.
DMCC accredits two of UAE's more than 10 refiners, requiring responsible sourcing policies and audits. Most UAE gold refiners and dealers lack accreditation or outside scrutiny of how and where they get their gold.
""This is the most significant thing the UAE government have done (to stop unethical trade),"" said Tyler Gillard, who advises governments and companies on responsible sourcing at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
But illicit trading will not disappear, he said. ""It's like squeezing a balloon ... there's still enough gaps and opportunities in other countries for gold to enter the market.""
Most countries do not require sourcing audits. Dozens of refineries are operating or under construction in sub-Saharan Africa, and India, a big importer of gold from small-scale mines, has many refiners not subject to scrutiny.",0
1781,"MORE THAN a day after it was meant to finish, COP26 finally came to an end, with 197 parties agreeing to the newly-dubbed “Glasgow Climate Pact”. There were several notable achievements. Countries committed themselves to further accelerating their decarbonisation plans and, specifically, to strengthening their emissions-reduction targets for 2030 by next year, rather than in 2025 as per the five-year schedule set out under the Paris agreement. Developed countries were “urged” to increase funding for adaptation in developing countries. Rules to create a framework for a global carbon market were approved, settling a problem that had plagued negotiators since 2015. The need to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions by a whopping 45% by 2030 was formally recognised. Not the stuff of triumph; but not a trainwreck, either. 

Ding dong the deadline is dead | Day 13, November 12th
When Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, reappeared at COP26 on November 10th, he glibly told reporters: “I don’t see why we shouldn’t go into extra time if we have to.” Unfortunately for thousands of exhausted delegates, and despite assurances from the summit’s president, they did. The official finishing time of 6pm on Friday has been and gone. 
Earlier on Friday, countries addressed each other in a “stocktaking plenary” to discuss a draft decision text that was published in the early hours of the morning. The grievances they aired made it clear where consensus remains elusive. The draft text, the final version of which will summarise the decisions made in Glasgow, currently calls upon parties to “[accelerate] the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels”, the first time that fossil fuels have been mentioned in a United Nations text about climate change since the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The jury is out on whether the clause will remain in the final text. Fossil-fuel producers are keen to see it excised.
Yet there was strong support for it in this afternoon’s plenary. Almost all countries asked for the clause to remain and many wished for it to be strengthened by calling for the removal of all fossil fuel subsidies, not just “inefficient” ones. China, Russia and Saudi Arabia were noticeably silent on the matter. John Kerry, America’s climate envoy, called fossil-fuel subsidies the “definition of insanity” but defended the wording on the basis that carbon-capture technology might be scaled up in future. Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, can snatch carbon dioxide from flue gasses before they wind up in the atmosphere, rendering some industrial installations carbon-neutral but this is not a solution for country-scale fossil fuel use, nor would it address distributed emissions, for instance from the tailpipes of combustion-engine vehicles.
The “G77-plus-China” group of developing countries complained loudly about the fact that their proposal for a financial body to deliver compensation for “loss and damage” was not included in the text. China asked for adherence to the existing timeframe which calls on countries to submit plans for stronger 2030 decarbonisation in 2025, thus appearing to reject a push to make such strengthening by next year’s COP.  A long night looms in Glasgow.
The home straight? | Day 12, November 11th
If COP 26 ends at its allotted time on Friday evening, the Mexican and Russian negotiators have promised, Archie Young, Britain’s lead negotiator, will receive a bottle of tequila and a bottle of vodka. As of now, he looks likely to be going to bed sober that night—if he gets to bed at all. The main problem is finance. On Thursday Alok Sharma—the summit’s president—warned delegates that they are “struggling to make progress” on a number of outstanding issues under that heading. One concerns the delivery of the promised $100bn per year for poor countries by 2020, a goal first set in 2009 but still not achieved: what needs to be done to put things right?. Another is how much more money developed countries should mobilise per year from 2025, with African countries saying they need at least $700bn. Observers think that it is virtually impossible that an actual figure will be agreed upon at this summit. 
The small print is causing headaches too. Negotiators are struggling to define what climate finance should consist of in the first place, the division of funding between mitigation and adaptation and settling the ideological question of which treaty it should sit under. There is also still significant disagreement about the framework for international carbon markets and how to ensure countries are transparent about meeting their climate goals (or not). 
These problems are not easily solved: all have been being negotiated in some form since the Paris agreement in 2015. But as the end of the summit looms, environmental groups and developing countries are becoming angry with those they believe are frustrating the process—including America, which they accuse of blocking loss-and-damage compensation for vulnerable countries. 
Hearing from the oilmen | Day 12, November 11th
Another day at the COP; another grand-sounding declaration. Today’s is the “Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance” (BOGA), a coalition of countries and sub-national governments led by Costa Rica and Denmark which is promising to stop issuing new permits for oil and gas exploration and production. They also vow to end oil and gas production by a date which is aligned to the goals of the Paris agreement. 
The International Energy Agency, a global forecaster, says that to meet the Paris goals no new oil and gas fields are required beyond those already approved for development by 2021. But so far only eight governments have signed up to BOGA’s goals. Rather unsurprisingly, they produce little-or-no oil or gas; the biggest of the bunch, Denmark, produces 72,000 barrels of oil each day—hardly a petrostate. Together they account for about 0.1% of global oil supply and around the same share of the world’s natural gas production. But they hope to convince more members to join the club. They say that they are in talks with others, including Scotland, the host of the COP summit. 
Lest this seem empty posturing, though, it is worth reflecting that membership may have a price. Quebec, which has joined the club, is being sued by Utica Resources, a local oil firm, for refusing the company’s application for an exploratory drilling licence. The oil industry may not be happy to lose even minnows.
Hands across the Pacific | Day 11, November 10th 
COPs usually have a few moments of sudden, unpredictable drama. This year the first such frisson came on Wednesday evening. It began shortly before 6pm with rumours of a joint American-Chinese press conference. Instead there were two successive ones, with China’s lead negotiator Xie Zhenhua going first. He announced that the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, accounting for about one-third of the global total, were releasing a “China-US joint Glasgow declaration on enhancing climate action in the 2020s”. Forty-five minutes later he walked off stage with journalists trailing after him while John Kerry, America’s envoy, took the stage.
The verbose joint declaration reaffirms the two countries’ commitment to keep the increase in the Earth’s mean surface temperature to “well below” 2℃, and ideally to no more than 1.5℃, compared with pre-industrial levels—which was the goal set forth at the COP in Paris six years ago. The statement acknowledges that current efforts are inadequate, and so the duo promised to work together to narrow the gap between their emissions-reduction plans and what science says is necessary to meet the Paris goals.
The text then offers a long list of ways in which the two nations will work together, including on research, policies to produce energy without carbon and efforts to reduce methane emissions and ban illegal deforestation. China will come up with a “comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan” to curb methane emissions. Speaking after Mr Xie, Mr Kerry said that China would deliver this plan at COP27, at the end of 2022. The document repeats that China will also phase out coal consumption starting in 2026—something Xi Jinping had announced in April. 
Perhaps the most significant aspect of the joint declaration is its very existence. Ahead of the 2015 climate summit in Paris, Mr Xi and then-President Barack Obama agreed to collaborate on climate change, including by sharing research and development of low-carbon technologies. This was a major breakthrough, one that helped catalyse the Paris agreement. Donald Trump’s presidency put an end to that. The two mega-powers joining hands once again is a welcome sight, though it remains to be seen whether the partnership actually delivers anything substantive.
Getting from here to there | Day 11, November 10th
The transport sector accounts for about 17% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Most of that comes from cars. Today’s big announcement focused on lowering those emissions. But progress could be hampered because of regional differences in the roll out of electric vehicles. 
A coalition of companies and governments said that they would aim to make all new cars and vans sold emission-free by 2035 in rich countries and by 2040 elsewhere. In the first half of this year battery-powered electric vehicles accounted for about 5% of total car sales. Plug-in hybrids made up another 2%. If the world is to limit global warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, the share of light duty electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrids) needs to grow to at least 75% by 2030. 
Yet the new coalition’s promises will not be enough to do that. The countries that have signed up, including Canada and Britain, represent just a fifth of the global car market. China and America, for instance, have abstained. And even though many auto firms are investing in electric vehicles, they are reluctant too: the corporate signatories produce only about 30% of cars sold worldwide. 
That is partly because the electric-vehicle market will evolve at different speeds in different places. It is expected to race ahead in America and Europe. But carmakers think that in 2035 they may still be able to sell internal combustion engines in poor parts of the world, such as South America. Governments in those places may be slow to roll out EV-friendly regulation and infrastructure, such as charging stations. Proponents of the new pledge hope that as more governments sign up, more firms will too. But, for now, the lack of signatories means the pledge looks underwhelming. 
The shape of things to come | Day 11, November 10th 
A draft of the “cover decisions” for COP26—the overarching texts that will lay out the summit’s decisions—was released early this morning amid reports that negotiators had spent the night wrangling over the documents. It seeks to strengthen the 2015 Paris agreement in several notable ways but does not offer developing countries the financial support they have been clamouring for to help them decarbonise. 
First, the draft “urges” countries to increase the ambition of the pledges they have just made in terms of actions they will take by 2030—part of their   “nationally determined contributions”—not in five years, as originally envisioned in the Paris agreement, but next year, at COP27 in Egypt. The draft also calls on all countries “to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels”, though it fails to mention any dates. Nevertheless, that is a bigger step than it sounds when you bear in mind that the Paris agreement does not even contain the words  “fossil fuels”. If kept—and large fossil-fuel producing countries like Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia will no doubt fight hard for it to be dropped—this clause will make Glasgow’s COP package the first to explicitly do so. 
Finally, the draft also puts significant emphasis on the need to pursue the lower 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris agreement, and points out the very rapid and deep cuts in global emissions that will be required to achieve this goal, namely a 45% reduction by 2030. The political promises that have been put forward so far amount to an increase in emissions by that date. The draft does not replace the higher 2°C limit with this tougher goal, something several countries have pushed for and China in particular has resisted. 
Crucially for developing country parties, the wording on finance is weak, with calls for greater support for developing countries but no specifics on how this should be achieved. Observers have rushed in to point out that achieving the Paris goals will require emissions reductions from all, but that poor countries do not have the means to do this without assistance. Therefore, absent strong financial support, the Paris agreement could fail. 
It is, of course, very early days. The summit does not come to a close until Friday (and these talks tend to run into Saturday) leaving plenty of time for the text to change. 
Pushing those pledging  | Day 10, November 9th
Countries’ climate ambition is currently not enough to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, to keep temperatures from rising by no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century (and preferably to 1.5°C). One solution is to increase the frequency of nationally determined contributions, the emissions-reduction plans that countries must submit to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which are currently required every five years. (Countries are allowed to update them more frequently if they wish.) The next round of NDCs is not expected until 2025, a timeframe that many think is too slow: at current emissions rates, half of the carbon budget that will take temperatures to 1.5°C will be used up in the next five years. 
More than 100 mostly-developing countries at COP26—including the 44 members of the Alliance of Small Island States, 54 members of the Africa Group and 48 members of the Least Developed Countries, the world’s poorest—are now pushing for NDCs to be required annually. Shortening the cycle is seen as a way to ratchet up ambition much more quickly, and thus accelerate decarbonisation. But they will have to convince some powerful countries who favour the existing five year timescale, including Britain, the European Union and Saudi Arabia. 
Headed for 2.4˚C warming | Day 10, November 9th
Has the Paris agreement put the world on track to curb global warming? Yes and no. On the one hand, the agreement’s mere existence and its requirement that governments regularly come back to the table has helped to improve projections of future warming. On the other, there is still a huge gap between what governments have promised and what is needed to limit global warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels—and in many instances an equally large gap between what governments have promised to do and what they are currently able to deliver. 
At the time the Paris agreement was being negotiated in 2015 , number crunchers predicted that all the political promises on the table amounted to roughly 2.7˚C of warming by 2100. Five years on, political pledges have evolved: they now include targets for cutting emissions before the decade is out and intentions to reach net-zero by mid-century. 

In new results released today, Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a consortium of climate modellers, says that if governments implement their 2030 pledges but no more, this would limit warming by 2100 to roughly 2.4˚C. That is an improvement on 2015 projections but still a far cry from the Paris goals. If the modellers add in the various net-zero pledges, projected warming comes down to a possible 1.8˚C by 2100. Last week, the International Energy Agency announced similar results. 

But the CAT modellers warn that buying into this narrative demands something of a leap of faith. “The problem is that not a single country has the short term policies in place to put itself on a trajectory to net zero,” says Niklas Höhne of NewClimate Institute, one of the CAT partner institutes. Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, another CAT partner, adds that “there’s a nearly one degree gap between government current policies and their net zero goals”.
Halfway through | Day 9, November 8th
The second week of COP26 started with a focus on adaptation and “loss-and-damage”—two complementary topics that are both central to relations between poor countries and rich countries. Adaptation seeks to limit the damage done by climate change; loss and damage is about compensating the most vulnerable countries—which are typically responsible for very few emissions—for the harm climate change is already causing them, and for future damage to which they will not be able to adapt. This concept has been brought up in climate negotiations for decades, though it wasn’t until COP18 in Doha in 2012 that countries agreed to establish a formal mechanism, a position which was confirmed in the Paris agreement of 2015. That has not been achieved in the years since but it is a priority for developing countries at COP26. The organisers promise that the operation of the “Santiago Network”—which is meant to help countries make claims for damages—is one of the things that will be hashed out this week. 

Establishing a mechanism for loss-and-damage financing is not the same as stumping up the cash it will need to function. Rich countries have historically been hesitant to commit because the total bill is likely to be so high. By 2030, the projected economic cost of climate damages in developing countries is projected to be between $290-580bn.  Until last week, no rich country had offered up any money at all. Then on November 1st the Scottish government broke the ice with a symbolic, if in practical terms paltry, promise of £1m ($1.3m). Whether others will follow suit remains to be seen.
Wrapping up the week | Day 7, November 6th
The first week of COP26 ended with a day centred on “agriculture and land use”. But those wanting significantly more to be done to protect biodiversity—including a sizable faction of the tens of thousands of protestors marching through Glasgow in the driving rain—were probably disappointed. The main announcements concerned forestry and agriculture. For the first, the British government boasted about establishing a new “dialogue” between the governments that produce and consume the commodities that most drive deforestation (such as palm oil, beef and timber), but gave no indication of what it was meant to achieve. 
For the second, 26 governments signed pledges to “repurpose” agriculture to make it more climate friendly or to “accelerate innovation” in the sector. (America and the United Arab Emirates claim they will mobilise $4bn of investment over the next five years in support of this.) Neither agreement includes any concrete goals or mentioned the meat and dairy industries, which produce more greenhouse-gas emissions than any other agricultural commodity. Elsewhere Alok Sharma, the summit’s president, summed up the negotiations that have occurred thus far, confirming that ministers still have a lot on their plates for next week, including financing for poor countries, timeframes for nationally determined contributions and global carbon markets. 
Suffer the children | Day 6, November 5th
Friday November 5th was “youth and public empowerment” day at COP26, crammed with events designed to reach out across generations and boundaries of expertise. But their target audience was mostly to be found outside the venue. Several thousand protesters took to the streets of Glasgow as part of a “Fridays for Future” march. Though they were kept well away from the conference centre by police they were joined some of the conference’s stars, including Greta Thunberg, the teenage Swede who founded the movement, and Vanessa Nakate, a young activist from Uganda. 
Both Ms Thunberg and Ms Nakate participated in the youth summit in Milan that preceded COP26 and sent recommendations to negotiators at the main conference. These included requests to concentrate on reducing inequalities and to involve young people in decision-making processes. The latter has been something of a sticking point in Glasgow: young activists (along with members of other environmental groups, particularly from developing countries) were invited to the conference as “observers”, meant to watch negotiations to make sure their concerns were being addressed. But almost all have been shut out of the relevant rooms because of covid-19 social distancing measures. Other protests during the week have included indigenous activists railing against carbon offsetting on their land and a march against “greenwashing” (the overselling of organisations’ and politicians’ environmental credentials). An even larger protest of up to 100,000 people is scheduled for Saturday. 
Brazil’s green gloss | Day 6, November 5th
Jair Bolsonaro’s government has so far been a challenging participant in annual UN climate summits. At the last two summits Brazil's negotiators have opposed consensus on the rules that might govern a UN-sanctioned international mechanism for trading carbon credits, provided for by Article 6 of the Paris agreement. As a result, this remains the last piece of the ""Paris rulebook"" that has yet to be operationalised. Mr Bolsonaro once seemed to relish his reputation as a pariah; he now seems keen to try to improve his reputation. In an attempt to look greener, last month the government announced two climate initiatives: a revamp of a low-carbon agriculture plan and a new green growth programme. In the last week, representatives have said the country would increase its target to cut emissions, to 50% by 2030 from their level in 2005 and reach net-zero by 2050 instead of 2060. But not everyone is convinced the turnabout is sincere or material. For starters, rampant deforestation in the Amazon meant that Brazil's emissions grew 9.5% in 2020, compared to 2019, even as covid-19 caused world-wide emissions to fall by a whopping 7%. To find out why Brazil's stance on climate is unlikely to change in spite of its slightly greener gloss, read our analysis in this week's edition. 
The coal shoulder | Day 5, November 4th
“Energy Day” on November 4th began with activists in inflatable “Pikachu” costumes campaigning against Japan’s coal industry across the river from the COP26 venue. Inside, leaders from more than 40 countries—plus businesses and financial institutions—announced a pledge committing themselves to phasing out coal power for good. (Sadly for the Pokemon, Japan is not among them. It has also not signed a separate pledge to stop funding foreign fossil-fuel projects, though it has said it will end financing for overseas coal plants.) Among the countries promising to stop the domestic use of coal for electricity are several that rely on it heavily, including Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Poland, South Korea, Ukraine and Vietnam. Richer countries have been encouraged to choose end dates in the 2030s; poorer ones in the 2040s (Poland is quibbling over which category it belongs in). Britain has promised to do away with coal by 2024. But it’s not all good news. Details of how the phase-outs will be achieved are sketchy and Japan is far from the only big hold-out. Others include America, Australia, India, Russia and the world’s biggest coal-user, China, which already committed to stop financing coal overseas but relies on it heavily for domestic power. 
Blowing through the budget | Day 5, November 4th
Thursday morning saw COP—and the rest of the world—given a reality check in the form of the latest global carbon budget, an analysis of carbon-dioxide sources and sinks produced by a consortium of academics called the Global Carbon Project. Emissions from fossil fuels fell by 5.4% in 2020 when covid-19 hit the world economy; this year they are set to bounce back by 4.9%, thus almost returning to their pre-pandemic levels. Though emissions from oil, which saw the biggest drop in the pandemic, have not fully bounced back, emissions from coal and gas are both now above their pre-pandemic levels, as are emissions from China and India. 
The report notes that 15 countries can now point to a decade-long stretch in which their economies have grown but the carbon-dioxide emissions associated with them have fallen. Those countries, which include America, Britain, France, Germany and Japan, account for about a quarter of global emissions. 
Following the rainbow | Day 4, November 3rd
South Africa may provide a blueprint for how countries can be encouraged to move away from coal. It has signed a “Just Energy Transition Partnership” with America, Britain and the European Union under which it will receive $8.5bn in concessional funding and grants in return for phasing out coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. South Africa generates more than 90% of its electricity from coal, and is the 12th-largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. Other countries are seeking similar deals. Indonesia’s finance minister told Reuters on November 3rd that her country is prepared to close coal-fired power plants by 2040 (its previous target was 2056) if it receives sufficient financial help. Along with the Philippines (and perhaps Vietnam), Indonesia is also part of a new pilot scheme launched by the Asian Development Bank that is meant to encourage international investors to provide cash to allow the three countries to retire up to half of their coal-fired power plants in the next ten to 15 years. But observers have criticised the plan for lacking realistic detail. 
Greenbacks | Day 4, November 3rd
Rishi Sunak, Britain’s chancellor, kicked off “finance day” with the announcement that the country will become the first “net-zero aligned financial centre”. That means that the government will “strengthen requirements” from 2023—but not yet make it mandatory—for all British financial institutions and all companies listed on the British stockmarket to publish plans explaining how they will decarbonise their operations, lending and investment, in line with Britain’s pledge to have a net-zero economy by 2050. Mr Sunak also announced that Britain would support a new capital-markets mechanism for green bonds, and put £100m ($136m) towards easing access for developing countries to climate financing. 
Meanwhile, ​​the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a coalition of financial firms, co-chaired by Mark Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England, published a progress report today. Their members, including banks, insurers and asset managers, hold assets worth roughly $130trn. They have committed themselves to lowering the emissions associated with their portfolios and loan books to net zero by mid-century. But green groups say this is too weak, and some observers worry that the targets will encourage financial firms simply to sell polluting assets rather than to try actually to reduce emissions in the companies they back. 
The methane-too movement | Day 3, November 2nd
America and the European Union announced a global methane pledge which aims to cut anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gas responsible for more warming than any other save carbon dioxide. The cuts envisioned are of 30% by 2030, measured against 2020 levels. John Kerry, America’s climate envoy, said that more than 100 countries have now signed up to the long advertised and  non-binding agreement. America and Canada said that they would introduce new regulations to cut the amount of methane emitted by their oil and gas industries. But China—the world’s largest emitter of methane—was not among them and nor were India or Russia; Russia’s gas industry leaks a lot of methane into the air.  Other sources of methane include agriculture, particularly of cattle and rice, with more than 300m tonnes currently emitted each year as a result of human activities. 
In recent years reducing emissions of methane and other so-called “short-term climate forcers” has been recognised as an increasingly important part of the fight against climate change. Though methane has a fairly brief life in the atmosphere, while it is up there it is an extremely potent greenhouse gas: a tonne of it causes 86 times more warming than the equivalent amount of CO2 in the 20 years after its emission. Cutting methane will have a rapid effect on  temperatures.
The woods for the trees | Day 3, November 2nd
More than 100 world leaders also pledged to end deforestation by 2030 on November 2nd. Tree-laden countries signing up included Brazil, Canada and Russia. Some 85% of the world’s forests will be covered by the agreement. In return countries will receive $19bn-worth of funding (from both public and private sources). Deforestation is thought to account for around a quarter of greenhouse-gas emissions. The announcement was broadly celebrated, though several observers were wary, warning that similar pledges in the past failed to slow deforestation at all. The New York Declaration on Forests in 2014 saw many of the same countries pledge to reduce tropical deforestation by 50% by 2020: yet, by 2019, a review of the initiative found that the 2020 goal was probably impossible. Approximately 12.2m hectares of tropical forest were lost last year, a 12% increase from 2019, according to the University of Maryland. Forests play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere: during the 2000s tropical forests are estimated to have absorbed carbon equivalent to around a quarter of the carbon-dioxide emissions generated by human activity.
Late, but better than never | Day 2, November 1st
On Monday November 1st Narendra Modi, the prime minister, laid out India’s new climate pledges to COP26. After a long, philosophical preamble, Mr Modi suddenly shifted quite abruptly to a commitment-filled conclusion. He pledged that India would reach net-zero emissions by 2070; that by 2030 half the country’s electricity would be renewable (with low-emission capacity raised to 500GW, from 450GW); and that it would cut its carbon-dioxide emissions by 1bn tonnes by the same date. A commitment to reach net zero in 50 years puts India one decade behind China (which is aiming for 2060) and two behind the 2050 target committed to by many western countries and often spoken of by Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general. The IPCC—the UN body that collates scientific opinion on climate change—states that global emissions must reach net zero by around 2050 for it to remain even remotely possible for warming to be contained to no more than 1.5°C. But Indian officials believe it unfair to expect the country, which is heavily dependent on coal, to meet the 2050 goal given that its economy is still developing. Even the 2070 target will require vast amounts of investment: Mr Modi closed his speech with a demand for developed countries to provide $1trn to developing countries “as soon as possible”.
Bad beginnings | Day 1, October 31st 
The UN climate summit got off to an inauspicious start on Sunday October 31st. The first tranche of 30,000 delegates gathered in the vast conference centre in Glasgow for COP26’s opening plenaries. At about the same time, some 2,500km to the south-east, leaders from the G20 club  of mostly rich countries—which are collectively responsible for around 80% of current greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide—were wrapping up their own meeting in Rome. That summit was meant to galvanise international political leadership ahead of . It failed to do so. But G20 leaders promised to end overseas financing for coal projects, though it has already largely been curtailed after China, South Korea and Japan, which provide 95% of such funding, pledged to stop. They also promised to slash leaks of methane and recognised the “key relevance” of getting global net emissions to zero by mid-century but skirted round making 2050 the actual target for doing so. Last, they also promised to strengthen national plans to cut emissions “where necessary”.

1782,"President Joe Biden set September 11th as the day by which American troops will pull out of Afghanistan after 20 years. Without their support, other NATO forces are also expected to withdraw. It is not clear how much help the US will now give the elected Afghan government to hold off the Taliban, a jihadist group that seized power in the 1990s and hopes to do so again.
Russia massed more troops along its border with Ukraine. A similar build-up in 2014 preceded the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of the south-eastern part of the country. Mr Biden called for a summit with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, to discuss the situation.

The chief of police said he believed that Kim Potter mistakenly drew her gun instead of her Taser before shooting Daunte Wright. Ms Potter was charged with second-degree manslaughter.
Hundreds of celebrities, bosses and companies signed a statement condemning voting restrictions. They were responding to the American state of Georgia’s new voting law, which critics say would make it harder for black people to vote. Mr Biden has called the rules “Jim Crow in the 21st century”; his predecessor Donald Trump wants a boycott of “woke” firms that speak out against them.

1783,"ALMOST TEN years ago President Barack Obama visited Australia’s parliament to announce a pivot to Asia. “The United States is a Pacific power and we are here to stay,” he declared. This week the White House will echo with similar sentiments, as the leaders of the Quad countries—America, Australia, India and Japan—gather in person for the first time. There will be talk of a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, code for facing down an assertive China. The rhetoric will be familiar, but the reaction may not be: this time both friend and foe may actually believe it.
The reason is AUKUS, an agreement announced last week for America and Britain to supply Australia with at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. The deal has caused waves because of its huge size and because it caused an unseemly row with France, which had a submarine contract of its own with Australia that has now been abandoned.

This belies AUKUS’s true significance, which is as a step towards a new balance of power in the Pacific. In a region where alliances have sometimes seemed fragile, especially during the presidency of Donald Trump, AUKUS marks a hardening of American attitudes. It is a decades-long commitment and a deep one: America and Britain are transferring some of their most sensitive technology. The three countries’ co-operation promises to embrace cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and more besides.
For this the Biden administration deserves credit. And yet the deal still amounts to only half a strategy. America’s relations with China involve more than a military stand-off. In the search for coexistence, America also needs to combine collaboration over issues like climate change with rules-based economic competition. The missing parts involve all of South-East Asia, home to some of the countries most vulnerable to Chinese pressure. And here American policy is still struggling.
Lest that seem grudging, first consider AUKUS’s merits. After Mr Obama’s pivot, America’s friends in Asia suffered a decade of disappointment. China seized and fortified rocks and reefs in the South China Sea, despite competing claims from countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. Last year its soldiers brawled with India’s on the border. Its warplanes and battleships are constantly ratcheting up pressure on Taiwan, which it routinely hints it might invade. China has punished South Korea for perceived affronts with ruinous commercial boycotts. Many Asian countries were beginning to fear that America was too inconsistent and half-hearted to provide a counterweight.

AUKUS offers a rebuttal. One dimension is military. Amid the sea-lanes and islands that are flashpoints with China, nuclear submarines are more versatile than diesel-electric ones. They can gather intelligence, deploy special forces and lurk for months in deep water in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean, a threat that Chinese planners will have to factor in. In addition, AUKUS sets the stage for American forces to operate around Australia, which could serve as a haven from China’s increasingly threatening missiles. The fact that Australia ditched the French deal for the Anglo-American one is evidence of strategic seriousness.
AUKUS’s other dimension is diplomatic. In recent times Australia has borne the brunt of aggressive Chinese tactics, especially after it called for an investigation into the possibility that covid-19 escaped from a Chinese laboratory. As punishment for this and other grievances, China imposed an unofficial embargo on a series of Australian exports. China’s belligerence is typical of the “wolf warrior” diplomacy that has caused consternation across South-East Asia and beyond. By reinforcing Australia, AUKUS sends a signal to the region that America has no qualms about backing allies that are resisting Chinese bullying.
The question is how America should complement the hard power of AUKUS with the engagement needed to trade with China and to work with it. President Joe Biden signalled his aspirations this week in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York. Making clear that he did not want a cold war with China (although he did not refer to it by name), the president called for “relentless diplomacy” to solve the world’s problems.

On the face of it AUKUS threatens this aim. And yet in the long run China will join global efforts to fight global warming not as a sop to America, but because it judges them to be in its interest. Just this week China said it will stop financing coal-fired power plants abroad. That was an easy promise, because such financing had already dwindled—but it was one China could have withheld to signal its anger.
Harder will be to strike the balance over commercial competition. Mr Biden’s economic policy towards China sets out to increase national security by creating jobs at home, with a Maginot line of industrial aims, regulation and government intervention. His Build Back Better World, a mechanism for financing development, (which he did name-check at the UN) is a pale imitation of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
Meanwhile China, already the biggest trading partner of most countries in the region, is strengthening its ability to shape the world’s economic and commercial architecture. It is getting its people into important jobs in international institutions. It is exporting its domestic regulatory norms, as with, say, its claim to jurisdiction over international legal disputes. This week it applied to join the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade pact America championed to counter China and then withdrew from under Donald Trump.
South-East Asia looks to China for its prosperity, so for America to act as a counterbalance calls for deftness and imagination. One sign of how far America falls short is that even the most obvious path—joining the successor to the TPP—is seen in Washington as hopelessly ambitious. Almost as worrying, when America is attempting a ferociously complex balancing act, Mr Biden’s diplomacy with France over AUKUS and his European allies over the pull-out from Afghanistan has been inept.
Celebrate AUKUS therefore. By signalling to China that its assertiveness has consequences, the pact stands to make South-East Asia safer. But remember that a deal over nuclear-powered submarines is just a down-payment on a broader China strategy that from here on will become increasingly hard to pull off. ■",1
1784,"SHOULD VIDEO websites have to review content before they publish it? Where does the boundary lie between hate speech and incitement to violence? Is pornography created by artificial intelligence an invasion of privacy? These are all hard questions, but behind them lies an even more difficult one: who should provide the answers?
On the internet, such dilemmas are increasingly being resolved by private firms. Social networks are deciding what kinds of misinformation to ban. Web-hosting companies are taking down sites they deem harmful. Now financial firms are more actively restricting what people can buy.

The digital gatekeepers are doing a mixed job. But it is becoming clear that it ought not to be their job at all. The trade-offs around what can be said, done and bought online urgently need the input of elected representatives. So far governments have been better at complaining than at taking responsibility.
For an example of how private firms have become the digital police, consider the rules on internet pornography being introduced by Mastercard on October 15th. In a bid to weed out illegal material, the card firm is demanding that porn sites take steps that go beyond what the law requires, including reviewing footage before publication and checking the identity of those who upload or feature in it. Sites that think these sorts of rules too onerous are under no obligation to work with Mastercard. But Visa is also cracking down, and the two firms handle 90% of card payments outside China, meaning that they are becoming the industry’s de facto regulators.
Liberals must strike a balance. Private firms should in general be free to deal with whom they like. Just as Facebook may legally ban people like Donald Trump from its network and Amazon Web Services can decline to host alt-right-friendly apps like Parler, Mastercard is free to drop particular porn sites. Yet the market power of these firms and their often like-minded rivals means that without their approval and support, individuals or businesses may face exclusion, even if they have broken no law. In edge-cases, private gatekeepers will err on the side of caution. What incentive is there for a social network to allow borderline hate-speech, or for a bank to deal with a legally tricky industry like cannabis?
The best remedy would be more competition, so that if Visa and Mastercard bar a porn site or Facebook cancels a controversial figure, consumers have alternatives. That will not happen soon: network effects are powerful in social media and crushing in the payments business.
In the meantime, private companies that find themselves acting as gatekeepers should be transparent about their rules, how they make them and what redress they offer. Under public pressure, social networks have taken steps in this direction. Facebook sends difficult decisions to an independent “oversight board”; Twitter this week published a set of principles for regulating online speech. Financial institutions are more opaque. Mastercard explained its new rules in a blog post. When OnlyFans, a site known for sexually explicit content, blamed banks for forcing a change in its content policy earlier this year, the banks in question made no comment.
Yet the bigger responsibility lies with governments. They are right to be wary of constraining speech. In much of the world leaders are only too ready to muzzle online debate. But carefully laying out a method for drawing lines around free expression and building in safeguards would help clarify where despots have overstepped the boundary.
What is more, in many areas the gatekeeping power wielded by private firms is really a consequence of government inaction. Keeping revenge-porn off the web or limiting children’s access to viral content are areas where governments could act if they wanted to. Instead, the approach of many has been to do nothing and then feign shock when profit-maximising companies come up with answers that may not be in the interest of society.
Politicians are right to warn that some private companies have too much power online. But those firms have ended up with so much responsibility partly because politicians themselves have abdicated it. ■",1
1785,"A STALWART OF the previous regime, now in charge of dismantling it. A camel-rustler turned warlord, now ensconced in a palatial home. And an avuncular economist, who once was a communist.
These are unlikely bedfellows. Yet they are entrusted with the task of building democracy in Sudan. Barely two years after a ruthless Islamist despot, Omar al-Bashir, was deposed, they are supposed to be shepherding the country towards elections in 2024. “We call it the Sudan model,” smiles Abdalla Hamdok, the economist (below left). He is the prime minister appointed by protest leaders in 2019. “A model of partnership between civilians and the military, paradoxically, to bring democracy.”

That model emerged from a power-sharing pact struck in 2019 between leaders of the protesters, who had first taken to the streets eight months earlier, and the generals who had tossed out Mr Bashir when it became clear he would fall. At the top is Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan (centre), Sudan’s de facto president and chairman of the sovereign council, a military and civilian body that oversees Mr Hamdok’s mostly civilian cabinet. Burhan is a general who rose to prominence under Mr Bashir.
Beneath him is a desert warlord, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti). He heads the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary unit that grew out of the Janjaweed, militias notorious for rape and butchery of civilians in the Darfur region. Mr Dagalo (pictured right), now deputy chairman, rose to power through ruthlessness towards rebellious Sudanese. Today he is jostling for primacy in a struggle that may determine whether Sudan’s third attempt at democracy since independence from Britain in 1956 also ends in failure.
Each tells The Economist that the spirit of unity is undimmed. “All components of the transition work together in harmony,” says General Burhan. As evidence he points to successes: a peace deal signed with armed rebels, and the repeal of repressive laws, such as one that banned women from wearing immodest clothing.
General Burhan also highlights the restoration of full ties with America and Israel, which prompted America to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. This has paved the way for Sudan to win relief on more than $56bn of its debt. “Our international isolation of more than 30 years is now over,” says the general.
But behind the façade of camaraderie tension runs deep. Speaking more candidly than his colleagues, Mr Hamdok warns of a “political crisis” stemming from three challenges that could derail the transition. The first is division among civilian leaders. “This was probably the broadest coalition the country has seen for decades,” Mr Hamdok explains. “It managed to topple the dictatorship. But immediately afterwards we started seeing cracks and divisions.” Several of its members have withdrawn from the coalition and returned to the streets. Those that remain squabble over jobs and government portfolios. Critics blame Mr Hamdok’s aloof and timid governing style for failing to maintain unity.

The fragmentation makes it harder for the civilians to handle the prime minister’s second challenge: to rein in the army. Mr Hamdok says he had “very frank discussions” with the generals early on about the army’s excessive power over the economy. General Burhan says this has ended, but that stretches credulity. Several firms which used to belong to Mr Bashir’s family, for instance, now belong to the army.
General Burhan, meanwhile, has emerged as the most powerful and effective of the three. He has muscled in on foreign policy, which is Mr Hamdok’s job. He has strengthened Sudan’s relationship with Egypt and overridden civilian objections to the deal with Israel last year. He has also burnished the army’s nationalist credentials by taking back control of disputed territory on the border with Ethiopia. “Burhan is a shrewd general,” says Yasir Arman, a former rebel who is now advising Mr Hamdok. “He bought time to shore up the army’s position. And now it is stronger than ever.”
But General Burhan’s assertiveness may have exacerbated the third problem Mr Hamdok identifies: fragmentation within the armed forces, and competition between the army and the paramilitary RSF. Created by Mr Bashir as a counterweight to the army and the intelligence service, the RSF has its own command structure and funding. As part of the power-sharing deal, Mr Dagalo is supposed to integrate his forces into the army, which would mean giving up some of his power. The general says this will happen “in the right time”. Mr Dagalo insists it has already happened.
But this superficial harmony could quickly evaporate. In June the RSF and the army began barricading their respective headquarters in Khartoum with sandbags. “It had reached a point where they could have been killing each other on the streets,” says Shaddad Hamid Mauwid, an academic at Khartoum University. Talks between General Burhan and Mr Dagalo have since calmed nerves. Some reckon the general may have agreed to postpone integration indefinitely. Yet that would put him at odds with Mr Hamdok, who feels Sudan should “have one national army”.
Big questions remain about Mr Dagalo. Few doubt he has presidential ambitions. (Over a sumptuous breakfast at his home he tells The Economist he has been taking English and French lessons.) But his footing looks a bit shaky. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which used to pay for thousands of his soldiers to fight in Yemen, no longer have much use for him. And the death of Chad’s dictator, Idriss Déby, has deprived him of another regional ally. Recent visits to both Qatar and Turkey suggest he is seeking new friends.
Perhaps in a sign of anxiety, Mr Dagalo warns of a “coup” by people tied to the old regime. Though this is unlikely, Islamists from Mr Bashir’s former party may conceivably ally with factions in the army to force Mr Dagalo out, notes Jean-Baptiste Gallopin, a French researcher. This could set off fighting across Sudan. Yet other observers believe Mr Dagalo himself would pose a bigger threat to the transition, should he fear for his economic interests—or his freedom. An investigation into a massacre of over 100 protesters in 2019 may point the finger at his gunmen.
Mr Hamdok has been sounding the alarm. In June he warned of civil war if the armed factions are not unified in a single army. He has set a deadline for forming a legislature with civilians in charge and called for a constitutional convention to clarify the place of the army in politics. “For all the years since independence to today, we have been dominated by the military,” he says. The civilians have a chance to reverse this. But only a fleeting one. ■",1
1786,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",0
1787,"“A NEGATIVE OUTCOME, a Taliban automatic military takeover, is not a foregone conclusion,” Mark Milley, America’s most senior soldier, intoned last month while reiterating America’s support for the embattled Afghan government. General Milley is right: such a takeover is not quite inevitable, despite the departure of American troops. But it is growing more likely by the day—in large part because America, whatever its generals say, is doing too little to help.
Ideally, America would not be withdrawing its forces at all. For several years, with only a few thousand troops who sustained few casualties, it had managed to maintain a stalemate between the Afghan government and the Taliban, thanks largely to air power. Yet last year, when Donald Trump was president, America struck a deal with the Taliban. In exchange for a promise from the militants not to harbour international terrorists, it undertook to withdraw from Afghanistan completely. Never mind that the insurgents refused any kind of ceasefire; never mind that they offered nothing more than indirect negotiations with the American-backed government in Kabul; Mr Trump wanted a quick end to the 20-year deployment, and President Joe Biden has stuck by that callous decision.

America’s rush for the exit has allowed the Taliban to drop the pretence of negotiations and redouble their campaign to remove the government by force. The insurgents did not control any of the 34 provincial capitals last week. They have since seized ten. Three of the country’s biggest cities, Herat, Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif, are under attack. America no longer has any military aircraft based in Afghanistan able to repel such assaults. Instead, it is dispatching them from distant bases in the Gulf and carriers in the Arabian Sea—a much less effective arrangement. And many of the mechanics who were helping maintain the Afghan air force’s planes have left with the Americans, further reducing the government’s firepower.
That has led to a rout which, if it continues, will be a disaster. When the Taliban last ran the country, in the 1990s, they kept girls out of school, confined women to their homes and beat anyone who listened to music or wore the wrong clothes. They have not changed much since then. In areas they now control, they are murdering civil servants and NGO workers, and ordering families to hand over single women to “marry” their troops.

A revived Taliban emirate will not just abuse Afghans; it will spread misery around the region. Afghanistan is already the world’s biggest producer of heroin, a business the Taliban happily tax. It also exports millions of refugees, especially to neighbouring Pakistan and Iran. Extremist violence is another export. An offshoot of the Taliban killed tens of thousands of Pakistanis during a bloody terrorist campaign that took years to quell. America’s humiliation may be pleasing to some in the region, but the pleasure will be short-lived.
Yet instead of joining forces to curb the Taliban, regional powers are bickering and jostling for advantage. And instead of finding ways to help the Afghan government, America is backing away fast. On August 10th Mr Biden declared that, in effect, it was up to the Afghan army to fight for itself.
If it is really left to cope on its own, the government will indeed collapse. But America might yet be able to stave that off without reinstating a permanent garrison. It could deploy special forces on brief sorties to bolster the Afghan army, for instance. It could expand the use of carriers to provide air support, or lean on neighbouring countries to allow at least temporary access to American aircraft. Above all, Mr Biden could signal that he does not intend to abandon Afghanistan to its fate—an impression that is doing more than anything else to hasten the Taliban’s advance. Over the past 20 years America has not managed to turn Afghanistan into a flourishing democracy, but it can still stop it from reverting to a violent theocracy. ■",1
1788,"THE GUT microbiome’s effect on health is so big that it is sometimes referred to as a forgotten organ. The trillions of critters in the lower alimentary canal have an influence that seems to reach all over the body—helping regulate weight, for example. In recent years, though, one idea in particular has intrigued researchers. This is that certain mixtures of gut microbes may help cause autism.
It is well known that children with autism suffer gastroenteric problems. They often also seem to have simpler gut floras than their neurotypical peers, and some observations report the presence of unusual species. This has led to the suggestion that these abnormal microecosystems might actually be triggering autism. So tempting is this thought that preliminary experiments intended to tweak the microbiomes of autistic children have been carried out, with apparently positive results.

Unfortunately, the theory that gut microbes can cause autism is built on shaky foundations. The best evidence comes from work on mice, which is problematic because identifying murine behaviour patterns that correspond to human autism is as much an art as a science. Work on people, meanwhile, has been criticised for relying on samples too small to yield statistically definitive conclusions.
But no longer. A study published in Cell by Jacob Gratten of the University of Queensland, Australia, and his colleagues is reckoned to have enough statistical power to answer the question robustly. And that answer is “no”, gut microbes do not cause autism. Dr Gratten’s work indicates that, while there is indeed a correlation to be explained, it is actually autism which (albeit indirectly) affects the gut flora, not the other way around.
Dr Gratten and his colleagues embarked on their project in 2016, using stool samples and dietary information collected as part of two large studies, the Australian Autism Biobank and the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain Project. Of 247 children they selected for inclusion, 99 had been diagnosed with autism, 51 were neurotypical siblings of some of these, and the remainder were unrelated neurotypical children.
There was, they found, a clear connection between individual children’s dietary diversity and the diversity of their gut microbes—with more adventurous diets being associated with richer microbiomes. And since the sensory experiences associated with new foods can be overwhelming to them, autistic children are more likely than others to have restricted diets. Subtracting this effect left no remaining signal. The team thus found no connection between autism and microbial diversity beyond that brought about by autistic children’s food preferences. Nor was there any detectable connection between autism and particular bacterial species of the sort suggested by previous studies.
On the face of things, this is at odds with the findings of the treatment-by-microbiome-tweaking camp, led by Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown of Arizona State University. Her initial studies, admittedly small in number, suggested faecal transplants—used in extreme cases to treat infection with an intestinal bug called Clostridium difficile—had a positive effect on the behavioural traits of children on the autism spectrum, as well as on their gastrointestinal symptoms. She is now supervising clinical trials to test these findings more robustly.
Whether there is really a contradiction remains to be seen. Dr Krajmalnik-Brown, while acknowledging the quality of Dr Gratten’s analysis, still thinks it cannot explain away the results she saw in the preliminary trials. But it is also possible that faecal transplantation, by relieving the uncomfortable symptoms brought about directly by unbalanced microbiomes, improves the behaviour of children with autism, yet does so without affecting the neural underpinnings of the condition. ■

1789,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",0
1790,"THE PLANET is black, perfectly spherical, does not really exist, and is exactly 65,536km around (being the sixteenth power of two, a number any hacker worth their salt would recognise). A single 100-metre-wide road runs round it. All the real estate on the virtual planet is owned by the Association for Computing Machinery, an academic body.
The Association sells parcels of land to enterprising programmers wishing to develop them. Many do: their efforts are responsible for the houses, bars and skyscrapers that line the great road. At any given hour the road bustles with people, or at least, with their 3D avatars. Some are going to work, some are going on dates, many are just milling around in the way that people have done since the invention of streets. A few take their cars—like everything else in that world, really just bundles of computer code—out off the highway and “race [them] in the black desert of the electronic night”.

That is how Neal Stephenson, a science-fiction author, aptly described what he called the “metaverse”, in a tongue-in-cheek cyberpunk novel called “Snow Crash” (1992). Three decades later, the metaverse—a sort of immersive sequel to today’s text-and-picture-based internet—has been anointed as Silicon Valley’s latest Next Big Thing. Microsoft is integrating virtual-reality offices and avatars into its “Teams” remote-collaboration software. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, is so enamoured of the concept that on October 28th he renamed the firm “Meta” to signal its focus on this new “north star”.
It sounds like west-coast techno-utopianism. But some glimpse of the potential could be seen on November 8th, when Roblox, an online game with 200m monthly users, reported its quarterly results. The number of daily players rose 31% year-on-year, to 47.3m, propelling revenue to $509m. David Baszucki, Roblox’s co-founder and boss, said that the firm had predicted the rise of what is now called the metaverse when its first business plan was written 17 years ago. In 2020, when it was still privately held, Roblox was valued at $4bn. Today it is listed and worth $68bn, not least thanks to an over-60% bump in its shares in the past month.
For metaverse enthusiasts like Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist, online games such as Roblox—and “Minecraft”, “Fortnite”, “Animal Crossing” and “World of Warcraft”—serve as proof that immersive virtual worlds can be popular and profitable. According to Newzoo, a market-research firm, consumers spent $178bn on video games in 2020. Besides blasting each other, many gamers use them to keep in touch with distant friends. And they are already happy to spend cash on virtual property. Newzoo thinks around 75% of the industry’s revenue comes from games that allow the sale of virtual goods, for example powerups or clothes for players’ avatars.The video-game industry has been experimenting with virtual worlds for decades, says Raph Koster, a veteran designer, exploring how players use them to socialise, create and run entire economies based on virtual goods. Interest waxes and wanes as each generation’s ambitions bump up against technical limitations, he says. But now that the subject is in the air again, some metaverse enthusiasts reckon that the benefit of all that experience might let video-game firms like Roblox, Epic Games and Unity beat the tech titans to the punch.
Roblox is both a game and a platform. In the same way firms such as Squarespace provide tools that allow tech neophytes to create websites, Roblox comes with a set of easy-to-use programs that let punters build and monetise their own 3D games and experiences. “Piggy”, for instance, is a user-created horror game inspired by “Peppa Pig”, a cartoon. In “Adopt Me”, users rear, collect and trade exotic virtual animals. (The latest craze is programmes based on “Squid Game”, a Netflix series.)
“Every experience is built by our community,” says Manuel Bronstein, Roblox’s chief product officer. The firm busies itself handling behind-the-scenes problems, providing server space and infrastructure to support its users’ creations. It has its own currency, called Robux, which is paid for with real cash. Users can spend it in what is, in effect, an app store that sells the powerups or cosmetic items like shirts, hats or pairs of angel wings which avatars need to stand out. The developers of those virtual items get a cut—around 27%—from each sale.
The game’s popularity has led to other firms offering experiences within Roblox as a marketing strategy—a simple but effective way to merge the digital and the real. Users can wander round a virtual version of the Starcourt Mall, a place in “Stranger Things”, another Netflix series. In May one user resold a virtual copy of a real Gucci handbag for around $4,100. On November 15th Roblox announced grants worth $10m to develop educational experiences, including a simulated trip to the International Space Station.
Mr Baszucki is not the only boss in the games industry with metaversey ambitions. Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic Games, the privately held firm that develops “Fortnite”, has been a fan of the idea since he wrote “Unreal”, an early multiplayer 3D-shooter, in 1998. Like “Roblox”, “Fortnite”—which is, at least on the surface, a straightforward action game—has been flagged as an early example of what a metaverse might look like. “We don’t see ‘Fortnite’ as the metaverse,” says Marc Petit, a vice-president at Epic, “but as a beautiful corner of the metaverse.”
Also like Roblox, it has seen crossovers from the real world. In 2019 “Fortnite” hosted a virtual space battle to promote “Rise of Skywalker” (the “Star Wars” film, in turn, referred back to the in-game event—very meta). In July Ferrari uploaded a virtual version of one of its luxury sports cars into the game for players to drive around. It is not quite the same as renegade hackers racing virtual cars in the “black desert of the electronic night”. But it is not a million miles away, either.
The best-known uses of “Fortnite’s” virtual world have come from the music industry. In 2020 Travis Scott, a rapper, hosted a virtual concert. The malleable physics of the digital world allowed him to do things no amount of stagecraft could accomplish in reality. His hundred-foot-tall avatar, wreathed in lightning, danced and stomped through the game’s pixellated universe, shaking the ground with every step. Around 12.3m people attended, around 60 times more than can fit onto the fields of Glastonbury, a big music festival.
The second prong of Epic’s strategy, besides “Fortnite” itself, is to sell pickaxes in a gold rush. Here it is in competition with Unity, a firm founded in Denmark in 2004 and which went public last year. Both firms sell sophisticated software “engines” that were originally designed to power video-games. Now they are touting them as pieces of general-purpose simulation software that they hope will become a common language in which 3D worlds are built, in the same way HTML underpins websites.
They are already partway there. Games engines are finding uses outside the gaming business. Architectural firms, for instance, use them to build virtual versions of buildings to dazzle clients before construction. Some use them to help manage the build itself. A collaboration between Epic and Cesium, a startup that maps cities and landscapes, allows virtual copies of real cities such as Melbourne or Detroit to be dropped into Unreal, the engine that powers “Fortnite”.
Mr Ball points out that much of “The Mandalorian”, a “Star Wars” TV show, was shot within a virtual world generated by Unreal. Since they are built with the same software, he writes, “audiences could freely investigate much of these sets [in an Unreal-powered world]”—a metaversey twist on charging fans for tours of film sets. Unity recently paid $1.6bn for Weta Digital, a visual-effects studio founded by Peter Jackson, who directed the special-effects-heavy “Lord of the Rings” films. It also unveiled Metacast, a piece of software designed to broadcast sports events into virtual worlds. The firm showed off a mixed-martial-arts bout that viewers could watch from any angle—even the point of view of one of the fighters.
Whether the games firms can compete with the tech titans remains to be seen. Meta’s annual revenues, at $86bn in 2020, make it half the size of the entire gaming industry by itself. But Mr Ball points out that big changes in technology often lead to the rise of new players despite the efforts of old incumbents. And, besides experience, the games industry has plenty of ready-made early adopters for whom virtual worlds are already an established cultural norm. “You have at least two generations of kids who’ve grown up playing online games,” says Mr Bronstein. “Navigating a 3D environment. Hanging out in a virtual world with friends. This stuff is commonplace for them.”■

1791,"CELEBRITY BOSSES used to have nicknames that made a virtue of short fuses and brutality. “Chainsaw Al” and “Neutron Jack” sounded more like wrestlers than men in suits. That kind of moniker would jar today. Inclusivity and empathy are what matter: think “Listening Tim” and “Simpatico Satya”. But just because chief executives seem more normal does not mean that they actually are. The demands of the job require an ever-stranger set of characteristics.
In some ways the path to the top of the corporate pyramid is unchanged. It requires people to compete with each other over an extended period. It demands evidence of financial and operational success. It uses the prospect of money—lots of it—as a lever to incentivise ambitious people. And it selects for familiar traits: hard work, impatience, self-confidence and extroversion. If you would rather stay in and watch “The Great British Bake Off” than wine and dine clients, the role is not for you.

A recent study by Steve Kaplan of the University of Chicago and Morten Sorensen of the Tuck School of Business looks at assessments conducted by ghSMART, a consulting firm, of more than 2,600 candidates for different leadership positions. Candidates for CEO jobs emerge as a recognisable type. Across a range of characteristics they have more extreme ratings on average: they shine in what the academics term “general ability”.
They also differ from other executives in the particulars. Where aspiring chief financial officers are more analytical and focus on the detail, would-be CEOs score higher on charisma, on getting things done and on strategic thinking. These traits also seem to be predictive. By tracking the subsequent careers of candidates, the academics find that people who were applying for a different position but had “CEO-like” characteristics were more likely eventually to wind up in the top job.
Yet firms today are after more than a type-A personality. Mr Kaplan and Mr Sorensen note that CEO candidates with better interpersonal skills are more likely to be hired. Another new piece of research, from academics at Imperial College London, Cornell University and Harvard University, analyses the lengthy job descriptions that companies draw up when they work with headhunters to recruit a new leader. Cognitive skills, operational nous and financial knowledge are prerequisites for success. But over the past two decades these descriptions have placed more and more emphasis on social skills—the ability of bosses to co-ordinate and communicate with multiple people.
Why are these softer skills prized? The answer, according to Stephen Hansen of Imperial College, lies partly in the rise of knowledge workers. Firms increasingly depend on developers, data scientists and IT managers who are used to operating independently. Chief executives are not going to tell these kinds of workers what to do; their job is to make sure that people understand the firm’s goals and toil together effectively. Sure enough, the paper shows that demand for these skills goes up in larger and more information-intensive firms. Social skills matter more when bosses need to persuade as much as instruct.
The wider environment also rewards softer skills. Polling by Edelman, a public-relations firm, suggests that majorities of customers and employees make choices on what to buy and where to work based on their beliefs. Chief executives must mollify politicians, respond to activists and dampen social-media firestorms. It helps if the boss comes across as a relatable member of society, not a volcano-dwelling villain.
It is not yet time to call time on old-fashioned narcissism. Another study, by a quartet of researchers at Stanford Graduate School of Business, surveyed 182 directors about the personalities of their chief executives. The answers suggest as many as 18% of bosses are considered narcissists by their own board members, a prevalence rate perhaps three times that of the general American population. The researchers also find that firms with narcissistic CEOs tend to have higher scores for their environmental, social and governance policies. What better way for an egomaniac to come across as empathetic than to save the planet?
The demands on chief executives make for an increasingly strange mixture. Be more talented than others in the firm, but don't tell them what to do. Crush the competition while exuding empathy. Listen charismatically. Be likeably aggressive. CEOs have always been abnormal. The trick now is not to show it.

1792,"LAST MONTH the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Spandau, a borough in Berlin, stuck a campaign placard for local candidates over one of Armin Laschet, the main standard-bearer of the CDU and the Christian Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian sister party, in the federal election on September 26th. It was a mistake, says a local politician, but stories abound about CDU chapters across Germany declining to put up Laschet placards. On a two-hour walk through Charlottenburg and Mitte, two other boroughs in Berlin, your correspondent did not spot a single one (though there were several with the grinning face of Olaf Scholz, the Social Democratic Party’s candidate).
Some in the CDU are still defiant in public, but the mood is defeatist. The conservative party is used to success: it has occupied the chancellor’s office for 52 of the 72 years of the republic’s existence. It has never polled lower than the 31% it won in the first post-war vote. But it is now facing the real prospect of being booted out of power. A new poll by Forsa put the SPD at 25%, the CDU/CSU at just 19% and the Greens at 17%. In 2013 the CDU/CSU got 41.5% and at the most recent election, in 2017, they got 32.9%.

What happened? Many believe that the CDU/CSU committed a cardinal error when it picked Mr Laschet, the wishy-washy state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, as its candidate for chancellor, instead of Markus Söder, the forceful boss of Bavaria. “The party had the choice between winning with Söder and losing with Laschet,” says Manfred Güllner, head of Forsa. He blames CDU apparatchiks, who feared a takeover of their party by Bavarians.

Another view, propagated by members of the Berliner Kreis, a network of conservative CDU and CSU politicians, is that the CDU is leaking voters because it lost its conservative identity under Mrs Merkel. “That’s absolute nonsense,” says Manuel Hagel, a CDU politician in Baden-Württemberg, who argues that Mrs Merkel’s success in four successive elections speaks for itself.
Julius van de Laar, a political strategist, thinks the troubles stem from a poorly planned campaign that started only in April; an emphasis on change when many voters want continuity; and Mr Laschet’s inept handling of the floods in July that devastated his state. All this played into the hands of Mr Scholz, who presents himself as a clone of the competent Mrs Merkel, copying even her hand gestures.
In a speech on September 7th Mrs Merkel strongly endorsed Mr Laschet and lambasted Mr Scholz for not ruling out a coalition with the polarising Left party. There is still a chance that the CDU will catch up with the SPD: the polls have been extremely volatile in recent months. But it is small. Forsa’s Mr Güllner thinks the party will stick to its choice and probably lose. Even a (highly unlikely) last-minute switch to Mr Söder may not help the CDU very much. Postal voting has already begun.

1793,"FRANKFURT, Aug 27 (Reuters) - German genetic testing specialist Qiagen (QIA.DE) is seeing demand for its COVID-19 tests firming up again, leading it to believe that sagging demand in July was temporary, Chief Financial Officer Roland Sackers said on Friday.
The stock extended gains to hit a 21-year high after the comments, trading 2.6% higher at 47.51 euros by 1520 GMT versus a record 61.24 set in 2000.
Qiagen, whose shareholders a year ago rebuffed a takeover bid by life science tools maker Thermo Fisher (TMO.N), had said in July that faster-than-expected uptake of vaccination campaigns weighed on demand for its diagnostics kits, prompting it to cut its full-year guidance.
Sackers told Reuters that demand for tests had taken yet another turn as continued breakthrough infections from the Delta coronavirus variant in some vaccinated people was fuelling test kit demand.
""We are now at a turning point where we realise that a one-off boost is turning into normal business. COVID is becoming an infectious disease that stays with us. Therefore the tests will stay,"" he said.
In July, Qiagen predicted currency-adjusted sales growth of at least 12% in 2021, down from a previous outlook of 18%-20% amid a dip in demand for COVID-19 tests, even though second-quarter non-COVID related business including latent tuberculosis tests surpassed expectations.
""A growing COVID business is an additional upside to our guidance and it looks like we can realise some of that upside,"" Sackers added, when asked about the revised outlook. ""I'm very confident that we'll have a good third quarter.""
Industry executives and health officials have told Reuters that U.S. companies are scrambling to boost production of coronavirus tests as infection cases soar, and schools and employers revive surveillance programmes.  read more 
A spokesperson for Qiagen, which also serves the U.S. market, said it had the capacity to meet growing demand there.
Asked about the prospect of Qiagen becoming a takeover target again, Sackers said he had strong confidence in the group's growth potential but would not rule out any tie-up.
Qiagen could purchase companies worth well over $1 billion but share buybacks were also an option to spend excess cash, he added.",0
1794,"WHEN KISHIDA FUMIO became the head of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) at the end of September, one of the first things he did was to lower expectations for the party’s future. Public frustration with the government’s handling of covid-19 had helped force the resignation of his predecessor, Suga Yoshihide. Some polls suggested that the party’s dominance in the lower house was under threat in coming elections. Voters seemed lukewarm on Mr Kishida, giving his new cabinet lower approval ratings than incoming prime ministers typically enjoy. Mr Kishida defined “victory” for his party as maintaining a simple majority of 233 seats along with its coalition partner, Komeito, down from 305 before the election.
He was perhaps overcautious. When results were tallied from the election on October 31st, the LDP had lost only 15 seats, leaving it with 261, single-handedly clearing the threshold for both a simple majority and also an “absolute stable majority”, which means that the party can chair and control all parliamentary standing committees. That is a relief for Mr Kishida. And it is a devastating defeat for Japan’s opposition, which had hoped to capitalise on public discontent. Instead, the biggest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), lost 13 seats. On November 2nd Edano Yukio, its leader, announced his resignation.

The opposition’s humiliation is in part the result of potent memories of its messy rule from 2009 to 2012. And it is in part because of bad strategy. The CDP co-ordinated with the Japan Communist Party to put forward unified opposition candidates in many districts, which alienated its own supporters. It also repelled independents, who are around 40% of the electorate and who turned out in relatively low numbers this year. Overall turnout was low, too, at just 56%. That is only a hair higher than the 54% in the previous lower-house election in 2017, which was itself barely more than the post-war record low of 53% in 2014.
Nonetheless, the results are no ringing endorsement of the status quo. Anti-establishment sentiment flowed instead to an upstart libertarian populist outfit based in Osaka, the Japan Innovation Party, which more than tripled its seats, from 11 to 41. It has limited appeal beyond its home region, and it is rare for regional parties to go national in Japan.
But the upstarts’ strong showing suggests that voters may abandon the LDP when presented with an alternative seen as competent. In a recent global study the Pew Research Centre, an American pollster, identified Japan as one of six countries where more than half the population wants “major changes or complete reform to the political, economic and health-care systems”. (The others on the list were America, France, Greece, Italy and Spain.)
Mr Kishida does promise big-sounding changes. He ran his campaign calling for a “new model of capitalism”, contrasting himself with Abe Shinzo, a former prime minister whose “Abenomics” agenda had mixed results. But no one, from Japanese business leaders to those on Mr Kishida’s “new capitalism” council, seems to have much idea what he means by it. Whatever the changes turn out to be, they are unlikely to be radical.
Vagueness pervades Mr Kishida’s other big agenda items, too. He celebrated his victory by making his debut on the world stage, joining other world leaders at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Though he promised an additional $10bn in funding to support measures for decarbonisation elsewhere in Asia, he offered little detail on how Japan plans to reach its own pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2050.
On defence, the LDP promised in its campaign manifesto to raise spending, possibly even doubling it to 2% of GDP, but Mr Kishida has yet to say what he would spend that money on. Nor has he convinced the public and the powerful finance ministry of the need to do so. Little surprise, then, that those in Tokyo happiest about Mr Kishida’s victory are bureaucrats, who see a pliable figure unlikely to upset the status quo. Until the opposition gets its act together, the LDP will not have trouble staying in power. But Mr Kishida still has to prove himself as a leader.■",1
1795,"Left-leaning celebrities took to Twitter to voice their outrage over Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal on murder charges, with legendary performer Bette Midler calling it a ‘tragic day’ and others bemoaning a perceived miscarriage of justice.
Midler fumed at Friday’s verdict to her 2 million followers, saying: ‘#kylerittenhouse found not guilty tho we SAW HIM kill two.
‘Fundamentally stupid, I predict he will go on to a big career on #Fox and in #RadicalRightWing circles, which counts as a plus with them. A tragic, tragic day for decent, THINKING, feeling, ethical people everywhere.’
 Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.     
Donald Trump was one of the few voices in Rittenhouse's camp as he congratulated Rittenhouse, a supporter of the former president, for beating the rap.  
 'Congratulations to Kyle Rittenhouse for being found INNOCENT of all charges,' said Trump in an emailed statement.
‘It’s called being found NOT GUILTY - And by the way, if that’s not self defense, nothing is!' 
 However, his voice was drowned out by a slew of TV and movie stars expressing outrage over Rittenhouse’s vindication. 
Talk show house Andy Cohen summed up his thoughts in five words, tweeting: ‘What in the actual f***.’
Actress Sophia Bush – who is not related to the political dynasty – was as succinct.
‘No words,’ she tweeted to her 1.2 million followers. ‘Just fury.’
She included an illustration that depicted Rittenhouse bragging about the killings to his bar pals and later appearing to sob over his actions in court.
Actress Rosanna Arquette said the ruling prompted her to lose faith in the legal process.
‘I have no faith in the justice system In America today,’ she tweeted. ‘I don’t want to live in a country that is ruled by violent ignorant racists.’
Rittenhouse could be seen smiling in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse Friday afternoon after being cleared of all charges.
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz.
Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, reacted to the verdict in a series of tweets.
‘I know so many are weary and tired,’ she tweeted. ‘But justice is not just about verdicts.
‘It is a continuum. We can galvanize around changing our culture, including challenging the difference in how a Black male teen would have been engaged in Kenosha.’
She later added: ‘I believe that it’s extremely important that we get back to the reason why people were even protesting in Kenosha - Police Brutality.’
Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly was one of the few luminaries that said the jury got it right.
‘Justice was done,’ she tweeted. ‘Kyle Rittenhouse was unfairly maligned by a dishonest press, and politicians who used him to advance their own fortunes.
‘If there are riots, these smear merchants will shoulder much of the blame.’  ",3
1796,"“RUSSIA IS ABOUT bears now, it’s not about bullies.” So joked Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, this week, speaking about the crisis in Europe’s natural-gas market. His country favours stability and lower prices over runaway prices, he insisted: “We would prefer to have here a bear market.”
Russia is responding to a view gaining currency in European capitals that Gazprom, the state-controlled energy goliath that is the continent’s biggest supplier, has been stoking the continent’s energy crisis by withholding exports of natural gas. European parliamentarians are demanding that Gazprom be investigated for not shipping more gas, allegedly as a ploy to secure final regulatory approval for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline designed to ship Russian gas to Germany.

The Cassandras get it half right. Europe is indeed mired in an energy crisis. The price of natural gas has skyrocketed of late across Europe. This has led to panic in Britain, where the government is now considering offering subsidies and other state support for steel, chemicals and other heavy energy users. On October 12th E.ON, a German energy firm, took the extraordinary step of suspending new gas-supply contracts for residential customers.
Worse yet, the continent looks headed for a bleak winter with a possibility of severe gas and power shortages. Matt Drinkwater of Argus Media, an industry publisher, observes that official forecasters are concerned that the La Niña weather phenomenon may produce an especially harsh winter not only in north-west Europe but also in north-east Asia and North America, which would spark further global competition for energy.
Europe’s stores of natural gas were well above the five-year average at the start of 2021, but a long winter combined with lower production in Norway and Britain (in part due to pandemic-related snags) means storage is now at worrying levels. Edward Morse of Citigroup, an American bank, predicts that if this winter is indeed a bitter one, those stores could run out.
Fuel switching was an option in the past, but that is difficult now. For example, green activism has stymied Europe’s nuclear development. James Huckstepp of S Global Platts Analytics, a research firm, notes that the region “can’t flip back to coal plants easily because some of them have been closed—and the rest made unattractive because of carbon policies.” And as recent painful episodes of low wind and depleted hydroelectric reserves across parts of Europe have made clear, renewable energy is not yet a reliable substitute for gas.
Using less gas will be difficult, at least in the short term. But is it possible for Europe to get hold of more gas? One way is to try to bully Russia into exporting more. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently praised Norway for helping with the gas crisis, but pointed an accusing finger at the Kremlin: “This does not seem to be the case in Russia.” But analysts reckon that the gas giant is actually exporting more gas to Europe this year than it did before the pandemic, and its big continental customers have recently confirmed that it is meeting its contractual obligations. There is little hard evidence that Russia is a big factor in Europe’s current gas crisis.
Another possible way to boost supply would be to increase imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship. Over the past two decades, Europe’s strategy of reducing reliance on Gazprom led to big investments in LNG, which now makes up some 20% of the continent’s gas (up from none a few decades ago). When the global gas market was well supplied a few years ago, Europe enjoyed low gas prices thanks to access to surplus cargoes. But the combination of stagnant investment in new production and a sudden spike in global gas demand linked to the global economic recovery has led to a mad scramble for LNG of late.

That has some in Europe pointing, with a bit more justification, to another foreign bogeyman. Mr Morse notes “a tendency among European officials to put the blame on China”. LNG imports have shot up in the Pacific region, with mainland imports soaring by 25% of late. Cargoes from America and the Middle East are spurning European ports, lured by the hefty price premium offered by Asian buyers. One advantage they have is explicit state support. In China, energy-security concerns have led officials to ensure adequate winter supplies “at all costs”.
The other advantage they have, explains Michael Stoppard of IHS Markit, a research firm, is that most Asian gas is still procured on long-term contracts linked to the oil price—a practice Europe abandoned as it liberalised gas markets. Since Asian buyers are hedged, they feel less pain than do European counterparts fully exposed to today’s astronomical prices. Mr Putin has, with some justification, ridiculed Europe’s embrace of “market-based” pricing for gas as the work of some “smart alecs” at the European Commission, and suggested that Gazprom stands ready to revive the old-fashioned type of oil-linked contract.
In the end, no foreign bogeyman offers a satisfying explanation for Europe’s gas crisis. There is another plausible, albeit controversial, explanation found closer to home: the continent’s headlong rush to decarbonise its energy system. Mr Morse argues that what Europe’s leaders are hiding from on the eve of the UN’s big climate summit next month in Scotland is the first crisis of the energy transition. As it shifts away from fossil and nuclear power and embraces renewables, the region has not properly dealt with the need for redundancy on the grid. America has such problems too, but he notes that it is self-sufficient in energy. Europe is far from it. ■

1797,"CHINA’S TECHNOLOGY giants are having a torrid time. At home, a regulatory crackdown is intensifying. In the latest move, on August 17th the authorities released draft antitrust rules that would hurt the business models of titans like Alibaba and Tencent. In the West, meanwhile, governments want to make it harder for Chinese companies to do business in their countries and, in America’s case, to list shares. Some global asset managers are calling Chinese tech stocks “uninvestable”.
The firms are thus casting around for friendlier climes. Foreign markets account for a relatively small share of the Chinese groups’ sales. Tencent made around $5bn in revenues outside mainland China last year, less than 8% of the total. So little of Alibaba’s income is derived from abroad that the company doesn’t bother publishing a geographical breakdown. If it were to start, however, no place would feature more prominently than South-East Asia.

The region is home to nearly 700m people, fast-digitising economies and, crucially, no hardened geopolitical persuasion. Having taken an interest in South-East Asian online darlings such as Lazada (an e-commerce venture majority-owned by Alibaba) or Sea Group (in which Tencent holds a 23% stake), China’s giants are expanding more directly in the region. Last year Alibaba bought half of a 50-storey skyscraper in Singapore, the regional commercial hub. Tencent and ByteDance, the unlisted owner of TikTok, a hit short-video app, have also opened beachhead offices there and set out on local hiring sprees.
Cloud computing presents a particular opportunity. Although the cloud market’s total size in South-East Asia is still relatively small, at less than $2bn a year, it grew by more than 50% in 2020, and shows no signs of slowing. And the Chinese firms are winning an ever greater share of this ever larger pie, mostly from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the American e-commerce empire’s cloud division.
According to Gartner, a research firm, in 2020 Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei, a privately held telecoms colossus, had 22% of the cloud market in South-East Asia and the smaller Asia-Pacific economies, up from 18% in 2019. This year Tencent opened its first data centre in Indonesia and its second in Thailand. In June Alibaba said it would build its first in the Philippines.
Unlike AWS and its American cloud rivals, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure, Chinese firms are comfortable with the principle of data localisation. Many South-East Asian governments mandate that data about their citizens be processed and stored in their territory. Whereas Microsoft and AWS publish reports on the data requests made to them by governments and law-enforcement agencies, Chinese firms do not. This makes the Chinese services attractive to authorities unwilling to compromise on localised data. It also complicates embryonic efforts by America to negotiate a digital trade pact with Asian countries, which would almost certainly try to limit data localisation.
Even before it contributes a big slug of revenues, business activity in South-East Asia is a way to learn what works outside China, notes Tan Bin Ru, the regional boss of OneConnect Financial Technology, a subsidiary of Ping An, a huge Chinese insurer. The environment is both familiar (with millions of Chinese-speakers, who often dominate commerce) and diverse (with different legal jurisdictions and a wide range of income levels). Asian companies have used the region as a staging post to global conquest in the past, notably Toyota, which began its international expansion in Thailand in 1957. China’s giants would love to follow in its tyre tracks. ■

An early version of this article was published online on August 18th 2021",1
1798,"THE NORTH of England got its objections in first. “Abandon us at your peril,” warned the Yorkshire Post on November 12th. Four days later the Manchester Evening News and five other northern newspapers ran almost identical front pages depicting Boris Johnson and his cabinet as characters from Danny Boyle’s 1996 film “Trainspotting” and telling them to “deliver what you promised”. Politicians are thick-skinned and will not mind being compared to heroin addicts. The accusation that they have betrayed the north is more troubling.

The north and Midlands had been promised High Speed 2, a new Y-shaped railway connecting Birmingham, Leeds, London and Manchester (see map). The north had also been led to expect a second high-speed line running east-west, from Leeds to Liverpool. What it got, in the government’s railway plans published on November 18th, is a severely truncated high-speed scheme and several unexciting but worthwhile improvements to the existing railway network. The government has broken its promises. It has also inadvertently revealed what the Conservative Party’s favourite phrase, “levelling up”, actually means. 
The pruning of HS2 was almost inevitable. That grand project was initially misconceived and has been badly managed. It was sold to MPs and the public as a whizzy scheme that would allow business travellers to zip between big cities, making them more productive. Because it is built to carry extremely fast trains, the line has a high engineering specification, driving up its cost. The fragile coalition government led by David Cameron from 2010 to 2015 made matters worse by caving in to southern NIMBYs who wanted the line to run through tunnels for long stretches. HS2 was originally projected to cost £37.5bn in 2009 prices (then $60bn). A review in 2019 estimated the project would come in between £72.1bn and £78.4bn in 2015 prices. Even that sum seemed several tens of billions too low. 
Under the new plan, as under the old one, a high-speed line will run from London to Manchester via Birmingham. But the eastern section of the Y, from Birmingham to Leeds, has been cut back to a spur. The high-speed line will stop a few miles south of Nottingham; from there, fast trains will have to join the existing line. As a result, a journey from Leeds to London will take 113 minutes, up from 81 minutes in the previous plan (but down from 133 now). Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative MP long sceptical of HS2, calls it “a white elephant missing a leg”. 
The proposed new east-west line from Leeds to Liverpool, known as Northern Powerhouse Rail, has also been pruned. Although 40 miles of new high-speed track will be built in the western section, trains will revert to the existing line in Yorkshire (additional tracks will be added in some sections to allow them to overtake each other). Manchester will not get an underground railway station, as local politicians wanted. The line will not run through Bradford, whose 540,000 people are poorly served by rail and road at the moment. 
Some of the money thus saved will be spent on improvements elsewhere. The transport department promises new digital signals, more convenient pay-as-you-go ticketing and funding for a metropolitan transport system in Leeds. The proportion of Britain’s railway network that is electrified will rise from the current 38%. The government even claims that some medium-sized cities and towns will benefit from the pruning of HS2. Under the previous plan, the line would have bypassed Derby and Nottingham, forcing residents of those cities to change trains if they wanted to use the high-speed line. Now that HS2 has been scrapped in that region, the trains will travel to them along existing, upgraded lines.  
Although it was hardly audible above the cries of betrayal, the government put forward an intriguing case for its new plan. “The old plans got the balance wrong,” explained Mr Johnson. They focused too much on showpiece high-speed links and too little on local services—“less glamorous, perhaps, but more important to most people”. The new plan, he claimed, “helps our largest cities, but it also helps smaller places.” The prime minister cited an MP who said that his constituents would rather have a decent bus service to the next town than watch trains zooming by at 200mph without stopping. Furthermore, the new plans can be delivered more quickly than the previous ones. 
This is a poor analysis of Britain’s transport needs. The real point of building new high-speed railway lines, as ministers ought to have said much more loudly a decade ago, is to remove fast trains from the existing network. Once they are gone, it should be possible to run many more local trains—those unglamorous things that improve ordinary people’s lives. It would also be possible to run more freight trains, which would remove lorries from the roads. Odd as it might seem, a new railway line can improve local transport even if the nearest stop is many miles away. 
As a political pitch, though, it is revealing. Mr Johnson talks often about “levelling up” Britain without explaining what he means. The new railway plan provides some clarity. Levelling up is not about grand projects but about marginal improvements that people will notice. It is less about enhancing the productivity of knowledge workers in big cities than about making life more convenient for town-dwellers. It emphasises quick benefits over long-term economic transformation. This might seem a rather pinched vision of Britain’s future. But Britain is a rather pinched country these days.",1
1799,"PANIC HAS set in at the Konrad Adenauer House, the Berlin HQ of Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats (CDU). The long-ailing Social Democrats (SPD), under the steady hand of Olaf Scholz, their candidate for the chancellorship, have opened a clear polling lead, and Armin Laschet, the candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian CSU ally, is plumbing new depths of unpopularity. What to do? Mr Laschet’s answer was to unveil, on September 3rd, a group of obscure advisory “experts” to lend his floundering campaign intellectual heft. They spanned the CDU’s “Christian-social, liberal wings”, beamed Mr Laschet, meaning that they could not agree on a single thing. Observers detected desperation.
A second tactic has been to raise a red scare. Mr Scholz has not ruled out forming a coalition with the Greens and Die Linke, a small hard-left outfit partly derived from East Germany’s Communists. (Nor will he; to do so would reduce his leverage in post-election coalition talks.) The liveliest moment in an otherwise dull televised debate between the chancellor-candidates on August 29th came when Mr Laschet launched a broadside against Mr Scholz for holding the door open to Die Linke. Two days later even Angela Merkel, who has sought desperately to stay out of the campaign, repeated the charge. Mr Scholz, an ultra-moderate who is as likely to invite the Russophiles of Die Linke into government as he is to don a Karneval outfit and down a litre of Kölsch on the streets of Cologne, can probably take the blows. A poll on September 2nd, the first since the debate, gave the SPD a five-point lead over the CDU/CSU—the biggest yet.

To a Hoffest (roughly, a party in a courtyard) in Charlottenburg, a posh neighbourhood in west Berlin, where Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), is geeing up the party faithful at a campaign event. Mr Lindner takes potshots at Robert Habeck, the Greens’ co-leader and a possible rival of Mr Lindner’s for the finance minister’s job in the next coalition. Mr Habeck’s plans for debt-fuelled investment, declares Mr Lindner, run up against a linguistic problem: “debts” (Schulden) sound a lot like “guilt” (Schuld). So instead, howls Mr Lindner, Mr Habeck decides to rebrand it as “credit”! Cue much guffawing. Some years ago Mario Monti, a former Italian prime minister, said that Germans treated economics as a branch of moral philosophy. Perhaps he was right.

Almost 60 years ago Germany signed its first “guest-worker” agreement with Turkey, which kickstarted several waves of migration between the countries. This week Mrs Merkel held a ceremony at the chancellery to pay tribute to Germany’s guest workers and their descendants. “Integration cannot remain a seven-generation task that is never completed because your name is not Klaus or Erika,” she said. It was a laudable sentiment from a chancellor who, in her quiet way, helped usher in Germany's slow acknowledgment of its own diversity (more than one-quarter of the population have what Germans call a “migration background”). The sceptical outsider might wonder why, 60 years on, such a statement remains necessary.

The federal election is not Germany’s only vote on September 26th. Two of the 16 states will also be choosing their assemblies. And if the election in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, a sparsely populated north-eastern state, might struggle to set pulses racing, the Abgeordnetenhauswahl in Berlin, one of the three city-states, should be a livelier affair. A few months ago the Greens thought they were cruising to a victory that would double the tally of states they run. But as nationwide polls go, so, it seems, do metropolitan ones: the SPD has lately opened up a clear lead in the capital. In May Franziska Giffey, the SPD’s charismatic candidate for mayor, had to quit her job as federal families minister amid—what else?—a plagiarism scandal which saw Berlin’s Free University strip her of her doctorate. But Ms Giffey’s campaign is going from strength to strength—even if wags have taken to defacing election posters bearing her name with an artfully placed “Dr”.

In engineering-mad Germany there is a tool for everything—even voting. Thursday saw the launch of the “Wahl-o-Mat”, an online election guide which asks voters three dozen questions on matters like wind-energy subsidies and asylum policy, before telling them which of 40 parties have views that best match their own. Before the 2017 election a staggering 15.7m voters cranked up the Wahl-o-Mat. The number that based their votes on the result is perhaps a little smaller, but either way there is great sport in starting a questionnaire believing yourself to be a Green, social democrat or conservative—only to find that your views align perfectly with Die Urbane, the “hip-hop party”, or V-Party, which aims to advance the interests of vegetarians and vegans.

1800,"NEARLY TWO years into the covid-19 pandemic, China’s propaganda machine is locked in a futile argument with the outside world. The row is about whether this giant country is paying too high a price for its “zero-covid” policy. China’s attempts to eliminate the virus, rather than merely manage it, are certainly costly. They have largely closed China’s borders for 19 months. Dozens of city districts, towns and counties are enduring lockdowns as the highly contagious Delta variant and an early cold snap cause a flare-up of infections. There are several hundred cases of the disease nationwide. Many of them are local transmissions rather than imports from abroad, underscoring Delta’s perils. Controls include roadblocks manned by police in protective suits, closed schools, cancelled trains and testing of millions of residents.
With officials facing punishment for cases on their watch, grassroots harshness abounds. The northern city of Heihe has declared a “people’s war”, with rewards of up to 100,000 yuan ($15,600) for residents who report such pandemic crimes as illegal hunting. A county in Inner Mongolia locked nearly 10,000 tourists in hotels for two weeks to smother an outbreak. Two pharmacies in suburban Beijing lost their licences for selling fever-reducing medicines to a couple without logging their names in a virus-tracking database. The customers, who had earlier visited areas with covid cases and later tested positive, are being prosecuted for failing to report to a fever clinic. Citing possible transmission risks, officials in cities including Chengdu, Harbin and Wuxi entered the homes of quarantined locals and killed their pet cats.

Officials reject foreign reports that call such measures unsustainable. “It’s simply not right to question China’s efforts to eliminate the virus,” complained Xinhua, a state news agency, citing the country’s “robust” economy and calling travel curbs a “minor inconvenience”. Hu Xijin, the editor of a tabloid newspaper, says foreigners are jealous of China’s virus-fighting record, and charges that America has eased pandemic controls because it values “money over life”. In fact, the two sides are talking past one another if they focus on how strict zero-covid policies are. It is more relevant to ask who feels the pain from those controls. They are best understood as a giant utilitarian experiment. To help the majority enjoy an orderly, covid-free existence, a hapless minority—notably those who catch the virus or are suspected of contact with carriers—must sacrifice individual liberties, privacy and dignity.
A focus on the interests of the majority resonates with many Chinese. They remember images of chaos in Wuhan last year, as the virus overwhelmed hospitals in that city of 10m. They know that the health system is weaker outside big urban centres. Many doctors in rural clinics lack university degrees. Intensive-care beds are rare. American-style pandemic policies could have led to millions of deaths. As for closed borders, which cause anguish to expatriates and Chinese with family overseas, they do not greatly pain the 87% of the population without passports.
Many citizens of democratic countries would not tolerate half the rules imposed on China in this pandemic. But the collective sacrifices of the Chinese have produced something remarkable. In a country of 1.4bn people, the official total death toll from the pandemic is under 6,000, compared with almost 808,000 excess deaths in America, which has less than one-quarter of China’s population. Some scepticism of China’s statistics is reasonable, given that officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected, concealed the virus for weeks in late 2019 and early 2020. Yet if large outbreaks were still being concealed today, control systems would start breaking down, for they rely on tracking and tracing fresh cases. Instead, life in much of China is relatively normal.
Strictness for the greater good continues to enjoy unmistakable public support. But Chinese leaders do face a risk whenever public opinion suspects that overly harsh lockdowns actually serve the interests of a minority, ie, officials eager to cover their backs. There are signs of disquiet. Chengdu, for instance, recently broadened its pandemic controls, testing 82,000 people whose mobile telephones had spent ten minutes within 800 metres of a suspected case. Other cities have started copying this approach. But on November 8th two leading epidemiologists and a doctor in Chengdu wrote an open letter warning pandemic officials that such mass testing must be guided by science, and risks causing panic. That officials keep talking about punishing rule-breakers is a sign of at least some public fatigue. It also risks driving the weary to hide from the authorities.
The party calls pandemic control proof that it loves the people
To maintain support, strict controls must be seen to benefit everyone, though a minority will feel the most hardship. Foreigners in China, yearning for borders to open, often suggest that the sight of normality in the rest of the world will soon make Chinese citizens restless. For now, state media keep such envy at bay by presenting the West as a death-stalked hellhole. An online video promoted this week by state media is filled with images of Donald Trump when he was America’s president, and the chaos abroad of those days. It calls American travellers “walking vectors of contagion”.
To date, zero-covid’s worst effects have been felt by luckless minorities, from locked-down residents to those whose livelihoods depend on free movement within and outside China. Fear, and the stigma endured by those who catch the virus, have ensured compliance with orders. Harsh policies have bought China’s leaders time, as they wait for potent vaccines and antiviral drugs that might let them open up safely. Officials have arguably slowed an exit by refusing to approve foreign vaccines that are more effective than China’s, in their eagerness to prove the superiority of one-party rule over Western democracy. Further mutations of the virus may one day challenge China’s strategy. If they make lockdowns more frequent, the ranks of the unlucky will grow.■

1801,"THE GOLDEN mean in California’s one-party politics can be caricatured, only a little unfairly, as the art of sounding progressive while acting conservative. Take housing. Homeowners may recognise that housing affordability and homelessness are acute social problems. But the obvious remedy—more construction—seems unappealing, because it might hurt property values and spoil neighbourhoods. Thus the progressive-conservative position is to insist on building housing at below-market rates, which sounds compassionate but, in practice, means that little new housing actually gets built. This is why it is so encouraging that two days after Gavin Newsom handily defeated a Republican attempt to boot him from office, the governor signed two contentious measures, SB9 and SB10, aimed at increasing housing supply.
In the past decade median home values have surged 165% in both Los Angeles and San Francisco Counties to $830,000 and $1.85m, respectively. Median home prices nationwide increased by 64% to about $375,000. Before covid-19, San Francisco was the costliest city for renters; New York now barely claims the top spot. Californians make up 12% of America’s population, but 28% of its homeless.

The more controversial law of the two is SB9, which ends single-family zoning in the state. This means Californians will now be able to convert their houses into up to four units, depending on the size of their plot. California isn’t the first place to eliminate single-family zoning. Minneapolis and Oregon did so in 2019. As for SB10, that will make it easier for cities to build up to ten apartments on land currently set aside for single-family homes near busy public-transport corridors.
California has built fewer than 100,000 homes a year, on average, in the past decade. Permits issued for new construction plummeted in 2007 when the housing bubble burst, and have not yet returned to their previous level. Estimates for the number of homes the state needs to build just to keep up with population growth vary wildly. The state thinks it needs to build 1.8m homes by 2025; McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons it will need 3.5m. Ben Metcalf of the Terner Centre for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says the magic number is probably somewhere between the two.
If California so badly needs more housing, why is ending single-family zoning controversial? For a long time, making it in America meant having a house in the suburbs with the white picket fence, says Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, a think-tank. Single-family homes are also ubiquitous. As of 2019, they made up 61% of all housing units in the country. San Francisco is America’s second-densest city after New York. Yet 51% of residential land in the county is zoned for single-family homes (see map).

Although single-family homes are everywhere, they were not initially meant for everyone. Today the Bay Area is a laboratory for some of the country’s most progressive policies. Yet in 1916, Berkeley was among the first places to enact single-family zoning. Banning apartments and commercial buildings was a way to exclude poor Americans from desirable neighbourhoods. At best, the practice was snobbish. At worst, it helped segregate cities by class and race. After the Supreme Court struck down explicitly racial zoning ordinances in 1917, zoning by land-use became widespread. Metal gates still ring Berkeley’s upmarket Claremont neighbourhood today; it was one of the first places zoned for single-family homes.
The new laws will bring incremental change rather than revolution. An analysis from the Terner Centre found that SB9 could make new development possible on 5.4% of existing single-family lots. That may sound very little, but it would still create about 700,000 new units, 40% more than would otherwise have been developed. The units will also probably be built slowly, since the law depends on Californians voluntarily renovating their homes.
Even so, SB9 and SB10 have incensed the state’s vocal NIMBY constituency. NIMBYs and their YIMBY nemeses have become tribal factions in California politics. Groups seemingly removed from housing policy scream their opinions. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation runs a housing advocacy outfit that took out a full-page ad in the Sacramento Bee beseeching Mr Newsom not to sign the bills.
Among the staunchest opponents of SB9 are those who liken the law to a power grab by the state that takes planning decisions away from cities. Some local officials in southern California talk about Sacramento, the state capital, with a prickly disdain usually reserved for faraway Washington, DC. Bill Brand, the mayor of Redondo Beach, a small city south of Los Angeles, has proposed an amendment to California’s constitution that would reassert local control over land-use decisions.
Opponents also argue that the law will hasten gentrification by allowing firms to buy up single-family homes, renovate them and sell them at higher cost. A requirement for property owners to live in one of their redeveloped units for three years should help assuage fears of rampant speculation. Some gentrification will probably still happen as neighbourhoods change, says Mr Metcalf. But it would come from homeowners being enticed to sell, rather than tenants being forced out because they can no longer afford the rent.
The biggest criticism levelled at SB9 is that it does nothing to create affordable housing. The new duplexes will be cheaper than the single-family homes that predated them, but may still be too pricey. Yet market-rate housing is also badly needed. “You’re criticised for having too many affordability requirements, or not enough affordability requirements”, says Scott Wiener, a state senator and the perennial author of California housing bills. “No matter what you do, people are going to nitpick at the bill. Frankly that is one explanation for why we have a housing crisis.”
To turbo-charge homebuilding, California might take a lesson from improv comedy and adopt a “yes, and” approach to housing. Yes, end single-family zoning—and build affordable housing, streamline the permit process, help cities navigate tricky policy and crack down on municipalities that are not building. These laws alone “are not going to end the affordability crisis in California,” says Jason Elliott, Mr Newsom’s housing tsar. “No one is suggesting they are.” But it’s a start. ■",1
1802,"THE ARMS of the European Union can sometimes stretch half-way around the world. That, at least, was New Zealand’s experience. In 2017 John Edwards, the country’s privacy regulator, urged its government to overhaul a dated privacy law. There were several good reasons, but one of the strongest originated 11,000 miles from Wellington. The European Union’s sweeping new data law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), was coming into force. Without reform, Mr Edwards warned, the EU could strip New Zealand of its “adequacy” status, which allows businesses to zip data freely back and forth between the trade bloc and other countries. That would have cost New Zealand an important competitive edge. The law was duly upgraded. Without a whisper of a threat of sanctions, the gravitational pull of EU regulation had reshaped the laws of a distant sovereign state.
Mr Edwards will soon have the opportunity to recount that experience to British ministers. On August 26th he was named the government’s preferred candidate for the role of information commissioner, the national privacy regulator. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, intends to review Britain’s privacy law, with the aim of shifting it further from Europe. That risks a confrontation that could cost Britain’s own “adequacy” status, and will test whether the EU’s remit also runs closer to home.

Even as the Brexit drama was unfolding, Britain diligently implemented the GDPR in domestic law. Its loyalty to the “European privacy family” was rewarded by the European Commission with an adequacy decision, which recognised that Britain’s rule book was “essentially equivalent”. That was a relief for the many businesses that rely on cross-border transfers of personal data, such as London’s fintech companies, lawyers and insurers. Without it they might have had to rely on fiddly contractual clauses or even to shift operations to the continent.
Mr Dowden intends to reduce the volume of cookie pop-ups that greet users when they visit a new website (which are a product not of the GDPR but of an earlier EU data-protection directive). Guidance for academic research will be streamlined. More radically, the government wants to cut the compliance burden on small companies, and to allow data collected for one purpose to be used for another. Ministers want the office of the information commissioner to pay less attention to tackling low-level breaches.
At the same time, they hope to extend Britain’s own “adequacy” agreements to America, Singapore, South Korea and other places the EU’s regime does not cover. According to Neil Ross of techUK, a lobby group, an updated data-protection rule book together with access to larger pools of data from around the world could make Britain marginally more attractive for research. But many companies have adopted GDPR as their global default, so it will be hard for them to take advantage of any British divergence.
The European Commission knew this was coming. The adequacy decision it granted to Britain was intentionally rickety, collapsible at a moment’s notice if Britain weakens its data-protection law too much, strikes data-sharing deals with less strict countries or fails to co-operate with the commission’s inquiries. Unlike the EU’s other adequacy agreements, it lapses in 2025 if not specifically renewed.
The British government stresses that its rules do not have to remain identical to the EU’s in order to be “essentially equivalent”. But its scope for divergence “is more a porthole than a floor-to-ceiling window”, says Mark Young, a partner in the London office of Covington  Burling, an American law firm. Defining precisely what would be acceptable is not straightforward, he notes, since it is hard to draw clear precedents from the EU’s previous adequacy decisions. Loosening the regulatory burden on small companies, for example, is riskier than it sounds, since cutting-edge tech firms are often small.
And the decision depends as much on politics, both European and British, as on legal precedent. The credibility of the EU’s global privacy regime is at stake if a large, recently departed member can shred it without suffering consequences. Privacy hawks in the European Parliament distrust Britain’s security and immigration services and will demand a firm line. But the economic disruption that would follow ending the adequacy agreement would be a headache for both sides, and a high price for British businesses to pay for the relatively modest prize of looser rules. On striking his Brexit deal, Boris Johnson declared Britain had escaped the EU’s “lunar pull”. That seems unlikely. ■",1
1803,"AT FIRST GLANCE, a murder in Istanbul, an abduction in Dubai and a deportation from Austria may seem to be unrelated. But they are all part of a disturbing pattern of behaviour by authoritarian regimes, which are using violence, intimidation and technology to silence dissent abroad. A report published on February 4th by Freedom House, a think-tank, argues that “transnational repression” has become more common. It found that 31 states had physically attacked their citizens living in other countries since 2014, with China, Russia and Rwanda among the worst offenders. China alone is responsible for 214 of the 608 direct attacks recorded. Millions more have been intimidated by harassment, digital surveillance and smear campaigns.
Regimes differ in the way they choose their targets. China goes after a wide variety of victims: religious and ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs, political dissidents, human-rights activists, journalists and former princelings. Russia targets outspoken politicians and former insiders who might spill President Vladimir Putin’s secrets. The Kremlin does not usually harass ordinary Russians abroad. However, the regime in Chechnya, a violent Russian republic, does. Chechens who have fled to western Europe are routinely spied on, threatened and occasionally killed. Iran and Saudi Arabia target outspoken exiles. Turkey hunts for Gulenists, members of an Islamic group whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for an attempted coup in 2016.

Physical attacks, such as murders, assaults, detentions and illegal deportations, are the most direct method of crushing enemies abroad. Freedom House believes there have been many more cases than it has managed to count. Blatant assassinations, such as the dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and a columnist for the Washington Post, in his country’s consulate in Istanbul, are quite rare. Illegal deportations and forced renditions, favourite tactics of Iran and Turkey, are more discreet. Dissenters can be hauled back home, tortured and sometimes executed away from the gaze of disapproving foreigners.
Grabbing people on foreign soil can be hard to do alone, so many countries turn for help to friendly foreign powers or even to formal international agreements. The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a security pact involving China, India, Russia and five Asian “stans”, has a shared “blacklist” of dissidents. Saudi Arabia uses the Gulf Co-operation Council to keep tabs on unreliable exiles.
Democracies can be unwitting accomplices. In March 2020 Austria complied with a request to deport Hizbullo Shovalizoda, an activist, back to Tajikistan. Austria’s Supreme Court later invalidated his extradition, but he is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for extremism. Rogue regimes have long manipulated the “red notices” of Interpol, an international policing organisation, to snare their opponents abroad (Russia has issued more than 40% of all such requests for arrest pending extradition now in circulation). And America’s “war on terror” provided regimes with both a model for rendition and a criminal label for those they want to abuse: 58% of the victims identified by Freedom House had been accused of terrorism.
Governments can also make exiles’ lives difficult in more subtle ways. Common tactics include withholding travel documents, denying consular services and threatening relatives back home. For example, in its attempt to shut down the website of a group of Ahmadis, a religious minority, in America, Pakistan has reminded the exiles that Ahmadis back home can be charged with blasphemy for referring to themselves as Muslims. Since many have relatives in Pakistan, where blasphemy is punishable by death, this is a potent threat.
Technology is making it easier for states to oppress at a distance. The internet and social-media networks which at first connected and empowered dissidents can now trap them, explains Marcus Michaelsen, a researcher who studies authoritarian politics. The Arab Spring a decade ago was a turning point. From thousands of kilometres away, states are now able to track the movements of anyone with a smartphone or a laptop, deploying surveillance software and malware to monitor and harass them. Some even have “backdoor access” to social-media platforms. Saudi Arabia bribed a Saudi programmer at Twitter to provide the whereabouts of troublesome tweeters. China is believed to exercise control over WeChat, a lifeline for Chinese abroad. Such technologies make it easier not only to find out where people are, but then to threaten them, or worse.
Technology also makes repressive regimes more aware of far-flung dissidents’ grumbling. Once they had no idea what the diaspora said about the tyrant back home. Now they can monitor social media and hear every unencrypted and possibly seditious word. This makes the exiles seem more of a threat, so repressive regimes feel more impelled to go after them.
The technology and tactics of extraterritorial repression are, for their perpetrators, helpfully inexpensive. “More and more states are realising that this is easy to do and fairly cheap,” says Gerasimos Tsourapas, of the University of Birmingham. Rwanda, a small, fairly poor African country, is a striking example. Determined to silence those who challenge its self-image as an African “development darling”—and to crack down on those who question its version of the country’s bloody history—the government extends its repressive reach far beyond its borders. Last year Paul Rusesabagina, a former hotelier whose heroism saving Tutsis during the genocide was portrayed in the film “Hotel Rwanda”, was kidnapped in Dubai and brought home. He has since been charged with terrorism; many suspect his real crime is to be an outspoken opponent of Rwanda’s autocratic president, Paul Kagame. Like China, Rwanda seeks to control its people abroad through spyware, an army of social-media trolls, and a coercive network of embassies and expatriate organisations. Senior regime insiders who defect have the most to fear. A former intelligence chief, for example, was strangled in a hotel room in South Africa. But Freedom House says that “all Rwandans are at risk of transnational repression.”
One reason why rogue states get away with harassing exiles is that democracies often look the other way. Sometimes, argues Mr Tsourapas, by acceding to extradition requests and Interpol red notices, and by broadening the definition of terrorism, they have even been complicit.
Extraterritorial repression is not new—Leon Trotsky was in Mexico City, more than 10,000km from Moscow, when Stalin had him murdered with an ice pick. What is new is the ease with which dissidents can be snooped on from afar. This, coupled with the global rise of authoritarian regimes and the disinclination of the previous American administration to advocate human rights, has allowed ever more despots to spread fear globally. As Freedom House argues, stopping them will require the re-assertion of international norms and the punishment of the worst offenders.",1
1804,"OBSERVERS OF MILITARY developments on the Korean peninsula were given whiplash on September 15th. Around lunchtime in Seoul, news broke that North Korea had fired two ballistic missiles off its east coast. Shortly afterwards the South Korean government announced that Moon Jae-in, the president, had observed the successful test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, the development of which the armed forces had previously declined to confirm. The parallel tests came hot on the heels of North Korean state-media reports that the country had successfully tested a new class of cruise missile over the weekend. For good measure, South Korea confirmed this week that it had recently developed a new cruise missile, too.
The Korean peninsula is entering a dangerous new phase in its arms race. North Korea, which resumed testing missiles in 2019 after a brief pause the previous year, has since continued to expand both its nuclear and its conventional arsenal, despite UN sanctions that ban it from doing just that. It has focused on new missiles that may be better at evading the South’s detection systems, rather than the intercontinental ballistic sort that could threaten America. Meanwhile the South has been ramping up defence spending and beefing up its own arsenal.

Three generations of North Korean dictators have sought to build ever more fearsome weapons, seeing this as essential for their survival. The South’s build-up has accelerated more recently, spurred by growing concerns about the durability of the alliance with America and the increasing tension between China and America. Donald Trump, America’s previous president, fuelled those concerns with his isolationist rhetoric and his dim view of alliances. So did the perceived lack of support from America when South Korea suffered a painful Chinese boycott after agreeing to host an American anti-missile system in 2017. Since taking office that year, Mr Moon has worked to make South Korea less dependent on America for its defence.
Diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions on the peninsula have been deadlocked since 2019. North Korea has spent the best part of two years entirely closed off from the world in a bid to ward off covid-19. The restoration of a communications link between the two Koreas in June (following the demolition of a joint liaison office by the North a year earlier) did not lead to wider detente. Then the North stopped returning the South’s calls ahead of joint military exercises between the South and America in mid-August.
The exercises, which the North views as practice for an invasion by the South, may be one reason it has resumed testing, reckons Ramon Pacheco Pardo of King’s College in London. “They need to test those new missiles to see if they work, and doing it now allows them to send a message of disapproval at the same time,” he says. There is growing pessimism about the prospect of further talks. The ballistic-missile tests came a day after America’s special representative for North Korea met senior South Korean and Japanese officials in Tokyo to discuss ways to cajole the North back to the table. South Korea’s armed forces, which tend to be cagey about identifying the North’s weapons to avoid raising tensions, this time quickly pointed out that they were sanctions-busting ones.
The timing of the South’s test, too, is hardly diplomatic. The submarine launch coincided with a visit to Seoul by China’s foreign minister, who had met his South Korean counterpart as well as Mr Moon earlier in the day. He was there to discuss not just relations between China and South Korea, but also joint efforts to persuade the North to resume negotiations about its nuclear arsenal. Mr Moon’s speech about the need for missiles on subs to defend against “omnidirectional threats” will not have helped with that. Meanwhile, South Korea’s National Security Council expressed “deep concern” about the North’s “provocation”. As a South Korean saying has it, “What I do is romance; what others do, adultery.”■

1805,"THE STREETS of Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city, have a dystopian feel these days. Marks of the protests which have convulsed the country for the past three weeks are visible everywhere. Several bus stations are now burnt-out shells; many petrol stations have been abandoned. The stench of rubbish and faeces fills the air. Towards the east of the city, protesters have occupied Puerto Rellena, a big crossroads, and renamed it “Puerto Resistencia” (Port of Resistance). Surrounded by bonfires and stolen cars, and with rap music blaring, they dance and light candles in honour of those hurt in confrontations with the police. “We’re here because we are tired of corruption, we are tired of struggling, we are tired of being poor,” says Blanca Cortés, a mother of two.
Cali has been hardest hit by the protests that began on April 28th in response to President Iván Duque’s proposed tax-reform bill. Despite the withdrawal of the bill on May 2nd and the resignation next day of Alberto Carrasquilla, the finance minister, people are still out on the streets.

Most protests are peaceful, but several have descended into violence, probably with the involvement of criminal groups. At least 16 people have died, according to Human Rights Watch, a pressure group, and 740 have been injured, according to government figures. Some 850 police officers have also been hurt. Roadblocks erected by the protesters across the country have led to shortages of food, medicine and vaccines at a time when Colombia is experiencing a third wave of covid-19.

The primary reason for the protests is economic. Despite decent growth since the early 2000s, inequality remains high. At the current rate of improvement, it would take 11 generations for descendants of a poor Colombian to attain the average income, estimates the OECD. The protests follow on from demonstrations in 2019, when thousands took to the streets to demand better wages and more money for higher education. The pandemic, and one of the longest lockdowns, has exacerbated these problems. Last year the economy shrank by 6% and the government’s budget deficit tripled to nearly 8% of GDP. Some 2.8m people fell into extreme poverty (earning less than 145,000 pesos a month, or $38).
Discontent with Mr Duque, who had approval ratings of 33% before the riots, has also brought people out onto the streets. The president has failed to keep his campaign promise to make Colombia safer. Voters plumped for him rather than the leftist Gustavo Petro in 2018 partly because his party, the Democratic Centre, was known as the “party of security”. But at the beginning of his term Mr Duque spent most of his time attacking the peace deal his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed in 2016 with the FARC, a Marxist guerrilla group, rather than dealing with the causes of crime.
Since then, smaller illegal armed groups—descendants from the FARC or right-wing paramilitary groups—have grown stronger. Working with Mexican gangs, they supply around 70% of the world’s cocaine. Colombia is producing more of the drug than at the height of Pablo Escobar’s reign, says Alejandro Eder, a politician who helped negotiate the peace deal. Indeed it is highly likely that the extreme violence in Cali, where around 180 gangs are based, was exacerbated by criminals who see an opportunity to create chaos.
More broadly Mr Duque has failed to see that Colombians, and especially the young, have a new set of “political values’‘, argues Andrés Mejia, a political analyst. With the FARC officially gone, they are more comfortable with left-wing politics. They also have more precarious living standards. Even before the pandemic hit, fully 28% of those between the ages of 20-24 were neither employed nor studying in a school or university. It is no surprise that most demonstrators are young, nor indeed that support for Mr Petro, Mr Duque’s left-wing former rival, is surging. He now polls at around 38% and is the frontrunner in next year’s presidential election.
The tax-reform bill would have dealt with some of these underlying economic issues, by increasing taxes on the rich so that the government could spend more on transfers to the poor. But it was seen by many as unfair. Now the protesters have a list of more than 100 grievances. Among other things, they want Mr Duque’s government to stop forcibly eradicating coca bushes, both manually and by aerial spraying. They are also demanding the introduction of a basic-income programme for 20m people that would cost the government 6% of GDP. In Cali people are furious at Jorge Iván Ospina, the city’s mayor, because he splurged public funds in a virtual version of a yearly salsa fair. Some 40% of the money was misspent or wasted, according to the body that examines public expenditure.
Mr Duque has tried to meet with the peaceful protesters, as he did in November 2019. “The most important thing is that we have to turn this into an opportunity,” he said in an interview with The Economist, adding later that “my obsession today is that we can address the needs of the youngsters”. On May 11th he announced that the poorest 50% of students, who account for 97% of those at public universities and technical schools, would get free education from the second half of the year. The government will soon start a job-subsidy scheme, in which it covers 25% of the salary of around 500,000 18-to-28-year-olds for at least a year, in order to boost employment among the young.
But so far the meetings between Mr Duque and civil-society groups, including the National Strike Committee, an alliance of trade unions and other pressure groups that convened the protests, have not persuaded people to leave the streets.
Another problem is that Mr Duque has no way to pay for these handouts, both of which were in his tax bill. On May 20th Standard  Poor’s, a big credit-rating agency, downgraded Colombia’s foreign-currency debt, ending a decade in which it had enjoyed investment-grade status. This will sharply increase the costs of borrowing for the government, making it even harder to raise the money the protesters would like the government to spend.
Mr Duque’s political weakness does not help, either. His term ends in August 2022 and his party does not have a majority in the national Congress. Videos of police beating protesters have damaged Colombia’s reputation abroad. On May 13th Claudia Blum, the foreign minister, resigned amid criticism from the UN, the United States and other foreign governments over the government’s handling of the protests.
In Chile, huge protests in 2019 were appeased partly with the promise of a vote on a new constitution. By contrast, no single measure can “deactivate” Colombia’s protests, says Francisco Miranda, a political analyst. The demands are too diverse.
Meanwhile Mr Petro is trying to strike a balance between supporting the protests, as most Colombians do, and opposing things like the roadblocks, which most people object to. If he can pull that off, he may become Colombia’s first left-wing president. Even if he doesn’t, however, the past few weeks have shown how much the country has changed.■",1
1806,"HOW MUCH is the local Amazon warehouse paying? Raina Summerson used to ask that question a couple of times a year. Now her firm checks most weeks, such is the competition for workers. In parts of the country she has raised pay at Agincare, the care provider she runs, to £11 ($15) an hour from around £9.50 before covid-19 struck. Even so carers are scarce: “We are turning away work every day in every one of our locations.”
That is bad for business—and for the health service, the source of much of that work. With hospitals unable to free beds because of a lack of carers, patients ready for discharge are piling up, crowding out new admissions. In October, across England, nearly 120,000 people spent more than four hours waiting to be admitted. Even in the worst winters, waits have never been so long (see chart).

Outside the wards are ambulances trying to discharge patients and unable to pick up fresh ones. The average wait for a “category two” incident (concerning a serious condition such as a stroke, chest pain or burn) is 54 minutes, up from an average of 25 last year and missing a target of 18. Research shows longer waits are associated with more deaths. The West Midlands ambulance service has warned delays are putting patients at risk of “catastrophic” harm.

Pressure is ratcheting up almost everywhere, says Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals. After nearly two years in which people have tried to stay away from health-care facilities, patient demand is now higher than it was before the pandemic. More primary-care appointments are by phone, which tends to mean more referrals. Patients presenting for acute care, meanwhile, are sicker, suggesting that the wait for treatment has taken a toll on their health.
Fewer than 9,000 people are in hospital with covid, down from more than 34,000 in January. But that is still a lot, and infection controls further reduce the number of beds available. “We’ve stopped using areas that were unsuitable even before the pandemic,” says an emergency doctor. According to Mr Hopson, the combination of covid, anti-infection measures and the difficulty of discharging patients has cut the number of beds available by a third.
What particularly worries hospital bosses is how early in the year this crunch has come. The normal pattern is for problems to mount until January, and sometimes longer. Having declined for three weeks, covid cases are now ticking back up, meaning those with the disease will continue to take up space. And anti-covid measures are making recruitment more difficult. Ms Summerson lost 20 of her 1,100 care-home workers because of a national vaccine mandate which came into effect on November 11th.
Winter is tough in health-care systems everywhere. That the taxpayer-funded NHS falls into a “crisis” every year—and is suffering so early in this one—reflects how little slack it has. It runs on relatively low numbers of doctors and nurses. In Europe, only Sweden has fewer beds per person than Britain does. Other rich countries with small numbers of beds also tend to have more “step-down” care, so people do not linger in hospital.
Policymakers have long sought to divert patients away from accident-and-emergency departments. The latest attempt is a health and care bill making its way through Parliament, which the government promises will move “services out of hospitals and into the community”. Yet two decades of attempts to do just that have so far had little success, notes Nigel Edwards of the Nuffield Trust, a think-tank. That is both because preventive health care is inherently difficult and because of hospitals’ dominance within the NHS.
Even if this attempt succeeds, it will take time to bear fruit. Spending on health care is set to rise by 4% a year for the next three years, which will ease pressures, but not immediately. The decision on November 15th to offer covid boosters to over-40s will help, but will not make a big dent in patient numbers. It is already too late to meet many of the goals in the NHS’s emergency-care “recovery” plan, published in September (“patients should not be left waiting in ambulances for handover to emergency departments,” for instance).
A spoonful of sugar
Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is establishing a “delivery unit” under the guidance of Sir Michael Barber, who set up the original one for Tony Blair in the 2000s and another for Boris Johnson that works on a wide range of policies. The new unit will include 30-odd people from the health department, NHS and outside government, and will scrutinise health-care data in an attempt to cut surgical waiting lists. This focus on waiting times for operations could, however, fall victim to deteriorations in emergency care, which will suck up hospital beds and attention.
All this is a problem for a government that has done a great deal to tie its fortunes to those of the health service. Before the general election in 2019, Mr Johnson toured hospitals vowing more nurses, equipment and cash (as he also did before the Brexit referendum). Having now raised taxes in order to increase spending on the health service, even more rides on its performance improving. Until it does ministers must hope, as one Conservative politician puts it, that “people are quite used to NHS war stories”. Yet the coming months may bring enough casualties to shock even hardened observers. ■",1
1807,"BY THE AGE of seven months, most children have learned that objects still exist even when they are out of sight. Put a toy under a blanket and a child that old will know it is still there, and that he can reach underneath the blanket to get it back. This understanding, of “object permanence”, is a normal developmental milestone, as well as a basic tenet of reality.
It is also something that self-driving cars do not have. And that is a problem. Autonomous vehicles are getting better, but they still don’t understand the world in the way that a human being does. For a self-driving car, a bicycle that is momentarily hidden by a passing van is a bicycle that has ceased to exist.

This failing is basic to the now-widespread computing discipline that has arrogated to itself the slightly misleading moniker of artificial intelligence (AI). Current AI works by building up complex statistical models of the world, but it lacks a deeper understanding of reality. How to give AI at least some semblance of that understanding—the reasoning ability of a seven-month-old child, perhaps—is now a matter of active research.
Modern AI is based on the idea of machine learning. If an engineer wants a computer to recognise a stop sign, he does not try to write thousands of lines of code that describe every pattern of pixels which could possibly indicate such a sign. Instead, he writes a program that can learn for itself, and then shows that program thousands of pictures of stop signs. Over many repetitions, the program gradually works out what features all of these pictures have in common.
Similar techniques are used to train self-driving cars to operate in traffic. Cars thus learn how to obey lane markings, avoid other vehicles, hit the brakes at a red light and so on. But they do not understand many things a human driver takes for granted—that other cars on the road have engines and four wheels, or that they obey traffic regulations (usually) and the laws of physics (always). And they do not understand object permanence.
In a recent paper in Artificial Intelligence, Mehul Bhatt of Orebro University, in Sweden, who is also the founder of a firm called CoDesign Lab which is developing his ideas commercially, describes a different approach. He and his colleagues took some existing AI programs which are used by self-driving cars and bolted onto them a piece of software called a symbolic-reasoning engine.
The heart has its reasons...
Instead of approaching the world probabilistically, as machine learning does, this software was programmed to apply basic physical concepts to the output of the programs that process signals from an autonomous vehicle’s sensors. This modified output was then fed to the software which drives the vehicle. The concepts involved included the ideas that discrete objects continue to exist over time, that they have spatial relationships with one another—such as “in-front-of” and “behind”—and that they can be fully or partly visible, or completely hidden by another object.
And it worked. In tests, if one car momentarily blocked the sight of another, the reasoning-enhanced software could keep track of the blocked car, predict where and when it would reappear, and take steps to avoid it if necessary. The improvement was not huge. On standard tests Dr Bhatt’s system scored about 5% better than existing software. But it proved the principle. And it also yielded something else. For, unlike a machine-learning algorithm, a reasoning engine can tell you the reason why it did what it did.
You could, for instance, ask a car fitted with a reasoning engine why it had hit the brakes, and it would be able to tell you that it thought a bicycle hidden by a van was about to enter the intersection ahead. A machine-learning program cannot do that. Besides helping improve program design, such information will, Dr Bhatt reckons, help regulators and insurance companies. It may thus speed up public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.
Dr Bhatt’s work is part of a long-standing debate in the field of artificial intelligence. Early AI researchers, working in the 1950s, chalked up some successes using this sort of preprogrammed reasoning. But, beginning in the 1990s, machine learning improved dramatically, thanks to better programming techniques combined with more powerful computers and the availability of more data. Today almost all AI is based on it.
Dr Bhatt is not, though, alone in his scepticism. Gary Marcus, who studies psychology and neural science at New York University and is also the boss of an AI and robotics company called Robust.AI, agrees. To support his point of view, Dr Marcus cites a much-publicised result, albeit from eight years ago. This was when engineers at DeepMind (then an independent company, now part of Google) wrote a program that could learn, without being given any hints about the rules, how to play Breakout, a video game which involves hitting a moving virtual ball with a virtual paddle.
DeepMind’s program was a great player. But when another group of researchers tinkered with Breakout’s code—shifting the location of the paddles by just a few pixels—its abilities plummeted. It was not able to generalise what it had learned from a specific situation even to a situation that was only slightly different.
Back to the future
For Dr Marcus, this example highlights the fragility of machine-learning. But others think it is symbolic reasoning which is brittle, and that machine learning still has a lot of mileage left in it. Among them is Jeff Hawke, vice-president of technology at Wayve, a self-driving-car firm in London. Wayve’s approach is to train the software elements running a car’s various components simultaneously, rather than separately. In demonstrations, Wayve’s cars make good decisions while navigating narrow, heavily trafficked London streets—a task that challenges many humans.
As Dr Hawke puts it, “the complexity of most real-world tasks is greater than is possible to solve with handcrafted rules, and it’s well known that expert systems built with rules tend to struggle with complexity. This is true regardless of how well thought out or structured the formal logic is.” Such a system might, for instance, craft a rule that a car should stop at a red light. But lights are designed differently in different countries, and some are intended for pedestrians rather than cars. There are also situations in which you might need to jump a red light, such as to make way for a fire engine. “The beauty of machine learning”, Dr Hawke says, “is that all these factors and concepts can be automatically uncovered and learned from data. And with more data, it continues to learn and become more intelligent.”
Nicholas Rhinehart, who studies robotics and AI at the University of California, Berkeley, also backs machine learning. He says Dr Bhatt’s approach does indeed show you can combine the two approaches. But he is not sure it is necessary. In his work, and also that of others, machine-learning systems alone can already predict probabilities a few seconds into the future—such as whether another car is likely to give way or not—and make contingency plans based on those predictions.
Dr Bhatt responds that you can train a car with data accumulated over millions of kilometres of driving, and still not be sure you have covered all the necessary situations. In many cases, it might be simpler and more effective to program some of the rules in from the start.
For champions of both strategies, the question goes beyond self-driving cars to the future of AI itself. “I don’t think we're taking the right approach right now,” Dr Marcus says. “[Machine learning] has proven useful for some things like speech recognition, but it's not actually the answer to AI. We haven’t really solved the intelligence problem.” One way or another, then, it seems seven-month-olds still have a lot to teach machines. ■

1808,"BRITAIN IS UNIQUELY exposed to the malign forces troubling the world economy. It gets two-fifths of its energy from natural gas, which is in short supply. Trade flows are worth more than half of its GDP, making bunged-up supply chains particularly painful. Brexit has exacerbated its labour shortage and disrupted trade further. It even has a high rate of covid-19 infections, posing a lingering threat to consumer confidence, though more than 90% of the population has antibodies against the disease.
Could a central-bank mistake soon be added to the list of problems? The Bank of England has encouraged markets to expect interest-rate rises sooner than in other big rich countries. In mid-September investors began betting that interest rates would start rising in December. This week comments by Andrew Bailey, the bank’s governor, led traders to place about an 80% chance on a rate increase on November 4th. Our reading of Mr Bailey’s remarks—which, admittedly, were imprecisely worded—suggests that the markets are getting ahead of themselves. The governor has promised only to be vigilant. And yet the bank has not disabused bond desks of the notion that a series of rate rises is imminent.

That is worrying. Inflation has risen to over 3% and will probably reach around 5% by the spring. But many of the forces pushing it up, such as energy-price increases, should prove temporary. The normal approach is to disregard inflation when it is caused by supply disruptions rather than by an overheating economy. The bank did this in 2011 when commodity prices rose and inflation reached 5.2%, and did so again after the Brexit referendum sent sterling tumbling in 2016, making imports more expensive. On both occasions high inflation subsided.

Those who worry that, in contrast to those episodes, the labour market is running too hot or supply could be permanently impaired should take comfort from the fact that the government is already turning off some stimulus. The furlough scheme, which helped pay the wages of staff who were temporarily laid off, finished at the end of September. A temporary boost to welfare benefits worth an annual £6bn (0.3% of GDP) lapsed at around the same time. The government has announced tax rises worth an annual £12bn, to take effect from April. Tighter fiscal policy gives policymakers time to see how the economy responds. The bank’s November meeting would be a poor time to jump the gun, because data on the jobs market’s response to the end of the furlough scheme will not yet be available.
The bank is troubled by the risk of inflation expectations rising, baking in persistent price increases as workers demand higher wages and firms’ costs rise. It is a reasonable concern. Several measures of inflation expectations have drifted upward and average wage growth is curiously strong. Britain, unlike America and the euro zone, did not have persistently below-target inflation before the pandemic, meaning the public may be more accustomed to price rises.
On present trends, the Old Lady would have to raise rates before other central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, in 2022. But tightening monetary policy to preserve long-term credibility, rather than because it is warranted by underlying economic conditions, is more typical of emerging markets than the rich world. That it may be necessary is a sign of Britain’s fragility.
Whatever policy they follow, rate-setters should communicate their intentions more clearly. One has even suggested that if markets price in higher rates, tightening financial conditions, that might slow the economy sufficiently to avoid monetary policymakers having to follow through—an approach that would create a credibility problem all of its own. ■",1
1809,"EDWARD BAKA, the headmaster of a school in Kono district next to Sierra Leone’s biggest gold mine, recalls how once he had to sell the school’s books to pay for a roof. Of the 700 children aged 4-13 under his care, 80% are in work, too, he reckons. Most toil in mines or on farms. The working kids are easy to spot. They have less energy. They can’t concentrate. They have health problems. Recently a child from a neighbouring school was killed in a mud slide at a mine. “Everyone knows that mining is not for children,” says Mr Baka.
Most people would agree. But the experience of Mr Baka’s pupils is less unusual than they might hope. A recent report by Unicef, the UN’s agency for children, and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) found that between 2016 and 2020 the number of working children around the world had risen for the first time since 2000, to 160m, with all of the net increase in sub-Saharan Africa. On the continent more than a fifth of children, or some 87m, work. Worryingly the figures do not show the impact of covid-19, which has almost certainly pushed more children into work owing to school closures and growing poverty. In the Central African Republic, a survey of 102 diamond mines found that between 2019 and 2020 the number of workers under 15 increased by 50%.

At a stone quarry on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital, Osman’s frame is muscled beyond a typical 12-year-old’s. He wants to be a doctor, but now spends four hours a day breaking rocks into gravel. The work has given him scars and welts. The ILO reckons that some 39m African children are involved in similarly dangerous work, such as fishing or mining.
Sometimes the work is even more exploitative. Children from the countryside are often sent by their parents to cities to get education, only to be put to work by relatives, acquaintances or criminal gangs. From there it can be a “slippery slope” to child-trafficking and other forms of abuse, says James Riak, who works in Freetown for GOAL, an Irish NGO. From Zambia to Nigeria, millions of children as young as five toil as domestic servants. In Nairobi, where “house helps” are common, child labour is one of the most common problems cited by people calling Kenya’s national child helpline.
Yet sometimes work benefits children, argue some academics. Consider a child who works for an hour before school on his parents’ farm, says Jim Sumberg of the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex. This is typical, given that 70% of child labourers work on farms. It might tire him and he might use a hoe, which the ILO considers dangerous and thus lumps under its definition of the “worst form of child labour”, a category that includes child soldiering and prostitution. Yet were he not working, the whole family might go hungry.
Other experts worry that well-meaning interventions can make things worse for children. They point to the fervent international campaign to eradicate child labour in the cocoa industry, even though 94% of children in the industry work for their parents or relatives. Criminalising child labour has led to raids on communities and incidents of NGOs removing children from cocoa farms or remote fishing villages, as has often happened in Ghana. “Snatching the child from their family or indeed stopping the child from working isn’t a solution at all,” argues Samuel Okyere of Bristol University. “You can’t put all working children in orphanages.”
The African Movement of Working Children and Youth, a sort of child-labourers’ union which is active in 27 countries, says its members have no choice but to work. Instead of outlawing labour, it calls for better protection for child workers.
Such views have been strongly criticised by governments and international organisations. The idea that there should be two standards of rights—one for richer children and one for poorer children—is “a bit bizarre” says Benjamin Smith, a child-labour expert at the ILO. Others balk at the prospect of undermining the huge strides made in the provision of free education to children across the continent. Even if the quality is poor, it still gives children a chance to improve their lot, says Sabelo Mbokazi of the African Union.
There is little disagreement on what is driving the increase in child labour. “It's not a big mystery, poverty is the main root cause,” says Mr Smith. Studies cited by the ILO suggest that a percentage-point rise in poverty in a country leads to at least a 0.7 percentage-point increase in child labour.
In Ecuador cash transfers have been effective at keeping children in school and out of the fields. Investing in schools, teachers and resources will make schools worth attending in the eyes of students and parents. Opportunities for mothers will make a difference, too. “I didn’t choose this for my children,” says Mabinty Dukuray, who works at a quarry with her six children. She and other women say that money to start their own business, such as a market stall or a hairdressing salon, would allow their children to stop working. Some women might be better off farming vegetables, says Mohamed Jalloh, who is developing such a scheme in Kono.
For now, though, few poor children or their parents have access to such schemes. Hawa and her ten-year-old daughter are among dozens of people sifting through pools of red clay in Kono in the hope of striking gold. Hawa has four older children, but her daughter is the only one who agrees to help at the mine. Their family name is Baka. Even the headmaster’s daughter is working at the mine. ■",1
1810,"COPPER WAS the first metal worked by human beings. They hammered it into jewellery and ornaments as much as 11,000 years ago. Today, Homo sapiens uses more than 20m tonnes of the stuff a year, much of it in buildings and electrical infrastructure. More will be required in coming decades, to meet the need for widespread electrification brought about by the transition to less carbon-intensive economies. Copper is an essential part of batteries, motors and charging equipment. Solar and wind installations use more copper than their fossil-fuel counterparts, and electric vehicles contain four times more copper than do cars with combustion engines.
This has spurred interest in new sources of the metal, most of which comes at the moment from rocks dug out of vast opencast mines that are then ground up and processed to release the copper they contain, typically about 1% of their mass.

Metal-rich nodules scattered across various parts of the ocean floor are a possibility. But exploiting these brings technological and regulatory difficulties, and is in any case controversial because of the damage it would do to deep-ocean ecosystems. Jon Blundy of Oxford University, however, offers an alternative. This is to extract, from deep under Earth’s surface, the mineral-rich brines from which ores of copper and other valuable metals are generated in the first place. As Dr Blundy points out, “pretty much all of the non-ferrous natural resources that we exploit come ultimately from ancient volcanoes.”
In particular, in 2015, he and his colleagues worked out the chemical details of how copper-sulphide ores form when sulphur-rich gases rise through the plumbing of active volcanoes and encounter metal-rich brines trapped in rocks sitting just above pockets of magma. Modern mining operations dig up examples of these ores that formed millions or billions of years ago. Dr Blundy proposes instead to cut out the middleman and go straight to the deep copper-rich fluids themselves.
As he writes in Open Science, he suspects these are found beneath every active and dormant volcano, though the concentration of copper in the brine concerned will vary from place to place. His evidence comes from electromagnetic surveys carried out on some 40 volcanoes, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount St Helens in America and others in Bolivia, New Zealand, the Philippines and elsewhere. These surveys consistently pick up highly conductive zones 2km or more beneath the surface, for which the simplest explanation is the presence of super-salty metal-rich brines. This conjecture is reinforced by analysis of rock samples recovered from such depths under a number of volcanoes. These do indeed contain brines with varying concentrations of copper, as well as other valuable metals including lithium, zinc, gold and silver.
All this suggests that copper could be drilled for commercially in the same way that oil is—except that the boreholes involved would be considerably deeper. That would be difficult, but not out of the question. It would require equipment that could withstand temperatures greater than 400°C and contact with brines ten times saltier than seawater. But the prize would be worth it.
Individual volcanoes would, admittedly, yield only a fraction of the output of a big copper mine. Dr Blundy and his colleagues estimate, for example, that there might be as much as 1.4m tonnes of copper beneath New Zealand’s White Island volcano (pictured above), whereas the world’s largest mines hold tens of millions of tonnes of it. But there are only a handful of such mines, most in mountain ranges near the Pacific coast of the Americas. By contrast, hundreds of volcanoes exist around the world, ready be tapped.
The temperature at which the equipment used would have to operate, moreover, brings an opportunity. The heat involved might be employed to generate electricity—enough to power the drilling operation and perhaps even to yield a surplus. Sucking copper out of Earth’s crust through 2km-long straws might thus be that rare thing in the mining industry, an actual environmental good. ■

1811,"IN MARCH, President Joe Biden asked his spooks how the covid-19 pandemic had started. Contradicting claims made last year by Donald Trump, who said the intelligence services had shown him very strong evidence on the matter, they told him that they did not know. So on May 26th he asked them again, publicly this time, admonishing them to try harder and to report back in 90 days.
This is a direct rebuke to China’s secretive government. When experts convened by the World Health Organisation (WHO) travelled to Wuhan, the city where covid-19 was first identified, in January and February this year their hosts refused to share crucial data. A senior Biden administration official said recently that he found those efforts to “undermine serious investigations” into the pandemic’s beginnings particularly troubling, and that they left “many more questions than answers”.

At the crux of this distrust is the possibility that SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes covid-19, may have emerged accidentally from research on animal coronaviruses conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or another nearby lab. In early 2020 this idea, sometimes conflated with the idea that the virus had been developed as a biological weapon, was publicly dismissed by eminent scientists. In February 2020 a number of them used the pages of the Lancet, a medical journal, “to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that covid-19 does not have a natural origin”. Most in the media followed their line. By far the most plausible account of covid-19’s origins, they reported, was “zoonotic spillover”—that is, a virus jumping unaided from animals to humans, as is taken to have been the case for SARS, a disease caused by a different coronavirus, in 2002. Lab-leak theories were widely dismissed as conspiracy-mongering.

In the past few months, though, discussion of lab-leakery has gained currency among politicians and policy elites and in the mainstream media, as well as in influential blog posts by science reporters. This is in part because of the departures of Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state, who promoted the theory with gusto. To be able to consider the possibility without giving them succour will have made it easier for some.
But the resurgence is not a purely political phenomenon. On May 13th Science, a journal, published a letter from a group of senior scientists who had not previously weighed in on the matter arguing that “theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable”. In this they were taking the same position as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s boss, who refused to rule out the possibility of a laboratory origin after the WHO mission in January and February was stonewalled, and has since called for further inquiry.
This is not going down well in China. On May 21st, at a Global Health Summit convened by the EU and G20, Xi Jinping, China’s president, urged world leaders to “firmly reject any attempt to politicise” the covid-19 pandemic. On May 25th China’s representative at the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, said the country considered the inquiry into the origins complete and that the focus should shift to other countries, strongly suggesting that it would not accommodate further investigation.
High on the assembly’s agenda were responses to the current pandemic and the prevention of future ones. Felicity Harvey, chair of an oversight committee for the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said that new virus threats must in future be handled with more transparency, better data-sharing and an ability to give informal early warnings to the world. Earlier in May a WHO panel of experts recommended that countries be placed under a greater obligation to report new outbreaks and that the WHO’s authority to seek out and share relevant information with the world be strengthened.
It would be surprising if China (and, indeed, some other countries) were to accept all these ideas. Its leadership has consistently fought to deny international bodies the right to stick their noses into the affairs of sovereign countries, and it does not always welcome the WHO’s attentions. In 2018 it declined requests from American officials, made under WHO guidelines, for lab samples of the H7N9 strain of avian flu.

China has instead recently indicated it will reform its own public-health system. On May 13th the authorities announced a reorganisation of the national public-health bureaucracy under a new entity, the National Administration of Disease Prevention and Control. A priority in the shake-up is to improve top-down control, so that lower-level officials have more incentive to report new public-health threats up the chain of command.
Chinese authorities tried to deal with a similar issue after the SARS outbreak of the 2000s, in part to tackle the problem that national health officials were outranked by provincial authorities who had covered up the early spread of that coronavirus in southern China. They made the monitoring of new threats more systematic, raised their game with the WHO and even co-operated with America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the model for China’s own CDC—the Wuhan office of which is now being mentioned in the context of a possible laboratory origin.

There is as yet no evidence in the public domain that a laboratory leak actually took place; just evidence that the possibility is real. Mr Biden’s request suggests anything the secret world can currently add to that is pretty weak stuff. His statement says that, at present, two “elements” within the intelligence community lean towards the zoonotic explanation, one prefers the laboratory origin, and no one has high confidence in any of these assessments. Without help from China, a harder look will not necessarily change this. But it is still worth taking, even given the risk of a confrontational response which will make the enhanced transparency and co-operation talked about at the World Health Assembly unlikely to blossom any time soon. ■

1812,"Seven migrants have been killed and eight others injured after the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in lost control and crashed near a motorway toll station in northern Greece, authorities said.
Police said the vehicle carrying 15 people had been travelling on a motorway from the area of Greece's north-eastern border with Turkey towards the north's main city of Thessaloniki when it crashed just after midnight.
The vehicle had been travelling at high speed and the driver lost control as he tried to exit the motorway, hitting a toll booth and crashing into a nearby storage container, police said.
The injured were four men from Pakistan, one from Afghanistan and two from Nepal, as well as the 35-year-old Moldovan driver, who police suspect was acting as a smuggler.
They have been transported to hospitals in the north-eastern Greek towns of Xanthi and Komotini.
The seven people killed in the crash included one woman.
Their nationalities were not immediately known, authorities said.
Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
The most frequently used routes for clandestine entries into Greece are the short but dangerous sea crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands, or crossing the heavily guarded land border between Greece and Turkey.",3
1813,"WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Tom Cotton is holding up a vote to confirm Alan Estevez as the U.S. Commerce Department's undersecretary for industry and security until he gets answers to difficult questions about technology exports to China.
In a letter dated Oct. 14 and seen by Reuters, Cotton asks Estevez to commit to strengthening U.S. restrictions on exporting semiconductor software and technology to China and to accelerating the roll-out of new rules to tighten export controls for advanced technologies.
The letter, also signed by Republican senator Bill Hagerty, asks Estevez to consider extending a Trump administration rule - that currently only applies to Huawei (HWT.UL) - to blacklisted Chinese firms with links to the military or human rights violations. That rule further restricted access for the Chinese telecoms giant to advanced semiconductor chips.
The job at the Commerce Department oversees exports to all countries but decisions over cutting-edge technology exports to China have given the position tremendous power over Chinese companies dependent on U.S. technology in recent years.
The Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Many industry watchers saw the choice of Estevez, a former Defense Department official with a limited track record on China, as a safe bet.
But Cotton - or any other senator - can hold up a fast-track confirmation process that requires consent by all 100 senators.
Since the Republican has not had the chance to question the nominee, he is pausing the confirmation process until he receives answers to the questions posed in the letter, a Cotton staffer said.
Republicans are not the only ones holding up Estevez's nomination. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez came out against Estevez when the Senate Banking Committee took up his confirmation and also opposes expediting a final full Senate vote.
His opposition stems from the former Pentagon official's response to questions regarding returning oversight of U.S. firearms exports to the State Department.
""I was not satisfied with Mr. Estevez's non-answers as to whether the Biden administration was planning to fulfill President Biden's campaign promise and finally reverse the Trump administration's dangerous stripping of oversight authority of U.S. firearm sales from the State Department's Munitions List to the Commerce Department,"" Menendez said in a statement.
The Trump administration transferred jurisdiction on exports of semiautomatic pistols, assault rifles and related firearms from State to the less-restrictive Commerce Control List, which also eliminated congressional review for such sales.
Estevez will be in good company. Other Biden nominees are being held up by Senator Ted Cruz, who is using the process to halt a Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, White House officials and Democrats in Congress say.
Estevez testified last month before the Senate banking committee, which later voted in favor of advancing his bid to the full Senate.
During the hearing and under questioning from Hagerty, Estevez said he expected to keep Huawei on a blacklist unless ""things change"" and pledged to ""look at"" Honor, a former unit of Huawei, to see whether the Chinese telecoms giant was using the spun-off company to minimize or circumvent its own blacklist designation. Republican senators have called on the Biden administration to blacklist Honor.
In the letter on Thursday, the senators also asked for Estevez to say whether he thought the global spread of Huawei Cloud Services posed a data security and privacy concern for the United States, and whether Honor should be placed on the Commerce Department's trade blacklist.",0
1814,"A PILE OF fake corpses littered the heart of Bangkok. The bodies—white sacks stuffed with hay and spattered with red paint—symbolised Thai victims of covid-19. “They’re dead because of the failure of this government,” a protester bellowed into a megaphone. To underscore the point, protesters had laid the “corpses” across a giant portrait of the prime minister, which they then set ablaze.
In many countries around the world, from Brazil to Belarus, the pandemic is stirring unrest. People are angry about the economic hardships they face. They have seen how the rich and well-connected go to the front of the queue for vaccinations, medical treatment and government help. They are angry that their leaders have not done a better job of containing the coronavirus. At the same time, people’s suffering has created a sense of solidarity which is fanning grievances that smouldered long before anyone had heard of covid-19.

Thailand’s protests flared up on July 18th as the Delta variant was running amok, leading to the country’s worst wave of covid-19 so far. Hospitals are swamped. Just 5% of the Thai population is fully vaccinated. Thais had hoped for a swift economic rebound, after GDP shrank by 6.1% in 2020, but that now seems unlikely. The Bank of Thailand recently reduced its growth forecast for 2021 from 3% to 1.8%.
Many Thais berate their government for failing to secure enough vaccines soon enough, or for reopening the country too quickly to foreign tourists, which they fear may have contributed to the current wave. Some grumble that the government has relied too much on Chinese-made vaccines rather than Pfizer’s or Moderna’s which they believe offer more protection.
Globally, you might expect covid-19 to make unrest less common. Before the pandemic, big protest movements had been increasing around the world, growing 2.5 times between 2011 and 2019, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), a think-tank in Sydney. However, dense crowds of angry people, all shouting slogans and spraying each other with spittle, could easily transmit the virus. Sure enough, in the early weeks of the pandemic the number of protests around the world dwindled in such places as India, Pakistan, Chile, Iraq and Nicaragua.
It didn’t last. Discontent has once again bubbled up in countries including Colombia, South Africa and Myanmar, even as the virus has continued to do its worst. In Tunisia this week, amid violent mass demonstrations which were sparked by the government’s mishandling of the pandemic, the president sacked the prime minister and suspended parliament.
The IEP found that in 2020, civil unrest rose by 10%. It counted 5,000 instances of pandemic-related violence in 158 countries. Violent demonstrations are more common than at any time since 2008. A broader measure that includes peaceful protests also rose, according to the Armed Conflict Location  Event Data Project, an NGO. In the year to March 1st 2021, ACLED logged 51,549 demonstrations or riots. Counting only countries surveyed in both years, it detected a significant increase.
In this, the pandemic looks as if it is following the pattern set by earlier outbreaks of infectious disease. In a paper published last year, Tahsin Saadi Sedik and Rui Xu of the IMF analysed data from 133 countries between 2001 and 2018 and found that social unrest starts to increase 12-14 months after the onset of an epidemic, such as Zika, a mosquito-borne virus, and peaks after two years. The covid-19 pandemic has been incomparably more severe and longer-lasting than those epidemics in almost every country. The disruption it causes could well be, too.
One direct cause of protests, the IMF data suggested, is economic hardship. A good example is Cuba, where a vast network of secret police and informers usually spot and crush dissidents before they cause trouble. Yet on July 11th thousands marched in more than 50 towns and cities, risking the dictatorship’s wrath to chant “freedom!” and overturn a few police cars. It was perhaps the biggest display of anti-government fury in Cuba in six decades.
Cubans are angry because the shops are empty, they have nothing for dinner, the electricity keeps failing and they are not allowed to vote out the people in charge. Covid-19 has aggravated these perennial grievances by devastating the Cuban economy. Tourists, the main source of hard currency, have stopped coming. GDP shrank by 10.9% in 2020 and slid further this year.
Nothing to lose but their groceries
The closure of Cuba’s borders to keep out the virus has cut connections with the capitalist world that made life more bearable. Everyday things like soap and coffee are usually brought in by relatives who made it abroad or by mules who travel to places like Panama, Mexico, Russia or Miami to buy supplies and resell them on the black market. The severing of this supply chain has stoked inflation, lengthened queues and reminded Cubans of how poorly the government caters for their basic needs.
The collapse of tourism has had knock-on effects on the health system. Without the dollars holidaymakers used to splurge on hotel rooms and rum cocktails, the government is struggling to buy the ingredients it needs to make drugs. Painkillers, antibiotics, insulin, asthma medicine and diagnostic tests have become scarce, so people with easily treatable illnesses are forced to suffer. Good medical care is supposed to be one of the pillars of the revolution. “Many people in Cuba were once content to accept that, while they might never be able to take an extravagant holiday, they at least had the guarantee of good health care,” says a Cuban doctor.
Pandemic-aggravated unrest strikes rich and poor countries alike, but middle-income countries are most vulnerable both to the disease and its social effects. Rich countries are protected by vaccination—even if some of their citizens hesitate to be jabbed. In the poorest places, the coronavirus is one burden among many, states are often too weak to enforce lockdowns, and the population’s youth offers a high degree of protection from covid-19.

In middle-income countries, by contrast, vaccination is patchy and lockdowns are common (see charts). Many of their people are old enough and fat enough to be especially vulnerable to the virus. What’s more, people in middle-income countries have expectations of their governments.

Too often, as in South Africa, those expectations have been dashed. The protests there earlier this month were stirred up at first by supporters of a justly jailed ex-president, Jacob Zuma, in an attempt to secure his release. But one of the reasons they snowballed into mass looting and the burning of shops and businesses was that so many South Africans are poor, jobless and furious about the corruption and rotten government that keeps them that way.
Covid-19 has put all of that on display. Lockdowns have been exceptionally tough, and many South Africans find the rules irksome. A spray-painted slogan on a looted shop in Edendale, in KwaZulu-Natal, the worst-hit of South Africa’s nine provinces in the riots, read “Level 4 to hell”—a reference to the country’s second-highest level of pandemic alert, during which the government imposes “extreme precautions”.
A short-lived ban on buying open-toed sandals was baffling. Periodic bans on the sale of alcohol struck many as unfair. Rich people with wine cellars have carried on tippling behind their high walls, but the poor have been deprived of one of life’s pleasures, and harassed by police when they indulge. During the riots, liquor stores were among the first to be looted.
When covid-19 hit, “everything came to a stop; my business couldn't function,” says Patrick Dlamini, who fixes cars, which fewer people are driving because of covid-related curfews, and recycles bottles, which fewer people are draining because of the booze ban. “There’s no money,” he frets. The looting, he reckons, was caused by “a combination of Zuma and covid”.
The tensions in South Africa have been aggravated by inequality. Pandemics expose the gulf between the haves and have-nots. What is more, the IMF’s analysis shows that when pandemics impose economic hardship, the burden falls most heavily on the poor. At a time when everyone should be in it together, it rankles when ordinary people see how the privileged both escape hardship and enjoy special treatment into the bargain. It brings the angry into the streets.
Colombia shows how the sense of injustice can overwhelm the government’s efforts to help. One of the world’s most unequal places, it has also spent longer under lockdown than most countries. GDP dropped by 6.8% in 2020 and 2.8m people fell into destitution. A decade of progress in eradicating poverty was wiped out. The pain was shared unequally. Youth unemployment from May to July last year was 30%, compared with overall unemployment of 20%, and 12 percentage points higher than it had been a year earlier. In a place where half of the economy is off the books, informal workers had nothing to fall back on.
Sorry isn’t good enough
The government tried to make amends. It introduced a fund called Ingreso Solidario to help the poor survive during lockdowns, but many families still did not have enough money to get by. In April this year it introduced a tax reform that set out to redistribute money to the poorest half of Colombians, partly by eliminating VAT exemptions that help the rich and widening the net of income tax.
But Colombians, struggling to cope with the pandemic, assumed that the reform would load them up with more taxes. Coming at the start of April, just as the disease was mounting and most cities were reimposing lockdowns, the tax bill brought people onto the streets—especially the jobless young. Over several days in May, protesters manned barricades, attacked police stations and looted businesses in Cali, the country’s third-largest city.
Once protests have started to take hold, more tend to follow. Again, hardship is a factor. A paper published in May by Metodij Hadzi-Vaskov, Samuel Pienknagura and Luca Antonio Ricci, of the IMF, analysed an index of social upheaval in 130 countries. It concluded that unrest is followed by a fall in economic output of 0.2 percentage points after 18 months—and that the effect in emerging markets is twice that in advanced economies.
What’s more, the very act of protesting can generate a sense of solidarity. In Belarus, for example, the coronavirus inspired people to stand up to the regime. They got a taste for rebellion. The spark came in the spring of 2020 when Alexander Lukashenko, the country’s despotic leader, dismissed covid-19 as a “mass psychosis” and blamed his citizens for dying of it. The EU’s members advised citizens to stay at home and offered financial help. Mr Lukashenko told his to have a shot of liquor, indulge in a banya (steam bath) and ride a tractor.
Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, likes to portray himself as the father of the nation. He has boasted about the country’s broad system of social support, which harks back to the Soviet Union. When he stumbled over covid-19 Belarusian activists sensed a rare opening.
A team of IT specialists launched #ByCovid19, a social-media movement that stepped into the void left by the state. In a few weeks it attracted hundreds of thousands of volunteers across the country and supplied personal-protection gear for doctors and machinery for hospitals. Andrei Strizhak, one of its founders, says that it proved to Belarusians that they could act together. After Mr Lukashenko rigged an election in August, they did just that by taking to the streets in huge numbers.
Something similar may be starting in Brazil. Early in the pandemic, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro dominated the streets. Unmasked and dressed in green and yellow, thousands of bolsonaristas gathered roughly every two weeks to back the president’s denouncement of governors’ lockdowns. In August 2020, 37% of Brazilians approved of Mr Bolsonaro, according to Datafolha, a pollster, partly because the government was paying 600 reais ($110) per month in emergency aid to a third of the population.

Today the emergency aid has been slashed and big crowds are calling for his impeachment. In May a senate inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic revealed that Mr Bolsonaro had rebuffed offers to buy vaccines last year, and later ignored possible corruption. One in seven Brazilians is out of work and one in ten is going hungry. In recent polls less than 30% of Brazilians backed the president and a record 51% disapproved of his government.
Three times in just over a month starting in late May, all the states of the country were protesting at once, uniting thousands of people in many cities. Former allies of Mr Bolsonaro have joined the marches, spurred on by the death toll from covid-19, currently at more than 550,000. “The glass is almost full,” says Creomar de Souza of Dharma, a Brasília-based consultancy. “We will see what is the last drop that might make it overflow.”
Plenty of countries have avoided covid-related protests. India has been relatively quiet, in spite of its government’s mistakes. So has Malaysia, which coped well with covid-19 in 2020. But in these places, too, discontent is stirring. Critics of the Modi government in India have become louder, and now include fellow-travellers from his own Hindu-nationalist power-base. One example is the formation of a group of retired senior civil servants—some of them once very high-powered—that has taken to berating the government.
In recent weeks Malaysia has suffered a wave of infections, taking the total to over 1m. Poor ethnic Malays, unprotected by the country’s patchy social safety-net, have watched ministers and the business elites flout health rules that carry swingeing penalties for ordinary offenders. The factories of well-connected owners have been allowed to continue to operate—despite being superspreading venues for employees. Around 18% of the population have secured a jab, but among the well-connected the share is much higher.
Households have taken to hanging white flags from their windows as a call for help. Increasingly, black flags flutter beside them, hoisted mainly by younger, educated Malaysians signalling frustration at the government’s mistakes. The black-flag, or Bendera Hitam, movement has unnerved the authorities, who are probing it for evidence of sedition. Bridget Welsh of the University of Nottingham, Malaysia thinks this wider mobilisation highlights how a country proud to consider itself uniformly middle-class is in reality a country of haves and have-nots.
It ain’t over ’til it’s over
The pandemic is far from over. Covax, the global vaccine-sharing initiative, aims to provide developing countries with enough jabs to inoculate a fifth of their populations by the end of 2021, but that target is very unlikely to be met. So far, almost 4bn doses of vaccines have been put into arms. To get to 70% coverage, the world needs to give another 7bn—more, if booster shots are required. That is unlikely before 2022.
In the meantime, governments will attempt to control the disease with rules and regulations—including measures to restrict dissent. According to Freedom House, a watchdog, at least 158 out of 192 countries have placed new curbs on public protests. Some governments have done so impartially and temporarily, to protect public health. Others have seized on covid-19 as a pretext, locking up their opposition for supposedly violating social-distancing rules while letting the governing party hold huge rallies.
In the long run political repression is often a recipe for trouble. The pandemic suggests that people’s anger does not dissipate while they are cooped up indoors. It simmers like water in a saucepan, even as governments do their best to hold down the lid. In Thailand gatherings of more than five are banned, officially to reduce the spread of the virus. The protesters on July 18th were met with tear-gas and rubber bullets. But that only makes them angrier. “We just want to get vaccinated,” says one. “Covid-19 is breathing down our neck but the government is doing nothing at all.”

1815,"EVER SINCE Winston Churchill, British prime ministers have boasted of their special relationship with American presidents. Yet this supposedly sunny partnership has experienced its fair share of clouds. The past few weeks have seen a big one, after Joe Biden unilaterally announced that all American troops would leave Afghanistan by August 31st, opening the way to a lightning conquest of most of the country by the Taliban. The chaos that followed at Kabul airport as thousands of frightened Afghans tried desperately to escape has shocked the world—and led even the British to ask if the transatlantic relationship is still working.
This is certainly another unsettled moment. But it is worth remembering that the relationship has survived storms before, from the Suez crisis in 1956, through Harold Wilson’s refusal to enter the Vietnam war, to Richard Nixon’s decision to abandon the gold standard in 1971. Even when relations were warm, there were rows. Margaret Thatcher was infuriated by Ronald Reagan’s unilateral invasion in 1983 of Grenada, a member of the British Commonwealth. Tony Blair was angered by George Bush’s refusal to sign up to climate-change targets. More recently the relationship between Donald Trump and Theresa May was icy, especially when he criticised her Brexit plans. America’s habit of failing to consult even close allies before big decisions dates back decades, not weeks.

Although some Tories privately wanted a Trump re-election last year, Mrs May’s successor, Boris Johnson, must have hoped for better things with Mr Biden. He received the new president’s first phone call to a foreign leader, and in June welcomed him on his first overseas trip. Yet there were signs that the two are not soulmates. When a BBC man asked Mr Biden for comment on the campaign trail, his instant response was “I’m Irish!” He plainly disapproves of Brexit. He has little interest in a trade deal with the British (or anyone else). And his priorities as president are overwhelmingly domestic, not international.
All this helps explain some of the vitriol hurled at Mr Biden over the past couple of weeks for his hasty and shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Unnamed government sources were quoted calling him gaga, or worse, and comparing him unfavourably with Mr Trump. On August 24th, when Mr Johnson as G7 president called an emergency meeting of the group’s leaders, Mr Biden flatly rejected his allies’ request for an extension of the August 31st deadline to pull out all troops. The race is now on to evacuate as many people as possible, even while accepting that thousands with strong claims to protection from America and its allies will be left to face the Taliban’s vengeance.
Behind the headlines, diplomats on both sides insist that relations are still close. Mr Biden is said to have spoken to Mr Johnson more than to any other world leader. Sir Simon Fraser, a former head of the Foreign Office now at Flint Global, says structural co-operation in intelligence, security and military matters remains as deep as ever. Britain spends more on defence than any of America’s other European allies and has dispatched its new aircraft-carrier, Queen Elizabeth, to the South China Sea, where America now spies its most important strategic interests. And Mr Biden should be far more helpful than his predecessor at the climate-change summit in Glasgow in November.
Yet changes in America over the past 20 years have inevitably downgraded the transatlantic link. It is over a decade since Barack Obama ostentatiously “pivoted” from Europe to Asia. Mr Biden may have proclaimed that “America is back” after the Trump years, but he shares his predecessor’s preoccupation with Asia and the rise of China. America’s appetite for military engagement abroad has been reduced by experience not just in Afghanistan, but in Iraq. Its interest in places of most concern to its European allies, such as the Balkans or north Africa, has hugely diminished.
The real concern for Britain is that more clouds may lie ahead. The biggest may be Northern Ireland, which provoked tension in June. The Biden administration supports the Northern Ireland protocol struck between Britain and the European Union, which avoids a hard border in Ireland that might threaten the peace process by, in effect, keeping the province in the single market. Averse to the border controls between Great Britain and Northern Ireland that this necessitates, Mr Johnson’s government is demanding a wholesale rewrite and threatening to suspend the protocol if the EU refuses. Ian Bond of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, notes that support for the peace process is unusually bipartisan in America. If Mr Johnson is seen as threatening it, the reaction in Washington will be fierce.
The American administration has accepted the reality of Brexit, but still wants Britain to repair its battered relationship with its nearest neighbours. As Sophia Gaston of the British Foreign Policy Group, another think-tank, puts it, geography matters in foreign and security policy just as much as in trade. And that strengthens the case for the Johnson government to do more to engage with the EU.
The EU has offered just such a close relationship in foreign and security policy, only to be spurned. A recent British government review of foreign and security policy talked up relations with France and Germany, but largely left out the EU. Yet it is not really possible to forge closer bilateral relations only with individual EU members, because they are building a common policy in Brussels. A more adept British government would seek closer links with both America and the EU; as Karin von Hippel, director of the RUSI think-tank, suggests, it is always possible to dance with several different partners.
Peter Ricketts, another former head of the Foreign Office, notes in his recent book, “Hard Choices”, that Britain has fallen a long way from the early 1940s, when one of his predecessors drafted the Atlantic Charter that became the basis for the American-sponsored post-war international order. He is now a keen advocate of closer co-operation with the EU, not least because the Afghanistan debacle underscores the case for it. Sadly, the government’s ideological opposition probably means it will not happen. ■",1
1816,"ONE SIDE-EFFECT of hosting an international climate conference is an outbreak of navel-gazing. As the UN extravaganza in Glasgow nears its end, many opinion polls and studies have appeared, which provide a superbly detailed view of how Britons think about climate change. They reveal a country committed to tackling global warming, but unfortunately drawn to the priciest ways of doing it.
Perhaps sensing that they ought to set a good example for their international guests, Britons have swung firmly behind the view that anthropogenic climate change is both real and alarming. One pollster, Ipsos MORI, finds that 81% believe that an environmental disaster looms unless habits change quickly. Old people’s opinions have changed most dramatically. A series of polls for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy reveal that 80% of over-64s are now concerned about climate change, up from 56% in 2012.

Britons have a lot on their minds these days, what with Brexit, covid-19 and inflation. That does not seem to matter. Whereas the financial crisis of 2007-08 was followed by a years-long recession in concern about climate change, the coronavirus pandemic suppressed interest only briefly (see chart). Lorraine Whitmarsh of the University of Bath suggested a decade ago that people have a “finite pool of worry” and that economic concerns had displaced environmental ones. She now thinks that climate change has become a core concern that cannot be pushed out of the pool.

What to do about it, though? Unsurprisingly, Britons are keen on climate mitigation policies in the abstract and less keen when they are presented with the probable costs of such policies. But if they must pay, they would rather do so, by a slight margin, through general taxation. Onward, a think-tank, reported on November 8th that 50% of people were prepared to pay higher taxes in order to reduce carbon emissions, whereas 46% would pay higher prices for goods. Low-earners were especially opposed to higher prices.
Politicians amplify this view. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, has for a decade campaigned successfully against any rise in fuel duty. That probably contributed to the fact that greenhouse-gas emissions from transport fell by just 2% between 2010 and 2019, even as emissions from all sources dropped by 26%. Mr Halfon is not a climate-change denier (“I believe in all of it,” he says). And he supports subsidies for electric vehicles. He merely opposes attempts to reduce demand by raising prices.
Britons are keener still on banning things. Another poll, in August, found that people would prefer policies that restrict the number of flights they can take and the quantity of meat they can eat to policies that increase the price of flying and the price of meat. Sir John Curtice, a psephologist at the University of Strathclyde, and others found that 44% support a ban on powerful vacuum cleaners. The proportion rose to 64% following an online discussion of the issue.
Economists usually favour market-based interventions such as carbon taxes, and disdain measures such as electric-car subsidies because of their inefficiency (some of the money goes to people who would have bought electric cars anyway). But ordinary Britons plainly disagree. Will Tanner of Onward suggests that is because they believe the cost of tackling global warming should be borne by society as a whole, and general taxation strikes them as a good way of achieving that. Blanket bans probably strike a nation inordinately fond of queuing as equitable, too.
This enthusiasm for inefficient ways of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions implies that Britain will end up spending far more than it needs to. That is frustrating. But the polls also suggest that Britons are in one sense ahead of their leaders. Adaptation to climate change has for years been the poor relation of mitigation. It is discussed less and often thought of as something that poorer countries need to do. Speaking at a session on adaptation in Glasgow on November 8th, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Britain’s trade secretary, touted a fund to assist Asian countries but said nothing about her own.
People seem to have noticed this, and are not happy. In late 2020 Ipsos MORI polled 30 rich and middle-income countries for the energy firm EDF. It found that just 30% of Britons believe that their government has taken measures to reduce the effects of climate change at home, such as building dams—the second-lowest proportion of any country after Italy. Politicians might call that judgment unfair. It would be better if they tried to change people’s minds through their actions.■

1817,"SIR DAVID AMESS was the quintessential local MP. When party whips whispered that he might become a minister if he voted the right way, he laughed. When his invitation to the Leigh Duck Race, where the local scout group ceremonially released hundreds of rubber ducks, went missing, his staff turned his office upside down. His relentless campaign to have Southend-on-Sea, the town in his constituency, recognised as a city is the stuff of parliamentary legend.
It was while attending a constituency surgery, where MPs meet locals to hear their problems, that he was stabbed to death on October 15th, in an apparent Islamist terrorist attack. The murder was the latest in a grim series. Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, was killed on her way to a surgery by a far-right extremist in 2016. Stephen Timms, MP for East Ham, was stabbed at one in 2010. Nigel Jones, MP for Cheltenham, was attacked at one in 2000. His assistant, Andrew Pennington, died protecting him.
Speeches in the House of Commons attract more attention, but all MPs have a second job akin to that of a social worker: supporting asylum claims, dealing with benefit enquiries, looking into anti-social behaviour and so on. When the system works, the latter informs the former. Appalled by the death of an elderly constituent who died in a cold house, Sir David introduced legislation to tackle fuel poverty. Campaigns he ran to ban the cruel tethering of animals and to raise awareness of endometriosis also sprung from local concerns.
The constituency surgery is at the heart of this job. It is up to MPs to decide how to arrange them: some insist that people book in advance; others, like Sir David, prefer to be more relaxed, allowing anyone to drop by. Yet this sort of openness is becoming difficult to maintain. The majority of MPs report facing “aggressive or intrusive” behaviour as part of their job. After Ms Cox’s murder, parliamentarians were advised by police to screen appointments more carefully and to avoid meeting constituents on their own. Spending on security, such as CCTV and alarm buttons, has risen.
Priti Patel, the home secretary, has now asked police to review MPs’ security arrangements, to see whether more can be done to protect them. The National Police Chiefs Council will contact every MP to discuss security precautions. Many are resistant to anything that would put distance between them and their constituents. Jess Phillips, a Labour MP, said she would disregard measures that did: “You can’t put me behind a screen when I’m walking my kids to a café. I’m not the pope.”
But the direction of travel is clear. Tobias Ellwood, a Tory MP, has urged fellow parliamentarians to put face-to-face meetings on hold; Diane Abbott, a Labour one, has said she would prefer a screen. Necessary or not, it is a trend Sir David would have lamented. “We are advised to never see people alone, we must be extra careful when opening post and we must ensure our offices are properly safe and secure,” he wrote in a guide to life as a politician published last year. “In short, these increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of people openly meeting their elected politicians.” After his murder in a Methodist church, meeting his constituents and hearing their problems, that tradition is under even greater threat.",1
1818,"Democrats in the American Senate tried to pin down proposed tax rises that will pay for a $1.5trn spending bill on welfare and the climate, legislation that is much reduced in scope from what its backers originally envisaged. But their plans were thrown into confusion when moderates pushed back against both radical ideas on taxing the super-wealthy and a levy on the profits of America’s biggest companies based on their financial accounting for shareholders, and not what they declare to the taxman.
A blizzard of policies was announced in the British government’s budget (or leaked to the press several days before). The national living wage is to rise to £9.50 ($13) an hour, a 6.6% increase. And with fuel prices surging, a planned tax increase on petrol was scrapped. That didn’t go down well with greens, just days ahead of the British-hosted COP26 summit.

Masters of the metaverse
Facebook formalised its expansion into the “metaverse”, a collection of online worlds where users’ avatars buy clothes, attend concerts and socialise. The company announced more investment in its Reality Labs division, which from now on will report separately from the rest of the business. Part of the reason for Facebook’s refocus is growing competition from TikTok and other apps for attention from younger customers, many of whom think the platform, which will turn 18 next year, is boring. It also faces claims that it cannot control hate speech.
The other highlight in Facebook’s quarterly earnings was the impact on its growth prospects of Apple’s new privacy policy, which allows iPhone users to say whether they want to be tracked for advertising purposes. Mark Zuckerberg said the policy was having a negative effect on Facebook. Snap, a photo and messaging platform, also blamed the change for weaker-than-expected revenues; its share price shed more than a quarter of its value.
Meanwhile Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said that the change in Apple’s policy was having only a modest impact on its advertising business, most of which comes via its search engine. Sales from ads across its divisions, which include YouTube, surged in the third quarter by 43%, year on year, to $53bn.

Tesla became the first carmaker to pass a stockmarket value of $1trn, after Hertz placed an order for 100,000 of its vehicles as part of its drive to electrify its rental fleet. Tesla joins Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft in the club of American companies valued at over $1trn. Elon Musk’s net fortune alone is now worth more than ExxonMobil’s market value.
The bullish quarterly earnings season in corporate America pushed the S 500 to a new record. The index is up by a fifth since the start of the year.
Oil prices climbed, after Goldman Sachs estimated that global demand will soon reach pre-pandemic levels, just as the world faces an energy crunch in natural gas. Brent crude rose above $86 a barrel, up by a fifth since the start of September. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, pledged to cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060. The promise was met with some scepticism; the target excluded the kingdom’s fossil-fuel exports.
The Spanish government softened its proposed windfall tax on the profits of utility companies by allowing for exemptions. It announced the policy in September amid soaring electricity bills for consumers, prompting a backlash from utilities, which said investment would suffer.
Beyond Meat’s share price struggled to recover from the hammering it took after the company warned that sales would be lower than expected because several factors have reduced demand. The maker of plant-based products had a hugely successful IPO in 2019, but has faced stiff competition in the market for fake meat since then.
Eurostar could face competition running passenger trains through the Channel Tunnel that links Britain and France. Renfe, Spain’s state-owned railway company, reportedly thinks it can offer a viable alternative service and has gained the support of the tunnel’s operator.
DraftKings, an American fantasy-sports and betting operator, abruptly abandoned its $22bn takeover approach for Entain, a British gambling firm and owner of the Ladbrokes brand. American gambling companies are looking to expand their global reach, but both sides reportedly couldn’t agree on the terms of a deal.
Retail regeneration
Augmenting its expansion from suburban warehouses to city-centre locations, IKEA is buying the building in London’s Oxford Street that used to house Topshop before it went bankrupt. That’s good news for the city’s busiest shopping thoroughfare, which lost some big high-street names during the pandemic.",1
1819,"Son Masayoshi, the boss of SoftBank, said he was curbing his conglomerate’s enthusiasm to invest in Chinese startups until the extent of the Chinese government’s crackdown on the tech industry becomes clearer in the coming years. The Japanese company is a big investor in Alibaba and Didi Global, two targets of the ire of regulators in Beijing.
Uncertainty about the future of internet firms in China was one factor behind the poorly received IPO of Krafton, a South Korean video-games developer that produces the “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds” series. Krafton is backed by Tencent, which distributes its games in China. However, Krafton also had to reduce the listing price for its shares when the Korean regulator questioned how it was calculated.

The American government’s ban on Chinese tech firms with suspected military ties obtaining American technology hit Huawei hard in the first half of the year. Revenue fell by almost 30% compared with the first six months of 2020, and by almost 50% in its consumer-electronics business, which relies on American chips for smartphones.
Bukalapak raised $1.5bn when it listed its shares on the Jakarta stockmarket, making it Indonesia’s biggest-ever IPO. The e-commerce group has the backing of big foreign investors, including Microsoft and Jack Ma’s Ant Group, and is the first unicorn startup to go public in the country.
America’s Securities and Exchange Commission approved a controversial requirement by the Nasdaq for companies that list on its markets to disclose statistics on the diversity of their boards and to have at least two “diverse directors”, or explain why they do not. One director must be a woman and the other from a racial or sexual minority; all must “identify” with their diverse group. Firms have a few years to comply.
American employers created 943,000 jobs in July, the most since last August. Employment is yet to reach its pre-pandemic level, however, and is not expected to do so for at least another six months. America’s annual rate of inflation, meanwhile, remained at 5.4% in July.
Britain’s GDP expanded by 4.8% in the second quarter over the previous three months, boosted by the end of pandemic restrictions on restaurants and pubs (just in time for the Euros football tournament). The economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, before covid-19 struck; it is on course to return to its pre-pandemic level by the end of this year.
All that carbon
Saudi Aramco reported a net profit of $25.5bn for the second quarter. That was an increase of almost 300% on the same three months last year and more than the combined quarterly profits of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total. Like its rivals, the Saudi company has gained from a buoyant oil market as economies reopen. Troubled by the hot topic of high petrol prices, the White House has publicly called on OPEC to boost output in order to curb oil prices.
The bidding war intensified for Kansas City Southern, a railway company that transports freight in America and Mexico. Canadian Pacific raised its offer to $31bn in an attempt to derail a proposal from Canadian National that the board at KCS has accepted.

Deliveroo reported earnings for the first half. The food-delivery company, which floated on the London stockmarket in March in a dismal IPO, took almost 149m orders in the January-to-June period, twice as many as during the same six months last year. It has expanded even more into grocery deliveries and restaurant fare. The lifting of lockdown measures in Britain, its prime market, has not had a material impact on its business; ordering meals from home has now become routine for customers who acquired the taste during the pandemic.
Jab or job?
The chief executives of American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said they would not impose a requirement on existing staff to have the covid-19 vaccine, but they will encourage them to do so. This came after United Airlines instructed all its workers based in America to get vaccinated by October 25th at the latest.
Virgin Atlantic is reportedly planning to list shares on the London stockmarket for the first time since its founding in 1984. The airline is owned by Virgin Group and Delta. During the pandemic it has cut costs by slashing jobs. It is expecting a surge in transatlantic travel as restrictions ease.
A least $611m-worth of cryptocurrencies vanished from Poly Network, a decentralised finance platform, in one of the largest cyber-heists targeting the digital-asset industry. Within hours, however, crypto sleuths tracked down the unnamed hacker, who started returning the funds after declaring “he was not so interested in money.”",1
1820,"TO RUSSIA’S WEST, Belarus, previously a model of authoritarian stability, is in tumult. On August 9th its people refused to accept the official assertion that they had, once again, chosen to elect Alexander Lukashenko, the country’s dictator. In Russia’s far east demonstrators have been on the streets since July, when the governor of the Khabarovsk region, who had been elected without the Kremlin’s blessing, was arrested on Moscow’s orders and charged with murders committed in the early 2000s.
Those protests were a harbinger of hope for Alexei Navalny, a charismatic Russian opposition leader. He was looking forward to issuing a palpable rebuke to the Russian regime at this September’s regional elections; the far-eastern unrest showed the strategy was working. But Mr Navalny now lies in a coma in a Berlin hospital, having apparently been poisoned in Russia by persons unknown on August 20th.

Together, these three developments make the prospects for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, more precarious than at any time since he came to power.
The unspecified neurotoxin which his doctors blame for Mr Navalny’s condition seems to have been administered while he was returning to Moscow after a trip to Siberia. Whoever carried out the attack, the subsequent attempts by the Kremlin to stop Mr Navalny’s transfer to a hospital in Germany, its refusal to investigate the attack and its efforts to muddy the waters strongly suggest complicity if not outright responsibility.
For years Mr Putin has used the power of the state to harass Mr Navalny, pursuing him through the courts, imprisoning him for short spells, excluding him from ballots—but never silencing him definitively. Holding back in this way, it was thought, demonstrated the president’s confidence in his invincibility. At the same time it held out the faint possibility that Mr Navalny might one day lead a real uprising—a possibility which helped ensure the support of the elites with whom Mr Putin lives in codependency. For Mr Navalny to be removed from the scene, as has now happened, would show either that the president no longer controlled his own partisans or that he felt real fear.
What there is to be afraid of can be seen over the western border. Despite—indeed to some extent because of—reprisals which have included beating and torture, apparently leaving at least five people dead, the people of Belarus are protesting in ever greater numbers, feeling their moment has come. Their revolt matters to Mr Putin not because he is particularly dependent on Mr Lukashenko, nor because the two countries have, since 1996, been joined in a two-country common market known as the “Union State”. It matters because Belarus has served as a template for many of the tactics Mr Putin has used to achieve and maintain his power, and Mr Lukashenko has now lost any semblance of legitimacy. Though Mr Putin has never been dictatorial in quite the same way, he may only be a few steps behind him.
Those involved join the dots quite explicitly. On August 15th Mr Lukashenko, trying to drum up support, said on television “It is not a threat to just Belarus anymore. Defending Belarus today is no less than defending our entire space, the Union State, and an example to others.” The others who needed that example set, it went without saying, were those in Russia sympathetic to Mr Navalny. Or, as Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny’s chief of staff, put it on Facebook, “Lukashenko with a rifle or Putin with his poison—which one of them is more crazy?...What is happening in Belarus today provides some clues about what awaits Russia in the very near future.” On the streets of Khabarovsk the protesters have started shouting their support for the Belarusian uprising.
Under the helicopter
The Belarusians, for their part, are experiencing a true awakening. On August 23rd, in the biggest protest to date, hundreds of thousands came to Independence Square in Minsk, covering it with the red and white of the flag used by the short-lived Belarusian republic of 1918-19. The authorities, which have dialled back the extreme violence of their response to the first protests, sent in police patrols and played patriotic songs from the second world war over a rooftop tannoy system. The protesters responded by howling, beating drums and chanting, shaking their heads in seeming disbelief at what they were doing. The atmosphere had an odd resemblance to that of an early Pride parade: something repressed was coming out, surprised and delighted to recognise itself.
The awakening is decentralised, its lack of established leaders a testament to the years Mr Lukashenko has spent steamrollering all opposition. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the candidate who the protesters believe would have won the election handily if the ballots had been fairly counted, was a complete unknown when the campaign started. She stood because her husband Sergei, a popular vlogger who had announced his intention to run for president and thereby crush Mr Lukashenko, had been jailed as a result.
“There has never been a plan other than reminding people of their own dignity,” says Maria Kolesnikova, one of the two other women who helped lead Ms Tikhanovskaya’s campaign and now the only one of the three still in the country. Ms Tikhanovskaya fled for Lithuania on August 11th after the government effectively took her hostage and coerced her into reading out a condemnation of the protests.

Mr Lukashenko seems in shock. The four previous elections he has staged since becoming president in 1994 (he abolished his country’s term limits 16 years ago) all provided him with between 75% and 85% of the vote. This one, rigged just as well if not better, seemed sure to see the streak continue. But when his 80% of the counted vote was duly announced the people simply refused to believe it. On August 23rd he flew over the protests in a helicopter with his 15-year-old son, railing at the streets below. On landing he emerged toting a semi-automatic rifle, oddly lacking a magazine, to cheer the riot police guarding his residence in their armoured personnel carriers: “Thank you. You are gorgeous. We will sort them out.” The images were meant to demonstrate his resolve to the armed forces. Their brittle edge of craziness may have undercut the intended message.
Were it not for Russia’s support, so far political and rhetorical, Mr Lukashenko would probably have fallen by now. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, claims that the country’s backing for Belarus stems from a need to shore up all former Soviet territory against inroads by Russia’s Western enemies. But Mr Putin’s reasons have more to do with maintaining power at home than with geopolitics.
Mr Lukashenko and Mr Putin are hardly cut from the same cloth. Boris Yeltsin, Russia’s first president and Mr Putin’s patron, staked his legitimacy on a rejection of the Soviet past. Mr Lukashenko’s maverick rise to power was based on returning to it. He implemented no market reforms and privatised no large state enterprises. He kept wages low, but roughly equal. His critics and opponents disappeared.
Most Belarusians did not seem too bothered. Some Russians, their economy in tatters and their lives upended by reforms, gazed over the border in nostalgic envy at old-style collective farms, filthy but functional factories and clean streets. When he negotiated the agreement that created the Union State in 1996, Mr Lukashenko may have entertained the hope that, after Mr Yeltsin shuffled on, the desire for a simpler past might see him become the two countries’ leader himself.
When Mr Yeltsin anointed Mr Putin as his successor in 1999 it was expressly to prevent any such backsliding. The former KGB man’s remit was to protect the wealth and safety of Russia’s new elite and preserve Mr Yeltsin’s reforms. But in securing his grip on power Mr Putin appealed to some of the same feelings as Mr Lukashenko. He championed those who felt they had lost out in the 1990s, and provided them with the symbols, at least, of the past they held dear—rather as Mr Lukashenko had when he restored a version of its green and red Soviet-era flag to Belarus. He encouraged them to identify with him, and returned the favour; as he said when criticised for re-establishing the Soviet Union’s Stalinist anthem in 2001: “Perhaps I and the people are mistaken, but...” The Russian state media, which he quickly made his own, reinforced the identification.
How to be president for life
Mr Putin chose to act on the people’s dislike of the new elite not, in the main, through economic appropriation but through political emasculation. Those who had made fortunes in the post-Soviet world could expect protection as long as they got out of politics and accepted that they now depended on him. He was not worried about jailing those who balked at the new dispensation.
Having consolidated power, in 2008 Mr Putin embarked on a sojourn as prime minister in order to avoid the constitutional limit on consecutive presidential terms, with Dmitry Medvedev sitting in for him as president. When they swapped jobs again in 2012, though, it was against a background of new level of discontent. The urban middle class, despite having done well under his rule, was protesting.

These protests marked the beginning of Mr Navalny’s career as a front-rank politician. Previously mostly known as an anti-corruption blogger and activist, they made him a leading figure in the opposition. His vision of Russia as a modern nation state offered an alternative both to the excesses of the 1990s and to Mr Putin’s increasingly imperial autocracy.
In Belarus, Mr Navalny would have mysteriously disappeared. But Russia was an autocracy, not a dictatorship. To keep the country’s elites, regional leaders and private sector on-side Mr Putin needed some sort of pseudo-democratic legitimacy. So when Mr Navalny announced he would stand in Moscow’s mayoral election of 2013, the Kremlin permitted it—while at the same time seeking to undermine his efforts with trumped-up embezzlement charges. The ruse backfired when an overzealous court sentenced Mr Navalny to five years in prison shortly before the election. Tens of thousands of Muscovites took to the streets to demand his release. In the end he won 27% of the vote, according to the official count.
Things changed in February 2014, when Viktor Yanukovych, a corrupt president, was overthrown by the Ukrainian people. Mr Putin encouraged pro-Russian thugs in the east of the country who rose up against the new regime—portrayed in the Russian media as fascists—and made use of the conflict to annex Crimea. This massively boosted his popularity, sidelining the opposition for years. In 2018 Mr Putin was re-elected president; Mr Navalny was not allowed on the ballot.
At that point, though, Mr Putin faced a problem. The constitution barred him from a fifth presidential term. But without the possibility of one he was a lame duck. He considered reviving Mr Lukashenko’s 1990s notion in reverse—amalgamating Russia and Belarus, and becoming the first president of a new country that would benefit from a retailored Putin-friendly constitution. Mr Lukashenko was not keen on the idea and sought, by resisting it, to rally his people round the flag (the green and red one he had introduced in 1995, rather than the white and red one now flying above every protest).
Stymied on the whole-new-country front, Mr Putin was eventually forced to change the constitution under the cover of a plebiscite in which the abolition of presidential term limits was bundled up with all sorts of other changes, most of them crowd-pleasing but inconsequential. It was, as it happens, a stratagem Mr Lukashenko had employed to bestow new powers on himself after he was impeached by parliament in 1996.
A rising tide
Through all this Mr Navalny continued to organise. In 2017, when the post-Crimea euphoria had largely dissipated and the economy was sagging, he sensed a new opportunity. The country’s growing reliance on the internet, as opposed to state-controlled television, for information helped him to seize it. A YouTube video which detailed Mr Medvedev’s yachts and palaces sparked a protest that rolled from Vladivostok in the east to St Petersburg and Moscow in the west, engulfing some 90 cities.
Mr Navalny himself was taken by surprise. You can never predict how many people will turn up, he said at the time; they won’t come out just because they are asked to. The protesters of 2017 were angrier and poorer than those of 2011-12, and half of them were under 30. What brought them on to the streets, Mr Navalny noted, was their lack of prospects.
Mr Navalny looked to fill that emptiness with the optimism and confidence of an American-style politician. He shunned ideological issues that might divide people, concentrating instead on what brought them together: incomes, health, education and a desire for the rule of law. The most important thing, he said, was to battle “learned helplessness”.
Unable to register a party and disqualified from standing in the 2018 presidential elections, he nevertheless built up a formidable campaigning machine, mobilising 120,000 volunteers. He came up with a strategy of “smart” voting in regional elections: his followers were to vote for whoever was best placed to defeat the Kremlin’s candidate regardless of party and however uninspiring or unpalatable that choice might be. At a rally in Khabarovsk he said his job was to create as many stresses for the Kremlin as possible.
The stress was seen in the summer of 2019. The Kremlin, afraid of smart voting, disqualified all of the independent candidates from seemingly insignificant local-council elections in Moscow. Protests broke out; the Kremlin responded with violence. Across the country, though, most sympathy was on the side of the protesters. The level of brutality being applied was counterproductive. This probably explains why there has been very little police violence in Khabarovsk over the past month.
That success, coupled with evidence that Mr Putin’s popularity was in long term decline, led Mr Navalny to concentrate even more effort on the regional elections to be held on September 13th as a rehearsal for the parliamentary elections in 2021.
The increasing appeal and sophistication of his operation, coupled with the protests in Belarus, may have changed Mr Putin’s calculations about the safety of leaving an opposition leader in place as a signal that such opposition did not worry him. And events in Minsk have shown again the limits of police violence. Even when applied with bestial enthusiasm it could not make up for Mr Lukashenko’s cataclysmic loss of legitimacy; instead it accelerated it. Better act savagely against a leader now than take on the people later.
The irony is that this could lead to the regime’s eventual downfall being more tumultuous than it would have been. Mr Navalny may be the last Russian opposition leader who can control street protest while also engaging in negotiations with the Kremlin. His absence does not make future protests a lot less likely, but it makes them a lot less predictable. Mr Putin may feel that he has the situation under control. So did Mr Lukashenko. ■",1
1821,"FOR MUCH of this year, the global distribution of covid vaccines has been enormously inequitable. The rollout has been a two-speed affair, with richer countries in the fast lane. Today, in low-income countries, less than 2% of adults are fully vaccinated, compared with 50% in high-income ones. A new analysis from Airfinity, a life-sciences data firm, spells out the startling implications: if rich countries do not redistribute surplus vaccine this year, between 1m and 2.8m lives could be lost as a result.
The data show that G7 countries could redistribute 500m doses by the end of September, and up to 1.2bn doses by the end of the year. Moreover, Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser at the World Health Organisation, says this surplus is actually an underestimate because it takes into account only supplies to the G7, and not the whole world.

The analysis was done by looking at the output of vaccine factories on a daily and weekly basis and the number of doses procured by G7 countries. The supply is vastly larger than countries will be able to use. The analysis generously assumes that children over the age of 12 will mostly be vaccinated, and everyone is offered a booster shot after six months. Rasmus Bech Hansen, the boss of Airfinity, says that even with these unlikely assumptions the number of surplus doses is “extraordinary”.
He says that countries have been stockpiling because of past uncertainties over supply. As vaccine production ramped up at the start of the year, supplies were small and unreliable. All that has changed. Today more than 1bn doses a month are reliably produced, and this will continue to increase every month this year. In November 2021, the world will make 1.5bn doses of covid vaccine. This is more than all the vaccines made in the first four months of this year.

If this rate of production continues there will be a glut of vaccines by the middle of next year. This year the world will make about 12bn doses, and it has the capacity to make the same amount again by June 2022. To fully vaccinate 80% of the population above the age of 12, only 11.3bn doses are needed (see chart).
With output now reliable, Mr Bech Hansen thinks the world has reached a “tipping point” in production, and that high-income countries can be confident about supply. Dr Aylward says the goal is to achieve 10% coverage in all countries by the end of September, and at least 40% by the end of 2021. Vaccinating 10% will cover health-care workers and the elderly; vaccinating 40% will cover most at-risk groups, including people with comorbidities, and reduce death rates enormously. Reaching this target will require only between 2bn and 2.5bn doses this year.
Yet Covax, the biggest buyer of vaccines and supplier of them to poorer countries, has struggled to get hold of doses it has bought and has shipped only 230m this year. It faces a variety of difficulties. A critical one has been that its most important suppliers, in India, have been prevented from exporting by their government. Seth Berkley, head of the vaccine-finance group Gavi, says Covax invested more than $1bn in Indian vaccine production, and helped with the technology transfer. But, he says, “there is no answer out of India on what they are going to do.”
Although India has now vaccinated 47% of its population aged 12 and over with a first dose, it has so far failed to say when exports will resume. This lack of clarity now means that Covax is currently struggling to project precisely how much it can distribute this year.
Donations, to the tune of 100m doses, have acted as a stopgap while Covax waits for the arrival of the doses it has contracted to buy. Discussions are under way about a summit that the Biden administration intends to convene to discuss global vaccine distribution. One source says it will take place on September 20th. This is expected to tackle the immediate vaccine-supply gap in poorer countries.
Yet, although vaccine donations are urgently needed, Dr Aylward argues that Covax ought to be getting its orders directly from the firms themselves, rather than as donations from third parties. He urges a more rational approach: that countries swap early-delivery contracts with Covax. Australia has been doing exactly this with Britain, Poland, and Singapore. Australia needs vaccines now but is not yet scheduled to receive deliveries. It has, therefore, swapped its contracts with countries that can get delivery more immediately but do not need vaccines now. Other countries urgently need to make similar arrangements.
In the months to come, it seems likely that America will want to try to play a leading role in sorting out the global vaccine supply. The country’s early vaccine nationalism allowed China to project itself as a benevolent global leader by sending an abundance of vaccines overseas. A geopolitical win for America would be especially useful after the debacle in Afghanistan.
On September 2nd America said it would invest $3bn in the vaccine supply chain to position itself as a leading global supplier of vaccines. The money will be spent on American suppliers that make the ingredients for vaccine production, as well as on sites that fill and finish vaccines. This is probably as much for economic as political reasons. As the start of next year approaches, the supply of vaccines will grow so large that, if they are plentiful enough, more popular vaccines will have the opportunity to push the less popular ones out of the market.
It is fairly clear that the mRNA vaccines are widely seen as the most effective and desirable around the world, whereas Chinese vaccines are seen as an inferior product that works less well. By supporting American mRNA manufacturing, the government can also help these vaccines win in the competitive market to come.
Yet vaccine geopolitics aside, the moral case for vaccines to flow quickly to lower-income countries could not be clearer or more urgent. The two-speed world means that as cases of Delta surge everywhere, the burden of death is falling heavily on the poorest.",1
1822," (CNN)While the US has been in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic, another public health crisis has surged past a tragic milestone. Over 100,000 people died from drug overdoses between May 2020 and April 2021, according to provisional data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday -- a 28.5% increase from the 12 months prior and a record high for the US.   Though these statistics are new, the problem is not. Overdose deaths have been trending upward for years.  A key aspect of the issue, experts say, has been the rise of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can be up to 100 times more potent than morphine, is much cheaper to produce than traditional plant-based opioids and is often mixed with street drugs without the buyer's knowledge, increasing the risk of a fatal overdose. Combine the growing popularity of fentanyl with a pandemic that has forced people into isolation, and stripped them of the in-person relationships and support systems they depend on, and it's easy to understand the spike in overdose deaths since lockdowns began.  But despite the macabre picture the trend lines paint, there is much that can be done to curb the overdose death rate, says CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who served as the health commissioner of Baltimore from 2014 to 2018 during which time the city had some of the highest opioid overdose rates in the US, and who currently serves as advisory board chair of the Behavioral Health Group, a network of outpatient opioid treatment and recovery centers in the US.  Many of the programs Wen implemented in Baltimore -- including promoting the widespread availability of naloxone, the fast-acting opioid antidote, piloting test strips that can alert users to the presence of fentanyl in street drugs and increasing treatment for opioid use disorders -- she feels have the potential to curb overdose deaths across the nation.  To address the opioid crisis we must refocus on a single mission, says Wen, and remind ourselves that when it comes to public health, we are all striving for the same outcome: saving lives.  The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: Experts have attributed the recent spike in overdose deaths to the pandemic and to the rise of fentanyl. Can you explain how those two factors impacted the overdose death rate? Wen: Prior to the pandemic, we were already having an epidemic of opioid overdoses that was driven primarily by fentanyl, which is many times stronger than heroin and is often used to cut street drugs. So, if someone is taking their usual amount of heroin, for instance, but there's something in there that's many times stronger, they are much more likely to overdose and die.  And then the pandemic happened. Public health resources were already stretched to the limits, so the people working on the opioid crisis had to shift focus to addressing the pandemic. This was necessary, but it also left a gaping hole in the social safety net. On top of that, we know that addiction is a disease of isolation, and recovery depends on relationships. Many people during the pandemic lost their health insurance and the ability to get treatment. Some may have lost other social resources like stable housing or faced food insecurity. Treating their disease of addiction may not have been top of mind. We also can't forget that addiction and mental health issues are diseases of despair, and this pandemic has worsened mental health for so many people. I think that is yet another layered component of what was already a major problem that has lost attention and lost funding and lost people working to solve it. CNN: How can overdose deaths be addressed while the pandemic is still ongoing and resources are still stretched thin? Wen: We can save lives right now through harm reduction practices. That includes getting naloxone, the opioid antidote, to as many people as possible in communities. We should also look at other classic harm reduction practices like making fentanyl test strips widely available. This does not mean condoning or encouraging drug use, but rather if people are going to be using drugs, they need to know if there's fentanyl in their supply so that they can reduce the risk of a fatal overdose. Then there are safe injection facilities, which in Portugal and the other countries have been shown to save lives. They are controversial, but if our focus is going to be on preventing deaths, then we should be looking at all strategies that are effective.  We also need to ensure that people have access to evidence-based treatment. For treating individuals with opioid use disorder, for instance, that means a combination of medications like buprenorphine or methadone, along with psychosocial support. There needs to be adequate insurance coverage for these treatments -- and while telemedicine should be enabled and allowed, we also must also recognize that many patients need brick and mortar care. Ultimately, the treatment for individuals with addiction needs to be viewed the same as treatment for people with any other medical illness.  CNN: What about longer-term solutions that can be implemented?  Wen: Strengthening our public health infrastructure is critical. Covid-19 has laid bare the many problems, including the underinvestment in and undervaluing of our public health system. We have seen what happens when resources are diverted from existing critical priorities to Covid-19. We, of course, need to focus on this because this is an existential emergency, but these other crises have not gone away. CNN: What are some of the barriers to implementing these policies and initiatives you just described? Wen: For the most part, thankfully, there has been bipartisan agreement that this is an urgent issue and needs to be a top priority. There are partisan differences around certain key elements -- criminalizing of drug use, for example. Many of us in public health would say that it is far past time for addiction to be treated as a disease, and not as a crime.  The harm reduction practices that I mentioned earlier are also not universally accepted by policymakers at this point. Most people of various political ideologies would support naloxone, because it's hard to be against the idea that if somebody's overdosing in front of you, you should save their lives. But syringe exchange programs, which are often sites where naloxone is distributed, are controversial. Many parts of the country still do not allow them for fear that they condone drug use, when what they actually do is to prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis, and provide outreach to individuals who could be susceptible to overdose.  In addition, there is a major issue around treatment. The concern here is not even so much political as in a partisan divide, but rather political as in what resources we are willing to devote to this issue. There are solutions we could tap into, but do we have the political will to devote the resources to finally solving this crisis? I understand that there are many funding priorities in front of the Biden administration and in front of Congress. The question is: where does addiction fall in their list of priorities? ​​CNN: When you were health commissioner of Baltimore, you focused heavily on implementing specific measures such as widespread access to naloxone and increased access to treatment as part of your initiative to combat the opioid crisis in the city. Do you think it's possible to implement a similar initiative on a national scale, or is this problem something that needs individualized approaches specific to each locality? Wen: There are general guiding principles that are necessary for addressing addiction in every community. And those principles include harm reduction, increasing access to treatment and strengthening public health infrastructure. Those are the three pillars that are uniform across all parts of the country. When I was the health commissioner in Baltimore, I worked closely with my colleagues in public health around the country, including Dr. Rahul Gupta, who at the time was the commissioner of health in West Virginia. He primarily oversaw a rural constituency and I oversaw an urban one, but together we wrote about how the programs that we implemented are similar. They were tailored to the specific constituencies we represented and the hospitals, nonprofits and community organizations that we worked with. And while there are different methods of reaching people in urban areas versus rural ones, the principles and the guiding values are the same. So, I think there is a way to scale up what we know works.  CNN: Do you see this as an issue that should be primarily addressed at the federal, state or local level of government? Wen: It needs to be a combination. The funding has to come from the federal government and then must be distributed to communities based on level of need. The communities then are best positioned to understand how to use that funding for specific programs or resources in their area. The federal government, though, is not going to give money and say, ""Do whatever you want with it."" There are very clear guidelines on how that money should be spent. And in this regard, the federal government has a major role to play in defining the evidence-based treatment that the funds can be used for. We don't want federal money, for instance, going toward rapid detox programs, which can be harmful and increase the rate of overdoses.  At the same time, states have to do their part. Those that have not expanded Medicaid need to. We need to have policies that treat addiction as we do all other medical illnesses.CNN: What advice would you have for people who are facing addiction and don't know how to seek help or what resources are available to them?Wen: If somebody struggling with addiction has a primary care provider that they trust and go to regularly, their doctor is the best person to seek help from because that person will know them, will understand their history, and will know what resources are available in their community. Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website has a list of providers in different parts of the country and a person's local health department may be able to refer them to treatment options depending on the part of the country they live in. In some parts of the country, hotlines exist for people to call if they are seeking help.  CNN: Are you optimistic that we will be able to turn around this trend? Wen: Public health is now right in the crosshairs of the ideological and culture wars in a way that it should not be. It's not helpful when masks and vaccinations are seen as political issues, and public health has now been largely equated with Covid-19. So, if Covid-19 is seen as a partisan issue, public health by default becomes partisan as well. Fighting drug overdose deaths is one of the issues where there is very clear bipartisan agreement that we have a problem, unlike the issue of Covid-19. Not everyone agrees that Covid is even a crisis. Addressing the opioid crisis is a way to get back to a bipartisan consensus on public health. I'm not saying that is the reason why we should be addressing the overdose crisis. We should be addressing it because it killed over a 100,000 people in America last year; we should be addressing it because it was a crisis before the pandemic and then it became largely forgotten.  But, as an added benefit, addressing the opioid crisis could get us back to the heart of the matter: how public health can unite rather than divide.",2
1823,"IN 1995 AUSTRALIA’S Northern Territory enacted the world’s first law explicitly allowing assisted dying. It said that terminally ill, mentally competent adults who wanted to die could ask a doctor for help, using lethal drugs. The law sparked outrage. Within months the federal government had overturned it. Yet today five of Australia’s six states have assisted-dying laws.
The Economist first made the case for assisted dying in 2015. We argued that freedom should include the right to choose the manner and timing of one’s own death, while also cautioning that the practice should be carefully monitored and regulated to avoid abuses. Since then, it has become more widely available. Assisted dying is now legal in one form or another in a dozen countries, and the trend seems likely to continue. Last week New Zealand enacted a euthanasia law for the terminally ill after 65% of voters backed it in a referendum. The same week Portugal’s parliament passed a broader law. Assisted dying is still illegal in Britain, but the House of Lords is debating a bill to allow it.

The number of people who die this way is increasing, though still small. In the Netherlands it rose from roughly 1,800 in 2003 to nearly 7,000 in 2020, or 4% of all deaths. As more countries liberalise, the global total will rise further.
Many people object to assisted dying on religious grounds: some faiths deem suicide a sin. Others worry that safeguards will prove insufficient, or that legalisation is a slippery slope. Critics have long predicted that families exhausted by the demands of caring for sick, elderly relatives will place undue pressure on them to end their lives, or that cash-strapped states will encourage the most expensive terminally ill patients to hurry up and die.
Yet such horrors do not seem to have come to pass. In places with the longest experience of assisted dying, charities that represent the elderly or disabled have not reported any abuse. It is conceivable that some has taken place unobserved, but scrutiny has been intense and in most countries permission to help someone die is revoked if there is even a hint of coercion. Fears that the poor and marginalised might be hastened to their ends have also proved to be unfounded. In America, the Netherlands and Switzerland the overwhelming majority of those who choose an assisted death are educated and middle-class.
Far from being too lax, the rules have often been too restrictive. The Australian state of Victoria, for example, bars doctors from mentioning assisting dying to their patients. The aim is to avoid coercion, but the consequence is that many sufferers do not know that it is an option. In some jurisdictions only those with less than six months to live are allowed help to die. Thus, patients can be terminally ill and in intense pain, but unless a doctor estimates that the end is very near, they cannot end their own suffering. In some cases the diagnosis comes too late. In Victoria in the first six months of 2021 no cases were withdrawn because the patient decided not to proceed, but in 90 cases the patient died before receiving relief. Some countries, such as Spain and Colombia, have liberal laws in theory, but in practice health authorities are reluctant to let anyone make use of them. Last week in Spain a desperate 83-year-old threw herself out of a window after her repeated requests for euthanasia were refused.
Canada offers a better model, because it provides more leeway for individuals to make their own choices. Anyone whose suffering is unbearable can choose an assisted death. They do not have to be terminally ill. And, uniquely, the question of what constitutes “unbearable” suffering is for the patients themselves to decide, so long as they are of sound mind. There is an assessment period of 90 days for those whose deaths are not “reasonably foreseeable”, to allow them to explore all other alternatives. In many cases, simply having the option of an assisted death gives people a sense of comfort and control. In Oregon a third of those people who receive the prescribed lethal medication ultimately choose not to take it.
Even as more societies accept the principle of assisted dying, hard questions remain. Some people worry that its availability may prompt health services to skimp on palliative care. But that is not ordained. Canada’s assisted-dying bill was explicitly linked to increased funding for palliative and long-term care.
If assisted dying becomes common, will old people who require round-the-clock care feel more social pressure to choose death? Many already worry that they are a burden on their children or carers. Some may feel additional guilt if continuing to live is seen as an individual choice, rather than the blind workings of fate. This is a genuine concern. But the possibility that some may agonise over whether to die should not trump the certainty that others will suffer unendurable pain if their freedom to choose is denied.
The trickiest questions arise when an individual’s capacity to make an informed choice is in doubt. Some people with mental disorders have suicidal thoughts that come and go. For them, the bar should be very high. Doctors must be sure they can distinguish between a temporary mental-health crisis and a sustained, considered wish to die. If in doubt, they should offer treatment aimed at helping the patient to live.
Free to choose, to the end
Dementia poses the hardest problem of all. Someone diagnosed with the condition may make a living will, asking for an assisted death when it becomes severe. But they may change their mind. Such a document should never be used to kill someone against their wishes, and if those wishes are unknowable, they should be left to live. Assisted dying should be only for those who can make an informed decision at the time they take the drugs.
No rules in this area are perfect. All should be subject to revision in the light of new evidence about how they work in practice, or to take account of medical advances. But the overall principle—that individuals are entitled to choose how they end their lives—is, we believe, a sound one. The evidence from countries that allow assisted dying is that abuses remain largely hypothetical, whereas the benefits are real and substantial. It relieves suffering, and restores a measure of dignity to people at the end of their lives. ■
Correction (November 12th 2021): An earlier version of this article stated that there is a cooling off period of ten days for patients who choose to have an assisted death in Canada. This is incorrect. There is an assessment period of 90 days for those whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable. Sorry.",1
1824,"WHILE ASSORTED G20 “Sherpas”, officials who do the donkey work on summits, gathered in Dhahran in Saudi Arabia in March last year, lockdowns were starting and international travel was stopping. A scramble to get home began. But within weeks, after some teething troubles with videoconference technology, the Sherpas were conducting talks over Zoom and Webex, and their bosses were holding a leaders’ summit by video. Diplomacy had gone virtual.
“For a long time we’ve been talking about the advent of digital diplomacy,” says Jonathan Black, Britain’s sherpa. “It has really now arrived.” Over the past year diplomats have all but abandoned big multilateral meetings in the flesh. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which normally clogs up New York for two weeks in September as thousands of delegates jet into the city, became a more modest affair with leaders joining via screens.

In the parts of the world that have secured vaccines “in-person” diplomacy is slowly restarting. When Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, hosts fellow G7 foreign ministers for “covid-secure” talks in London on May 3rd-5th, it will be the first time the group has met in the same room since they did so in Saint-Malo in France in April 2019. Current plans envisage that the full G7 summit in Cornwall in June, and a NATO one in Brussels immediately afterwards, will be in-person too.
In the meantime, a great experiment in virtual diplomacy has been under way. In February, for example, Joe Biden held his first summit meeting as president, with Justin Trudeau of Canada, by videoconference. Without leaving the White House, he has since joined a virtual meeting of fellow G7 leaders hosted in London in February—cyber-hopping across to Germany on the same day to speak at the Munich Security Conference—as well as the inaugural summit of the “Quad” (America, Australia, India and Japan) in March. In April he brought together 40 world leaders on screen for a climate summit. Diplomats everywhere, accustomed to ceaseless flying around the world, have spared the national coffers and done their bit to save the planet by cutting out travel.
“Diplomacy has not stopped; it’s accelerated in some respects,” says Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador, now at Harvard University. Communiqués have been agreed upon, resolutions passed, relationships nurtured. In some respects diplomats have probably never been busier.
Hurdles have had to be overcome. At the UN, Russia has refused to accept anything other than physical presence for the Security Council, depriving virtual meetings of formal status. That has slowed things down. Since the seats in the council are not sufficiently socially distanced, a system had to be worked out for voting by emailed letters. With receptions and other forms of entertainment ruled out, diplomats have had to adapt. Instead of the usual dinner to mark their stint as president of the Security Council in February, for example, the British distributed picnic baskets to other missions—placing an unusual amount of diplomatic weight on Branston pickle and Fortnum  Mason tea.
The main workarounds, however, have involved not tea but technology. Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms have both enabled diplomacy to continue and opened new possibilities for efficiency and reach. “We’re a lot better off now because of covid, in terms of diplomacy and mediation, because we’ve been forced to think more carefully about how to do our job,” says Martin Griffiths, the UN’s special envoy for Yemen. “It’s a huge seismic change to the way we do business.”
It is not the first time that technology has transformed the world of diplomats. Ambassadors used to be “the equivalent of ship captains”, says Charles Freeman, a former American ambassador, now at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University. “They were far away and not subject to control.” At the Congress of Vienna in 1814-15, the British foreign secretary, Lord Castlereagh, enjoyed great autonomy, since letters to London might take four to six weeks to arrive. “I did not wait for instructions at Vienna,” he later told Parliament. “I took upon myself the responsibility of acting.”
The telegraph changed all that. News and instructions travelled instantly, to generals in battle and diplomats in embassies. Envoys bemoaned their loss of autonomy (one British diplomat lamented the “telegraphic demoralisation of those who formerly had to act for themselves”). Diplomatic power became more centralised.
The pace could still be leisurely. Winston Churchill fished with Franklin Roosevelt and painted with Dwight Eisenhower. Leaders invested time “tending the diplomatic garden”, as George Shultz, America’s secretary of state under Ronald Reagan, put it. In his final year in office, in 1988, Shultz undertook an eight-country, three-week tour of Asia, “unthinkably long by today’s standards”, recalls Mr Burns, who accompanied him.
Cables and wireless
Since then, air travel and the demands of the news cycle back home have led to shorter summits and a general acceleration of diplomacy. Email and social media have further speeded things up, often bypassing careful drafting and clearance procedures developed to avoid mistakes. Under the presidency of Donald Trump, an impulsive tweet could short-circuit the best-laid diplomatic plans. Modern diplomats have had to adjust to “the annihilation of distance and the compression of time”, as Mr Freeman puts it.

Now covid-19 has shaken things up still more. For one thing, it has played havoc with foreign services’ plans and personnel. At the top, foreign trips have been scaled right back (see chart). Down the ranks, many diplomats have been withdrawn from their posts because of health precautions, or find themselves on extended tours without their families. The pandemic itself has also become a core element in diplomacy, whether as part of soft-power manoeuvring between America, China and Russia, or among allies in tensions stoked by vaccine nationalism. But its longer-term impact will probably be on how diplomacy is conducted, changing practices in three important ways.
First, in the often staid world of diplomats, it has accelerated the adoption of technological tools. Videoconferencing and other means of direct communication, especially via WhatsApp and (for greater security) Signal, have been used more widely. Foreign services’ investment in secure video technology is expected to grow.
Martin Waehlisch, who leads an “innovation cell” at the UN in New York, says the pandemic has boosted adoption of virtual-reality (VR) technology to give decision-makers in New York a sense of what it is like to be on the ground in conflict zones. He sees this as “the future of briefings”, replacing the traditional reports in “Times New Roman, single-space, black-and-white block text”. “Iraq 360”, a VR experience to help mobilise donors, showed the possibilities in 2019. Now the restrictions on travel have led to an investment in other immersive storytelling projects as an extra format for briefing the Security Council. Such projects are under way for Yemen, Sudan and Colombia. Mr Waehlisch hopes this will become standard practice.

The second change is improved productivity, thanks to videoconferencing. Interacting with people around the world has become a lot simpler. “I’ve been able to reach out to more people because I’m not constantly in an airport or on the road,” says Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN’s undersecretary-general for political affairs. Thanks to Zoom and other platforms, it has become possible for diplomats and political leaders to show up for speeches and meetings that they would almost certainly not have attended had their physical presence been required.
For example, 12 foreign ministers and a prime minister might not have flown to New York in February to discuss global vaccine access, but they did all take part in a virtual Security Council meeting on the subject. Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, would hardly have travelled from Canberra to the Rocky Mountains just to address the Aspen Security Forum, as he did last August. It takes months of planning to assemble all the people necessary for a G20 or ASEAN gathering, but you can bring presidents and prime ministers together on a video screen with relative ease. For peace talks, too, virtual platforms make it possible to bring in people who probably wouldn’t find the time to get on a plane and spend several days cloistered in Stockholm or Geneva.
Virtual meetings also cut out a lot of the formalities and pomposity of traditional diplomacy. They are “a great leveller”, says a diplomat from a UN Security Council member: “They’re in their bedroom and you’re in your bedroom.” In the bigger gatherings, officials feel less need to be loquacious than when they have the floor after travelling for a day to deliver a message. As a result, they can sometimes achieve much the same outcome, insiders say, only faster.
Blessed are the peacemakers
The third change may be the most important: the pandemic has accelerated experiments in ways to include a wider range of voices in peace efforts. For some time “inclusivity” has been a buzzword in the world of conflict resolution. Diplomats know that peace processes are often perceived as being imposed from above, or from outside, and that any such deals may not enjoy widespread support. A number of private-diplomacy outfits, such as the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), based in Geneva, have worked to facilitate the involvement of grassroots representatives, including women and young people. But the logistics can be hard. Getting a handful of women from a conflict zone to Switzerland for a few days of discussion is a challenge at the best of times. During a pandemic it can be an impossibility.
So mediators turned to technology—and found relatively quick and easy ways to bring in people who are not normally consulted on a political or peace process. Diplomats are now excited about the potential. “This should become a standard part of how we operate,” says Ms DiCarlo. Her innovation cell in New York repurposed a commercial tool normally used for market research to develop the ability to conduct what it calls “large-scale synchronous dialogues”. These digital focus groups feel like a texting chat, but have the scale of an opinion poll.
The first experiment was in Yemen. A regular poll with 20-30 questions in that country would cost €250,000 ($300,000) and take a month to get the answers, according to Mr Waehlisch of the innovation cell; the digital dialogue cost only a modest consultancy fee for the question design, and produced results instantly. “It’s quite extraordinary for the UN to be in the forefront of this stuff,” says Mr Griffiths, the envoy for Yemen. “It’s terrific, it’s 21st-century diplomacy, because of course it gets away from men in rooms.”
The absence of alternatives
Libya shows the impact this can have. Last year the pandemic pushed negotiations between the country’s rival forces onto video platforms—Zoom for the political dialogue, Teams for the military track. In the summer, with the help of HD’s mediators, a physical meeting in Montreux led to a road map for reconciliation, the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF). Stephanie Williams, at the time the UN’s acting special representative for Libya, realised she needed to expand the numbers in the dialogue for it to be more representative.
In September she started doing big Zoom sessions with mayors, women’s groups and youth activists; representatives of each group reported back to the LPDF, giving their suggestions. In all, Ms Williams says, some 200 women took part, as well as 100-150 young people and the majority of Libya’s 130 municipalities. And then, between November and January, she held five digital dialogues, averaging over 1,000 people for each one, typing back and forth in Arabic. “It really took off with the Libyans,” says Ms Williams. “And it turned out to be a great tool.”
The dialogues included spot polls, which confirmed a lot of what she knew Libyans wanted from the political process, “but we were also able to use it to push the political class, to say, hey, it’s not just the UN mission that’s saying what Libyans want.” In particular the dialogues were useful in pressing the need for unified institutions before elections, which are planned for December. In giving Libyans a voice, the UN’s diplomats reckon, the Zoom calls and dialogues not only boosted confidence in the peace process but improved the prospects for it lasting. An opinion poll (of the traditional sort) in February by Diwan Research found that 71% of Libyans were satisfied with the LPDF process to select a new government, and 68% deemed the process fair and transparent.
Sooner or later these tools would have been put to use in diplomacy. But the constraints of covid-19 had the effect of hastening their adoption, in Libya saving valuable time. “I don’t think that we would have considered things like the digital dialogues had it not been for the pandemic,” Ms Williams says.
Even enthusiasts for the new possibilities of digital diplomacy, however, are keenly aware of its limits. Building a rapport is harder on Zoom than in person. Samantha Power, when appointed by Barack Obama to be America’s ambassador at the UN, went to the trouble of paying a visit to each of her 192 fellow mission heads (with the sole exception of North Korea’s), an investment in relationships that could no doubt be done far more easily today by Zoom, but with much less impact.
Part of what is missing are the signals you can pick up about an interlocutor in a physical meeting: the visible reaction. “When you ask a tough question, do they blanch or do they back up, do they lean into it?” says Mr Burns of Harvard. “You’re not going to get that on Zoom.”
And the really hard part of a negotiation is best done in person. If things aren’t going well, a chat at the bar, or a stroll in the grounds, may help create a breakthrough. The plus side of virtual meetings, the efficiency gains, are also their minus side: you lose the time spent on the margins, the space for informal conversation that helps to establish trust. Difficult messages, often the stuff of diplomacy, can be delivered with more nuance, and less lasting damage to a relationship, face to face than when struggling with a poor connection. At a distance, diplomats say, it is easier to camp on a red line than when you are in the same room. Confidentiality is another concern: “The most delicate issues aren’t amenable to virtual,” says Mr Griffiths.

For all these reasons the toughest agreements—such as Britain’s Brexit deal with the EU—and the hardest conversations will still have to be worked out in person. It is one thing for the White House to convene world leaders to make worthy on-screen statements about tackling climate change, as happened on Earth Day in April. It is another to cajole and corral countries into a difficult agreement, as happened in the negotiating rooms at COP21, the Paris climate summit in 2015. Hence the hope that COP26 in Glasgow later this year can be held in person too.
So physical summitry will not end. Neither is the role of the resident ambassador under serious threat, despite the ease of direct digital communication between governments. Diplomats insist there is still no substitute for that man or woman sitting in the foreign capital, soaking up the culture, the politics, the media, the arguments, and being the acknowledged interpreter of that culture back home.
Diplomatic immunity
But any complacency about a simple reversion to pre-pandemic habits of diplomacy would be misplaced, just as it was after previous disruptions such as the telegraph and the jet plane. The big diplomatic jamborees of the past, such as UNGA, may never return in quite the same way. Digital tools, from virtual meetings to inclusive focus groups, have proved their worth. The diplomatic handbook is ready for a rewrite.
Covid-19 has hastened the arrival of hybrid diplomacy, a blend of the physical and digital. Quite what the ideal mix turns out to be has yet to be worked out, but it is something international negotiators and foreign services are starting to think through. In America Mr Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, want to reinvest in a State Department that had been badly neglected. The money and training should go on preparing for tomorrow’s diplomacy, not yesterday’s. ■",1
1825,"Meghan Markle's 'I'm just a mom' routine on Ellen DeGeneres' show will be a hit with Americans who 'celebrate' celebrity, a royal commentator has said.
British journalist Emily Andrews joined the Good Morning Britain team today to discuss the Duchess of Sussex's first major TV interview since her notorious tell-all with Oprah Winfrey.
Meghan, a former Suits actress who is living in a $14million mansion in California with husband Prince Harry and their children Archie and Lilibet, left a group of Los Angeles street vendors open-mouthed in shock by dancing and singing in front of them while referring to herself as 'mommy' as part of a cringe-worthy on-the-street prank with DeGeneres.
The 40-year-old made a clear attempt to distance herself from the royal family's reserved image during her surprise appearance, when she stepped outside of the studio to pull a prank on a trio of vendors, which saw her forced to do and say whatever the talk show host told her to via a hidden ear piece.
But Ms Andrews suggested many Americans 'will love' the duchess' 'acting' and 'I'm just a mom' image after she recently caused controversy by cold-calling US senators on their private phones and using her royal title to urge them to vote in favour of compulsory paid family leave.
The royal commentator said: 'We often talk, don't we, about the fact that you know the British sense of humour, the American sense of humour, the fact that she struggled maybe slightly over here because she is very American.
'In America celebrity and achievement is celebrated. In the UK... you don't want to get too big for you boots. We do celebrate but we're very understated. Which is completely opposite in America.
'I think she has needed to reboot her image a little bit because some Americans, I've been told by friends out there, felt that her politicising, her ringing, cold calling senators, on paid family leave, now look, the Americans fought a war to get rid of the British royal family, over 220 years ago, and now there's a member of the royal family - yes she's American and married in - but a member of the royal family campaigning. 
'And so I think many Americans will love this, they'll love the fact that she sent herself up, they'll love the acting. It's sort of very homespun, ""I'm just a mom"", I'm helping people, it's a very important part of her image.'
She added that Meghan was trying hard to build her brand as a philanthropist. 
'What she was doing though [on The Ellen Show], was so royal, that's what the royals do, they highlight the work of other people, they put the limelight and the spotlight on ordinary people, and of course, Meghan as we know likes the limelight on herself,' added Ms Andrews. 
The duchess renewed calls for compulsory paid family leave in the US in her soft-soap interview with close friend Ellen.
She told the host she would do 'everything' in her power to change US policy for millions of Americans. 
The duchess recently caused controversy by cold-calling US senators on their private phones and using her royal title to urge them to vote in favour of paid leave. Previously she wrote a letter to the US Congress asking them to considering making paid leave law. 
Republican Representative Jason Smith of Missouri condemned Meghan for interfering in American politics, and even suggested she should be stripped of her title to stop her using it to gain political leverage.
Meghan told The Ellen Show: 'I think that people truly forget, or don't even know that in this country, it's one of the only six countries in the entire world and the only wealthy nation in the entire world that does not mandate and have a federal paid leave programme.
'Everybody knows, especially if you have had a child and even if you haven't, you know how hard it is and how critical it is in those first few weeks if not months to be together as a family. 
'And the fact that we don't offer that here is something that now as a mom of two, I will do everything that I can to make sure that we can implement that for people.' 
Meghan also promoted her children's book The Bench, which she said she wrote as a poem for Harry on Father's Day.
Elsewhere, to kick off her prank during the show, DeGeneres asked Meghan to touch her elbow and nose, and then do a squat to confirm that she could hear all of the talk show host's instructions, while one of the series' producers approached the vendors to inform them that the duchess wished to browse their stalls.
'I am executive assistant to Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex and she's here today and would love to just shop normally,' the producer - using the name Pwamma - told them. 'She just wants to be treated normally. Don't try to act any other way, just totally normal. Is that cool?'
Meghan then approached the first vendor and began inspecting the crystals on their stall, before DeGeneres instructed her to hold one to her head and begin groaning and moaning.
'I'm going to hold this against my head,' the mother-of-two told the perplexed salesperson, before closing her eyes and mumbling, adding: 'That is wonderful.'
Moving on to the next vendor, who was showcasing different varieties of hot sauce, Meghan began 'bouncing up and down' in excitement at DeGeneres's request, asking the man: 'What do we have here? What have you got, what have you got, what have you got?'
Inspecting the bottles of hot sauce lined up on the table, Meghan then told the baffled vendor: 'Let mommy have a taste,' before telling him, 'My boo loves hot sauce.'
After being presented with a hot sauce covered chip, the duchess proceeded to chomp down on it 'like a chipmunk' and DeGeneres's behest, nibbling on the snack while holding it to her mouth with both hands, before telling the salesman: 'That's not spicy! Let me try something real hot, mommy wants some heat.
'Let's get the spiciest, let's get the hottest.'
Seizing another chip from the man, Meghan was then instructed to 'shove the whole thing in her mouth' - and then begin furiously fanning at her face while saying: 'Oh lordy, lordy, lordy.
'I'm feeling hot, hot, hot,' she then sang to the tune of the hit song by The Merrymen. 'Mommy needs some milk.'
The duchess went on to pull out a baby bottle from her purse and vigorously swig milk from it, all while the vendor looked on open-mouthed, unable to hide his bewilderment over her behaviour.
PAID FAMILY LEAVE
I think that people truly forget, or don't even know that in this country, it's one of the only six countries in the entire world and the only wealthy nation in the entire world that does not mandate and have a federal paid leave programme.
Everybody knows, especially if you have had a child and even if you haven't, you know how hard it is and how critical it is in those first few weeks if not months to be together as a family. 
And the fact that we don't offer that here is something that now as a mom of two, I will do everything that I can to make sure that we can implement that for people.
HALLOWEEN   
We wanted to do something fun for the kids and then the kids were not into it at all. Archie was a dinosaur for maybe five minutes. Still not even five minutes, Harry talked him into putting the head on.
But Lilibet was a skunk and it was so cute. She was the flower from Bambi. 
HARRY IN CALIFORNIA
He loves it (living in California). 
We moved here during lockdown so everything was shut down, so we have been able to spend a lot of time at home and creating our home, but it's a lifestyle and the weather is pretty great. We're just happy.
ON LILIBET TEETHING
She is a good sleeper, but the teeth are coming in, so any mom will understand where you go they may be the best in the world, but the moment that is happening you have so much sympathy, so yes, I am up most of the night.
ON HER BOOK 'THE BENCH'
It was about my observation of him (Harry) and him being a dad, which was the most beautiful thing to watch.
Once it was shared with a couple of friends and people that we were close with, they said, 'No this resonates for me too because it feels really inclusive and there's representation and it's just like a sweet love story between a family', and so I said, 'OK let's turn it into a children's book'. 
ON HER NIGHT OUT WITH PRINCESS EUGENIE
He (Harry) came to see me in Toronto and our friends and his cousin Eugenie and now her husband Jack, they came as well, and the four of us snuck out in Halloween costumes to just have one fun night on the town before it was out in the world that we were a couple. 
It was a post-apocalypse theme, so we had all this very bizarre costuming on, and we were able to just have one fun final night out.
ON AUDITIONING AT WARNER BROS LOT
So I had this very old Ford Explore Sport and at a certain point the key stopped working on the driver's side, so you couldn't get yourself in through the door so after auditions I would park at the back of the parking lot and I would open the trunk and climb in, pull the door shut behind me and crawl all over my seats to get out. That's how I would come to and fro. 
I would park on gate three and I would scoot on over and the security guards here would always say 'break a leg, I hope you get it'. So driving today was very different.
ON SELLING SCRUNCHIES AT SCHOOL
My mom would take me down to downtown LA where all the fabrics are, you can buy them really affordably and I would get some of the remnants and I would buy the elastic and tied the knot and I had a sewing machine, and I made scrunchies and sold them at school, this is when I was at elementary school.
It was a thing at the time and I guess they are back now, people are wearing scrunchies again.",3
1826,"Vials labeled 'smallpox' that were discovered in a freezer in a Philadelphia laboratory don't contain any traces of the deadly virus, federal health officials reveals.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday that testing showed the vials contain 'vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine' and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. 
The vials 'were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker' who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer on Monday night.
There were 15 vials in total - five of which were labeled 'smallpox' and the other 10 labeled 'vaccinia.' 
Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 with a successful mass vaccination campaign after it killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone.
Samples of the deadly virus are only supposed to be kept in two labs: the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Russia.  
Mark O'Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County.
It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. 
The CDC said it was 'in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization' about the findings.  
The finding was first reported by Yahoo News, which obtained a copy of an alert sent to the Department of Homeland Security labeled 'For Official Use Only.'  
Smallpox is a serious, life-threatening illness causes by variola virus.
A person may not look or feel sick for 7 to 14 days after exposure, but initial symptoms include high fever, headaches, backaches, and vomiting.
Around a third of people who contract the disease, die. 
After the initial symptoms, a body-wide rash appears. The person is most contagious during this stage.
Rashes develop in the tongue, mouth and throat. They then spread to the face and arms, torso and legs.
Pus-filled bumps, also called pustules, form and begin to scab over and fall off over a period of about 10 days.
It was mostly spread by prolonged face-to-face due to respiratory particles. The virus was also spread by sharing sheets, towels and clothing.     
Source: Cleveland Clinic 
After they were discovered, the vials were secured immediately and the facility was put on a lockdown that was lifted by Wednesday night.
'Merck is in the process of figuring out why it was there,' the source told NBC10 on Wednesday 
Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com.
'There is no indication that anyone has been exposed to the small number of frozen vials,' a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo. 
'The frozen vials labeled 'Smallpox' were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker while cleaning out a freezer in a facility that conducts vaccine research in Pennsylvania.'
The discovery took place at the Merck Upper Gwynedd facility in North Wales, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, according to WCAU. 
'CDC, its Administration partners, and law enforcement are investigating the matter, and the vials' contents appear intact. The laboratory worker who discovered the vials was wearing gloves and a face mask. We will provide further details as they are available,' the spokesperson said. 
The incident is likely to renew questions about what should be done with the world's Smallpox samples, which are kept in only two labs in the world. 
Smallpox is an infection caused by the variola virus. Patients develop a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash, according to the CDC.  
Most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, meaning an outbreak could have devastating consequences.  
The vaccine leaves a dime-sized lesion that gradually forms a scab and leaves a scar, the CDC says. The lesion is contagious before the scab forms, and those who receive it have to protect the vaccination site from other parts of their body and other people.
In 2014, a government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland - just outside of Washington, DC - found six decades-old glass vials containing freeze-dried smallpox, according to the Washington Post.
The samples were packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box. At the time, it was the first such discovery in the country. 
In 2019, an explosion at the state-owned Russian lab holding some of the samples sent one worker to the hospital, though the World Health Organization said the blast didn't occur near the stockpiles, according to NPR.  
Earlier this month, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said the US and UK should invest 'tens of billions' in virus research, including how to possibly prevent smallpox attacks from being unleashed in places like airports, according to Yahoo News. 
'So along with the climate message and the ongoing fight against diseases of the poor, pandemic preparedness is something I'll be talking about a lot,' he said in an interview with British health policy official Jeremy Hunt.
The origin of smallpox is unknown, but the earliest written description of a similar virus appeared in China in the 4th century.
It has typically worked in outbreaks and was brought to North America by European settlers in the 17th century.
About a third of infected patients died. Those who survived were sometimes left with various scars or even blind.
The 'basis for vaccination' began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had gotten cowpox were also protected from smallpox, according to the CDC.
In the 1800s, the virus used to make the smallpox vaccine changed from cowpox to vaccinia virus. (Five of the fifteen vials found in Philadelphia on Tuesday were labeled 'vaccinia.')
Before the vaccine, variolation was a common method of protection against the virus. People who had never had smallpox took material from pustules of infected people and scratched it into their arm or inhaled it through their nose to develop immunity. 
In 1948, the virus was infecting about 50 million people a year throughout the globe, according to the WHO. 
Experts estimate that the virus killed about 300 million people in the 20th century.
Soviet scientist Viktor Zhdanov proposed a four-year global vaccination campaign starting in 1959, and the campaign got a global boost aided by US funds in 1966 and 1967, with the Intensified Eradication Program.
'Laboratories in many countries where smallpox occurred regularly were able to produce more, higher-quality freeze-dried vaccine,' the CDC notes. 
'Other factors that played an important role in the success of the intensified efforts included the development of the bifurcated needle, the establishment of a case surveillance system, and mass vaccination campaigns.'
The last known naturally occurring case happened in 1977 in Somalia. The last natural US outbreak was in 1949. 
By 1980, the WHO declared the disease wiped out.
At this point, most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, according to Yahoo News.

1827,"A BATCH OF new houses across California is selling unusually fast. In the past two months, 82 have been snapped up, and the waiting list is 1,000 long. That demand should, though, soon be satisfied—for, while it can take weeks to put up a conventional bricks-and-mortar dwelling, Palari Homes and Mighty Buildings, the collaborators behind these houses, are able to erect one in less than 24 hours. They can do it so rapidly because their products are assembled from components prefabricated in a factory. This is not, in itself, a new idea. But the components involved are made in an unusual way: they are printed.
Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been around since the early 1980s, but is now gathering steam. It is already employed to make things ranging from orthopaedic implants to components for aircraft. The details vary according to the products and processes involved, but the underlying principle is the same. A layer of material is laid down and somehow fixed in place. Then another is put on top of it. Then another. Then another. By varying the shape, and sometimes the composition of each layer, objects can be crafted that would be difficult or impossible to produce with conventional techniques. On top of this, unlike conventional manufacturing processes, no material is wasted.

Just press “print”
In the case of Palari Homes and Mighty Buildings, the printers are rather larger than those required for artificial knees and wing tips, and the materials somewhat cruder. But the principle is the same. Nozzles extrude a paste (in this case a composite) which is then cured and hardened by ultraviolet light. That allows Mighty Buildings to print parts such as eaves and ceilings without the need for supporting moulds—as well as simpler things like walls. These are then put together on site and attached to a permanent foundation by Palari Homes’ construction workers.
Not only does 3D-printing allow greater versatility and faster construction, it also promises lower cost and in a more environmentally friendly approach than is possible at present. That may make it a useful answer to two challenges now facing the world: a shortage of housing and climate change. About 1.6bn people—more than 20% of Earth’s population—lack adequate accommodation. And the construction industry is responsible for 11% of the world’s man-made carbon-dioxide emissions. Yet the industry’s carbon footprint shows no signs of shrinking.
Automation brings huge cost savings. Mighty Buildings says computerising 80% of its printing process means the firm needs only 5% of the labour that would otherwise be involved. It has also doubled the speed of production. This is welcome news, the construction industry having struggled for years to improve its productivity. Over the past two decades this has grown at only a third of the rate of productivity in the world economy as a whole, according to McKinsey, a consultancy. Digitalisation has been slower than in nearly any other trade. The industry is also plagued, in many places, by shortages of skilled labour. And that is expected to get worse. In America, for example, around 40% of those employed in construction are expected to retire within a decade.
The environmental benefits come in several ways, but an important one is that there is less need to move lots of heavy stuff about. Palari Homes, for instance, estimates that prefabricating its products reduces the number of lorry journeys involved in building a house sufficiently to slash two tonnes off the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per home.
Palari Homes and Mighty Buildings are not, moreover, alone in their endeavours. Similar projects are being started up all over the place. The vast majority print structures using concrete. 14Trees, a joint venture between Holcim—the world’s biggest cement-maker—and CDC Group, a British-government development-finance outfit, operates in Malawi. It says it is able to print a house there in just 12 hours, with a price tag of less than $10,000. Besides being cheap and quick, 14Trees says this process is green as well. Holcim claims that by depositing the precise amount of cement required and thereby reducing waste, 3D printing generates only 30% as much carbon dioxide as using burnt-clay brick, a common technique in Malawi.
In Mexico, meanwhile, a charity for the homeless called New Story has created a partnership with ICON, a 3D-printing firm, to erect ten houses with floor areas of 46 square metres. Each was printed in around 24 hours (though these hours were spread over several days), with the final features assembled by Échale, another local charity. And in Europe the keys to the continent’s first 3D-printed home, in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands (pictured above), were handed over to its tenants on July 30th.
Layer cakes
The house in question, the first of five detached, two-bedroom dwellings in a project co-ordinated by Eindhoven’s municipal government and the city’s University of Technology, is a collaboration between several firms. The Dutch arm of Saint-Gobain, a French building-materials company, developed the concrete mortar needed. Van Wijnen, a construction firm, built the thing, while Witteveen+Bos, a consultancy, was responsible for the engineering. It is being rented out by its owner, Vesteda, a Dutch residential-property investor.
Making the cement involved in projects like this is not, however, a green process. It turns calcium carbonate in the form of limestone into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, and is reckoned responsible for about 8% of anthropogenic emissions of that gas. A group at Texas A University, led by Sarbajit Banerjee, has therefore developed a way to dispense with it.
Dr Banerjee’s new building material was inspired by a project he masterminded some years ago to construct supply roads to remote parts of the Canadian province of Alberta using stuff immediately to hand. The road metal he devised combined local soil with a mulch of wood fibres, and was held together by liquid or water-soluble silicates that then hardened and acted as cement. To build houses he uses whatever clay and rock debris is lying around under the topsoil near the construction site, crushes it into a powder and blends it with silicates. The result can then be squeezed through a nozzle, after which it rapidly consolidates and gains strength, so as to hold its shape and bear the weight of the next layer. The process is thus doubly green. It eliminates both cement and the need to transport to the site, often over long distances, the sand and aggregates used in conventional concrete.
Concrete benefits
There are limitations to 3D-printed homes. For a start, construction codes need to be tweaked to accommodate them. To this end UL, one of America’s largest certifying agencies, has collaborated with Mighty Buildings to develop the first 3D-printing standard. The guidelines will be included in the new International Residential Code, which is in use in, or has been adopted by, all American states save Wisconsin. While this is a welcome boost to a fledgling industry, most governments have yet to come up with country-specific standards. There are also questions about the quality and finish of homes built by 3D printers.
Even so, the direction of travel looks promising. Last year, plans for a 3D-printed apartment building were approved in Germany. This three-floored structure, assembled by Peri, a German construction company, from parts made using printers developed by Cobod, a Danish firm, will contain five flats. Use of the technology is also expanding in the Middle East and Asia. Dubai’s government wants a quarter of new buildings in the country to be 3D-printed by 2030, and is dedicating a district on the outskirts of its eponymous capital to host 3D-printing companies and their warehouses. Saudi Arabia wants to use 3D printing to build 1.5m houses over the next decade. And India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs wants to use 3D printing to address the country’s housing shortages.
If successful, building by 3D printing is likely to spread beyond housing. Opportunities also exist in warehousing, offices and other commercial buildings. And beyond earthly structures, NASA, America’s space agency, is exploring the use of 3D printing to build landing pads, accommodation and roads on Mars and the Moon. There is no soil on those two celestial bodies, just shattered rock called regolith. Dr Banerjee’s group, which is working with NASA, says its approach to 3D printing functions just as well with this material. “We would ultimately like to have property on Mars and the Moon but we’re not going to be able to take concrete up there with us,” says Dr Banerjee. “We’re going to have to work with regolith.” ■

1828,"WORRIES ABOUT the use of puberty blockers, which are prescribed to some children to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics (like breasts and facial hair) have been mounting in much of the rich world. Some countries have scaled back their use. Not America. Doctors who work in transgender clinics routinely claim that prescribing such drugs is conservative, because their effects are largely reversible, and compassionate, because they save children with gender dysphoria (the feeling of being in the wrong body) from enormous distress.
That may be beginning to change. Last week Abigail Shrier, a writer, published interviews in “Common Sense With Bari Weiss”, a newsletter, with two transgender health-care professionals who suggested that some doctors were irresponsible in the way they treated children. The women, both trans, are on the board of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which endorses the use of blockers early in puberty in some cases. Though blockers are often described as operating like a pause button, most children prescribed them go on to cross-sex hormones. This combination can have irreversible consequences, including sterility and the inability to orgasm.

This was the chief concern expressed by Marci Bowers, a vaginoplasty surgeon who is due to become the president of WPATH in 2022. Dr Bowers built her career operating on adults, but she has also operated on teens: in 2018 she performed a “penile inversion” on Jazz Jennings, a 17-year-old who had been put on blockers aged 11. But Dr Bowers told Ms Shrier she was “not a fan” of putting children on blockers early in puberty. She worried, she said, “about their reproductive rights later. I worry about their sexual health later and ability to find intimacy.”
In 2018 Lisa Littman, a researcher, was hounded and lost her job as a consultant after coining the term “rapid onset gender dysphoria” (ROGD) to describe the social contagion of trans-identification among teens, mostly girls. Dr Bowers appeared to acknowledge the existence of “this ROGD thing” as she called it. “I think there probably are people who are influenced. There is a little bit of ‘Yeah, that’s so cool. Yeah, I kind of want to do that too.’” In some cases, she said, girls with eating disorders were being diagnosed with gender dysphoria, “then they see you for one visit, and then they recommend testosterone.”
Erica Anderson, a clinical psychologist at the University of California San Francisco’s Child and Adolescent Gender Centre told Ms Shrier that because of “sloppy health-care work”—“rushing people through the medicalisation” and an “abject failure” to properly evaluate patients’ mental health—she expected more young people to regret transitioning. Her clinic had seen twice as many females as males for two years running, she said.
It is exceedingly rare for health-care professionals in America to criticise—or even question—the practices that have become prevalent in the medical treatment of gender-dysphoric youth. Professional bodies, including the American Association of Paediatrics, have endorsed “gender-affirmative” care, a model that accepts patients’ self-diagnosis that they are trans, and the use of blockers. Anyone who publicly dissents tends to be castigated.
Will the airing of these views change the way trans-identifying children are treated? Laura Edwards-Leeper, a psychologist who helped found America’s first transgender clinic for children in Boston in 2007, has claimed (including to this newspaper) that too few teens undergo crucial mental-health assessments before starting treatment. She says Dr Bowers’s comments, especially about the effects of blockers on sexual function, have “shaken up” many in the field. Yet she notes some doctors are responding by talking about how they might control or slow treatment, without mentioning the role mental-health professionals should play in all this. That they are discussing the risks at all nonetheless constitutes progress.■",1
1829,"CHINA HAS an anger-management problem, at least when dealing with small and mid-size Western democracies. The fate of Lithuania, a European Union member on the shores of the Baltic Sea, is a case in point.
The country is being punished for agreeing that Taiwan, a democratic island that China claims as its own territory, may open a “Taiwanese Representative Office” in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital. China calls that an affront to its sovereignty. It has summoned its ambassador, Shen Zhifei, home for consultations, and told Lithuania to recall its envoy, Diana Mickeviciene. In a covid-era twist, China informed Ms Mickeviciene of her fate as she returned to Beijing from a summer break. She has to complete three weeks of strict quarantine at her residence and, after emerging on August 31st, catch the next flight home. State media suggest that China may soon suspend direct rail-freight services to Lithuania, then sever other economic links with that country of 2.8m people (Lithuanian farmers should forget long-held dreams of selling milk to China, it is hinted). In a detail noted with dismay by foreign envoys in Beijing, Lithuania’s embassy has received a barrage of threatening calls, many targeting local Chinese staff.

China’s problem is not simply that it has a short fuse. It is not new for leaders in Beijing to downgrade relations with governments that cross their “red lines”. China routinely freezes trade talks and official visits whenever foreign leaders meet Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (Lithuania suffered this fate in 2013). Last year China curbed imports of coal and wine from Australia after that country’s government called for an international probe into covid-19’s origins. Often, China’s demands are arcane as well as aggressive. Lithuania may earn a partial reprieve if it permits only a “Taipei Representative Office” in Vilnius. China tolerates trade offices named after Taiwan’s capital, because those sound like local government outposts. Even the hair-trigger anger of the Chinese public—or at least its noisiest elements—is wearily familiar. Each week, it seems, online nationalists demand a new domestic boycott of a business, or the cancellation of a foreign or local celebrity accused of hurting Chinese pride. Threats directed at Chinese deemed “race traitors” are alarmingly common.
Rather, Chinese irascibility may prove more problematic than before because China’s ambitions are changing. The country no longer inhabits a world of bilateral ties dominated by trade, of the sort that allowed it to play one country off against another. It hopes to create new international networks and groupings that share similar views about what constitutes good governance, in which China plays the central role. That brings new forms of scrutiny when it loses its temper.
About a decade ago, lots of foreign countries saw China as a dazzling, potentially transformative economic partner. Lithuania was no exception. In competition with Estonia and Latvia, its Baltic neighbours, it pitched its largest airport as a hub for Chinese flights, and its main seaport, Klaipeda, as an entry-point for Chinese ships. More recently, it sought to be a European gateway for Chinese financial technologies. In 2012 Lithuania joined 15 other central and eastern European countries, nine of them EU members, in a Chinese-led grouping. This came to be known as the “16 plus one” initiative, holding annual summits with China’s prime minister and spawning countless committees to work on co-operation. At first, many in eastern Europe chafed when the group was called a threat to the EU’s unity by the continent’s rich Westerners. Easterners particularly resented being chided by Germany, given that country’s exceptional access to Chinese leaders and markets.
Disappointment followed. Chinese investments in central and eastern Europe proved paltry, and the lion’s share went to Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Serbia. Trade increased, but mostly because of imports from China. Today, China is still only Lithuania’s 12th-largest trade partner. As dreams of an economic bonanza faded, some members of the 16 plus one (which swelled to 17 after Greece joined in 2019) began comparing notes about the bloc’s political aims and lack of transparency. Like-minded embassies discovered that Chinese officials and party bodies were making direct contacts with regions, cities and institutions in their home countries, bypassing national capitals. In February six members—Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia—sent only ministers to a virtual summit of the 17 plus one, though President Xi Jinping was in the chair.
China’s brand of performative patriotism goes global
Further complicating China’s image, its nationalist fervour is increasingly on display far from home. In August 2019 Lithuania accused China’s embassy in Vilnius of rallying Chinese citizens to disrupt a protest in support of Hong Kong’s democrats (Chinese diplomats were photographed handing out banners). A few months later Chinese-speaking visitors proudly filmed themselves vandalising signs of support for Hong Kong planted on the Hill of Crosses, a shrine to national independence dating to Lithuania’s occupation by Nazi Germany and then by the Soviet Union. The videos went viral, appalling Lithuanians. In April this year expansion of Klaipeda’s outer harbour was put on hold for at least a decade. Senior officials had earlier called China’s attempts to invest in the port a national-security risk. In May Lithuania’s foreign minister announced his country’s withdrawal from the 17 plus one, calling it divisive and less efficient than a unified EU.
State media accuse Lithuania of foolishly provoking China in order to curry favour with America, as if smaller countries lack any will of their own. The mood of gloom and wariness among many European embassies in Beijing is obvious to all. But domestic political imperatives require outsize displays of anger, whenever China feels disrespected. That is a clumsy way to manage foreigners. To China, however, being defied is worse. ■",1
1830,"Nigel Kennedy is munching biscuits and swigging tea from his Aston Villa mug. It's 10.30am: practically the crack of dawn, given that he was up necking plum vodka — 'My wife made it. I drink it. Teamwork!' he cries — until the early hours.
The virtuoso violinist is wearing one of Villa's vintage 'away' strips: 'Horrible, tasteless neon green and lurid red. I love it!' he chortles.
His allegiance to the Birmingham football club he has supported since boyhood is as ingrained as his commitment to making classical music accessible to everyone, not just an elite minority of 'condescending wannabe gentry', as he puts it.
Since his 1989 recording of Vivaldi's Four Seasons sold more than three million copies, making it the best-selling classical recording ever, he has been resolutely defying convention. And today, as he publishes Nigel Kennedy Uncensored!, a riotous, no-holds-barred memoir, he fires a volley of invective at his detractors and deplores the BBC's descent into political correctness.
He talks about drugs (yes, he smokes cannabis), sex, all-night partying — and how he's standing by his son Sark, 25, jailed earlier this month for drug-dealing after being caught with £15,500 worth of cocaine in his car.
'He knows that I'm around to offer him an alternative life and he knows that I love him. I'm going to see him (in prison) pretty soon so I'll remind him of that.
'I just hope he's going to be successful in what he's trying to do, which is to change his life and turn it around. But I'm not going to pull him up by the ear. It's not my place.
'We have all these relatives in Australia and it would be a really fantastic opportunity to start a new life there, away from his old circles. But he's an adult. You can give people opportunities but they have to make up their own mind.'
Nigel Kennedy, 64, is a man of fierce loyalties and ardently held opinions. I had expected bluster and braggadocio. I hadn't reckoned on humour, affability and charm. He's talking to me via Zoom from the studio of the timber house, remote in the Polish countryside, he shares with Agnieszka, 43, his second wife, and their elderly weimaraner, Huxley.
'We're in the wilderness. There are bears, but they're quite shy, not like American grizzlies, and wolves,' he enthuses. 'We've got a huge vegetable patch — Agnieszka instigated it — and beehives. We go hiking!'
He has always been provocative: his bog-brush hair and concert get-up mark him as a maverick. Long ago he eschewed the performer's traditional black tailcoat — the outfit of a 'poncing underpaid butler', as he puts it — and often performs wearing bovver boots, cargo pants and his football jersey. The stuffy elite deplore his anarchism; his vast army of fans applaud his determination to bring classical music to the masses.
He's been dubbed the 'punk violinist' and more acerbically, 'a latter-day Liberace with his ludicrous clothes'. (This from the late Sir John Drummond, one-time director of the Proms and controller of BBC Radio 3.)
He points out that Sir John — an 'elite toff' — at times garnered as few as 250 listeners at Radio 3, turning it into 'an unattainable exclusive club'. Meanwhile, Kennedy, a glittering alumnus of the Yehudi Menuhin School (the great violinist actually paid his fees) was packing the 5,000-seat Royal Albert Hall to the rafters.
'And I don't think he [Sir John] played the piano as well as Liberace,' he says. 'He was a purist; he didn't like Liberace's white piano and candelabra. I didn't really like Liberace either, but he was a skilful piano player.'
And Kennedy laments the fact that the taxpayer-funded BBC has become 'a teeth-gnashing, pitiful and desperately wannabe politically correct institution', concluding: 'Public reaction to this self-indulgence is already taking the shape of even more apathy and resentment, which will inevitably lead to refusal to pay the licence fee and the discarding of TV in general in favour of the internet.'
Kennedy renames one BBC First Night of the Proms the 'Farce Night', decrying its 'tedious desperation' to burnish its woke credentials after one singer dedicated her performance to 'transgender people all around the world'.
'What for? Why?' he asks incredulously. 'That type of irrelevant superficial claptrap was too much to take and had nothing to do with the music she was performing, unless she thought it couldn't stand up for itself.
'To think that we pay a licence fee to hear that kind of spouting. I respect everyone whatever their gender, but meritocracy is what we're looking for. This insistence on quotas and equality of outcome . . . there should be an equal chance for everyone as long as they're prepared to work hard.'
Kennedy, never reticent about expressing his views, was not prepared to let the singer's comments pass unremarked.
He was due to play Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending and Monti's Czardas, and during his rehearsal with the orchestra, he recalls: 'I quipped in a similar bleating manner to the singer, 'I would like to dedicate my part of the performance to all the forgotten and displaced heterosexuals around the world.' '
This light-hearted riposte misfired. He was met with an 'unamused glower' from two women in the viola section, 'As if heterosexuals shouldn't be recognised or allowed to celebrate anything'. 'The conductor also seemed rather unsupportive,' he adds.
'I know some people suffer from a chronic sense-of-humour shortage and I sincerely wish them a speedy recovery.'
Although he is Left-wing and fervently anti-elitist, he now finds his sympathies veering towards the white British middle classes.
'I've had a fair few good nights at the Proms. I've experienced a mixed feeling or two about the toffs waving Union Jacks. First of all, I found myself a bit averse to all of that jingoism, but now that everyone in the media is so anti-white British my feelings have become a bit more tolerant. Every other group of people is allowed to talk about their race and big it up.
'And once the Scottish finally have to leave our UK, we won't see the Union Jack any more and it's a shame, because it's a killa [great] looking flag.'
Such unfashionable views have, it seems, made him persona non grata at the BBC. 'They won't make any shows with me any more. Jimmy Savile was OK but apparently I'm not!'
He has always been a dissident, his soaring musical talent matched by rebelliousness and an epic capacity for partying.
Does he still love a shindig? 'Of course! There's a lot of adrenaline coursing round your body after a concert, when you're trying to deliver the best performance for the people who have paid to be there.
'Afterwards it's good to hang out with your mates. Often I'll invite members of the audience to a party. Everyone's welcome.'
He's famous for the epic duration of these parties: in his book he enumerates the many events to which police were called, grading various forces throughout Europe on the standard of their response.
(The Met come out top for turning a blind eye to the antics of the carousers at his home during one early-hours revel, merely requesting they kept the volume down.)
He goes off on a riff in praise of our police force: 'It's an amazing privilege to live in a society where we don't have armed police,' he says. 'The people who join the police are trying to help society and we ought to remember that.
'Maybe a few behind desks get a bit addled in the head, but the people on the streets are trying to benefit us. It's not a brilliantly paid job and there are huge expectations.'
He makes no secret of the fact that he smokes cannabis: 'I appreciate a good smoke. It has helped me become the improviser, composer and classical interpreter that I am today.'
But I wonder if his capacity for caning it has waned with age?
'I think you become more professional at handling drink as you get older, don't you?' he asks. When I tell him I hardly drink now he roars with laughter. 'Well there's no point in you coming to one of my parties then!'
I ask about his views on cocaine. When his son, Sark — who lives with Nigel's ex-wife, Eve, in Malvern — appeared at Worcester Crown Court earlier this month, he was jailed for 33 months after admitting possession with intent to supply the drug.
The court heard that he was selling 'wraps' of cocaine at £40 each after getting into debt since becoming addicted as a teenager, but was now determined to become a useful member of society.
'I've always been clear that I don't appreciate it [cocaine] in my circles,' Nigel says. 'I really hate that type of stuff. It doesn't improve the atmosphere. I've got a crackpot theory that coffee is a gateway for cocaine. It revs you up and makes you more hyperactive. I don't think you'd find many tea-drinkers like it.' He tops up his brew and takes another sip.
'My son knows what I think about it. It's not my place to tell him: 'You can't do that.' You give people opportunities and in the end they make their own choices.'
Is he a good dad? 'You learn as you go, but practice does not always make perfect,' he says.
'My son sees a lot of hard work going on in my house and he knows to get a life together you have to really work.'
Indeed, Nigel's work ethic is formidable. He practises for between three and six hours a day, striving constantly to improve.
'It's quite boring, what I'm doing. I write music. I get better at the violin. I work ceaselessly at it. And if I have a killa project like a gig at Madison Square Garden [the 20,000-seat New York arena], or if I'm writing something — I've just finished my first violin concerto — my life becomes very regulated.
'For a couple of months I have no sex or alcohol; no parties or any recreational stuff. It becomes a very focused life, and it really does help.'
I wonder what Agnieszka thinks about this monastic life.
'Oh I think she's pretty happy about it,' he laughs. 'She doesn't have to bother about me.'
'And you can still do a bit of hiking.'
'Exactly.'
They've been married for 23 years or so — he is hazy on dates and chronology, a fact that has got him into deep trouble with his wife, an actor and artistic director.
'Three years ago I forgot her birthday and I had to buy her a car,' he guffaws. 'My mate said, 'Well you've learnt from that. You won't forget next time.' But I did! I couldn't buy her another car — Greta [Thunberg] wouldn't like that — so I got her a toy one instead.'
We go off on a bit of a tangent, talking about Greta, from whom he is loath to take advice.
'Relatively speaking she's just a child.' He's sceptical about man-made global warming but is an ardent environmentalist.
'I hate to think of dolphins swallowing plastic. I went through a phase of leaving plastic packaging outside the supermarket. If they want to propagate it they should deal with it.'
He likes a bit of a rant. When we talk about the house he owns at the foot of the South Downs in West Sussex he says he's likely to sell it. 'The village there has lost its post office and I said, 'When they get rid of the pub, I'm off,' and they've turned it into a horrible wedding venue. It's a crime, isn't it?'
He's easy company; amusing, provocative and for all the privileges his exceptional talent has conferred, his early life was not plain sailing.
His father, John, a cellist, left his mother when Nigel was a baby, emigrating to Australia and returning later to become principal cellist with the Royal Philharmonic. His mum Scylla, a pianist, remarried when Nigel was a child and they moved from his native Brighton to Birmingham.
Nigel's stepfather, a doctor, was physically abusive to Scylla. 'As a small child I did jump on him and try to stop him once or twice, but it resulted in him chasing me round the house with a knife.
'It was a horrible thing.'
At the age of six he says he was subject 'to a form of abandonment' when he was sent away to the Yehudi Menuhin School in Surrey, having won a scholarship.
He was both precociously talented and determinedly single-minded. In his teens, while studying at the Juilliard School in New York, he was invited by jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli to perform with him at the city's Carnegie Hall.
He was told by his teachers that he would scupper his classical career if he did, but he defied them, with glorious results. And his challenging of convention and authority continued.
He recalls how he became the Punk Violinist by mistake when, flying from New York to perform a concerto at the Royal Festival Hall in London, he forgot his 'bat suit', as he calls it. Finding himself on a Sunday without the appropriate attire, he went to the only place that was open in the 1970s, Camden Market, 'and the only clothes I could get were punk stuff with chains and a gothic edge. I got all togged up for less than 50 quid'.
He has infuriated and entertained in equal measure ever since. Refusing to be pigeon-holed, he's performed with rock aristocracy: with Paul McCartney, The Who and Led Zeppelin; with Roy Wood of The Move and Deep Purple's Jon Lord.
Music snobs will always decry what they perceive as his philistinism. They have even, he says, disparaged him for playing Tchaikovsky.
'His music is looked down upon by some pseudo experts as being below top level, and this sets my bulls***ometer right off into the red,' he says.
'These pseuds try to discount this beautiful music because it has committed the cardinal crime of becoming phenomenally popular with classical audiences all around the world.'
He's off on a tirade again, inveighing against 'experts' who 'protect their status by pretending that something popular is s*** in order to appear as if they know more than us poor proletariat'.
'It seems that there's always an 'expert' on every subject, from global warming all the way to poor little music, portraying themselves as knowing better than us.
'But it's all hot air and no substance, reminiscent of the emperor and his new clothes.
'Mind you,' he adds as a coda, 'if we're to believe Greta et al, it won't be long before neither we nor the emperor will need any clothes.'

1831,"London (CNN Business)The threat by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to quit China after one of its stars, Peng Shuai, disappeared from public view, leaves at least two global brands watching anxiously to see how this will play out.Peng, a two-time former Grand Slam doubles champion, has vanished from the public eye since she accused former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex in a social media post on November 2 that was deleted within minutes. Concerns for her safety have grown after Chinese state media released a screenshot of an email, purportedly from Peng and sent to the WTA, walking back her allegations and claiming ""everything is fine.""In an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, WTA chief executive Steve Simon said the welfare of the player and the need for her allegations to be properly investigated were ""bigger than the business"" that the WTA has in China. ""We're definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it,"" Simon said.Two of the WTA's official partners — Porsche, owned by Volkswagen (VLKAF), and German software maker SAP (SAP) — may feel differently about putting their own business in the world's second biggest economy at risk by backing the association's stance on Peng.CNN Business has contacted both companies for comment. Neither has so far responded.The silence from the WTA's corporate partners contrasts with growing calls for China to conduct a full and transparent investigation into her allegations. The United Nations Human Rights office on Friday urged Beijing to provide proof of her wellbeing, and the German Olympic Sport Federation made a similar call.Whether the WTA will follow through on Simon's threat to pull the WTA out of China is unclear. But for now, its sponsors are ""caught in the middle,"" said Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute in London.""If they appear to back the WTA, the Chinese Communist Party and China will punish them in the Chinese market. If they don't, women in democracies may boycott their products,"" he told CNN Business.Porsche has been in China for more than 20 years, according to the company. In August, the luxury sports car brand said it would build a permanent research and development center in Shanghai to improve local Chinese product development, ""allowing a sustained focus on what is Porsche's biggest single market."" Porsche executive board chairman Oliver Blume said at the time: ""Having a permanent home for this work in China will bring obvious benefits, particularly when it comes to reflecting and predicting our customers' needs in China — a nation that has truly welcomed Porsche and taken our cars to heart to the extent that it's been our biggest sales market for six consecutive years."" SAP is also committed to China as part of its global sales strategy, with six corporate locations and five software labs in the country. Whoop, the fitness tracker maker, is also a WTA partner. CNN Business has contacted Whoop for comment.— Anna Cooban, Teele Rebane and Michelle Toh contributed to this story.",2
1832,"ON THE FACE of it there is little to separate the two towns. Cloppenburg, near the Dutch border, and Hoyerswerda, 40km from Poland, each has a population of 30,000-40,000. Both, say local officials, offer respite from the strains of urban life: cheap housing and plenty of kindergarten places, the shortage of which is a huge source of stress for metropolitan parents. Neither is near a big city; both offer visitors a friendly, somewhat sedate, face.
But the similarities end there. With one of Germany’s highest birth rates, Cloppenburg is growing at a steady clip, whereas Hoyerswerda has moved in the opposite direction. “This is a family-friendly region,” beams Johann Wimberg, Cloppenburg’s district administrator. “You can build a home here.” Hoyerswerda, a former coal-mining hub, lost half its population after reunification in 1990, largely to westward emigration. The district of Cloppenburg has grown by nearly 50%. Hoyerswerda’s “new” town (built during the communist era) is pockmarked by vacant plots on which GDR housing blocks once stood. Industrial parks on the outskirts of the town are half-empty.

Until a small, covid-induced decline last year, the German population rose steadily over the 2010s, reaching a record 83.2m in 2019. This was the result of high net immigration, running at an annual average of 400,000, mainly from southern and eastern Europe. Even the birth rate, long one of the lowest in the world, ticked up. But now a crunch looms. The birth rate peaked in 1964, and the baby-boomers are preparing to retire. In 2000 there were 26.5 over-60s for every 100 aged between 20 and 65. By 2025 this ratio will have shot up to 41.4. Immigration and labour-force participation rates aside, the working-age population will shrink by over 4m in the coming decade. Within the OECD club of mostly rich countries, only Italy and Japan have older populations.

Some parts of the country will do worse than others. Germany is no stranger to the town-and-country divide, but in some regions its economic structure mitigates against rural decline. Cloppenburg, like many small places, benefits from the success of “hidden champions”: the profusion of SMEs, often based in the middle of nowhere, that keep well-educated locals close to home. These Mittelstand firms, which often operate in specific niches, are a peculiar feature of the industrial landscape. The area round Cloppenburg also offers less salubrious work in the form of meat-processing plants, which attract transient eastern European workers.
Hoyerswerda has no such luck. This correspondent’s visit coincided with one from the Dresden branch of the Helmholtz Centre, which was considering where in the Lausitz region to locate a new research centre. Torsten Ruban-Zeh, the mayor and irrepressible cheerleader for his city, presented his vision of a vibrant, future-minded place ripe with opportunities for medical research and tourism. He noted that Hoyerswerda could not hope to hold on to the 200 or so students who leave its high-end Gymnasium for university each year, but needed prospects for the next tier of school-leavers, largely in technical work. The experts were not convinced; Hoyerswerda dropped out of the reckoning.
Parts of formerly communist East Germany face almost insurmountable demographic hurdles. Although people are no longer leaving for the west, so many of them did so after reunification (a net 1.74m by 2006), especially the educated young, that the demographic damage is now baked in. All five eastern states are older than all 11 western ones. If some “lighthouse” cities like Leipzig or Jena, on which state governments have showered attention, are muddling through, or better, it is a bleaker picture for smaller towns and the countryside.
Yet few regions are immune. By 2035 only 31 of Germany’s 401 Kreise (districts) will have a working-age population comparable to today’s, according to projections from the Berlin Institute for Population and Development. (The east will suffer disproportionately: 23 of its regions will lose one-fifth of their people.) The public sector is highly vulnerable: almost a third of government employees are due to retire in the next decade, according to Gerhard Hammerschmid at the Hertie School in Berlin.
Help from abroad
Immigration can help only so much. It has already slowed inside the EU, as eastern countries have their own demographic woes. In 2020 Germany modestly relaxed entry requirements for skilled workers from outside the EU. But as Johannes Vogel, a Free Democratic Party (FDP) MP, notes: “Every expert knows it won’t be enough.” The Federal Employment Agency reckons the country needs 400,000 immigrants a year to plug its skilled-labour gap.
The public-pension scheme is also threatened. Since 2007 the number of recipients has risen by more than 1m to above 21m, over a quarter of the population. The system sucks around €100bn a year from the federal budget, over 30% of total spending. A strong labour market and earlier incremental reforms, including a slow rise in the retirement age to 67 by 2031, have somewhat eased the situation. Uncertainty over growth and immigration make long-term predictions hazy. But the coming crunch is as clear as day.
What to do? The IMF calls for indexing the retirement age to life expectancy, as Denmark does. More likely are smaller tweaks, including increases in the contribution rate from today’s 18.6% of gross wages. Payments may have to fall, too: last year a pension committee suggested the ratio of average pensions to income would probably have to drop from 48% to 44% after 2025. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, adds: “It doesn’t seem very convincing to rule out changes to the retirement age while life expectancy continues to increase.” Failure to reform will only increase the burden on the federal budget, exposing the system to recessionary risks, notes Christian Dudel at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock.
Yet change will not be simple. Pension reforms do not, as a rule, inspire France-style mass protests. But an ageing electorate will not roll over easily, and in consensus-oriented Germany the government will need to prepare the ground carefully. In June politicians howled when advisers to the economy ministry warned that the state pension system could face serious financing problems as early as 2025. “My hope is that we start reform before it becomes a political battle in which many participants will be wounded,” says Steffen Kampeter, general manager of the BDA employers’ association. Four in five Germans think their state pensions will not be enough to live on in old age. It will fall to the next government to ease their fears.■

1833,"FIRST THE children lost their bedridden father. Then they lost their grief-stricken mother. Then they were left to fend for themselves in west Kabul. In normal times their plight would have been tragic. In today’s Afghanistan, where more than half the population is running short of food, it was deadly. Neighbours said they helped out with bread and water where they could, but it was not enough. Earlier this month the eight children starved to death. The youngest was less than two years old.
Afghanistan is on the brink of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, the UN said on October 25th, exceeding even the misery in Syria and Yemen. A new report from UN agencies estimates that some 23m of the country’s 38m people will not have enough food to get through the winter unless aid is rapidly scaled up.

The crisis has been a long time coming. Drought and war had already left many destitute. The fallout from covid-19 lockdowns squeezed household finances further. Since the Taliban took over the country in August, the economy has collapsed. The UN estimates that half the country was living on less than $1.90 a day when Kabul fell. By the middle of 2022, that may rise to 97%. “We’ve not seen this level of near universal poverty in any country in recent history,” said Kanni Wignaraja of the UN Development Programme on October 21st.
The immediate reason for the crisis is the loss of foreign aid, on which the Afghan economy previously depended. Before the Taliban took over the country received around $8.5bn a year, which was two-fifths of its GDP. Three-quarters of the government’s budget was paid for by foreign donors, including almost all of health and education. The central bank also relied on regular cash injections from abroad.
All that ended on August 15th, when the previous government fled the country. Aid payments were suspended and the country’s $9bn in foreign reserves was frozen to prevent the Taliban from getting their hands on it. The government’s hefty wage bill, which included salaries for 220,000 teachers, has since gone unpaid.
With no dollars being shipped in, the hard currency needed to purchase foreign goods has dried up. Fear of sanctions has largely halted transactions related to foreign trade in any case. Foreign correspondent banks, which provide currency exchange and help with money transfers, are cutting their links to Afghan banks. They worry that they will be punished for dealing with the new regime, many members of which are under UN sanctions. The currency is in free fall; basic necessities are scarce; inflation is rising.
Because much of the economy is informal, it is hard to know precisely how bad things are. Informal money transfers and the black market may be taking some of the strain. Yet many people are apparently unable to afford even bare necessities. Kabul residents have taken to selling their possessions by the roadside to buy food. The IMF estimates GDP may contract by 30% in the coming months.
There is little hope that things will get better soon. The Taliban, who this month somehow found the money to hold a reception celebrating their suicide-bombers, seem to have no plan to tackle the disaster other than to blame it on foreigners. Afghanistan’s former backers, meanwhile, are turning their attentions elsewhere. Despite pledges made at a recent donor conference in Geneva, aid plans are only one-third funded. Moreover, says Robert Mardini, the boss of the Red Cross, “no humanitarian organisation can...replace the economy of a country.”
Attitudes towards the regime, which shows little sign of keeping its promises to form an inclusive government or respect women’s rights, are hardening. Having allowed the Taliban to take over the country, Western leaders look set to observe its economic collapse from afar.■",1
1834,"THESE IMAGES show Betelgeuse, a star that marks one of Orion’s shoulders, as it was in January and December of 2019 and January and March of 2020. They were assembled from data collected in those months by the Very Large Telescope, an array of four instruments in northern Chile. Between November 2019 and March 2020 there was excitement among astronomers when a rapid dimming of this, the second-closest red supergiant to Earth, suggested that a supernova might be about to happen. Regrettably for those who enjoy watching notable astronomical phenomena, it did not, though one is expected within the next 100,000 years or so. Studying these images, as they write in Nature, Miguel Montargès of the Paris Observatory and his colleagues suggest the most likely cause of the diminution was a local cooling of part of the star’s southern hemisphere, associated with an ejection of mass. The much bigger ejection of mass that is a supernova will have to wait.

1835,"AN OVERWEIGHT WOMAN reaches for a takeaway. An older man struggles out of his seat. “Let’s face it, after the year we’ve had, many of us are carrying a few lockdown pounds,” says the voiceover. “Now’s the time to turn things around.” On the screen is a familiar logo to prompt people to action: three white letters, “NHS”, against a deep-blue background.
When the government wants something done, it invokes the health service. In the early days of covid-19 ministers urged people to “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”. In an attempt to get those contacted to follow instructions, the test-and-trace system was labelled “NHS test and trace” despite being a standalone outfit. The “Better Health” campaign, of which the TV ad is a part, is in fact run by a separate government body, Public Health England.

According to the database of WPP, a giant advertising agency, the health service is Britain’s strongest brand, beating the BBC and Amazon. Just like them, it has tight rules governing the use of its intellectual property. The logo, three decades old, must be Pantone 300 (or “NHS blue”). The font must be Frutiger. Imagery must “reflect the diversity of NHS patients, the public and staff”.
A study published by the health service in 2016 found that patients get “confused and unsettled by non-standard NHS branding”. They do not like other organisations employing the logo, worrying that this would “imply privatisation”. There was consternation when Islamic State set up the Islamic State Health Service, using similar imagery. So, too, when Brexiteers put the logo on the side of a bus, without permission, and promised the health service more cash.
During the pandemic, firms from Premier League football clubs to John Hurd’s Organic Watercress (“donate 1p to the NHS from every pack purchased”) have rushed to show solidarity by plastering their products with the logo.

1836,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. Among them is a piece offering a different view on reparations.
DRIVE SOUTH-EAST from Minneapolis for an hour and you come to the Prairie Island Indian reservation, home to one of Minnesota’s 11 federally recognised Native American tribes. The federal government built a dam in the 1930s, flooding the place. In the 1970s it allowed the construction of a nuclear-power plant. Despite these blots, on a rainy Wednesday afternoon Prairie Island is full of visitors. People have come from Minnesota and Wisconsin to play the slot machines and blackjack and poker tables at the Treasure Island casino, operated by the tribe.
The Native American story runs through Minnesota. The largest mass-execution in American history took place at Mankato, south-west of Minneapolis, when 38 Dakota tribesmen were hanged in 1862. Today a small memorial garden in Mankato has a bench inscribed “forgive everyone everything”. Native Americans also receive reparations. In most states they take the form of land, though it is often useless for farming or property development. But federally recognised tribes are not subject to state laws against casino gambling. So Native Americans with reservations near cities have a near monopoly over a lucrative industry. Yet gambling has been only a partial success. Native Americans still have lower life expectancy and educational attainment than any other group.

The federal government has made some attempts similarly to recompense African-Americans, but these efforts were either ineffective or withdrawn after meeting too much opposition. The unpopular attempt to redistribute land in the South after the abolition of slavery was soon suspended. From the 1960s, various schemes were tried to favour minority-owned businesses in government contracting. They have not made much difference. For private businesses, reserving jobs for people of one race is illegal. Affirmative action, which gives African-Americans favourable treatment in university admissions and federal contracting, is being litigated away, mainly because it tends to discriminate against Asian-Americans.
Yet the idea of paying reparations for slavery has moved from the fringe since 1989, when John Conyers, a Michigan congressman, first introduced a reparations bill in Congress. Mr Conyers persisted in every Congress until he retired. It was not until Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote an article in the Atlantic in 2014 that the idea became more mainstream among Democrats. In the party’s 2020 primary the leading contenders all supported reparations. Since he moved into the White House, Joe Biden has announced his support for studying the issue, which looks like a case of a politician signalling support for an idea without actually having to do anything to advance it.

Even if a reparations bill passed the House, which is unlikely, it would have no chance in the Senate. The idea, which is popular among upscale Democrats, has the support of only half of African-Americans. Practical questions, such as who should receive any payment and who should be obliged to contribute, remain formidable. The political backlash against a party that made a determined push for reparations from the federal government would be fierce. This has not stopped some towns and institutions from trying. Asheville in North Carolina, Evanston in Illinois and Georgetown University have all taken steps in this direction by acknowledging a moral responsibility for slavery and segregation.
Initiatives like this may be worthy, but they will not deal with disparities in income, wealth, education and housing. The reparations movement is driven by arguments about justice, but the economic arguments for it are weak. The bulk of the black-white wealth gap is accounted for not because white Americans have inherited far more than black Americans. It is caused by African-Americans having lower incomes which, compounded over time, lead to less wealth. A one-off reparations payment would not fix that.

1837,"ON THE KAMPALA skyline workers can watch their savings climb into the air. Pension Towers, an office complex financed by the state-run provident fund, will be one of Uganda’s tallest buildings. Work began in 2008 and has been marred by fatal accidents, corruption allegations and budget overruns. The skyscraper illustrates the growing size of African pension pots—and the challenge of investing that money usefully.
This is a strange problem to have. The African Development Bank reckons that the continent needs $130bn-170bn of infrastructure spending a year to bring roads, water, power and internet to its people. Businesses are crying out for capital. What little they get often comes from foreigners, who are quick to pack their bags when things get tough. There is no such risk with local pension funds, which collectively manage around $350bn of assets in sub-Saharan Africa, according to RisCura, an investment firm. And yet many local funds say they struggle to find places to invest.

Pension funds have grown impressively in recent decades, for diverse reasons. In South Africa the government pumped cash into the civil service pension scheme to allay members’ worries about losing benefits at the end of apartheid. Its successor, the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF), is the largest in Africa, with assets of about $110bn. In Nigeria a mandatory pension system was introduced in 2004, and funds’ combined assets have grown nine-fold over the past 15 years, to $31bn.
Pension schemes typically cover only the small fraction of Africans who have formal jobs. But they can still be big fish in small ponds. In Namibia, for example, the value of retirement fund assets is larger than the country’s annual GDP.

What to do with all that money? Consider the choices laid out by Richard Byarugaba, the managing director of Uganda’s National Social Security Fund. It already owns a third of the shares traded freely on the local stock exchange, where only 16 companies are listed. An alternative is property, like the ill-fated Pension Towers, but building things is much more complicated than just “pumping concrete in”, he notes. So 78% of the fund’s investment is in bonds and the like, mostly government debt (see chart). In Africa, unlike in rich regions, that yields high returns.
This reliance on government securities is typical of fund managers almost everywhere except South Africa, which has uniquely deep capital markets. The Public Investment Corporation, which manages the assets of the GEPF, puts 41% of its investment into listed equities, as well as 7% into an unlisted portfolio that has drawn scrutiny for alleged improprieties. Pension pots in Botswana and Namibia also invest an unusual amount in equities, often abroad. The Botswana Public Officers Pension Fund could buy up the entire national debt and still have money to spare. Moemedi Malindah, its chief executive, says it would like to invest more locally, but options are limited: it had so much trouble finding private-equity managers that it had to run a programme to create them.
Talk of diversifying into alternative assets runs ahead of reality. In Nigeria, for example, pension funds put just 0.5% of their assets into infrastructure. That is partly because fund managers find it hard to assess the prospects of greenfield projects with unproven cash flows, says Wale Okunrinboye of Sigma Pensions, one of the largest funds in the country. It is a similar story when fund managers look at private equity. “Some of them want to dip their toes in the water but they’re just scared,” says Abi Mustapha-Maduakor, the chief executive of the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, an industry body.
There are efforts to change that. In Kenya more than 20 pension funds have formed a consortium to invest in infrastructure, pooling their capacity to spot duds. Governments and foreign donors are thinking of ways to take on some of the risk by issuing guarantees.
The long-term investment horizons of pension funds dovetail with the need for “patient capital” to build a continent. Yet the first job of a pension-fund manager is to protect the savings of future pensioners. The kind of public-private partnerships they might invest in have had mixed outcomes in Africa. Until there is a track record of success, most will continue simply to lend to governments and let the politicians build the roads instead. ■
Clarification (October 1st 2021): This article has been amended to clarify the comments made by Wale Okunrinboye.",1
1838,"LOCK AND DAM 25 on the upper Mississippi River is testament to how good American infrastructure can be. Stretching nearly 1,300 feet (400 metres) across the water, the concrete-and-steel structure is a crucial link in the system that connects Midwestern fields to Southern ports and thence to Asian markets. Roughly 60% of America’s corn and soy exports pass through it every year. But it is almost 100 years old, and engineers wage a constant battle to keep it operational. It has the same capacity as when it was built, while boats have grown bigger. “How many highways built in the 1930s still have the same number of lanes now?” asks Andy Schimpf, a manager at the lock.
Salvation may be at hand. On November 5th the House of Representatives passed a five-year, $1trn bill to repair and upgrade America’s ageing infrastructure. About $2.5bn has been allocated to inland waterways, and Mr Schimpf is optimistic that some will go towards rebuilding Lock and Dam 25, doubling the size of its chamber. Today, workers sometimes need to break apart barges to get them through, and then reassemble them on the other side, which can take up to three hours. A bigger lock could reduce transit time to 30 minutes.

Hundreds of similarly delayed and neglected public projects around America will get a big boost from the infrastructure bill, which President Joe Biden will soon sign into law (it long ago passed the Senate). It includes $40bn of new funding for fixing bridges, the largest investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. There will be nearly $70bn for passenger rail, aimed both at clearing years-old maintenance backlogs and bringing service to new areas. Another $65bn should ensure that every American has access to high-speed internet. And the list goes on and on, from highways to airports and the electricity grid to water pipes.
For years American infrastructure has suffered from under-investment. It would take $2.6trn over the next decade to get it up to scratch, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), a professional body (albeit one with an interest in spending more). The bill will not fix everything. But it could be the beginning of a process that will make a real difference.
How big a difference? Roughly half the headline amount would have been expected as part of regularly budgeted maintenance, meaning that about $550bn actually constitutes new spending, to be disbursed over five years. That might not sound like much, but it is. From 2022 to 2026 federal infrastructure spending will rise from about 0.8% of annual GDP to 1.3%, well above the trend of the past four decades. Adie Tomer of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, says that is nearly the same average level as during the New Deal, which helped lift America’s fortunes after the Great Depression.
As a rough rule of thumb, an additional $100bn per year spent on infrastructure could boost growth by about a tenth of a percentage point when the digging actually begins, and potentially more if it catalyses additional private-sector investment, notes Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley, a bank. In the longer term, she estimates, a sustained expansion of infrastructure spending could support productivity and raise America’s potential growth by as much as a fifth of a percentage point, a big deal for a large, mature economy. “That’s why whenever you talk to economists, infrastructure is the stuff that we go to bed at night dreaming of,” says Ms Zentner.
Getting a positive return will, of course, require the money to be allocated well. Considering the shortfalls in investment over the years, it should not be hard to find good projects. On average a water main breaks every two minutes somewhere in America, while nearly half of all roads are in bad shape, according to the ASCE. In some cases the investments will not generate new growth so much as defend America’s existing strengths. Take the locks on the upper Mississippi: they help American soyabeans compete against Brazilian ones. Labour is much cheaper in Brazil, but transportation is better in America. Keeping the locks in good shape underpins that. “If you were to close any of them down for a few months, it would cost us billions of dollars,” says Steve Censky, CEO of the American Soybean Association.
Just about doubling the federal government’s expenditure on infrastructure overnight could lead to waste, however. Cost overruns often bedevil American infrastructure projects. It is more expensive to build rail in America than in almost any other country, according to Transit Costs Project, a research group. The price of building highways has also soared. That just about anyone can mount a legal challenge against public works in their vicinity is part of the problem, leading to delays and missed budgets. And the current backdrop is hardly propitious, with supply-chain congestion affecting even the most basic home-building projects.
On the positive side of the ledger, the bill creates space for private investors to join the government’s efforts, which could both enlarge total spending and impose more financial discipline. Any city or state seeking federal funding for transport projects costing more than $750m will be required to evaluate whether partnering with private-sector investors would deliver better results. Some projects, such as the development of the first-ever national network of chargers for electric vehicles, naturally lend themselves to co-operation with the private sector, given that is where the technology resides. The government also wants companies to pitch in to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change. Grant programmes, useful in attracting private investment in water systems, are likely to be expanded. “This bill can potentially create a framework for ongoing and necessary public and private investment in infrastructure,” says Aaron Bielenberg of McKinsey, a consultancy.
But a dose of scepticism is also useful. Ultimately, the amount that America spends on infrastructure is a direct result of the amount that Americans are willing to be taxed. And that, by the standards of other rich countries, is not very much. “Ten years from now, I think we will look back and say that this bill was a historic investment, a great expansion of investments that were neglected,” says Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and a former adviser to President Barack Obama. “But people are still going to be saying, well, why don’t we have high-speed rail all over the country?” Even so, better to fix roads, expand ports and lay broadband cables than not.■

1839,"DAVE PARKASH and his girlfriend were strolling down the street one evening in June when an irate man accosted them. Tan Boon Lee accused Mr Parkash of “preying” on his girlfriend, whom Mr Tan, a Chinese-Singaporean, believed was also Chinese, unlike Mr Parkash, who is ethnic Indian-Filipino. He urged the couple to date “people of our own race”. A video of the confrontation went viral and made Singaporeans uneasy. For the country is diverse—nearly three-quarters of Singapore’s residents are ethnic Chinese, 13.5% are Malay, and 9% Indian. It prides itself on how well everybody gets along.
Yet over the past few months several racist incidents have seized public attention. The rising tide of ugliness has provoked a reckoning over race—until recently a taboo subject—which has penetrated even the halls of power. After the episode involving Mr Parkash, a cabinet minister said he was “not so sure any more” that Singapore is “moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony”.

His comment caused a stir. The ruling party sees itself as the guardian of “racial harmony”. It stepped into that role in the 1960s, when deadly riots pitting Chinese against Malays threatened to destabilise the fledgling nation. The city-state’s founding fathers became convinced that they must intervene to defuse tensions. They criminalised racism and anything that would stir up hatred between the races, and designated Chinese, Tamil, English and Malay the four official languages.
They also began funnelling Singaporeans into four categories: Chinese, Malay, Indian or “Other”, depending on the race of their parents. The government was worried about racial enclaves forming in public housing, where some 80% of Singaporeans live. This classification system enabled it to set ethnic quotas in public housing and calibrate the racial make-up of Parliament and even, by controlling immigration, society as a whole.
On one level, the government’s assiduous management of race relations has worked. Racial violence is rare; so too is overt discrimination. Nine in ten Singaporeans surveyed in 2018 by the Institute of Policy Studies, a local think-tank, reported that the level of racial harmony in the city-state was moderate to very high.
Yet tensions between the races have simmered for decades. Chinese chauvinism has deep roots in Singapore, watered by Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister who remained influential until his death in 2015. He believed that Chinese were physically and mentally superior to Indians and Malays. He tried to make Chinese Singaporeans more Chinese, by encouraging people to speak Mandarin and insisting all ethnic Chinese study it at school (though almost all their parents spoke other dialects as their first language). The government opened numerous elite Chinese-medium schools, which were given much more government funding than other public schools. Mr Lee’s Sinicisation programme was intended for ethnic Chinese, but minorities felt pressure to espouse “Chinese” values too, according to Michael Barr, a historian of Singapore.
His successors tread more carefully. Yet they have sustained Chinese privilege. All three prime ministers since independence have been Chinese, and in 2019 a leading politician insisted that is unlikely to change because, he said, older generations are not ready for an ethnic-minority prime minister. The government regulates immigration to ensure that the racial make-up remains stable, which has the effect of maintaining ethnic-Chinese dominance.
For generations, Chinese Singaporeans have been told that they are special, says Mr Barr. “That element has been internalised by a lot of people,” including minorities. Sharvesh Leatchmanan, a 24-year-old student and co-founder of Minority Voices, a website, is ethnic Tamil but grew up wishing he were Chinese. “I changed the way I spoke, I changed the way I dressed, I never had Indian friends, I never spoke Tamil,” he says. He would tell new friends he was mixed-race “so I could say I was ethnically ambiguous, to be included”.
Mr Leatchmanan’s discomfort in his own skin stemmed in part from his experience of being discriminated against as a Tamil. Many minorities say they are treated unfairly. Almost half of Indians and a third of Malays surveyed in 2019 said they faced discrimination when renting a property. More than a third of Malays and Indians polled in 2018 encountered prejudice at work “sometimes” or “often”. Job adverts often solicit applications exclusively from people who speak Mandarin.
Malays, in particular, are marginalised. According to the census of 2020, just 11% went to university, compared with 35% of Chinese and 41% of Indians. The median Malay household income is S$5,700 ($4,200), compared with S$8,000 for Chinese and S$8,500 for Indians.
Stereotypes of Malays as lazy may play a role. In 2019 Peter Chew of James Cook University found that Chinese Singaporean undergraduates rated Malay job applicants as less competent than equally qualified Chinese applicants, and recommended lower salaries. Mr Lee believed that racial differences in performance at school were genetic—an attitude that has lingered, writes Cherian George, a Singaporean scholar at Hong Kong Baptist University.
The government admits that racial harmony is a work in progress but insists that it has protected minorities and improved their lot in life. They are guaranteed representation in Parliament and, periodically, the largely ceremonial presidency (the current occupant, Halimah Yacob, is of Indian and Malay descent). “Self-help” organisations—one for each race—assist needy members of their communities; these groups are chaired by cabinet ministers and partially funded by the government (the rest is paid with contributions automatically deducted from the monthly salaries of working adults). The current soul-searching over racism in itself is a sign of progress; such discussion was verboten until recently.
However, enthusiasm for celebrating cultural differences sometimes wanes where Malays are concerned. Malays share the same ethnicity and religion (Islam) as the majority races in Malaysia and Indonesia, neighbours with whom Singapore has sometimes had testy relations. Until 1977 Malays were excluded from serving in the military because Mr Lee doubted that their loyalty could be relied upon should they fight a war against Malaysia. Today Muslim women in certain public-sector jobs are not allowed to wear headscarves, though Sikh men in the same roles can wear turbans. A Malay-Muslim nurse wonders why this kind of discrimination is needed. She suffers spiritual turmoil each time she removes her veil before starting a shift: “I try to reassure myself that I’m not doing something wrong.”
Far from soothing racial inflammations, the government’s methods may exacerbate them. It is not just that its policies put Chinese on a pedestal. The racial classification system “encourages us to think along those communitarian lines,” says Laavanya Kathiravelu, a sociologist. The nurse, for example, sees herself not as Singaporean but as Malay. In a country where minorities feel belittled by the majority, that’s a recipe for discord, not harmony. ■",1
1840,"IN 1968 A GRAVE dating from about 1100 was uncovered near Hattula, in Finland. Little remained of the occupant’s skeleton, but the inhumation included two swords and a sheathed knife. Such grave goods would normally suggest said occupant was a man. The skeleton was, however, also adorned with brooches and woollen clothing of types more usually worn at the time by women. This led to speculation that the burial was actually of a powerful woman, possibly a local ruler in her own right rather than just the wife of a male monarch.
This would be noteworthy enough. But a re-examination of the remains, just published in the European Journal of Archaeology by Ulla Moilanen of the University of Turku and Elina Salmela of the University of Helsinki, suggests the truth may be yet more intriguing. Ms Moilanen and Dr Salmela suspect that the individual in question may have had outward characteristics of both a man and a woman.

In 1968 working out the sex of a skeleton in an ancient grave was tricky. After years of deterioration, the bones of men and women look pretty-much alike. But that was before the use of DNA became possible. So Ms Moilanen and Dr Salmela thought it worth trying again.
Most people have two sex chromosomes: XX in women and XY in men. Find DNA from a Y-chromosome in a skeleton and the chances are the body in question was male. And, looking at a fragment of femur brought to her by Ms Moilanen, who is the archaeologist in the collaboration, Dr Salmela, who is the geneticist, did indeed find such DNA. But not much of it. That led her to wonder about contamination, but also to consider whether the individual in the grave had had an extra X-chromosome that was swamping the signal from the Y.
Having an anomalous number of sex chromosomes is rare, but not vanishingly so. The particular combination XXY leads to what is known as Klinefelter’s syndrome. People with this karyotype are male, but may have small genitals and reduced body hair. Some also develop breasts, a female secondary sexual characteristic, during puberty.
To determine the occupant’s karyotype from the meagre amount of DNA available, Dr Salmela drew comparisons with living people. The grave yielded 8,329 sequenceable fragments, so she used a computer to draw samples of similar size from the genomes of living people with various karyotypes, including XXY, and also from mixtures of both sexes, to mimic contamination. She then compared these with the DNA from the grave and concluded it was 99.75% probable the individual concerned had indeed had Klinefelter’s syndrome.
While Dr Salmela was working all this out, Ms Moilanen and her team had another look at the grave. They confirmed that it was a high-status burial. For instance, they discovered traces of feathers below the spot where the skull had been, hinting that the deceased individual’s head had rested on a feather pillow. They also found evidence of fine furs, probably from foxes.
Clearly, this was a venerated human being, but what led to that veneration in a world then dominated by masculine values is a matter of speculation. Perhaps the person in question came from a family powerful enough for such things not to matter. But perhaps those who did not fit easily into sexual categories nevertheless had honoured roles in society. Across the Gulf of Bothnia in Sweden a near-contemporary grave found last century contained a man buried in women’s clothes and jewels, but otherwise with masculine grave goods. Stereotyping can work in many ways. And one is to accept, unthinkingly, modern stereotypes about the past. ■

1841,"WHEN INDIA set off a nuclear bomb in the desert of Rajasthan in 1974, describing it implausibly as a “peaceful nuclear explosion”, a young Pakistani metallurgist in the Netherlands was ready to volunteer his services to his own country. A few months later, Abdul Qadeer Khan was sitting down with the prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and explaining the possibilities of spinning uranium in centrifuges to make it usable in bombs. The “man makes sense”, noted Bhutto. Within a decade, Pakistan had the ability to build and test a nuclear bomb; in 1998 it did so, following a series of Indian tests.
In later years Mr Khan and his acolytes would cast this moment as if it were Albert Einstein writing to Roosevelt, revealing the secrets of the atom. “A country which could not make sewing needles, good bicycles or even ordinary durable metalled roads was embarking on one of the latest and most difficult technologies,” Mr Khan recalled. In fact Pakistan, humiliated and dismembered by India in the war over Bangladesh in 1971, had begun pursuing nuclear weapons long before.

But Mr Khan’s knack for self-promotion was such that it was he—and not Munir Ahmad Khan, a rival nuclear physicist—who got much of the glory. After AQ Khan’s death on October 10th, at the age of 85, Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister (the three were unrelated, though all of Pushtun origin), declared him a “national icon”. He was buried with full honours.
For Western spies, though, Mr Khan’s sin was not so much vainglory as entrepreneurship. He had been under surveillance for years when he left the Netherlands in 1975 with stolen blueprints for centrifuges and details of the companies that supplied their components. In the years that followed, Mr Khan sold this information first to Iran and later to North Korea—which provided missile technology in return—and Libya. He sold a Chinese bomb design to Libya for tens of millions of dollars and offered it to Iraq, too. Where this money went remains unclear, though an investigation by Pakistan’s National Accountability Bureau found that Mr Khan owned several houses and had $8m in bank accounts in Pakistan, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
This black market was the biggest and most advanced network of nuclear proliferation ever built. Its full extent remains unclear to this day. Mr Khan had travelled to at least 18 countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria. The CIA believed that Osama bin Laden himself had sent envoys to Mr Khan, although these approaches were thought to have been rebuffed.
It was Mr Khan’s dealings with Libya’s dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, that were his undoing. The CIA, increasingly worried about the prospect of jihadists getting their hands on a nuke, had penetrated a Malaysian factory in Mr Khan’s network. When it sent centrifuge parts to Libya in late 2003, spies tracked the shipment and had it diverted to Italy, where the incriminating equipment was impounded. Libya came clean and its nascent nuclear programme was dismantled. In February 2004 Mr Khan appeared on Pakistani television and admitted to “unauthorised proliferation activities”. It was, he said, an “error of judgment”.
Pakistani officials professed themselves shocked that their prize scientist—the only double recipient of the Nishan-e-Imtiaz, the country’s highest civilian award—had been up to such mischief. Mr Khan, who spent years under de facto house arrest, said he took “full responsibility”. Yet the idea that he had run an international nuclear cartel for over a decade and meanwhile acquired a lavish lifestyle, all without the country’s powerful armed forces noticing, strained credulity.
In an interview in 2008, Mr Khan, in disgrace internationally but still a national hero, whose name was affixed to schools and hospitals, came close to recanting his admission of sole responsibility and hinted that he had covered for others. “I saved the country for the first time when I made Pakistan a nuclear nation,” he boasted, “and saved it again when I confessed and took the whole blame on myself.”",1
1842,"The opponents of Binyamin Netanyahu reached an agreement that would end his 12-year stretch as prime minister of Israel. Under the deal, Naftali Bennett, the leader of a nationalist party, would become prime minister, serving for two years before handing over to Yair Lapid, a centrist and secularist. The Knesset still must pass a vote of confidence in the new coalition, which includes an Arab-Israeli party. That leaves time for Mr Netanyahu to try to pick off its right-wing supporters.

The Democratic Republic of Congo said that 32 of its MPs had died of covid-19. The reported total for the entire country of 80m is only 786 deaths. So either MPs are very unlucky or there is massive undercounting among less prominent folk, and a far worse pandemic than official numbers admit.
Iran’s largest navy vessel (in terms of tonnage) sank after catching fire in the Gulf of Oman during a training mission. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. The navy said it started in one of the ship’s systems.
A cargo ship carrying chemicals and plastic pellets sank off the coast of Sri Lanka, near Colombo. The X-Press Pearl had been on fire for two weeks. Its sinking will exacerbate an unfolding maritime disaster: hundreds of tonnes of fuel could escape from its tanks to add to the tonnes of plastic already finding their way onto local beaches.
China’s ruling Politburo said the country’s two-children-per-couple rule would be changed to a three-child one. The government, which once tried to force people to have fewer babies, now wants them to have more, to stop the population from ageing so fast. Parents who want a third child rejoiced, but the vast majority do not. Demographers predicted that the birth rate would not rise much.
Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s foreign minister, said his country would summon China’s ambassador, after 16 Chinese air-force planes were seen approaching Malaysia’s airspace over the South China Sea, where the countries’ territorial claims overlap. The foreign ministry described the incident as a “serious threat to national sovereignty”. Chinese officials described the flights as “routine”.
A Chinese blogger, Qiu Ziming, was sentenced to eight months in prison for “picking quarrels and causing trouble”. His offence related to his posts suggesting that China had under-reported the number of its soldiers killed in border clashes with India last year.

It was the first big protest against the president since the start of the pandemic. Mr Bolsonaro’s approval ratings have plummeted; he is up for re-election next year.
Mr Bolsonaro agreed that covid-embattled Brazil could step in at the last minute and host the Copa América football tournament, which starts on June 13th. Surging infections in Argentina and protests in Colombia have caused both countries to withdraw as co-hosts. Critics fretted that cheering fans will turn the matches into superspreading events.

And it suggested the document would raise yet more of its own questions - but this time about the leadership of under-fire Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick. 
David Spencer, research director at the centre, told MailOnline: 'Plenty of people are of the view that police priorities tend to be the wellbeing of criminals rather than the law abiding public and this will go some way to reinforce that perception.
'It is also quite simply treating trained police officers like children and is hugely patronising to the vast majority of police officers who are arresting potentially dangerous suspects every single day.
'Most arrests will not give police the luxury of considering 44 questions before apprehending a suspect. They are working on instinct and applying their training and this is where such questions should be, and are, drummed into them.
'It is difficult to imagine how Cressida Dick’s time as Commissioner could get much more embarrassing for the Met, but this policy is certainly doing its best. 
'There are already serious question marks about whether Cressida Dick is the right person to be leading the Met and proclamations like this are only going to undermine her authority still further.' 
The policy on handcuffing tells officers to ask themselves 44 questions before arresting a suspect and details the procedure in a child-style ABC guide. 
Its mammoth decision process is laid out in full in the new 25-page document published by Scotland Yard.
It puts into official policy nearly 50 questions officers should consider when they are using the police-issue restraints.
The questions include, 'What could go wrong (and what could go well)?', 'What is happening?', and, 'What do I not know?'.
Other advice to mull over also includes, 'Do I need to take action immediately?' and 'What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?' 
Most are from the College of Policing's National Decision Model but are now enshrined in the official equipment policy. 
It is not clear what the Met's previous policy on the police restraint tactic had been.
But the new rules have been drawn up after complaints from the black community they had been disproportionately targeted in stop and search.  
1. Is what I am considering consistent with the Code of Ethics?
2. What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?
3. What does the police service expect of me in this situation?
4. Is this action or decision likely to reflect positively on my professionalism and policing generally?
5. Could I explain my action or decision in public?
6. What is happening?
7. What do I know so far?
8. What do I not know?
9. What further information (or intelligence) do I want/need at this moment?
10. Do I need to take action immediately?
11. Do I need to seek more information?
12. What could go wrong (and what could go well)?
13. What is causing the situation?
14. How probable is the risk of harm?
15. How serious would it be?
16. Is that level of risk acceptable?
17. Is this a situation for the police alone to deal with?
18. Am I the appropriate person to deal with this?
19. What am I trying to achieve?
20. Will my action resolve the situation?
21. What police powers might be required?
22. Is there any national guidance covering this type of situation?
23. Do any local organisational policies or guidelines apply?
24. What legislation might apply?
25. Is there any research evidence?
26. If decision makers have to account for their decisions, will they be able to say they were proportionate, legitimate, necessary and ethical?
27. Reasonable in the circumstances facing them at the time? 
28. Does anyone else need to know what you have decided?
29. What happened as a result of your decision?
30. Was it what you wanted or expected to happen? 
31. How were the principles and standards of professional behaviour demonstrated during the situation?
32. What information or intelligence was available?
33. What factors (potential benefits and harms) were assessed?
34. What threat and risk assessment methods were used (if any)?
35. Was a working strategy developed and was it appropriate?
36. Were there any powers, policies and legislation that should have been considered? 
37. If policy was not followed, was this reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances?
38. How were feasible options identified and assessed?
39. Were decisions proportionate, legitimate, necessary and ethical?
40. Were decisions reasonable in the circumstances facing the decision maker?
41. Were decisions communicated effectively?
42. Were decisions and the rationale for them recorded as appropriate?
43. Were decisions monitored and reassessed where necessary?
44. What lessons can be learnt from the outcomes and how the decisions were made? 
Also featured is an alphabet-themed guide to handcuffing that warns to, 'Always ask the suspect if the cuffs are too tight'.
It includes the advice to 'always double-lock the handcuffs'. 
The Met publicised the new policy yesterday morning, which came after a review by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist. 
Industry insiders and former police officers have slammed the alphabet-style guide, with former Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley warning it was indicative of the 'weakness of senior police leadership'.
He told GB News: 'Frankly, it's an example of the ineptitude, the pusillanimous, the weakness of decision-making that we now see with senior police leadership.
'Police officers, when they decide to use force or apply handcuffs, need to run through in their mind a lot of different things which comes down to: ""Is this the right thing to be doing, and can I defend my options?""
 'What we've now see happen is something that's going to affect three groups of people. 
'First, it is going to put off the cops using force or arresting people. There's nothing more difficult than trying to get some officers to deal with confrontation.
'It's very easy to back down. The hard thing is to motivate a police officer to be nosy. 
'The second thing is, the public are going to think: ""What on earth is going on here?""
'The third point really is that those who are ""baddies"", it's going to give them an opportunity for an outer.'  
Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said of the force's new policy: 'My number one priority remains tackling violent crime and keeping people safe from street crime – which is blighting the lives of too many young people.
'Alongside that, I have set out to increase the trust and confidence of communities in their police service.
'We know that not all communities have the same level of trust in us – I am determined to change that.
'The handcuffing review could not have taken place effectively without the input and contribution of many front line police officers and members of the public. I thank them all for their time, effort and valuable honesty.' 
The policy follows a review commissioned by the Met Commissioner Cressida Dick in 2019 into the use of handcuffs before an arrest has taken place.
It came after complaints from black communities they were being disproportionately targeted.
The Met said the review would make sure the tactic, for which there is a sound legal basis in some circumstances, was justified and recorded on each occasion.
It fed in consultation responses from young black men aged between 16 to 25 years-old.
A Met spokeswoman said: 'The launch of the policy, which covers all aspects of the use of handcuffs, is the final recommendation from the 2020 review to be implemented.
'Officers are already receiving additional legal training, more public and personal safety training, with further emphasis on de-escalation; and more community input to understand the respective experiences of the public and police officers during encounters on the streets of London.' 
Last October a highly criticial review of the Met's use of stop and search powers has revealed officers stopped two black men after they were seen 'fist bumping,'.
The review by the Independent Office for Police Conduct revealed the officers thought the pair had just completed a drug deal, in one of a number of issues raised by the watchdog.
It found handcuffs were used in nearly all instances where other tactics could have de-escalated an encounter, while officers also failed to use bodycam video from the outset of their interaction with some members of the public.
The IOPC said their review 'mirrors concerns,' already raised by communities in the Capital.
Regional director Sal Naseem said: 'We saw a lack of understanding from officers about why their actions were perceived to be discriminatory.'",3
1844,"NEGOTIATIONS ON THE Northern Ireland protocol are deadlocked. To avert a hard north-south border with Ireland, it keeps the province (though not Great Britain) in the EU’s single market for goods. But protecting the single market means customs controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea. The European Commission has offered to simplify these controls a great deal, but Britain insists on a total rewrite of the protocol to remove most checks and the authority of the European Court of Justice (ECJ)—demands that the commission has no authority even to discuss.
Diplomats now expect the British government to trigger Article 16 of the protocol within weeks. This permits unilateral “safeguard” measures if the protocol creates “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties” or diversion of trade. The government says this condition is clearly met, entitling it to invoke Article 16 and take corrective steps. It is seeking fresh legal advice to justify the move.

The EU is preparing to respond to what officials have termed the nuclear option. The impact depends on what happens next. The EU can take “rebalancing” measures, but if Boris Johnson’s government merely extends grace periods for importing chilled foods or plants to Northern Ireland, it may result in little more than lengthy court proceedings. However, if Britain overrides the provisions on customs and the single market, and writes out the ECJ, the EU would respond more forcefully to what it would deem a disproportionate and illegal breach of the treaty.
Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, has suggested that the EU would react by terminating the entire Brexit trade deal. Catherine Barnard, a Cambridge academic who is deputy director of UK in a Changing Europe, a think-tank, says this can be done without offering any reason, but with 12 months’ notice. Many in Brussels claim that formal moves to terminate the deal would be certain to follow the invocation of Article 16—though such warnings are aimed, in part, at discouraging Mr Johnson from pursuing the nuclear option.
This would all take some months. Meanwhile the British government may hope to show that the checks supposedly required to stop leakage into the single market are otiose. Mij Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, says this prospect makes many in the EU keen to retaliate more quickly. Possibilities include tariffs on fish and many food exports, as well as on whisky. Britain is not in an easy position to retaliate as it has not yet imposed checks on goods imported from the EU.
Fears of an immediate trade war may be exaggerated. More likely is the opening of tricky negotiations that could last for much of 2022. The protocol would remain formally in place, if not fully applied. The result would be continuing uncertainty for businesses on both sides of the Irish border. Although polls find a majority in the province want the protocol to be maintained if it can be improved, the recent rancour has polarised opinion: most unionists are now against keeping it in any form.
The biggest risk is that, under the threat of terminating the trade deal, Mr Johnson may revert to his atavistic preference for no deal. His team is fostering the delusion that he was forced to accept the protocol by pro-European MPs who tied his hands in the Brexit talks, and by the ineptitude of his predecessor, Theresa May. This skates over the fact that Mr Johnson himself chose to create the border in the Irish Sea, which Mrs May once said no British prime minister could ever accept. He then railroaded the Brexit deal through with the huge majority he won at the end of 2019.
The revived spectre of no deal would be bad for Britain’s fragile economy. But with his popularity dipping amid a sleaze scandal, Mr Johnson may find fighting with the EU politically attractive, even if it casts doubt on his claim to have got Brexit done. Labour’s leader, Sir Keir Starmer, will find it hard to work out a way to respond to such a scenario. And experience has shown that when it comes to Brexit, politics trumps economics—on all sides.■

1845,"Much of America’s Pacific north-west and Canada’s west coast baked in a heatwave. Police in Vancouver reported more than 130 sudden deaths, most of them old people or those with underlying conditions. The extreme temperatures were caused by a phenomenon known as a “heat dome”, in which an area of high pressure in the atmosphere stops air escaping.
President Joe Biden backed down over his claim that he would not sign a bipartisan infrastructure bill worth roughly $1trn unless it was accompanied by more expansive provisions off the Democratic party’s wishlist, such as tax increases. Mr Biden had tied the two together after striking a deal with a group of senators from both sides last week, riling Republicans.

Florida’s governor declared an emergency after a beach-front condominium building in Surfside, a suburb of Miami, collapsed. At least 18 people have died and almost 150 are missing. A study published last year charted subsidence in the ground beneath the building in the 1990s.
Donald Rumsfeld died at the age of 88. The Republican served twice as America’s defence secretary, under Presidents Gerald Ford and George W. Bush. He was instrumental in the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and bore much of the criticism when it led to violent insurgency and sectarian strife.
A high-ranking official at Brazil’s health ministry was fired after being accused of asking for a bribe in negotiations over the AstraZeneca covid-19 vaccine. A whistleblower also denounced alleged irregularities in a contract for the Indian-made Covaxin. The vaccine, which has yet to be approved by a Western regulator, cost Brazil more per dose than any other and was acquired by a third-party firm. President Jair Bolsonaro denied wrongdoing. The health ministry suspended the contract.
Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that sections of a law which prohibit recreational use of marijuana were unconstitutional, in another step towards narrow legalisation. When a bill currently in parliament is enacted, those who want to smoke the drug recreationally, or grow plants at home, would be able to apply for a permit. The sale of cannabis would continue to be illegal; Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the president, has called the idea of a legal market “immoral”.
America carried out air strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon said the militias had conducted drone strikes against Americans in Iraq.
Yair Lapid, Israel’s foreign minister, became the highest-ranking Israeli official to visit the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since the countries signed a historic deal to normalise relations last year. Mr Lapid inaugurated Israel’s embassy in the UAE, saying: “We’re here to stay.”
South Africa’s highest court sentenced Jacob Zuma, a former president, to 15 months in prison for ignoring legal summons and impugning judges. His time in the dock is not over; he is also accused of taking bribes from a French arms company while he was deputy president.
Sudan’s reform-minded government said it would send the former president, Omar al-Bashir, to the International Criminal Court ( ICC) at The Hague after a local trial. The ICC has accused him of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity said to have been committed in the Darfur region in 2003.
The second round of France’s local elections were a disappointment for Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party. She had high hopes that the party would for the first time take control of one of the regional governments, in the south. But other parties teamed up against her candidates, who lost. President Emmanuel Macron’s La République en Marche also failed to win any regions.
Britain and the European Union agreed a truce in the “sausage war”. They delayed for three months a ban on some British meat products being sold in  Northern Ireland, a consequence of the post-Brexit arrangement which in effect keeps the province in the EU’s single market and customs union.
The military junta in  Myanmar released nearly 2,300 people who had been locked up for protesting against the army’s coup. Some activists and journalists critical of the regime were also released. No reason was given for the move, but the junta may be trying to temper popular ire. A cross-section of society has joined the protests.
India’s government, which is seeking more control of online content, piled pressure on Twitter. In the latest of many twists, the social-media company was accused of treason for carrying a map that placed territory claimed by India outside its borders.
The Chinese Communist Party celebrated its 100th birthday. To mark the occasion, the party’s leader, Xi Jinping, appeared in front of 70,000 people at Tiananmen Square. He waxed lyrical about how the party had transformed China for the better, and promised that the party would never allow the country to be bullied, oppressed or subjugated.
Coronavirus briefs

Australia’s states closed their borders as new clusters of the Delta variant emerged across the country. Around 80% of Australians are now living under restrictions and their “travel bubble” with New Zealand has been suspended. Just 5% of the population has been vaccinated.
Mixing different covid-19 vaccines could boost immunity against the coronavirus, according to researchers at Oxford University. A shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine four weeks after one of Oxford-AstraZeneca’s, and vice versa, produced a high level of antibodies.
Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, dismissed senior officials for “incompetence and irresponsibility” related to pandemic prevention. Mr Kim did not admit that there had been a covid-19 outbreak in his country. Last week North Korea again told the World Health Organisation that it had recorded no cases.",1
1846,"FOR THE first time in more than a year, this month small groups of children with their backpacks and chatter have trooped into some schools in Mexico City. It is a cautious re-opening. It is up to schools whether or not they open, and only a minority have chosen to do so. Only part of the class attends each day. The same goes for 18 of Mexico’s 31 other states; in the others all schools remain shut. With the pandemic far from over, caution may be understandable. But among the living, children continue to be among its principal victims, in Mexico and across Latin America.
The region has been hit especially hard by covid-19 in three ways. With 8% of the world’s population it has suffered around a third of officially recorded deaths from covid-19 (and many more unrecorded ones). Its economies contracted by an average of 7% last year, worse than the world as a whole. Much less discussed is that Latin America’s schools have stayed shut for longer than those in any other region. The effects will be felt long after the pandemic is over and economies have recovered.

Schools closed nearly everywhere in the region in March 2020 and many have remained shut ever since. They are fully open only in six smaller countries. Some countries, such as Argentina and Colombia, began opening their schools earlier this year only to close them again as they suffered a second wave of the pandemic.
The prolonged loss of learning will make dismal educational standards worse. The PISA international tests of 15-year-olds in 2018 found that in reading, maths and science, Latin American participants were on average three years behind their peers in the OECD group of mainly rich countries. With schools closed for 13 months, the World Bank reckons that some 77% of students would be below the minimum performance for their age, up from 55% in 2018. This has long-term effects. Even if only ten months of classes are missed, the bank reckons that the average student could lose the equivalent of $24,000 in earnings over his or her lifetime. The poorest, those in rural areas, and girls are most affected by the school shutdown, aggravating Latin America’s already wide inequalities.
Many Latin American countries have made big efforts to organise distance learning during the pandemic. But a sizeable minority of schools lack internet access for teaching purposes. Whereas 98% of the richest fifth of students in the region have internet at home, just 45% of the poorest do. In Brazil mobile phones offer the only internet access for over 60% of black and indigenous students. Many governments are using traditional channels, such as television, radio and printed materials. Mexico has offered distance learning by these means for 25m pupils.
This is no substitute for face-to-face teaching. “Not all students learn at the same pace,” says Marco Fernández, an educational specialist at Monterrey Tech, a university in Mexico. “They can’t ask questions or get feedback as they would in the classroom.” Beyond the loss of learning, school closures have brought emotional costs and a big increase in the number dropping out.
Schools in many countries in other regions re-opened months ago, with social distancing, testing and thorough cleaning. Apart from the severity of the pandemic, there are several reasons this hasn’t happened in Latin America. Parents have generally not been keen. In Mexico, until most people are vaccinated “we think that unfortunately the conditions don’t exist for a massive return to school,” argues Luis Solís of the National Union of Parents, a voluntary group. Teachers’ unions have been reluctant, too. In Argentina when the mayor of Buenos Aires tried to re-open schools in March he was opposed both by the union and the national government, its ally. “There’s no pressure” on governments to re-open, laments Mr Fernández.
Governments could do much more to promote safe re-opening, through information and consultation. “By now all countries should at least have made a substantial effort to open schools,” says Emanuela Di Gropello of the World Bank. “We are not where we should be.” Catching up will be a formidable challenge. Schools need quickly to assess each pupil’s level, organise remedial teaching, and make up lost time with Saturday classes and longer terms. This will take money as well as effort. Many governments have spent more on health care and emergency aid to families and firms during the pandemic. Education should be an equal priority if Latin America is not to fail a whole generation.",1
1847,"WHEN TINSLEE LEWIS was ten months old, doctors said that the treatment keeping her alive was causing her pain and should cease. Born with grave heart and lung conditions that surgery could not ease, she had no prospect of getting better, they said. Her family disagreed. Nearly two years and several court judgments later, Tinslee remains on life support in a hospital in Texas. In April the hospital, requesting that a court’s final ruling, expected in January, should be brought forward, described how the child’s body had been “ravaged” by invasive treatments. Her mother countered that the two-year-old, who is heavily sedated but conscious, had shown some signs of improvement.
This battle is about more than the suffering of a child, her family and those who care for her. Texas Right to Life, a pro-life group that is funding the Lewises’ legal fight, hopes it will result in the overturning of a state law designed to protect doctors’ right to withhold what is known as “futile” or “non-beneficial” care. The law allows doctors to see if another hospital will accept the patient and, if that fails, to stop treatment after ten days.

Yet the questions this case raises, about how clashes between doctors who want to discontinue care and patients’ families who want to continue it should be adjudicated, are familiar to doctors in hospitals across America. Many say that such conflicts are happening more often.
Robert Truog, a paediatric intensive-care doctor at Boston Children’s Hospital and the director of Harvard Medical School’s Centre for Bioethics, says advances in medical technology mean it is “very hard to die in a modern ICU [intensive-care unit] these days”. This can make it harder for families to accept that there is no chance a fatally ill patient will recover. Their hopes, he says, are often bolstered by experimental treatments discovered online. A decade ago there used to be one or two patients a year being kept alive against doctors’ judgment in Dr Truog’s ICU; now there are two or three at any time. “Families are increasingly likely to go to the courts. Doctors don’t want to be all over social media, so they increasingly choose the path of least resistance.”
Such conflicts affect patients of all ages. In recent years a rapid increase in the use of extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation machines, which keep patients alive when their heart or lungs (or both) do not work, has meant that relatives are more likely to push for continued treatment.
The combination of mighty life-support systems with religious belief—or the plain power of grief—can create big problems for hospitals. Thaddeus Pope, a bioethicist and professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Minnesota, says the influence of vitalism, which holds that life must be preserved at all costs, has meant that a growing number of brain-dead patients are kept in hospital. And “doctors definitely do not want dead patients in their hospital”, he says.
Such cases can cause enormous distress to medical staff, especially the nurses who care for patients hourly. Even washing and feeding someone who cannot feel a thing can cause anguish to a person who is trained to heal. Tending to conscious patients in a way that causes suffering but no benefit can inflict an intolerable strain. The most recent court filing from the hospital where Tinslee Lewis has spent her life describes how the nurses who change her nappy first apologise, “in hopes she will understand that the torturous exercise she is undergoing is not their choice”.
Providing futile medical care can create other problems. It can delay other patients’ admittance to intensive-care units. Though the hospital says its staff do not consider the financial cost of keeping Tinslee alive, her care, paid for by Medicaid, has cost more than $24m, according to the hospital’s most recent court filing.
In any health-care system that prioritises the expertise of doctors and the wishes of patients’ families, clashes about the end of life are inevitable. Drawing up policies that make them less likely may be more difficult in a decentralised health system. Texas is one of three states, along with California and Virginia, which has legislation giving doctors more power to withdraw care without consent. Others have passed laws that prohibit this.
Common to all disputes is the fact that once doctors have established that further treatment is futile, the decision about what happens next is as much a moral judgment as a medical one. “The life she has may not be a life we would want for our children, but we don’t get to make that decision,” says John Seago, legislative director of Texas Right to Life. “The hospital is making a moral decision. She is alive, that means the care is not futile.” He says the Texas law gives hospitals too much power.
Wishing and hoping
Other pro-life groups disagree, arguing that prolonging the process of dying is antithetical to their beliefs. Such organisations were involved in drawing up the Texas law in 1999, in the belief that it would bring timely resolution to excruciating conflicts. The row has exposed an unusual rift among pro-life groups, which tend to present a unified front on abortion. Kyleen Wright, the president of Texans for Life, says that antiabortionists’ defence of the law has allowed them to build links with progressive lawmakers that would otherwise be unthinkable.
The battle over Tinslee may dissuade other states from introducing such legislation. Yet other improvements to the system are possible. Many are critical of the role played by the hospital ethics committees that weigh in on such conflicts. Because their members tend to be employed by hospitals, there are concerns they may do their bidding. Independent panels, appointed by the states, could offer more reassurance to grieving relatives.
In the case of adults, advanced directives can help. Patients tend to be less enthusiastic about life-sustaining interventions than families or guardians are. “People don’t want the guilt that may follow the decision that treatment should be withdrawn,” says Mr Pope.
Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones. Arif Kamal, a palliative-care expert at Duke University, says involving people who are trained to talk about death “beyond the clinical details” can help reconcile families to what doctors are telling them. Once a disagreement arises this, unfortunately, becomes a lot less likely.■",1
1848,"“IT’S LIKE TASERING an elderly person who’s already on a pacemaker,” says a British newspaper boss of the newsprint market, where prices have risen by over 50% in a matter of months. The cost of paper that feeds into presses around the world is rising to record highs, pushing up expenses for newspapers from Mumbai to Sydney. When times were good, before ads shifted online, newspapers had a supportive partnership with paper mills. As ads departed and circulations fell, relations became more transactional. They are now at the shouting stage.
Paper mills had the worst of it for years as newspapers reduced pagination, went wholly digital or shut for good. The papers were able to hammer down the cost of newsprint from firms fighting for business as demand declined. Price-taking paper mills suffered in silence. Many hesitated to shut massive machines costing hundreds of millions of dollars.

That hesitance has disappeared; mills are taking out newsprint capacity and diversifying. Norske Skog, a Norwegian pulp and paper firm, said in June it would close its 66-year-old Tasman Mill in New Zealand, for example. Many mills are converting machines to make packaging for e-commerce. UPM, a Finnish firm, announced this year the sale of its Shotton newsprint mill in Wales to a Turkish maker of containerboard and packaging. For JCS Volga, a Russian mill, newsprint used to account for 70% of production; now half of what it makes is packaging. The mills “moved from being price takers to being capable co-participants in a declining market,” says Tim Woods of IndustryEdge, a research firm for Australia and New Zealand’s forestry and paper industries.
The pandemic, with people working from home, meant even fewer newspaper purchases, which depressed demand for newsprint again and increased the pain for paper suppliers. In the past 24 months European mills have responded by shutting almost a fifth of their newsprint capacity, says a buyer for a large British newspaper group.
Then economies reopened. Newsprint demand shot up. That, combined with much reduced capacity and coupled with soaring energy prices, has resulted in a price shock. Particularly controversial are energy surcharges that some paper suppliers are seeking to pass on. Newspaper firms reckon this amounts to breaking contracts. European newspapers will have to pay newsprint prices that are 50-70% higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared with the year before. As for their counterparts in Asia and Oceania, they are facing prices around 25% to 45% above their usual level. Kenya’s Nation Media Group is paying around $840 per tonne, compared with $600 at most in the past, says Dorine Ogolo, a procurement manager at the firm. North American prices went up earlier, and more gradually; contracts are fixed monthly rather than half-yearly. But there, too, newsprint prices are 20-30% higher in 2021 than in 2020.
Germany’s print and media industry association has warned that mills are going to force newspapers to dump paper editions, hurting each other in the process. “It’s about the famous branch that both of them are sitting on,” it said recently. But mills can sell packaging instead. “We’re not going to save the publishing industry by being unprofitable ourselves,” says a mill executive in North America.
For some publishers, price rises will wipe out profits. They will need to do further restructuring involving axing titles and layoffs. Iwan Le Moine of EMGE, a British paper-industry consultancy, expects a big increase in 2022 of the number of papers that shut compared with a typical year. That will lower demand and nudge the market back towards equilibrium. But newspapers will have more hard conversations about paper, full stop, says Douglas McCabe of Enders Analysis, a research firm. More digital adrenaline is one possible riposte to the paper mills’ tasers. ■

1849,"A CROWD of reporters and Hollywood types, drawn by the drama and glamour of the event, are likely to jostle to find a seat in a courtroom in San Jose on August 31st for what may be the next, perilous act for a woman once touted as the next Steve Jobs and the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire. Jury selection will begin for the fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the former chief executive of Theranos, a startup which attempted to revolutionise the process of blood testing but failed spectacularly in 2016 after the press and regulators probed the company’s inflated claims. 
These sorts of cases usually hinge on subtle distinctions between exaggeration and outright deceit and whether such deceit was intentional. But the legal intricacies may take second place to theatrics. Will Ms Holmes take the stand in her own defence, a move fraught with risk under the spotlight of cross-examination? Will she claim “coercive control” by her second-in-command at Theranos, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, with whom she had an “abusive intimate-partner relationship”, according to a filing by Ms Holmes’s lawyer ordered for release by a judge on August 26th? Mr Balwani will be tried separately in January; he has denied Ms Holmes’s claims.

But first will come the question of whether any juror can be found in Silicon Valley without preconceptions of guilt. Around half of the potential pool has acknowledged exposure to press coverage of the case. That is hardly a surprise. The story of Ms Holmes, who founded the company in 2003 as a 19-year-old university dropout, is an epic of Valley hubris. She brought glamour and charisma to the corporate world, adorning magazine covers as the subject of flattering features within. Her relentless promotion of her firm’s  potential led to a valuation of $9bn in 2015 before its spectacular demise. The firms’ investors ignored its flawed financial performance and the dubious quality of the device it was developing, and were drawn instead by the company’s idealistic goal of making testing cheap, easy and ubiquitous.

The attention lavished on Theranos seemed justified for a time. In 2015, Joe Biden, then America’s vice-president, called Theranos, “the laboratory of the future”. The company’s board included two former secretaries of state (George Schultz and Henry Kissinger), two of defence (James Mattis and William Perry), a former head of the Centres for Disease Control and David Boies, perhaps the country’s most famous lawyer. Two huge  American companies, Safeway and Walgreens, agreed to distribute Ms Holmes’s products. The awareness grew with the company’s abrupt failure in 2016. Multiple books and television documentaries shone more light on Ms Holmes. 
A TV mini-series and a film is now reportedly in the works. ABC News will bring back a popular podcast about Ms Holmes that will focus on the trial. In many ways, such coverage is not justified by the facts of the case. Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani are accused of lying to investors, patients and doctors about the effectiveness of Theranos’s tests. But Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists are well used to over-hyped plans, though most never see the light of day. Failure rates among tech startups are high, though most do not lose as much as the $700m or so that had been invested in Theranos. 
The buzz over Theranos stems from more than money. Because it was involved in health care rather than, say, enterprise software or co-working facilities, any mistake could have had catastrophic consequences for a patient. The inability of Theranos to deliver on its promises was also a disappointment to those who had seen it as a way for science to improve lives.  Most controversially, the case resonates because Ms Holmes looked like a woman succeeding in a male-dominated world. Her failure, say some female company founders in Silicon Valley, has made life tougher. The issue will become more prominent if Ms Holmes is convicted and sentenced to jail as in July she gave birth to her first child. That could make for a mini-series with a heart-rending finale.",1
1850,"IN OCTOBER 2019 more than a million Chileans took to the streets to demand greater equality and better public services. At least 30 people died in protests that lasted for weeks. To restore calm, Chile’s leaders increased social spending and agreed to a process to rewrite the constitution adopted under Augusto Pinochet, a dictator who ruled from 1973 to 1990. Members of a constitutional convention elected in May this year, many of them leftists and political neophytes, have begun drafting a charter that could transform the country.
Until recently it looked likely that Chile would elect a new president who shares the protesters’ goals. For months Gabriel Boric, a 35-year old former student leader allied with the Communist Party, was the front-runner in a presidential election whose first round takes place on November 21st. (Legislative and regional elections are also scheduled for that day.) Now it seems that the presidential race will be a hard-fought contest between him and a candidate of the far right, José Antonio Kast, who has surged in the polls. A champion of “liberty, the rule of law and the family”, Mr Kast would preserve Pinochet’s low-tax economic model and restore his social conservatism. “Boric represents the demands that gave rise to the protests. But Kast represents what happened two years after, which is that people want peace, order and security,” says Roberto Izikson, the head of Cadem, a polling company.

The summoning of the constitutional convention did not end the upheaval, as Chileans had hoped. On October 18th protesters marked the second anniversary of the demonstrations with more violence. Two people died and hundreds were arrested. Last month the government also declared a state of emergency in southern Chile in response to arson attacks, mostly against logging companies, by some Mapuches, an indigenous group seeking greater autonomy in its ancestral lands. This allows the government to send in the army. On November 9th it extended the emergency after a video appeared on social media that showed heavily armed, hooded men threatening to boot the army out. To many, a rise in immigration looks hardly less menacing.

Having demanded a new constitution, some Chileans have misgivings. They worry that it will enshrine obligations that the state cannot afford, fuelling inflation, which has recently risen sharply. The constitution may declare Chile to be a “plurinational” state, giving indigenous groups more influence. Trust in the convention fell after the revelation that a far-left member had lied about having cancer, which was a central theme of his campaign. One poll shows that its approval rating has dropped by almost 15 percentage points since July (though it remains more popular than other political institutions).
Mr Boric would put the presidential palace on the side of the protesters and their allies in the constitutional convention. He would scrap the model for public services introduced by the Pinochet regime, which gives private providers a large role. He would forgive all student debt, abolish private pension funds and make public transport free and green. Children as young as 14 would be able to change their gender on documents; schools would be equipped with condom dispensers; “at least” 1% of jobs in the public sector would be reserved for trans people. Mr Boric would raise taxes by a massive eight percentage points of GDP in as few as six years.
There are more moderate candidates among the seven running for the presidency, notably Sebastián Sichel on the centre-right and Yasna Provoste on the centre-left. But they have so far failed to prosper. Slammed for left-wing looniness, Mr Boric himself has become more moderate. He no longer favours an amnesty for illegal immigrants or a requirement that half the members of corporate boards must be workers. But his Communist allies will impede his move to the centre. Although Mr Boric criticised violence on the anniversary of the protests, some of his coalition partners joined the rally.
This gives an opening to Mr Kast, whose remedy for Chile’s woes mixes nationalism, law and order and proposals to slash taxes and regulation. A lawyer who broke with an established party to found his own Republican Party (echoing the name of Donald Trump’s), he proposes to dig ditches on Chile’s northern border to deter undocumented migrants and establish an agency modelled on the United States’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mr Kast denounces the protesters of 2019 as vandals. He wants to beef up the government’s powers during states of emergency. This month he provoked a furore by comparing Pinochet favourably with Nicaragua’s left-wing strongman, Daniel Ortega. (He says his comments were taken out of context.)
A devout Catholic and father of nine children, Mr Kast opposes legalising same-sex marriage and wants to ban abortion (which is legal only in very few cases). Most of all, he opposes the unsettling changes that the protests threaten to bring about. “We’re not going to transform anything radically,” his manifesto declares. If he wins, he may clash with the architects of the new constitution.
There is much in Mr Kast’s conservatism to put voters off. Elderly and low-income voters, who make up his base, like his line on law and order but may be less enthusiastic than he is to restrict the state’s role in providing public services. But he has been deft in persuading hesitant voters that he is not such a scary guy. He puts out self-deprecating TikTok videos. In an interview with a gay leftist YouTuber he jovially rolled a condom onto a banana.
“These elections are the hardest to predict since the return to democracy,” says Carmen Le Foulon, the head of polling at the Centre of Public Studies, a think-tank. After trouncing his opponents in the first two debates Mr Kast faltered in the third, on November 15th. His rivals laid into him for downplaying Pinochet’s crimes, for opposing gay marriage and for sending mixed signals on whether his government would build coal-fired power plants. Mr Kast’s charm deserted him.
That gives new hope to Mr Boric, and perhaps to one of the more moderate candidates. A lot depends on young voters, who were an important factor in the referendum last year that endorsed the rewriting of the constitution. They are likely to favour Mr Boric and Ms Provoste. If those two go to the second round in December, the protesters’ agenda will have survived the backlash they provoked. ■",1
1851,"WHEN “SQUID GAME” appeared on Netflix in mid-September, many South Korean reviewers were underwhelmed by the home-grown survival drama. They found the characters clichéd, the plot unconvincing and the violence gratuitous. The whole thing, they complained, was too similar to older films, such as the Japanese “Battle Royale”, and added nothing new to the survival genre, notwithstanding the striking set designs and star-studded cast. “Even though every genre has its clichés, too much in ‘Squid Game’ reminds you of every other movie you’ve ever seen,” complained one critic.
“Squid Game”, which takes its name from a common Korean schoolyard game, follows a group of debt-ridden losers, including an unemployed gambling addict, a North Korean refugee and a Pakistani migrant worker. Dressed in green tracksuits evoking those worn by Korean pupils during school sports and policed by shadowy supervisors in black masks and hot-pink jumpsuits, they fight for a nearly $40m prize—and their lives—in violent versions of traditional Korean children’s games. Rich spectators in embroidered robes watch from a VIP lounge filled with exotic plants and crystal chandeliers. Hwang Dong-hyuk, the director, says the show is an allegory about modern capitalism.

“Squid Game” has taken the world by storm. It is currently the most-streamed show on Netflix in all but a handful of the company’s markets. It has entered mainstream cultural consciousness, spawning millions of videos on TikTok, thousands of memes and dozens of earnest articles dissecting the show’s meaning. Cafés all over the world have started selling their own takes on dalgona, a Korean candy featured in one episode. In Paris fights broke out as fans tried to force their way into a pop-up shop where visitors could pose with staff dressed like the pink-suited enforcers from the show.
The brutality of the competition has also rung true for ordinary South Koreans struggling with unaffordable housing and a sluggish labour market. Politicians have begun referring to the show when attacking opponents. Yet after a brief spell at the top of the Korean Netflix charts, “Squid Game” has been overtaken by “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha”, a saccharine K-drama.
The global craze has prompted bemusement in South Korea. “Nobody around me understands the global hype, and neither do I,” says In-young, a 26-year-old from Seoul who stopped watching after a couple of episodes because it disturbed her to see her childhood games depicted as a brutal struggle for survival. One Korean critic speculates that the combination of violent entertainment with a very on-trend critique of capitalism explains the show’s appeal to Western audiences, who are used to such themes from American productions such as “The Hunger Games”, set in a dystopian world of grave social injustice.
No doubt the hypnotic geometry of the design, the lush costumes and eminently meme-able stills also help—as does Netflix’s strategy of dubbing and subtitling its productions in dozens of languages. That had already created hits such as “Lupin”, a French thriller with an underlying theme of social injustice, which the Korean show is likely to dethrone as the company’s most successful non-English production.
The embrace of “Squid Game” is a reflection of South Korea’s outsize cultural power on the global stage. It may also have benefited from following in the footsteps of “Parasite”, a film about—what else—social injustice, which won the Oscar for best picture in 2020. But most of all, it shows that, like love and money, complaints about inequality have no language.",1
1852,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",0
1853,"TAKE A ROAD trip to Indianapolis, home to a certain two-and-a-half-mile race track, and you will find yourself in good company. A survey carried out before the pandemic found that about 85% of local commuters drive to work, alone. Standing on a bridge over 38th Street, which runs by the state fairground, you cannot escape the roar of six lanes of petrol-fired traffic below—and, reports a local, this is quiet compared with the noise on pre-virus days. Getting Americans to kick their addiction to fossil fuels will require many of these drivers to find another way of getting to work, and to move on from the flaming hydrocarbons celebrated each May at the city’s famous oval.
Joe Biden hopes to use what looks like a narrow window of Democratic control of Congress to encourage this transition. The last time lawmakers came close to writing climate legislation on anything like this scale was in 2009, when the Waxman-Markey bill, which would have established a trading system for greenhouse-gas emissions, was passed by the House. Since then, a Democratic White House has tried to nudge America to reduce emissions, by issuing new regulations, and a Republican White House has tried to undo them. That record illustrates what a delicate political operation this is.

Yet despite having a much weaker grip on Congress than Barack Obama had in the first year of his presidency, Mr Biden and his legislative allies have put forward a sweeping set of proposals for decarbonising America’s economy. These would promote everything from clean energy on the grid and electric vehicles on the road, to union jobs making green technologies and measures for left-behind communities.
Were this wish list passed in its entirety, which is unlikely, it would give a boost to Mr Biden’s pledge to reduce America’s emissions by roughly half from their 2005 level by 2030. A chart released by the office of Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s majority leader, suggests that implementing all of these provisions could reduce America’s emissions by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030, thus achieving almost all of Mr Biden’s goal of cutting them by roughly half in that period (see chart 1). Passing a law, even a less expansive one, would allow Mr Biden to travel to the UN climate summit in Glasgow in November representing a country that is making progress towards internationally agreed goals, rather than asking for the patience of poorer, less technologically sophisticated countries while America sorts itself out.

Some of the Democratic proposals are in an infrastructure bill with bipartisan support that spends $1trn over ten years. But most are in a budget bill disbursing $3.5trn (also over ten years) that, on account of Senate rules, can only pass through a partisan parliamentary manoeuvre known as reconciliation. This requires the assent of all 50 Democratic senators. The likeliest outcome is a compromise between Democratic progressives and moderates that yokes together the agreed infrastructure bill with a much slimmer version of the $3.5trn proposal. Yet it is possible that neither bill will become law.
This raises two questions. First, how good can a salami-sliced version of Mr Biden’s agenda, the result of a negotiation between 270 Democratic members of Congress each angling for their constituents’ interests, really be for the climate? Second, how bad would it be for America’s decarbonisation efforts if both bills fail?

Happily even reconciliation-lite could bring meaningful progress, if key bits of the current proposals survive the negotiations. Paul Bledsoe of the Progressive Policy Institute, a think-tank, is confident a deal “likely a bit under $2trn” will happen this month. Only a fraction of that spending will be on climate, because the bill also contains proposals to make the social safety-net more generous. The Rhodium Group, an analysis firm, reckons that just six proposals would cut emissions by nearly 1bn tonnes in 2030 compared with no new policies (see chart 2), about a sixth of America’s total net emissions per year. That is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from all cars and pickup trucks on American roads, or the emissions of Florida and Texas combined. The six include proposals related to “natural carbon removal” (from forests and soil), fossil fuels (making it more expensive to emit methane) and transport (a generous credit for buyers of electric cars).
Carrots beat sticks
The big prize, though, is the power sector. Two proposals for decarbonising the grid account for the lion’s share of likely emissions reductions: a new Clean Electricity Performance Programme (CEPP) and more mundane reforms to the tax credits received by clean energy. The CEPP has been touted by Mr Biden’s cabinet officials and leading progressives as a linchpin of the climate effort. It is loosely based on the mandatory clean-electricity standards imposed by over two dozen states which have successfully boosted adoption of low-carbon energy.
The CEPP is flawed in a couple of ways, though. Because it has to be primarily a fiscal measure in order to squeeze through the reconciliation process, it does not involve mandatory regulation—unlike those successful state energy standards. Rather, it uses (biggish) subsidies and (rather punier) penalty fees to try to nudge utilities to build more clean energy. It is politically vulnerable because it is unfriendly to natural gas and coal (unless they have expensive add-on kit to capture and store related emissions). That has incurred the hostility of Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents coal-rich West Virginia, without whose approval the bill will fail. Some influential utility companies with coal assets, including Ohio-based American Electric Power, do not like it either.
Despite the attention paid to it, CEPP is actually less potent as a greenhouse-gas slayer than those boring tax credits, which are less controversial because they do not overtly penalise coal or gas. Two energy veterans, one at a top renewables lobbying outfit and the other at a fossil-heavy utility, agree that the tax credits would sharply boost investment in low-carbon technologies. That is because they improve the current set-up by replacing stop-go uncertainty with a predictable long-term tax regime, and make tax breaks “refundable” rather than needing to be offset against tax liabilities, meaning even utilities that do not have such tax liabilities can enjoy them as freely as cash in the bank.
Thus the CEPP is overshadowing the real star proposal. The tax credits have “a huge impact potentially”, reckons Rhodium, accounting for over one-quarter of the greenhouse-gas emissions reductions in the legislation, at a cost of roughly $150bn over ten years. A former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) puts it bluntly: “Take the wind and solar tax credits at ten years if you had to choose—and let everything else go.”
What if Democrats fail, the negotiations fall apart and Mr Biden is left empty handed? That would be embarrassing. And it could make it difficult to pursue ambitious federal climate policies through Congress for years, just as the failure of Waxman-Markey in 2009 haunted lawmakers. However it would not mean America can do nothing at all about climate change.
First of all, as Mr Biden’s officials have already made clear, they stand ready to use regulations to push ahead on decarbonisation efforts, just as the Obama administration did. Last month the EPA issued rules cracking-down on emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, an especially powerful greenhouse gas. The administration also has plans for loan guarantees for energy innovations and for speeding-up approvals for offshore wind farms. Yet this is tinkering compared with the federal law being discussed, especially as new regulations are likely to encounter legal challenges.
Even if the federal government fails again, states and cities have climate policies too. Drawing on analysis funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, Leon Clarke of the University of Maryland calculates that decentralised policies emulating the current best efforts of states like California could achieve roughly one-quarter of Mr Biden’s objective. But this is a bad deal: such efforts would fall a long way short of the federal proposal in reducing emissions, and what reductions they achieve would be more expensive than if done at the federal level. Still, it is not nothing. Last month, Illinois passed the country’s boldest climate-change law. Democratic states such as New York and California have green policies, but Republican states such as Texas and Indiana have big wind industries too.
Although Mr Clarke says Congress has to act if America is to achieve Mr Biden’s targets, he believes that progress will continue even if Congress falters, because there is now a deeper sense of ownership of climate policy among local and state governments. “The Trump years really changed the way that subnationals in the US view climate action,” he says. “They can’t rely on the federal government.”
Change is happening in surprising places. Take that flyover in Indianapolis. The city’s officials have made it into a bike path that will be connected to 55 miles of commuter-friendly trails traversing the city. The city has allocated $100m for building a bus-rapid transit system, which is a cheap and efficient substitute for underground rail, with more such rapid bus lines on the cards. Bloated 38th Street will undergo a “lane diet” with car and lorry traffic yielding two lanes to the buses. Come back in a few years and the view from the bridge should be a bit quieter. ■

1854,"IT IS AN Instagram account to inspire envy. In one picture Ramon Abbas, a Nigerian who calls himself “Hushpuppi”, is leaning against a white Rolls-Royce. In another the Roller is purple. Lest his 2.5m followers think he is partial only to palatial British cars, other posts show him with a red Ferrari and sporting a red Chanel handbag or lounging in a private jet (pictured above).
Nowhere on Hushpuppi’s feed is there a picture showing him in handcuffs being led away by police in Dubai. Nor of the $40m in cash that they seized in raids on several apartments there before handing him over to America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to face charges of money-laundering and cybercrimes.

Few were surprised when they learned that Hushpuppi had pleaded guilty in April. But Nigerians were stunned on July 28th when court documents were unsealed implicating their most famous cop, Abba Kyari, who is known for tracking down and locking up kidnappers, of whom Nigeria has far too many. Mr Kyari is now himself wanted by the law, oddly enough for locking up one of Hushpuppi’s accomplices. In this case, though, it was not sleuthing that got Mr Kyari his man. The indictment alleges that Hushpuppi promised to pay him for the arrest.
The plot began, according to the indictment, with a wheeze to swindle $1.1m out of a businessman who wanted a loan to build a school in Qatar, by impersonating bankers and setting up a fake bank website. Of the money raked in, $230,000 was spent on a watch that was hand-delivered to Hushpuppi in Dubai.
But then the thieves fell out over the size of the cut going to Kelly Chibuzo Vincent, whose job it had been to set up the fake bank website. Feeling cheated, Mr Vincent called the businessman and told him of the scam. Hushpuppi, furious, allegedly offered the Nigerian detective money to arrest Mr Vincent and give him the “beating of his life”. Job done, Mr Kyari, a deputy commissioner of police, took photos of the arrested man and sent them as proof—along with details of a bank account into which payment could be made.
Mr Kyari insists he is innocent and said he arrested Mr Vincent only because he had threatened to kill members of Hushpuppi’s family in Nigeria. He denies accepting money. But an affidavit submitted by the FBI, backed up by messages between cop and fraudster, showed that Mr Kyari was told to hold Vincent until the scam was completed and that he had asked for a cut of the profits. Mr Kyari allegedly received some $20,000 for his role.
Unusually for an organisation that often overlooks wrongdoing by its officers, Nigeria’s police force has suspended Mr Kyari and opened an investigation. Nigerians gripe that cops are more likely to try to extort money from them than to respond to distress calls. In 2005 a former police chief, Tafa Balogun, pleaded guilty to money-laundering and was made to forfeit 16bn naira ($120m), several houses and a “jeep farm” with hundreds of pricey cars. Shortly after the seizures the recovered loot vanished and the houses and cars were auctioned off for peanuts to cronies, prompting parliamentarians to demand that Mike Okiro, Mr Balogun’s successor, account for the looted loot.
Mr Kyari’s indictment may not be the biggest scandal to hit the police. But it is demoralising for the public. His heroics in battling kidnappers had earned him a presidential medal of courage and made him unusually popular for a policeman. His fall would be a blow to the many who saw him as proof that a cop can rise to the top by working hard and staying clean. Perhaps he may have been too good to be true. ■",1
1855,"HOW DO PORCUPINES mate? Very carefully! An old joke, but one that applies even more forcefully to creatures with big, sharp teeth than it does to those with big, sharp spines. And few creatures have had teeth bigger and sharper than those of Tyrannosaurus rex.
How tyrannosaurs mated will never be known for sure. But Caleb Brown of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, in Alberta, Canada, thinks, as he describes in Paleobiology, that it might have involved what amounts to the ultimate in love-biting. Previous examinations of tyrannosaur skull bones have revealed scars that look as if they were delivered by other tyrannosaurs. Aware of the fact that many animal species bite one another during battles over access to mates, and sometimes even bite their mates during courtship (an endearment from which Homo sapiens is not exempt), he and his colleagues thought it worth looking at these bites in more detail.

They therefore tracked down every tyrannosaur skull fragment that they could lay their hands on—528 bones from 202 individuals. They identified 324 wounds grievous enough to have damaged the bones in question, but which also showed signs of healing, and thus indicated that they had not been fatal (which wounds inflicted during the mating fights and rituals of living species rarely are). Measuring the sizes and shapes of these wounds confirmed that they were probably tyrannosaur bites.
Tellingly, such bites seemed confined to older animals. Skull bones that clearly belonged to animals which were unlikely to have been sexually mature, of which the team obtained 18, showed no signs of having been bitten. Bites started to appear on the skulls of tyrannosaurs which were half the size of adults, with three of 17 such specimens (18%) showing relevant healed bites. In fully grown adults that proportion rose to 60%.
Nor were wounds distributed at random. They were, rather, concentrated around the centre and base of the lower jaw. This indicates they were inflicted from a particular, consistent posture. That, in turn, suggests the bites involved were part of a ritual. Whether this was ritual fighting between males for access to females or was part of the process by which males and females checked each other out in a search for suitable mates is impossible to determine—not least because no one has worked out a way to identify the sex of a tyrannosaur skull. What does seem clear, however, is that not all sharp-toothed dinosaurs behaved in this way. When Dr Brown and his colleagues looked at the skulls of smaller carnivorous dinosaurs like Velociraptor, they found no evidence of these animals biting each other’s faces.

1856,"THE “Project for Bringing About Perpetual Peace in Europe” did not receive rave reviews when published in 1713. Voltaire thought the author, the Abbot of Saint-Pierre, was deluded. “The peace…will no more be realised than among elephants, rhinoceroses, wolves, or dogs,” he wrote. Showing less understanding of nature than of politics, he added: “Carnivorous animals will always tear one another to pieces at the first opportunity.”
Over the years, European intellectuals queued up to give the work a kicking. Immanuel Kant poked holes in it. Rousseau labelled it naive. Frederick II of Prussia declared the plan “very practicable: all it lacks to be successful is the consent of all Europe and a few other such small details.” Yet skip forward three centuries and the plan is, more or less, in place as the European Union.

To understand the EU today, one could usefully turn to the works of the abbot, now largely forgotten outside academia. Glance between Saint-Pierre’s 18th-century blueprint and the EU as it stands, and they are strikingly similar. In both cases, European countries agree to club together, submit themselves to the rulings of a court and devise rules by means of a continental parliament. Both have a rotating presidency. Contributions to the budget are based on wealth. Saint-Pierre even called his scheme a “European union”. Only Saint-Pierre’s inclusion of long-defunct countries such as Venice and Savoy gives the game away.
At the heart of both schemes is a radical idea. Under Saint-Pierre’s plan, sovereigns would submit to a superior law, enforced by independent supranational institutions. Coming more than half a century before Americans kicked out the British and the French started decapitating kings, this was radical. Without such a principle, argued Saint-Pierre, sovereigns would be stuck in a Hobbesian nightmare of constant struggle. Judging by the intervening three centuries of on-and-off wars and failed attempts to unify the continent spelled out in Shane Weller’s recent “The idea of Europe: A Critical History”, Saint-Pierre was on to something.
The rule of law has made the latest crack at European integration a success. Whether mighty Germany or tiny Malta, all members of the modern EU agree to subject themselves to the rulings of the European Court of Justice and laws put forward by the European Commission. Fundamentally, it is down to trust, or rather the lack of it. One country does not always believe another will abide by the rules, so other institutions must enforce them. This makes recent challenges to the supremacy of EU law from judges in Germany and Poland, who have questioned the authority of the ECJ, so dangerous. What was true in 1713 is even more true now. Without a clear legal basis, things can fall apart.
Saint-Pierre had a subtle understanding of sovereignty, which still applies today. From one perspective, most enthusiastically put forward by Brexiters, pooling sovereignty weakens it. For Saint-Pierre, true sovereignty involved no longer fearing one’s neighbours, since insecurity makes independence an illusion. The same logic is at work in the EU. Small countries appreciate the EU because it protects them from the excesses of big countries. Take the euro. Rather than suffer monetary whiplash from a decision by the Bundesbank, small countries can give up their monetary independence in exchange for a modest say in a bigger project. Saint-Pierre knew that sacrificing sovereignty is sometimes the only way of saving it.
Likewise, criticism of the abbot’s plan holds true for the EU today. Rousseau was almost right when he argued that Saint-Pierre’s idea could come about only through violent means. It took two world wars for European leaders to abandon their objections to such a scheme. In the EU, things still go forward when things go wrong. A pandemic and the biggest recession in the club’s history were needed for Germany and other holdouts to agree to the club issuing common debt.
Even Saint-Pierre’s failings feel appropriate for an ancestor of the EU. The abbot was a clunky writer, on a par with Brussels’s best bloviators. Where Americans have “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, the EU has “concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity”. In an age when Europe’s fiercest intellects were forging the Enlightenment, Saint-Pierre was decidedly second-rate, littering his argument with factual errors. One academic labelled him a “genius of European idiocy”.
But the abbot fits squarely into the EU’s long tradition of grey men and women who ultimately succeed despite having first been written off. Jacques Delors was initially seen as a patsy of Paris and Bonn, yet managed to become the commission’s most illustrious leader, leaving behind the single market, a path to monetary union and a natty flag. Ursula von der Leyen, the current German chief of the commission, ended up in Brussels only after her domestic career had gone off track. Yet the commission has quietly become more powerful on her watch. Second-tier types have a way of succeeding in the EU.
Forgotten forebears
Given Saint-Pierre’s foresight, it is at first odd that he is so little known. Unfortunately, there is a tendency in Brussels to trace the history of European integration no further back than the bloodless, legal approach that took hold after 1945, points out Luuk van Middelaar, a Dutch historian. Attempts before that—whether in the shape of Napoleon or Hitler charging across Europe or more diplomatic efforts—are played down. This makes the history neater, but less honest. For a club that is obsessed with notions of “European values” this is disappointing. The EU is always keen to claim such noble ideals as democracy and the rule of law as distinctly European traits. But imperialism and totalitarianism have just as long a pedigree on the continent. Rather than deal with that history, the EU overlooks it. Forgetting about Saint-Pierre’s efforts is one consequence of that tendency to brush over a messy past. ■",1
1857,"IN THE FIELD of epidemiology, a “spillover” is a virus that has made the leap from one host species to another. The spillovers of most concern to people are those from other animals to Homo sapiens. These may then go on to create “zoonotic” human diseases—of which covid-19 is believed to be one (the original host of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been an as-yet-undetermined species of bat).
Such traffic can, however, run in two directions. For example, in 2020 the World Health Organisation reported that SARS-CoV-2 had spilled over in Denmark from human beings into farmed mink, and was thereafter transmitted from animal to animal to create a separate veterinary epidemic. And, earlier this month, a paper posted on BioRxiv, an electronic host for work that has not yet been peer reviewed, presented evidence that the virus is also circulating in white-tailed deer in North America, having presumably spilled over from people there. All of which is on top of reports suggesting that domestic pets, especially cats and dogs, can also pick up SARS-CoV-2—and in the case of cats at least, can then pass it on to others of their kind.

Spillovers of this sort are potentially serious, for two reasons. One is that they create viral reservoirs beyond the easy reach of medical science and monitoring. Even if there are no human cases of covid in an area, such animal reservoirs mean that SARS-CoV-2 may still be lurking, waiting to spill back into people. The other is that exposure to the immune systems of novel hosts may drive the evolution of new and (if they then do spill back) potentially threatening viral strains. The mink incident therefore led the governments of Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain to cull 18m animals and place strict lockdowns in regions around the fur farms concerned. Treating a wild population, such as white-tailed deer, in a similar way would be harder. But precautions are still possible. Raising awareness among those who interact with the deer, such as hunters, can do a lot.
These, though, are reactive approaches. A proactive one would try to establish which species are at greatest risk of becoming reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 before they actually do so. That would permit the monitoring of threats before they got out of hand. And, as she reports this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Barbara Han of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, an independent environmental-research organisation based in Millbrook, New York, thinks she has worked out a way to achieve this.
Hidden ACEs
Starting early in 2020, just after covid emerged, Dr Han and her colleagues focused their attention on ACE2, a cell-membrane protein that had been identified almost immediately as the virus’s point of entry. ACE2’s day job is to help regulate blood pressure, and most vertebrates have it in one form or another. The researchers wanted to determine in which other vertebrate species SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to bind as strongly to the local ACE2 receptors as it does to those in human beings. These would be candidates for the role of reservoirs.
To this end, they gathered molecular information about every version of ACE2 that they could get their hands on. Mostly, these were from mammals—142 species of them. They then used computer modelling of the interatomic forces involved to work out the strengths of the bonds likely to develop between SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein and each version of ACE2. As they expected, based on news that broke while they were conducting their work, the bond with mink ACE2 was particularly strong. They found a similarly strong affinity with ACE2 from white-tailed deer, long before reports of infections in that species emerged. Cats and dogs also showed up as being at risk—which reports then confirmed that they were. And gorillas and macaques, which have suffered a few cases in zoos, looked susceptible as well.
Useful as this information was, Dr Han was keen to look beyond these 142 species. To delve deeper, the team built a database of evolutionary traits shared by the species with the most vulnerable ACE2 receptors. This is a technique which has been used successfully in the past on rodents and bats, to assess their likelihood of acting as reservoirs for viruses including Ebola and Zika. It is based on the idea that particular proteins of species with similar physiologies and ways of life might be expected to evolve in similar ways.
The researchers studied everything they could—from breadth of diet, metabolic rate and age of sexual maturity to litter size, lifespan, geographical range and phylogenetic relationships—about more than 5,000 mammals for which little or no ACE2-receptor information was available. This enormous database completed, they fed the outcome into a machine-learning system that had been trained on the characteristics of the 142 species they had already examined. The result was the revelation of 540 species which seemed likely to have vulnerable ACE2 receptors and thus the potential to function as covid reservoirs.
Most primates were on this list—which, considering that people are primates too, was expected. Nor, given suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins, was the inclusion of 35 types of bat a surprise. Surprises, however, there were. Though the common house mouse does not look to be a risk, which is good news, two of its fellow rodents, the ricefield rat and the Malayan field rat, both do. Since these species are often preyed on by domestic cats, themselves now known to be covid-susceptible, that provides a route by which people might become infected.
Dozens of other species were also flagged up as potential reservoirs. These included red foxes and raccoon dogs—two creatures which, like mink, are sometimes farmed for fur—and white-lipped peccaries (pig-like creatures found in South and Central America) and nilgai (a large Asian antelope), both of which are farmed occasionally, and also hunted and eaten.

Among more widespread livestock, the species of most concern is the water buffalo. There are reckoned to be over 200m of these around the world, acting as both beasts of burden and sources of milk. And other frequently hunted animals, such as the duiker (another antelope), the warty pig and the mule deer were also reckoned vulnerable, together with some rarities, including two critically endangered antelopes, the addax and the scimitar-horned oryx (pictured below), which was once extinct in the wild and is only now being reintroduced. In these cases the threat is less to human beings than to the survival of the species concerned.
Paying the buffalo bill
The sheer range of species involved staggers Dr Han. “I never imagined that we would ever see a virus with such a high cross-species infection potential,” she says. “It appears that there are at least an order of magnitude more species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than any other zoonotic virus I can think of.”
Forewarned, however, is forearmed. And here there is perhaps a lesson on keeping the weapons in the arsenal sharp. One reason Dr Han’s study took so long from inception to publication is the disparate nature of the sources she needed to draw on. Scattered as they were around the world’s natural-history collections, assembling them took time. Many museums are now in the business of making their collections available electronically. To some, that might sound a low priority. Work like this suggests it is not. ■

1858,"OFFICIALS IN XINJIANG have always been suspicious of the distinctive cultural identity of ethnic Uyghurs. They worry that it may fuel separatist yearnings in the far-western region. But in 2014, as the authorities stepped up their campaign to crush terrorism there, the government still tolerated displays of pride in Uyghur culture. In October that year a new talent show, “The Voice of the Silk Road”, aired on state-owned Xinjiang Television. It featured songs in various styles, from pop and R to traditional muqam music with lyrics influenced by classical poetry. The judges mostly spoke in Uyghur.
When China began to open up in the late 1970s, after the death of Mao Zedong, Uyghur culture was allowed to flourish, as long as it avoided any hint of support for a separate Uyghur state. Uyghur writers produced poems and songs filled with universally familiar themes such as love and loss, but also conveying pride in their identity. They created innovative blends of muqam with rock and hip-hop that turned a few Uyghurs into household names in China. Songs in such styles were aired on “The Voice of the Silk Road”.

There was nothing politically edgy about the show. It was merely a regional adaptation of a national hit, “The Voice of China” (which is still running). But it fell victim to a security clampdown, launched in response to sporadic attacks by Uyghurs on Chinese belonging to the ethnic-Han majority. Since 2017 some of the show’s stars have disappeared into a vast new gulag in which more than 1m people, most of them Uyghurs, have been locked up.
Officials say the camps offer “vocational education” to help Uyghurs find better jobs and to curb their “extremist” tendencies. But many of those detained have shown no more sign of extremism than simply being devout Muslims. Often, as with those involved in “The Voice of the Silk Road”, their crime has been to show too much enthusiasm for Uyghur culture, not necessarily just Islam.
Those rounded up who were linked with the show include Zahirshah Ablimit, who came second in the competition of 2014, and Muhtar Bugra, a businessman and poet who was its financier and head producer. Both were eventually released. Still thought to be inside are Memetjan Abduqadir, another producer who is also an actor and singer, and Mekhmutjan Sidiq, the director of Xinjiang Television.
Uyghur groups in the West reckon that the four are among nearly 400 intellectuals and cultural figures who have been detained in the new camps, sent to regular prisons or who have otherwise disappeared since the clampdown began. Some are well known in the region: Perhat Tursun, a novelist and poet; Tashpolat Tiyip, the president of Xinjiang University; Rahile Dawut, a scholar of Uyghur folklore; and Ablajan Ayup, an actor and singer sometimes described as a Uyghur Justin Bieber. Others associated with Uyghur culture have been paraded on state television praising the virtues of the Communist Party or singing patriotic songs.
The chill had begun even before the airing of the first episode of “The Voice of the Silk Road”. In September 2014 Ilham Tohti, a revered academic with moderate political views, was sentenced to life in prison for separatism. Mr Tohti had maintained a website that hosted writing by Uyghur intellectuals on social and cultural issues. He had dared to call for more enlightened official treatment of his ethnic group.
Today the only Uyghur culture allowed in China is of a token kind, conforming to a stereotype endorsed by the party such as smiling Uyghurs wearing brightly coloured traditional costume, dancing in public squares and singing, often in Mandarin. On September 29th, at a side event during a meeting in New York of the UN General Assembly, Chinese diplomats showed a video of such performances. It was called “Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land”.
Uyghurs living in exile in the West have been waging a parallel campaign to keep their culture alive. It has involved airing the works of underground artists in Xinjiang whose songs and poems explore more politically risky themes such as oppression and alienation, says Mukaddas Mijit, a specialist in Uyghur music living in France. As repression has tightened, she says, the works of such musicians and poets have become increasingly suffused with lament and despair.
Some writing has even emerged from the camps, such as poetry by Abduqadir Jalalidin, an academic. His verses were memorised by other inmates who relayed them to the outside world. “In this forgotten place I have no lover’s touch”, one begins. “Each night brings darker dreams, I have no amulet / My life is all I ask, I have no other thirst / These silent thoughts torment, I have no way to hope.” The translation is by Joshua Freeman of Princeton University, a former student of his.
In 2022 a novel by Mr Tursun, one of the detained writers, will be published abroad in English. Called “The Backstreets”, it first appeared online, in Uyghur, in 2013. The surreal fable echoes Ralph Ellison’s classic novel “Invisible Man”, about a black American who does not feel fully seen (Mr Tursun was influenced by Ellison). On a street in Urumqi, Xinjiang’s capital, the narrator meets a man who vows to “chop” to death everyone in southern Xinjiang, a mostly Uyghur area. The man vanishes into the fog and the narrator muses: “I would always be the one he was going to chop, even though we didn’t know each other.”
Mr Tursun’s writings and links with other cultural personalities in Xinjiang may have led to his detention in 2018 and his reported jail term of 16 years. A public figure in Urumqi, his politics had once been officially acceptable. He had even criticised Uyghur ethno-nationalism.
But displays of loyalty to the party are no longer enough to keep people safe. In 2017 Shireli Eltekin, a famous singer, released “A Song for Leader Xi Jinping”, a paean to China’s president. It includes fawning lyrics such as: “You put light into the hearts of the people.” Uyghurs in exile were dismayed to hear a much-loved performer crooning for the regime. But one night in June he was taken away from his home in his pyjamas, says a family friend.
In 2018 “The Voice of the Silk Road” was discontinued.It returned last year, with changes. Introducing the new series, the host made approving remarks about building socialism in Xinjiang and loving the party. In this year’s competition, the first contestant to take to the stage sang a Uyghur-language song from the 1950s called “Leader Mao Zedong”. In the show’s early days, this would have been “unimaginable”, says Elise Anderson of the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington, an American ethnomusicologist who competed in the inaugural series of “The Voice of the Silk Road” in 2014.
Such popular entertainment used to suggest at least some official acceptance of Uyghur culture. Now it is evidence of its suppression. Ms Anderson worries that, inside China, “only a Potemkin version” may survive. ■

1859,"IN THE AFTERMATH of a mass shooting at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, two senators introduced a modest measure to require background checks on all gun sales. Out of 100 senators, 54 voted to move ahead with it. In almost every parliament in the world, such a majority would be enough to ensure passage. In the Senate it meant defeat.
The men who framed America’s constitution intended the Senate as a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority. Its present-day failure to pass bills supported by a majority of its members, though, was never any part of that original design. It is the result of what seems to have been a genuine error: a lack of fixed procedures for shutting down debate. That absence allowed minorities in the chamber to use various manoeuvres, most famously the filibuster, to block legislation a majority wishes to pass. Once onerous and used sparingly, subsequent changes to the rules have allowed these ruses to become routine, cost-free and all but ubiquitous. This has turned the Senate into the only legislative body in the world which requires a supermajority for ordinary business.


The ability to filibuster could be abolished by a simple majority vote. But neither party has chosen this route. Instead, as the filibuster has become more routine, frustrated majorities have carved out various exceptions. Now that Democrats find that their unified control of Washington is insufficient for enacting the sweeping agenda of the Biden administration, further exceptions seem possible. But some requirements for supermajorities seem certain to stay.
The room where it doesn’t happen
Few have put the case against supermajorities better than Alexander Hamilton, one of the framers of America’s constitution, who brought to the issue the impassioned frustration of one who had seen them in action. Reflecting on the way they had been used in the Congress created by the Articles of Confederation, he wrote in the Federalist Papers that “What at first sight may seem a remedy, is, in reality, a poison.” Rather than protecting minorities, as its supporters claimed, “its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.”
He and his fellow framers saw the case for supermajorities in circumstances of great consequence—the constitution requires them for convicting impeached officials, overriding presidential vetoes, ratifying treaties and enacting constitutional amendments. They could have also written them in for other matters. They did not.
The filibuster was only rendered possible at all by a parliamentary housekeeping accident. In 1805 Aaron Burr (who, as a service to musical theatre, had killed Hamilton in a duel the previous year) recommended removing from the Senate rulebook the motion used to force the end of debates: it was thought redundant. It was only a few decades later that John C. Calhoun, a senator for South Carolina, realised that the absence of such a rule meant that debate could defer a vote indefinitely. After the civil war, organised filibusters—the term, an anglicisation of the Dutch vrijbuiter, meaning mercenary or privateer, denotes the way in which the tactic overthrows the normal order—became a recognised tactic. But they were used only for matters of great importance.
Those 19th-century filibusters could run indefinitely. In 1917 the Senate created a way to cut them short: a “cloture” vote requiring a two-thirds majority (in 1975 this was reduced to three-fifths, which is 60 votes in today’s Senate). But a minority could still hold business hostage. And if it had enough votes to defeat a cloture motion it could block legislation.
The minority these rules ended up protecting was that of segregationists in the Senate. Their protection was achieved at the expense of the African-American minority in the country at large. From the end of the civil war to 1964 practically the only bills actually defeated by the filibuster were civil-rights legislation opposed by Southern Dixiecrats.

The filibuster has changed since then. The “two-track system” created in 1970 allows the majority leader to consider more than one piece of legislation at a time. This has stopped filibusters from derailing all business, but has also reduced the public cost paid for using the device. Now the threat of a filibuster (known as a “hold”) chills the progress of any bill that seems unlikely to muster the 60 votes needed for a cloture vote. Such threats are now quotidian (see chart 1). “You can make it more difficult to pass a bill than it has ever been before. And you can do so with near total anonymity,” says Adam Jentleson, whose time as deputy chief of staff to Harry Reid, the Senate Democrats’ leader through much of the 2000s and 2010s, led him to entitle his book on the filibuster “Kill Switch”.
Checks in a chequered history
The recent increase in filibustering has been a bipartisan achievement. Both parties, when in the minority, have driven it forward—a ratcheting-up which both parties, when in the majority, have decried. During the presidency of George W. Bush, Mr Reid’s Democrats started to use the filibuster routinely to block nominations for cabinet secretaries and federal judges. A frustrated Mitch McConnell, then the Republicans’ majority whip, openly mulled changing the rules to allow simple majority votes: “What Senate Republicans are simply trying to do is get us back to the procedure that operated quite nicely for 214 years.” But Republican senators under Mr McConnell’s leadership took up the baton with gusto during Barack Obama’s presidency—and Democrats under Mr Reid and his successor, Chuck Schumer, outdid them during the tenure of Donald Trump.
Senators seeking to justify the filibuster say that it is an incentive for bipartisanship in matters of substance. There may have been some merit to that argument when the parties had real ideological overlap, with a smattering of East Coast Republicans further to the left than some Southern Democrats. Those days are gone. The median Republican senator has moved a long way to the right (see chart 2), creating a polarised legislature well suited to a political landscape where animosity towards the other side trumps everything else.

What is more, control of the Senate now swings back and forth. Between 1933 and 1979, the Senate was led by Democrats for all but four years. Since 2000 it has changed hands five times. Put together these changes create “less incentive to share hands and jump over the cliff together” says Sarah Binder, a professor at George Washington University. The rewards for stymieing the majority in the hopes of retaking the gavel in the next election cycle look (rationally) enticing. In these circumstances the filibuster operates as a convenient tool of partisan struggles, not as a helpful stimulus towards dealmaking. The Senate certainly does not seem much more genial and conciliatory than the current House of Representatives, which has no such parliamentary faff.
As the filibuster has risen in use, so have threats to change the rules and impose simple majority votes (called “the nuclear option” in the overheated parlance of the day). In 2013 Mr Reid, then majority leader, launched a limited nuclear strike, eliminating the filibuster on presidential nominations other than those for the Supreme Court. Mr McConnell lamented this “power grab” as a “sad day in the history of the Senate”. But in 2017 the nukes flew again as Mr McConnell got rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court confirmations.
Why did he not go further? One reason is that in the 1970s the Senate created a limited exception to the filibuster: reconciliation, which allows a bill to pass the Senate if its provisions are aimed at changing spending and taxes. This means that tax cuts, like the appointment of conservative judges, are rendered filibuster-proof. If he could provide both those things Mr McConnell was content to do little else; his forbearance reflected shrewdness more than deference to senatorial norms.
The status quo is less pleasing to Democrats. Their plans for dramatic climate action and curtailing income inequality fit poorly with reconciliation, if at all. They are also well aware that the nature of the Senate makes Republican filibusters doubly minoritarian because the states they represent tend to be less populated. The 41 Republican senators needed to defeat a cloture motion could, in principle, represent just 23% of the population.
The process of shoehorning President Joe Biden's covid-19 relief bill through the reconciliation process (which forced the shedding of a long-sought increase to the federal minimum wage) underscores this painful state of affairs for progressives. The stillborn bill to reform the immigration system and create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, introduced at the insistence of the Biden administration, will be another expedition doomed to a dead end.
This has produced new enthusiasm for going fully nuclear. When Mr McConnell, now in the minority again, recently tried to force Mr Schumer to guarantee that the filibuster would not be tampered with, Mr Schumer demurred. Mr Biden—in the past very much a traditionalist on Senate procedure—has not flatly ruled out abolition. But in practice it seems off the table. Two moderate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have expressed their resistance to outright abolition in no uncertain terms. Pressed on the possibility by a reporter, Mr Manchin snapped back “Jesus Christ, what don’t you understand about ‘never’?”
This leaves only the option of a further carve-out. The likeliest immediate crisis point will be a new voting-rights bill with which Democrats hope to head off Republicans’ efforts to amend state election laws. Because voting rights have little budgetary effect, the measure could not pass using reconciliation. The hope of reformers is to force a carve-out for certain genres of critical legislation (beginning with civil and voting rights) and try to expand its remit over time.
Other reforms could temper the filibuster where it still applies—and might meet with Mr Manchin’s approval. Dr Binder suggests lowering the threshold for cloture from 60 votes to, say, 57, then 54, and, finally, 51 as the debate on a bill goes on. Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, suggests requiring the minority to provide 41 votes to continue debate (rather than requiring the majority to find 60) and insisting that the debate-seekers actually hold the floor of the Senate and debate the measure they object to.
There is little doubt that in either case the minority, whichsoever party it might be, would seek to maximise whatever possibilities for obstruction remained. And hopes that more debate would be better debate should be tempered: the Senate will never be the “world’s greatest deliberative body”, as is sometimes grandiloquently claimed. But steps towards simple majority rule would bring it more into line with the rest of the democratic world—and the vision of the framers.

1860,"WITH ONE’S eyes closed, Beijing’s main roads sound like any Chinese city. All around is the roar of traffic, punctuated by honks from delivery scooters, recorded safety warnings from buses and the occasional bell of a rental-bicycle. But in the capital’s last hutongs, as its ancient grey-walled alleys are known, fragments of an older soundscape can be heard.
The chirping of caged crickets is one. Hung in the doorways of courtyard homes or small shops, the insects bring a rural note into the city. A quarter-century ago their song was common. Beijing was still home to cycle rickshaws and delivery tricycles. Some riders hung crickets from their handlebars, inside spherical cages woven from reeds. Today, cricket-sellers cling on, lurking near a motorway bridge in southern Beijing. A big specimen sells for 20 yuan ($3). They are heirs to a grand tradition. In imperial times, bored courtiers and Manchu army officers spent fortunes on caged crickets and songbirds.

Another relic is the musical clanking of steel plates strung on a cord, announcing a knife sharpener’s arrival. Several such specialists still work Beijing’s streets. Their sounding-plates, sometimes supplemented with a distinctive cry, summon customers from hutong homes and high-rise flats. But numbers are falling. “What young man would study this?” asks Craftsman Liu, a sharpener for 40 years, as he hones a cleaver on a whetstone mounted on his bike.
An almost-vanished Beijing sound is one of the strangest. An eerie thrumming, like the noise of flying saucers in an old science-fiction film, it is made by homing pigeons, or more precisely by pigeon whistles. Tiny flutes made from bamboo or gourds, these are sewn into the tail feathers of pigeons kept in rooftop coops. The birds are released twice a day to circle in the sky. Even 20 years ago, it was possible to hear this melancholy noise in the hutongs. It was particularly associated with cold winter skies, for pigeons moult in summer, making feathers too weak to hold whistles. Alas, modern Beijing is a city in a hurry. Many hutongs have been razed to make way for wide avenues and shiny skyscrapers, leaving no room for pigeon lofts.
Zhang Baotong is one of Beijing’s last master pigeon-whistle makers. As a child in the 1950s he heard the dong of camel bells as dusty caravans carried coal to a nearby railway station. He learned to make whistles in boyhood from a famed master who shared a courtyard with his family. Today Mr Zhang has apprentices and a workshop lined with certificates calling him a living treasure. But many of his whistles are sold to collectors and never see the sky.
Mr Zhang is advising a museum of sound that will open next May in Songzhuang, a suburb of Beijing that is popular with artists. A rooftop coop is planned, with more than 100 pigeons that will take to the skies for visitors. It is hoped that pigeon-whistles will be heard each day over Songzhuang, at least in cooler months.
The co-founder of Fen Sonic HQ, a cultural institute that will run the museum, is Colin Siyuan Chinnery, a British-Chinese artist and collector of Beijing’s sounds. He lists the gongs, rattles and rhythmic cries used by fortune tellers and medicine sellers, doctors, barbers and knife sharpeners, until private enterprise was crushed in the 1950s. Many of these will feature in an exhibit about old Beijing narrated by an animation of Mr Zhang, among others. Other places had hawkers’ cries, but true Beijingers dismiss peddlers elsewhere as mere bellowers, Mr Chinnery says. Beijingers’ pride is one tradition that never fades.■

1861,"YUNIOR GARCÍA AGUILERA, a leader of Cuba’s pro-democracy movement, had hoped to join a protest against the government on November 15th. It was planned as a follow-up to demonstrations in July. This time security forces detained activists in advance and blocked the street along which Mr García had planned to walk holding a white rose, the movement’s symbol. The protest was small. Mr García later turned up in Spain.",1
1862," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci said it could be the end of 2021 before life gets back to how it was before Covid-19.""If you're talking about getting back to a degree of normality which resembles where we were prior to Covid, it's going to be well into 2021, maybe even towards the end of 2021,"" Fauci said Friday.A vaccine will help, but there are caveats, Fauci said in a series of interviews Friday.   Fauci has said repeatedly that it's possible at least one of the vaccines being tested could get emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year or early next year. But it won't be available to everyone immediately.""By the time you mobilize the distribution of the vaccinations, and you get the majority, or more, of the population vaccinated and protected, that's likely not going to happen to the mid or end of 2021,"" he  told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell. One stumbling block -- keeping the vaccines cold. Most of the experimental coronavirus vaccines must be kept frozen. Speaking during a Friends of the Global Fight webinar earlier on Friday, Fauci said, ""One of the things that's always an issue is the cold storage issue, and the 'cold chain' that is so often required."" Debunking nonsensePlus, people are not always doing what they should do to control the spread of the virus, even now, Fauci said.""When you're dealing with a situation that requires behavioral change, we in the United States have a significant issue that I'm very disappointed in,"" Fauci said during the webinar.""It was stunning to me ... that in some states and cities and counties, you would see television clips of people crowded indoors at bars, which is a superspreading event if you ever saw it.""Young people may think they are not going to get dangerously ill, and get careless, Fauci said.""But what they forget is their societal responsibility to not propagate the outbreak because if they get infected, they're likely going to infect someone else who then might infect someone who really is vulnerable and will have a serious severe consequence."" And people are spreading misinformation, making the virus even harder to fight.""The one thing that bothers me is the amount of things that aren't evidence-based, and we've seen examples of that in the United States like claims that certain drugs have a great positive effect when there's no scientific evidence whatsoever that they have a positive effect,"" Fauci said.""And yet it gets ingrained and I and my colleagues have to spend a lot of time trying to debunk that. And you're in the middle of a pandemic and you're trying hard to address all the appropriate issues, it is truly a waste of time to have to debunk nonsense.""Fauci also cautioned that just because coronaviruses are in the spotlight, people should not forget  the flu.""The one thing I've learned throughout the years is don't put anything past the flu -- don't take anything for granted,"" he said during the MSNBC interview. There ""a hint of potential good news"" when it comes to flu season. In Australia, where the flu season just ended, ""They have had the lightest flu season in memory -- which most people think is because they're doing things to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection with masks, distancing, avoiding crowds, outdoor more than indoor. That what they've done as a secondary offshoot of that is they brought down the level of influenza cases, very, very low,"" he said. He added that if  Americans can do this, he's optimistic the country will have a light flu season too. ",2
1863,"IT IS A question that might have been devised by Cantinflas, a comic actor who turned the Mexican taste for circumlocution into an absurdist art form. “Are you in agreement or not that appropriate actions in accordance with the constitutional and legal framework be carried out in order to undertake actions of clarification of political decisions taken in the past by political actors, aimed at guaranteeing justice and the rights of the possible victims?” This is what President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wants Mexicans to decide in a national referendum on August 1st. Decoded, what it means is, should he be authorised to orchestrate a kind of unofficial show trial of his five most recent predecessors and their subordinates?
Mr López Obrador (or AMLO, for short), has always insisted that he became president in order to draw a line under 30 years of what he calls “neoliberal”, corrupt government. He holds those five presidents responsible, variously, for corruption, the concentration of wealth, electoral fraud and a failed drug war that begot yet more violence. Shortly after his landslide victory in 2018 he began to talk about holding a referendum over whether to put the ex-presidents on trial.

To resort to a popular vote to decide whether or not to prosecute someone is a travesty of the rule of law. The Supreme Court, whose president boasts of an “affectionate” relationship with AMLO, narrowly ruled that the referendum was constitutional but softened the question to its current convoluted form. What makes the exercise even more surreal is that the president says he won’t vote, because he is not “vengeful” and doesn’t want to dwell on the past. If “the people” decide otherwise, however, he will act on their wishes.
This referendum serves several of the president’s purposes. He is fond of consultative votes. They support his claim to take more notice of the people than his predecessors did. He has used them to provide backing for decisions he wanted to take anyway, such as the cancellation of a half-built new airport in Mexico City.
This one will have binding force if 40% of the electorate take part and a majority votes in favour. If that happens, some think the government will set up a kind of truth commission into the recent past. But turnout may fall short. The opposition is boycotting the vote. The independent electoral authority, which complains that the government is starving it of funds, says it will install only a third of the number of polling stations it used in a mid-term election last month.
The vote also confirms that, in fighting corruption, AMLO prefers theatre, which he can direct, over substance. Mexicans are fed up with graft; the government of Enrique Peña Nieto of 2012-18 was notoriously corrupt. AMLO made ending corruption a central plank of his campaign. Nevertheless, “corruption in Mexico is in robust good health,” says María Amparo Casar of Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity (MCCI), a watchdog. “There is talk against corruption but there is no anti-corruption policy.”
Rather, there has been regression. Although public contracts are supposed to be tendered, as Mr López Obrador promised to do, his government has awarded them by fiat in 81% of cases, more than the 79% under Mr Peña Nieto, according to Ms Casar. The office of the special prosecutor for corruption cases has had its funding and staffing cut. The fight against corruption has become a political tool. Last year Spain extradited Emilio Lozoya, a former head of Pemex, the state oil company, who is wanted for taking bribes from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction firm. He has not been jailed and has become a protected witness, incriminating enemies of the government. AMLO hounds anti-corruption campaigners: he has criticised MCCI dozens of times in his morning press conferences, and the tax authorities have subjected it to punitive audits.
The president claimed victory in last month’s election because his party gained ten state governorships. But it lost its majority in the lower house of Congress (it can still eke one out with allies) and suffered a humiliating defeat in Mexico City. Though he remains popular, Mr López Obrador is no longer invincible. Many Mexicans continue to think he is on their side. But they are suffering from the pandemic, the government’s mishandling of it and the related economic slump, as well as unabated violent crime. To distract attention from policy failures, their president needs all the Cantinflan spectacles of political theatre that he can muster.",1
1864,"THE FIRST signs may go unnoticed. An individual might sicken here; another might die there. As few need reminding in 2021, death enters countries quietly. For trees, as for people, a whisper of unease may mark the arrival of a new disease. But as from tiny acorns, mighty oaks, so from small beginnings, devastating diseases.
Nobody is counting the trees Britain has lost to diseases, because it is difficult to keep track of millions of hectares of woodland. But on ash and elm, oak and beech, horse chestnut, alder and larch, diseases are spreading. Some kill. In London the leaves of horse-chestnut trees curl, brown and wither long before autumn arrives. In Devon and in Cumbria, ailing ash trees lift their skeletal silver fingers to the sky. In Dumfries and Galloway, hillsides of larch have been felled.

This is the era of the treedemic, which is not one disease, but many. Some are mild; others reshape the landscape. When Dutch elm disease swept across Britain in the 1960s and 1970s it was described as a national tragedy, but it was not the whole tragedy. It was the messenger speech, a warning of what is to come. Twenty-odd diseases have come to Britain since the 1960s; over 40 others, it is feared, might yet come. Attempts are being made to slow them. Forestry Commission helicopters hover over Britain, searching for signs of disease and issuing felling orders.
On an autumn day at the edge of Lake Windermere in the Lake District, Great Knott Wood sits in sunshine. This is archetypal English woodland, not particularly dark or deep but with cultural roots that spread far into the national story. Wordsworth wandered here, exulting at “Nature’s fairest forms”. Now some of those forms are threatened. Sudden larch death, which arrived in Britain in 2002, has just been found here. Within six months, says Heather Swift, the Cumbria site manager for the Woodland Trust, a charity, every larch tree in this area will have been felled.
The reason for all this devastation is simple: trees are not meant to move. Seeds might travel a few metres, or a few miles if eaten by a bird or animal. But outside Middle Earth and “Macbeth”, the plant itself should stay put. Instead vast numbers are travelling, more and farther every year. Over the past three decades, the global horticulture industry has grown so rapidly that it puts weeds in the shade. Forests are on the move and, as when Birnam Wood came to Dunsinane, this bodes ill.
Buy a potted plant and you may assume that you have bought a single species. You have not. In a recent paper in the Journal of Fungi, Alexandra Puertolas and three co-authors analysed the soil in 99 woody plants bought in Britain and the Netherlands: 90% contained organisms capable of causing diseases, some serious. It is perhaps better to think of bought trees less as plants in pots than as Petri dishes of potential pathogens which also contain a tree.
Worse still, they often do not contain the diseases of one area alone. Many enjoy an arboreal “grand tour” of Europe before being planted in British soil. Trees are not obliged to carry the country of origin, or of where they are grown, on their labels. Dieback led to regulations for ash trees being tightened in 2012, explains Richard Buggs, a senior researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, but other trees travel far. A single sapling might start life in the Netherlands and then be sent to Italy (trees grow faster where it’s sunnier) before returning, via Germany, to Britain. Like many a European grand tourist, such a tree can become riddled with disease.
The globalisation of tree cultivation means that many countries are experiencing similar problems. But they are unusually severe in Britain, which has few tree nurseries and is one of the least wooded countries in Europe, a fact it is trying to change. The value of tree imports has increased from £6m in 1992 (£12.5m in 2019 prices; $16m), to £93m today, an increase of nearly 650%. The Forestry Commission counted 4.25m new trees planted in Britain in the 12 months ending in April; the Woodland Trust, a charity, has pledged to plant 50m trees by 2025.
The potential impact of tree disease, however, dwarfs such numbers. Britain is home to 150m ash trees, and many more saplings, all of which might be infected by ash dieback. Of the trees infected, it is estimated that 90-99% will die. Dead trees must be removed (especially if they overhang roads and railways) and their environmental benefits are lost. Researchers at Oxford University have estimated that the cost of tree death on such a scale will be £15bn (0.7% of GDP).
Root cause
Humans have been exploiting forests for millennia. Ancient Roman bathers were warmed by fires kindled with North African trees. Captain Cook returned from Botany Bay with a ship filled with botanical samples. But Roman merchants and Enlightenment explorers transported dead trees and live seeds. Now, live trees are being moved. The analogy is less with dead timber than with live animals, in particular humans. “When Europeans colonised America they took with them diseases like flu and chickenpox that for them caused fairly mild symptoms,” says Mr Buggs. When they met populations unused to such diseases, the result was catastrophic.
Moving trees less would reduce the spread of disease. So would building more nurseries and cutting imports. Brexit means Britain is better able to impose phytosanitary restrictions at its borders. That would come at a cost, but it would probably be lower than the potentially catastrophic losses caused by new diseases. The Oxford researchers point out that imports and exports of all live plants, not just trees, were worth £300m in 2017—a mere 2% of the potential costs of ash dieback. It is time to see the wood for the trees. ■",1
1865,"ONE OF THE all-time-great corporate emails was sent several years ago, by a manager at Shell to pep up a team of oil engineers on a project in the far east of Russia. “Personally, I, like most others, love winning,” he raved. “I despise cowards and play to win all of the time.”
The language was bizarre in other ways, too. “When everyone of you were kids, I am sure that you all admired the champion marble player” struck a chord with precisely no one in 2007. The anachronism was because the writer borrowed liberally from a stirring speech by General George Patton to American troops in 1944. Patton’s “all real Americans love the sting and clash of battle” became “all real engineers love the sting and clash of challenge.” And so on.

Copying from the army is seldom so cack-handed, but the idea that managers have lessons to learn from uniformed types persists. A cottage industry rests on the conceit that soldiers have insights into leadership that can be of use in the boardroom. Two new books based on the premise have come out this month—“Risk: A User’s Guide” co-written by Stanley McChrystal, a retired four-star general in the US Army, and “The Habit of Excellence” by Lieutenant-Colonel Langley Sharp, a British officer.
General McChrystal’s book is a pot-pourri of anecdotes and case studies on how to manage risk. The general’s idea of creating “fusion cells” to bring together a network of intelligence teams in the fight against al-Qaeda has spread to other areas: the state of Missouri did something similar to connect different agencies to combat covid-19.
Lieutenant-Colonel Sharp has written the more distinctive book, a detailed account of how the British army goes about developing its leaders. Much of the thinking will be surprisingly familiar to managers. The army’s concept of “mission command”, in which the overall intent of a mission is set at the centre and the decision-making that brings it to fruition is delegated to people on the ground, is akin to the ethos of agile software development. “Serve to Lead”, the motto of the army’s academy at Sandhurst, came decades before the now-modish management theory of “servant-leadership”.
Yet these echoes are only that. The differences between leading in the armed forces and leading a business come through more strongly from both books than the similarities. Most obviously, the use of lethal force tends not to be a big feature of corporate life. The stakes are much lower, and the calculus of risk is therefore just different.
Leaders in the armed forces can draw on deeper motivations among soldiers than bosses can with their employees. History offers a shared narrative to those in service. Patriotism provides a ready-made sense of purpose. And nationality operates like a permanent non-compete clause: soldiers do not change their allegiances to countries in the same way that workers can switch companies. “England expects that every man will do his duty,” was the message that Admiral Nelson sent his sailors before the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Swap in the name of your employer and see how it sounds.
The contrasts do not end there. Leaders in the armed forces play a much more familial role than the average boss. They will have been in the forces themselves for years. The people below them are often very young. Many live and work in close proximity.
The armed forces also emphasise intensive training in preparation for moments of extreme stress, when there is no time for senior figures to be consulted. When pivotal decisions need to be made at companies, the bigwigs schedule a meeting weeks in advance. The closest analogues of army leadership lie in elite sports rather than in firms.
It is interesting for civilians to read about army life, but largely because it is so alien. It may make sense to hire veterans, but as part of the mix rather than as a template. A research paper from 2014 found that bosses who had been in the armed forces were more conservative than those who had not donned uniform. They invested less; they were less likely to commit fraud; and their firms performed better in times of crisis.
Patton’s speech in 1944 ended by imagining what his soldiers would say to their grandchildren after the war was long over: “Son, your Granddaddy rode with the Great Third Army and a Son-of-a-Goddamned-Bitch named Georgie Patton!” The Shell executive’s missive finished thus: “Details of the team are summarised in the enclosed email.” War and work are not the same.

1866,"Double child killer Colin Pitchfork has been arrested and recalled to prison, the Ministry of Justice said, after he was released two months ago.
Pitchfork, now 61, was arrested by police officers for 'concerning behaviour' and taken in for processing just two months after he was freed after 33 years in prison.
Under the cover of darkness, the sexual predator was taken from Leyhill open prison, in Tortworth, Gloucs., to a hostel in the south of England, where he was greeted by other residents and staff. 
In September, it was revealed he had been placed near three schools and two nurseries, with pictures showing him prowling the streets as a free man.
Pitchfork, who was imprisoned for life in 1988 for the rape and murder of two 15-year-old girls, is facing a standard recall - which in theory means he could be re-released into public life again in 28 days. 
But sources told the Sun his past life of crime means he is almost guaranteed an audience before an official Parole Board hearing within the next six months to determine his fate.
The source said it could be 'years' before he was released into public life again, adding: 'Pitchfork’s licence conditions were so tough that if he stepped out of line he faced recall.  
'Now he has done just that. His behaviour caused great concern and that was behind it.
'He kept going for long walks alone which in itself was alarming. It’s thought his attitude and fears he was hiding things were also a problem.'
Pitchfork strangled his first victim Lynda Mann, in Narborough, Leicestershire, in November 1983. He killed Dawn Ashworth three years later in the neighbouring village of Enderby. 
He became the first person to be convicted using DNA evidence after he had tried to evade capture by persuading a work colleague to take a blood test for him during the murder hunt.
Reacting to the news he would be returning to a life of incarceration today, his second victim's mother, Barbara Ashworth, said she was 'pleased' the child killer has been recalled to prison.
She said: 'I'm pleased that he's been put away and women and girls are safe and protected from him now.
'It's a safer place when he's behind bars and I won't have to worry about other people being hurt by him for the time being.
'But there's always the worry that he might get out again, he seems to have a lot of people on his side who give him the benefit of the doubt.
'But for now, I have to be pleased about the news.' 
Pitchfork was freed after the Parole Board rejected the Government and his devastated victims' families' legal challenge. 
In a clear indication of the threat he still posed, he was subject to some of the strictest licence conditions ever set.
The killer will wear an electronic tag so he can be monitored at all times, banned from going near the relatives of his victims and face restrictions on using the internet by himself.
He also faced on-the-spot lie detector tests to see whether he has broken any conditions.
He is also banned from approaching children and will be on the sex offenders register for life. Pitchfork’s hostel had a small garden, a pool table and runs a cooking club for residents. 
Pitchfork raped and strangled Lynda in Narborough after dropping his wife off at an evening class and while his baby son slept in the back of his car.
Three years later, he raped and murdered Dawn in a similar attack in nearby Enderby. 
The killer was the first criminal to be caught by the revolutionary DNA profiling process pioneered by Sir Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester.
He was eventually caught after the world's first mass screening for DNA, as 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples.
No matches were found. 
But in 1987 a bakery colleague of Pitchfork - who had been there as an apprentice and had expressed a desire to set up his own cake-making business - was overheard boasting how he was set to receive £200 to pose as Pitchfork and give a sample.
The conversation was reported to the police and Pitchfork was later arrested. He was jailed for life in 1988.  
His minimum term of imprisonment was set at 30 years, later reduced to 28 years in 2009 on appeal.
Pitchfork's early release from a life sentence in the summer prompted furious relatives of his victims to speak out.
Barbara Ashworth, the mother of Pitchfork’s second victim Dawn Ashworth, said: ‘This man should not be breathing the same air as us. He should not be walking the streets again.’  
Rebecca Eastwood, the sister of Pitchfork’s first victim Lynda Mann, said: ‘Why has he been placed near a number of schools? I just hope the pictures will mean people will now be able to be on their guard.’
Miss Eastwood, of Liverpool, added: ‘Please remember his face and stay clear of him and keep your children safe. There is no way a man who committed these crimes can change.’
The families of both victims had accused the Parole Board of putting children at risk by ignoring concerns from experts, especially over Pitchfork’s ‘future sexual interests’. 
Alberto Costa, MP for South Leicestershire, where Pitchfork committed his crimes, said: 'I was informed earlier this evening by the Policing Minister that double child rapist and killer Colin Pitchfork has been recalled to prison. 
'Pitchfork’s behaviour has given sufficient cause for concern to the probation authorities. 
'Pitchfork is under the most stringent of licence conditions and perhaps this recall evidences that those conditions are working. I will urgently take this matter up with the government to ensure that public safety remains the number one focus.'
DNA evidence - then in its early use in criminal cases - played a key role in solving the murders of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.
It was first used in the investigation following the death of Pitchfork's first victim - Lynda Mann.
Then 15, Lynda was grabbed, raped and murdered as she walked home from babysitting earlier that day.
DNA was used at the start of the investigation, when a sample of semen taken from her body was found to be from a person with type-A blood.
It also matched an enzyme profile of just 10 per cent of males.
But with few leads and no direct suspects, police left the case open.
In 1986, a second 15-year-old girl, Dawn Ashworth, left her home to visit a friend's house.
When she did not return, a search was launched and, like Lynda, her body was found having been raped.
Police again found similar DNA, and with the murder having been carried out in a similar way, detectives realised they were looking for a double murderer.
Officers had another suspect in mind at the time, Richard Buckland - a 17-year-old with learning difficulties who had confessed to the second murder and had knowledge of the first. He would later be exonerated.
But it wasn't until Sir Alec Jeffreys, a genetics researcher at nearby Leicester University, became involved that his innocence was proved. 
Sir Alec first developed genetic profiling along with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett.
And he used it to compare DNA samples found on both bodies.
It proved the killer was the same person - but not Buckland.
Later, police launched a DNA drive and up to 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples.
However, no matches were found.
But in 1987 a bakery colleague of Pitchfork was overheard boasting how he was set to receive £200 to pose as Pitchfork and give a sample.
The conversation was reported to the police and Pitchfork was later arrested. ",3
1867,"A FEW MINUTES after 1pm Universal Time, on July 20th, Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, a successful online bookshop and parcel-delivery company, and of Blue Origin, an aspiring rocket firm, became the first billionaire in space. Or maybe not the first. It rather depends on your definition of “space”.
Mr Bezos and three companions—his brother Mark; Wally Funk, an American woman who trained as an astronaut in the 1960s on an unofficial, privately sponsored programme, but did not fly into space; and Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old Dutch physics student, who thus unarguably became the youngest astronaut ever—blasted off in one of Blue Origin’s human-rated capsules, mounted on top of a New Shepard reusable rocket. The rocket launched the capsule on a trajectory that would culminate above an altitude of 100km. The capsule then separated and carried on into space, while the rocket returned to a landing pad 3km downrange of its launch site in Culberson county, Texas. Its jaunt complete, the capsule, too, then parachuted back to Earth.

The debate about who goes into the record books as “first billionaire in space” was made live on July 11th, when Sir Richard Branson, a Briton, flew to an altitude of 85km in a rocket-propelled plane built and owned by Virgin Galactic, a firm he founded. Sir Richard announced this trip after Mr Bezos had set the date for his—apparently to pre-empt him. There is nothing wrong with a bit of friendly competition, of course. But Sir Richard’s jaunt muddied the waters because many people think it was not exactly the real deal.

The lower bound of outer space is, by convention, something called the Kármán line. This is the altitude above which a craft relying on aerodynamic lift to keep itself aloft would have, because of the thinness of the air at high altitude, to travel faster to obtain that lift than the speed required to go into orbit around Earth.
The exact height of the Kármán line does, though, vary with atmospheric conditions. So again, by convention, it is usually pegged at 100km. This convention is recognised by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the keeper of standards for such matters. One up to Mr Bezos.
America’s armed forces, however, lack the means to reach such heights, but still want some of their own pilots recognised as astronauts. So they claim instead that space begins at an altitude of 80km, the upper bound of an atmospheric layer called the mesosphere—and to avoid diplomatically awkward distinctions between its own astronauts and military ones, NASA, America’s aerospace agency, has conceded the point. One up to Sir Richard.
New Shepard itself is named after Alan Shepard, a NASA astronaut who was the first American to make a suborbital ballistic flight of the sort Mr Bezos has just experienced, which he did in 1961 on top of a modified Redstone intercontinental ballistic missile. And the date Mr Bezos chose for his flight was also historically redolent, being the 52nd anniversary of the landing of Apollo 11’s lunar module, which carried the first human visitors to the Moon.
Blue Origin’s next project is New Glenn, named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth. As its name indicates, this will be powerful enough to reach orbit. If all goes well, New Glenn will fly (uncrewed) in 2022, and may subsequently carry passengers, though its main purpose will be to launch satellites. So, unless Elon Musk decides to take a trip in one of the Dragon capsules made by his firm, SpaceX, which already routinely orbit Earth, Mr Bezos does stand a chance of being the first billionaire in orbit. Meanwhile, for anyone who wants a suborbital hop, tickets on New Shepard trips will soon be available, for an as-yet-undisclosed amount. For those who prefer to fly Virgin, $250,000 will buy you a seat. ■
Clarification (July 22nd 2021): A sharp-eyed reader has pointed out that both Sir Richard and Mr Bezos have been pre-empted for the title “first billionaire in space” by Guy Lalilberté, a Canadian who flew to the International Space Station in 2009, courtesy of a Russian rocket. Perhaps we should have framed the competition as “first billionaire in space in a vehicle of his own devising”.",1
1868,"BEFORE THE Burmese army took power in a coup last February, Aung Naing Oo was a well-spoken civil servant widely praised for spearheading economic reforms under the governments of Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto leader until the coup, and her predecessor. When the army took over, it detained senior members of Ms Suu Kyi’s government. Yet Mr Aung Naing Oo did not just remain free. He was promoted by the junta to the role of investment minister.
Once a darling of the international community, Mr Aung Naing Oo, an ex-military officer, now speaks the junta’s language. He recently told Reuters that foreign executives of Telenor, a Norwegian telecoms firm, had been barred from leaving the country because of the regime’s need to meet them in person. Myanmar’s current economic crisis, he argued, was caused in part by “sabotage” backed by foreign states.

After previous coups, Myanmar’s generals did not immediately invite civilians onto their ruling councils. This time is different. Several civilians sit on their council, and in their caretaker government, too. Nine of 28 cabinet ministers are civilians. Six ministers were senior civil servants in the ousted government, suggesting the junta wants to project a sense of continuity. Eight cabinet members served under the presidency of Thein Sein, an ex-general who, between 2011 and 2016, created a “business-friendly but military-controlled state”, which the junta seems to want to recreate, write researchers at ISEAS, a think-tank in Singapore.
Why the top brass has included civilians in its government seems clear. Why civilians would want to work for the generals is less obvious. Some may not have had “much of a choice when asked by the military”, says Ye Salween, the pseudonym of a Burmese analyst based in Yangon. They may also not have expected the coup to meet with the overwhelming public opposition that it did.
There are more petty reasons, too. Several ministers hold grudges against the junta’s arch-rival, Ms Suu Kyi. In 2019 she reassigned Mr Aung Naing Oo from the government’s investment agency, which he ran, to the investment ministry, making him permanent secretary. This was widely regarded as a demotion—though apparently not by Mr Aung Naing Oo, who says that it was a promotion and that he bears no ill will towards Ms Suu Kyi.
Thet Thet Khine, the welfare minister, is a former lawmaker from Ms Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD). She bears “hatred” for Ms Suu Kyi, a former friend says, because she was made to feel unwelcome by Ms Suu Kyi and the NLD over her past leadership of the country’s top business lobby, which engaged with previous military regimes. The party dismissed her in 2018, whereupon Ms Thet Thet Khine became one of Ms Suu Kyi’s most vocal critics, branding her a “control freak”. (Ms Thet Thet Khine denies that she hates Ms Suu Kyi but says she’s not a “huge fan”.)
The turncoats also claim to believe that the junta can do some good. The army justified the coup by claiming that the NLD stole the election in 2020, even though observers found no evidence of widespread fraud. Ms Thet Thet Khine says that she “witnessed personally that NLD cheated”. Days after the coup she justified working with the generals by arguing that the ousted government “did undemocratic things”, whereas the army “is doing democratic acts” by taking charge until it can hold a fair election. For his part, Mr Aung Naing Oo may have calculated that he could bring about more change from within government than outside.
The flaw in that argument is that the regime focuses not on good government, but on violently quelling resistance to its rule. It has killed more than 1,200 civilians so far, according to a local watchdog. The names of reformers like Mr Aung Naing Oo are now “manure”, says Mr Ye Salween. If they thought siding with the army would ensure their safety, they may be thinking again. Low-level officials are assassinated almost every day. ■",1
1869,"In a speech to a joint session of Congress, Joe Biden laid out his American Families Plan, the most ambitious attempt to expand social programmes since the 1960s.

The $1.8trn price tag will be paid in part by increasing the top rate of income tax to 39.6%. And for those earning over $1m, taxes on capital gains and dividends will soar.

Panasonic made its biggest-ever foreign acquisition when it agreed to buy the 80% of Blue Yonder it doesn’t already own in a deal valued at $7.1bn. Blue Yonder specialises in software for supply-chain management.
More banks disclosed losses from their exposure to the collapse of Archegos, an investment fund. Nomura took a hit of over $2.9bn, more than it had estimated previously, dragging the Japanese bank to its worst quarterly performance since 2008. UBS recorded a $774m loss in operating income related to Archegos, overshadowing the Swiss bank’s solid quarterly profit.
By contrast, Deutsche Bank said it had managed to sell its assets in Archegos before it imploded, avoiding any associated damage to its balance-sheet. The German bank made a net profit of €908m ($1.1bn) in the first quarter, its best since the start of 2014.
In one of the firmest commitments to getting workers back into the office, JPMorgan Chase told staff that it wants them to return to their place of employment by early July, albeit on a rotational basis to comply with a 50% cap on office occupancy.

1870,"IF IT EVER was Shanghai’s tallest building, the 40-metre-high headquarters of the North China Daily News did not remain so for long. Skyscrapers became fashionable before the Communists took over in 1949 and turned China into a world leader for them. In 2015 the tallest building in China (and second-highest in the world) opened in Lujiazui, Shanghai’s Wall Street, on the far side of the Huangpu river. Chinese officials call the 632-metre edifice Shanghai Tower, a symbol of the financial capital’s might.
The sinuous, 128-storey structure, designed by an American firm, purports to evoke a dragon’s twisting form. It is home to Chinese and foreign financial firms betting on China’s rise. JPMorgan, an American bank, occupies four floors. But the Communist Party is there as well. It has taken a large, airy space high up to run a political operation about which it is open and proud. Its focus is on companies in Shanghai Tower and other skyscrapers. For private firms in China, there is an echo of 1921, when industrialists wondered what the Bolsheviks were up to. Once again, Communists are eager to establish themselves in the workplace. There are worrisome implications.

Before his inspection of the big brain in 2018, Xi Jinping visited Shanghai Tower. On his way up in the world’s fastest lift to its observation deck, he stopped at the party-building service centre on the 22nd floor (a separate lift goes directly to it). One room displayed his slogan calling on party members to cleave to the ideals that inspired activists a century ago: “Don’t forget the original intent, keep the mission firmly in mind, struggle forever.”
Those words appear on billboards across China. The “original intent” phrase is from a Tang-dynasty poem. Mr Xi says it means working for people’s well-being and China’s rejuvenation. The aim is not to whip up a Maoist frenzy or encourage workers to rise up. The strike-fomenting Bolshevik menace which worried industrialists in Shanghai in the 1920s is of no concern now, since the party abhors labour unrest. “Stability is paramount” is its mantra. Today the worry is different: that a more assertive party will muscle into boardrooms and keep them on a tighter leash.
It has always been the case that, in a workplace with three or more party members, they should, with approval from a higher level, form a branch or, with 100 or more members, a committee. But some businesses were cool to the idea and the party did not always insist on it. Mr Xi wants complete coverage, with no excuses for non-compliance. “Party organisations must extend wherever party members work and live,” he said on the 22nd floor. They should be “strongholds for combat”. There are now 40 party-building centres covering the 280-plus towers in the financial district. Work began last year to set up yet another layer of control, with a party-led building-affairs committee in each multi-occupant commercial property. These committees include party chiefs of tenant firms, as well as police. State media call this injecting a “red gene” into property management.
Within private firms, efforts to install a party presence have been ramped up. Since Mr Xi took over, the proportion that have embedded party organisations has risen from just over 50% to more than 70%. As an academic at the Central Party School, Cai Xia conducted research into party-building efforts in private firms. In those pre-Xi days, she says, the aim was mainly to give scattered party members a greater sense of belonging and encourage them to be model workers. Now, says Ms Cai (who has lived in America since 2019), the purpose is to help the party maintain social stability and “supervise and control” their firms.
Some foreign firms are anxious. Those operating in sectors that China considers vital to its economy, including financial services, must often form joint ventures with state-owned companies. In 2017 party bosses in some state enterprises began pressing their foreign partners to agree to wording in the charters of their businesses that guaranteed a management role for the party. Companies are required to have officially approved charters. Failure to abide by them could be deemed a crime.
A rare retreat
Remarkably, amid an outcry from foreign investors, party officials backed down. No longer are they arm-twisting foreign firms to specify a role for the party in the running of joint ventures, says Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. As for wholly foreign-owned businesses, the chamber says it has not heard of the party having a business-management function in any of them. Indeed, among nearly 585 European firms it recently polled, nearly 65% said they were unaware of any party presence in their firms. Of those with branches, only just over 1% said the party could veto business plans.
Foreign companies have always had to be mindful of the party’s wishes. But it may be that the party does not see strengthening its presence in foreign firms as a political priority. Mr Wuttke says that in foreign businesses party branches often operate “like Rotary Clubs”. But even if most of them keep out of business decision-making, there may be an anaconda effect among staff. Chinese often say they like to work in foreign firms because of their freer atmosphere. Lester Ross, the Beijing representative of WilmerHale, an international law firm, says expatriate bosses, who seldom have a strong command of Chinese, may not easily spot changes in the mood of local employees.
It is a different story with private Chinese businesses, which provide 80% of urban jobs. They are the titans of online and high-tech industries. To ensure control over Chinese society, the party wants to boost its influence among such firms both at board level and among ordinary employees. It wants to ensure that China’s influential tycoons, and their staff, toe the party line. A directive in 2017 called for measures to “strengthen the sense of loyalty” among entrepreneurs and party leadership over them.
A widely touted model is Hodo Group, a family-run manufacturer of garments and textiles with 30,000 employees in Jiangsu province. Mr Xi has praised its party-building efforts. Zhou Haijiang, the chief executive, is also the party secretary. Other senior managers hold corresponding roles within the group’s party committee (which oversees Hodo’s more than 100 party branches and their membership of around 1,000). The head of the human-resources department is in charge of the party’s organisational affairs, the person responsible for brand development is the party’s propaganda chief, and the chairman of the firm’s board of supervisors is the party’s head of discipline.
In 2018 foreign business grandees attending the China Development Forum, an annual get-together with Chinese counterparts and government leaders, were surprised by their hosts’ decision to flaunt the party’s role in economic matters. Hodo’s Mr Zhou was among those wheeled out to make the point. He regaled the audience with his party-building exploits and sang the praises of what officials now call a “modern enterprise system with Chinese characteristics”—meaning one with the party very much involved.
It is easy to see why the party likes the Hodo model. In about 50% of private firms with party branches, the boss is already a party member. For such a person, taking on the additional role of party secretary is not difficult. The bosses may even accept the idea as the least bad option: better to manage the company’s party affairs oneself than allow someone else to take the job. And there may be benefits. Being a party secretary can open doors with officialdom. Businessmen prize such access. Privately, some Chinese entrepreneurs describe their party-building efforts as a box-ticking exercise. Party members in their companies know to whom they must be loyal in order to keep their jobs: the firm.
In the Shanghai Tower, state media say Mr Xi’s visit has been a boon (as has support from the state-owned company that owns the building). Every month, on average, one company pays a visit to ask for help setting up a branch. It has also boosted demand for party membership. The service centre offers enticements: a place to relax and enjoy the view. There is a gym on the same floor.
But party-building in Lujiazui is also about controlling members. The 22nd floor is pioneering a new way of making them stay on their toes. It involves an app that shows members how many points they have scored for volunteer work, for taking part in political study sessions or for submitting “thought reports” (a device much-loved by the party for ensuring discipline, as it forces members to expose their own weaknesses). Score less than 60 points in a year and you could be summoned for a chat with a party official, or sent for retraining at a party school.
That may sound scary, but well-educated Chinese still flock to join the party. Even on campuses, where curbs on free speech have become tighter under Mr Xi than at any time since Tiananmen, many students are keen to sign up. That is because membership can confer lifelong benefits.■

1871,"IN THE DUNES north of Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the sun sets and the party begins. Girls discard their abayas, the black shrouds that envelop them in public, and begin jiving to techno music with boys. A few swig from bottles, but most prefer Captagon pills, nowadays the Gulf’s favourite drug, at $25 a pop. They call it Abu Hilalain (Father of Two Half-moons), after the two letter “c”s (for Captagon) embossed on the pills. Part of the amphetamine family, it can have a similar effect to Viagra—and conquers sleep. “With one pill,” says a raver, “we can dance all weekend.”
Though Saudi rulers have opposed the regime in Syria for a decade, the pill-popping by young people is funding it. For Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, the drug has become a boon—at least in the short run. His country has become the world’s prime pusher of Captagon. As the formal economy collapses under the burden of war, sanctions and the predatory rule of the Assads, the drug has become Syria’s main export and source of hard currency. The Centre for Operational Analysis and Research (COAR), a Cyprus-based consultancy, reckons that last year authorities elsewhere seized Syrian drugs with a street value of no less than $3.4bn. That compares with Syria’s largest legal export, olive oil, which is worth some $122m a year. The drug is financing the central government, says Ian Larson, who wrote a recent report on the subject for COAR.

Syria has long been involved in drugs. In the 1990s, when it ruled Lebanon, the Bekaa valley was the region’s main source of hashish. But mass production of drugs within Syria began only after the civil war erupted in 2011. Officers fed their men “Captain Courage”, as they called Captagon. Shia fighters from Afghanistan and Lebanon, who came to support the Syrian regime, brought their skills in making and trafficking drugs. Hizbullah, Lebanon’s biggest Shia militia, which has given crucial support to the Assad regime, acquired large tracts across the border in Syria’s Qalamoun mountains. They expanded hashish cultivation and developed a new cottage industry, making Captagon pills.
Syria began exporting them in about 2013, as its formal economy shrivelled, thanks to war, economic sanctions and corruption within the regime. Chemical plants in the cities of Aleppo and Homs have been converted into pill factories. In the Gulf the mark-up for pills can be 50 times their cost in Syria. Smugglers hide them in shipments of paper rolls, parquet flooring and even pomegranates. Saudi princes use private jets to bring the stuff in.
Seizures by police in foreign waters testify to the size of the trade. Italian police last year uncovered 84m pills worth over €1bn on a single ship. It was then said to be the world’s biggest interception of amphetamine-related drugs. In May the Malaysian authorities, acting on a Saudi tip-off, seized 95m pills. The Libyan port of Benghazi, linked by a regular shipping route to Syria, is said to be a key entrepot.

The Assads insist they are not involved. “Propaganda”, says Shadi al-Ahmad, an economist in Damascus, the capital, who is loyal to the regime. But because Mr Assad finds it hard to pay his troops, he farms out much of his country to warlords who oversee the smuggling. The army’s fourth division, which is commanded by Maher al-Assad, the president’s younger brother, is said to take a big cut. Other relations run operations at the Mediterranean ports of Latakia and Tartous. A Lebanese drug-runner close to Hizbullah and wanted by Interpol boasts on Facebook of his ties to the Assads and senior Hizbullah clerics. “It’s out of control,” says an insider in Damascus.
The regime may see Captagon as a lever in regional power struggles. It “uses drugs as a weapon against the Gulf”, says Malik al-Abdeh, a Syria watcher close to the opposition. “The message is: normalise relations, or we’ll destroy your youth.”
In any event, the regime’s loyalists are not the only ones involved. The Kurds who control Iraq’s north-eastern border with Turkey draw on the experience of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which operates routes through the mountains to Europe. Sunni Syrian rebels under Turkish protection in northern Syria are at it too. And the route south through Jordan to Saudi Arabia is getting busier. “All the militias get their earnings from smuggling drugs,” says a tribal leader in southern Syria. He says southern militias have helped thousands of refugees cross the border into Jordan, their knapsacks full of pills.
For the Syrians left behind, drugs may destroy what remains of society after a decade of civil war.  “Young men who haven’t been killed, exiled or jailed are addicts,” says a social worker in Sweida, a city held by the Assads in the south. A recent survey of Syrians in the north found that in January this year 33% said they knew a drug user. That is up from 7% in 2019. So prevalent is the habit that during this year’s Ramadan, in April and May, the prime-time serial on state television was “On a Hot Plate”, portraying a family of drug dealers.",1
