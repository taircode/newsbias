1497,"THOR, THE Norse thunder-god, was reputed to carry a hammer known as Mjollnir—a tool for destroying enemies and blessing friends. The hammer has provided suitable inspiration for the name of a powerful new drug to fight covid-19: molnupiravir. That drug has just been approved by Britain’s national medicines regulatory agency—the first in the world to do so. Molnupiravir, made by Merck, a big pharma firm,  and a Florida-based biotech called Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is the first oral antiviral medicine available to treat covid-19. The approval marks another milestone in the world’s fight against covid-19.
Other countries are also working quickly to approve the new medicine, which has provoked keen interest. Last month the interim results of a trial found that patients with a risk factor for covid-19 were 50% less likely to be hospitalised or die if the oral antiviral was taken in the first five days after symptoms. Britain has secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir, and sales of the drug are already brisk. America, Australia, Britain, the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are some of the countries that have secured deals, or are in the process of doing so. 
Demand is likely to be very high. The drug will be used to treat patients who have not been vaccinated, or who remain at high risk despite having had a jab.  Doctors now have a medicine to offer those most at risk from covid, which patients can take at home. The drug is also expected to be affordable globally. It is expected that rich countries will pay $700 a course for the drug, but low-income ones will pay something closer to $20—and maybe less as time goes on. 
Given the difficulties that low- and middle-income countries have faced in obtaining vaccines this year, it is reasonable to wonder whether rich countries are going to hoard the supply of this new drug, or even prevent it from being exported from the countries in which it is made.  That seems unlikely. Since the summer of last year when it bought the rights to the new molecule from Ridgeback, Merck has been looking for ways to make the drug widely available, such was its promise.
Known then as EIDD-2801 the molecule had been shown to inhibit the replication of RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 but had not yet been through trials in humans to test its efficacy.  As part of its covid-19 response, Merck chose to work on two vaccines and two drugs. With the exception of molnupiravir all its other products failed during development. 
Merck increased its own production and has licensed the drug to be made by others. It expects to produce 10m courses of treatment by the end of 2021 and hopes to be able to double manufacturing capacity next year. At the same time, five Indian manufacturers of low-cost generic drugs, including Cipla, Dr Reddy’s and Sun Pharmaceuticals have already signed deals to make generic versions of molnupiravir. Merck says it is also setting aside 3m courses of its own supply for low- and middle-income countries, to make sure not all early supplies are snaffled up by rich countries. 
Another notable move came on October 27th. Merck signed a voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicine Patent Pool—a United Nations-backed organisation that negotiates drug licences on behalf of less wealthy countries. The agreement will allow many more firms around the world to manufacture generic versions of molnupiravir. (One lesson of the pandemic has been the  need to have a global manufacturing footprint.) 
Trevor Mundel, president of global health at the Gates Foundation, says that because many generic drug firms are waiting to gauge  demand for molnupiravir in less wealthy countries, the foundation has made $120m available to get manufacturing going. This money will support guarantees to manufacturers that a certain volume of the new drug  will be bought. The foundation says it is hoping to speed up production by generic manufacturers, some of which can make as many as 10m courses a month. 
In the past year firms such as Pfizer and Moderna have been criticised for the lack of global access to their vaccines and their unwillingness to share the know-how to make them. Will Merck get much thanks for all its generosity? Mr Mundel thinks the speed and global breadth of the launch of molnupiravir will be without precedent in history. If so, that will mark a high-water mark in global health. Not everyone is happy. Médecins Sans Frontières, a humanitarian charity, says the Merck licence from the MPP does not go far enough. James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a “social justice” non-profit, disagrees, saying that the agreement goes further than any other company has done during the pandemic. 
Asked how much Merck had invested in its covid-19 research programme so far, the firm would only say “billions”. It is not likely to recoup this soon from  low- and middle-income countries. There are also concerns about whether the drug will be safe for everyone to take. Its ability to cause mutations in viruses could also pose a risk to fetal development. Regulatory agencies may thus choose to limit the use of the drug to certain groups for these reasons. Nonetheless, countries struggling to beat down  high numbers of covid hospitalisations and deaths, will find molnupiravir a powerful new hammer. ■

1498,"WHEN COMPANIES that depend on emissions, such as easyJet, an airline, use offsets sold on private “over the counter” markets to claim carbon neutrality it is hard not to be reminded of the indulgences sold by the medieval Catholic church that helped sinners to go on sinning guilt-free. But the recent emphasis on “net zero” economies has made offsets central to climate-change plans. In a net-zero economy adding carbon dioxide, or another greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere is only allowed if an equivalent amount of greenhouse gas is removed from it.
Offsets already play a role in some international agreements and government-backed programmes. But the idea of including them in emissions-trading schemes triggers bad memories in Europe. Credits for dodgy offsets helped to undermine the credibility of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in its early years. International offsets are in the process of being expunged from the ETS, though they are still traded on the Californian emissions market.

Despite this rocky start, offset-trading could still work. Indeed, the 2015 Paris agreement already includes rules for how to account properly for offsets, according to Kelley Kizzier of the Environmental Defence Fund, a campaign group. Many of the issues with monitoring offsets come from the fact that offsetting takes place in remote places where the rule of law is weaker, because planting trees and plants requires a lot of cheap land.
But it is likely to become easier. Ben Caldecott of Oxford University points out that technology used to monitor offsets has improved. The use of high-resolution satellite imagery means that it is possible to know exactly when a tree is cut down. In theory offset contracts could also be auctioned on mobile phones with payments sent via mobile banking. “We can create smart contracts between a smallholder farmer and a funder where the payment is unlocked if the tree is still there,” he says.
If the world is to achieve net-zero emissions, the only permissible offsets will need to be genuine negative emissions (rather than schemes that simply reduce emissions). This may mean sucking carbon out of the air using machines. A nascent industry aims to do this, but the costs are big. An estimate in 2018 by researchers at Carbon Engineering, a Canadian firm, put the cost of direct air capture between $94 and $232, many times the carbon price in most places.
It is possible that with sufficient investment those costs could fall as carbon prices rise, allowing a “direct air capture” industry to make money by selling credits into emissions-trading schemes. Direct-capture machines are much more efficient in terms of land. Mr Caledcott hopes that Britain, which has said it will leave the ETS now it is no longer in the EU, will pioneer the first net-zero emissions trading system including such offsets.",2
1499,"“A NEW GLOBAL energy economy is emerging.” Thus declared Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, a global forecaster, launching the organisation’s World Energy Outlook, its annual flagship report, on October 13th. It is appearing less than three weeks before COP26, a big UN climate summit, gets under way in Glasgow. Not by chance: the IEA brought publication forward by a month so that the report could be a “guidebook” for the UN's shindig. 
The new economy detected by Mr Birol still has a long way to go. To be sure, the report spies it in many places. Clean energy, such as wind and solar, is the cheapest source of new power in most regions. Electric vehicles account for a tenth of new car sales in China and Europe. And since 2016 more green investment has flowed into the power sector, which is crucial for decarbonisation, than into the oil and gas industry. 

But the report's main purpose is to forecast the various paths the world could take as it tries to decarbonise. In the most pessimistic pathway, countries adhere to their stated energy policies and global warming continues unabated. On this trajectory, there is a 50% chance that the world’s mean surface temperature will increase by 2.6°C, and still be rising, by the end of this century, relative to pre-industrial levels. Another possible trajectory assumes that countries honour the climate pledges they have announced so far, which are more ambitious than their stated policies. Faster decarbonisation ensues (see chart). In that case, fossil-fuel demand peaks around 2025 and the planet’s heating is limited to about 2.1°C.
The best-case scenario is one in which the world only warms by 1.5°C by the end of the century—the more ambitious end of the target governments agreed on at the Paris climate summit in 2015. Increasingly climate science suggests that, in terms of the detrimental impact of climate change, the gap between 1.5°C of warming and 2°C (the upper bound of the Paris goal) is large. To achieve that cooler goal, carbon-dioxide emissions must be net zero by the middle of the century. The world is way off track. Countries’ current climate pledges would achieve less than 20% of the emissions cuts by 2030 needed to keep warming to 1.5°C.
How can the world get onto the right path? The IEA points to four areas of policy that need sharpened focus over the next decade: using clean electricity for more purposes, such as transport or heating; energy efficiency; preventing leaks from fossil-fuel operations; and boosting green innovation. All this ambition will, of course, require plenty of money. To cut carbon-dioxide emissions to net zero by mid-century, the IEA estimates, investment relating to the energy transition needs to grow three-fold, to roughly $4trn a year by 2030.
Much of the IEA’s analysis will not surprise those who follow the climate-change debate. But the report does add yet another voice to calls for more climate action ahead of COP26. And the IEA’s calls are particularly striking. The organisation was founded in 1974, after the first oil shock. Its aim back then was to protect the interests of oil-importing countries. Now as another energy crisis shakes the world, it wants more than ever to rid those countries of fossil fuels. ■

1500,"AS A STUNT, it took some beating. A Vancouver city councillor joined activists outside a police station on July 14th to distribute free heroin, meth and cocaine. These “safe” samples of illicit drugs, the councillor tweeted, could save users from a poisoned street supply that has caused an overdose crisis on Canada’s west coast.
If the measure seems desperate, it suits the moment. The health officer of British Columbia (BC), where Vancouver is located, declared an emergency over deaths from drug overdoses five years ago. Dealers were lacing street drugs with lethal levels of fentanyl, a cheap and potent opioid. BC’s rate of illicit-drug deaths has more than doubled since then, with around 2,000 people dying from overdoses in the year to May—more than those killed by covid-19. “It’s really stretched all our traditional policy responses,” says Kennedy Stewart, Vancouver’s mayor. The pandemic appears to have worsened the crisis, since deaths are more likely if users inject alone.

So in May, Vancouver submitted a proposal to exempt it from Canada’s drug laws. It would decriminalise possession up to defined personal limits: two grams of heroin; three of cocaine; ten rocks of crack, for example. Drug prohibition deters addicts from seeking treatment, the request says, and criminal records make it hard to get a job. The proposal would also allow possession of drugs prescribed legally but sold on the black market, and of “party drugs” like LSD, MDMA and psilocybin mushrooms. It’s an all-or-nothing approach: decriminalising only the most harmful substances risks making users of other drugs turn to these more dangerous ones.
There are precedents for decriminalisation. Portugal is an example. This year Oregon became the first American state to stop making arrests for possession of small quantities of all drugs. But most such places still issue fines, confiscate drugs or impose mandatory treatment, whereas the Vancouver model proposes no penalty.
For decades, Vancouver has led Canada towards a drug policy that emphasises harm reduction. The country’s first supervised injection site for drug users opened there in 2003. Dozens of similar sites now operate across the country, even while they remain banned in America. The Canadian government has funded programmes—known as “safe supply”—that give users access to alternative opioids such as hydromorphone. Some clinics in the Vancouver area prescribe untainted, medical-grade heroin to the severely addicted.
The city’s submission includes letters of support from organisations of indigenous people in British Columbia. They died from overdoses last year at five times the rate of the rest of the population. But some advocacy groups think the proposal does not go far enough. Garth Mullins of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU) says the proposed possession limits are too low and that the city has deferred too much to its police department.
The mayor says it was politically important to get the police onside. He is hoping for a government decision within weeks. “This is the prime minister who legalised cannabis,” he says of Justin Trudeau. “I think there’s a willingness to experiment with approaches that will save lives.”
But not everyone is convinced that decriminalisation alone will save lives. “In practice, it’s not going to be particularly effective in the short term,” says Scott Bernstein of the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition. Suppliers will continue to poison the west coast’s heroin with fentanyl, and only a small portion of users will have access to safe-supply programmes.
And safe-supply schemes, too, have shortcomings if not managed properly. Like many addiction-medicine specialists, Lori Regenstreif, a physician at McMaster University in Ontario, says she is worried that the government is encouraging the “overprovision of prescription-opioid consumption, without proper supervision” under the safe-supply scheme.
She knows of many people who take the easily obtained hand-outs of hydromorphone tablets, sell them on the street because they are not strong enough, and buy fentanyl on the black market. This, she says, means the government may be worsening the problem, not solving it. ■",2
1501,"TRADE COFFEE shifted under 1m bags of whole and ground beans between beginning operations in April 2018 and the start of the pandemic in March 2020. By the start of 2022 it will have sold another 4m or so, says its boss, Mike Lackman. It has benefited from a covid-era craze for subscriptions. Confined at home, consumers round the world hit “subscribe” on all manner of boxes delivered to their doorsteps, from drinks and meal kits to scented candles, razors and underwear. Sales in America surged by over 40% during 2020 to $23bn according to eMarketer, a research firm. But hanging on to those customers as lockdowns start to ease will be hard.
Investors like a business which offers recurring sales and oodles of data on customers. The Subscription Trade Association reckons global revenues grew at an average annual rate of 17% between 2014 and 2019. That encouraged venture-capital firms to invest close to $3bn worldwide in online subscription firms between 2018 and 2020, according to PitchBook Data. But finding customers is pricey and keeping them has proved hard, given high cancellation rates among those who find themselves tossing away unused products at the end of the month. Shipping costs nibble away at margins.

Competition has intensified, both from a fresh influx of startups and large established firms that have launched or acquired their own services. Early entrants such as Walmart, which introduced Beauty Box in 2014 featuring popular cosmetic brands, and Unilever, a British consumer-goods giant, which bought Dollar Shave Club for $1bnin 2016, have been joined by the likes of URBN, which owns fashion brands such as Urban Outfitters. In 2019 it launched Nuuly, a clothing-rental service.
More firms are fighting over a pie that will expand more slowly as customers return to physical shops. Companies such as Mr Lackman’s are trying to adapt. He is giving subscribers more flexibility over how often they receive coffee. Stitch Fix, an online clothing marketplace, has introduced one-off purchases.But acting more like a regular online retailer diminishes the advantages of selling subscriptions, and may not stop shoppers from clicking the “unsubscribe” button.

1502,"The Chinese government widened its crackdown on businesses that don’t toe the Communist Party’s line, targeting private tutoring, an industry worth $100bn in revenue, which it decreed can now only operate without profit. Foreign investment will be restricted, no new licences issued, and curbs on teaching hours introduced. The constraints are harsher in tone than those imposed on the tech industry, but Chinese tech stocks swooned as investors wondered whether a broader clampdown was on the cards.
Tencent’s share-price fall was among the steepest; it shed a sixth of its value. The Chinese tech giant has suspended new registrations on its WeChat social network while it upgrades the platform to comply with the government’s latest edicts for the industry.

SoftBank is reportedly selling about a quarter of the stake it holds in Uber to offset the heavy losses from its holding in Didi Global, China’s biggest ride-hailing company. Didi’s market value slumped when Chinese regulators targeted it for investigation recently.
Meanwhile, China’s securities regulator approved a secondary listing of shares by state-owned China Telecom on the Shanghai stockmarket, which could raise $8.4bn.
Zomato’s IPO was a roaring success in Mumbai. The food-delivery app is the first of several tech firms in India to whet investors’ appetite with a market flotation. Paytm, a fintech firm, is next. Both it and Zomato count Jack Ma’s Ant Group among their backers.
Robinhood, a trading app used by hordes of small investors to buy and sell stocks, not least the “meme” variety, priced its shares at the lower end of its target range ahead of its debut on the Nasdaq stockmarket. The unconventional broker has taken an unconventional approach to an IPO, eschewing the usual boardroom presentations to institutional investors and selling a third of its shares to its customers.
The jabbed and jabbed-nots

In its latest outlook, the IMF said that access to vaccines had become the “principal fault line” for the world economy, separating emerging markets and low-income countries, which are grappling with surging infections, from advanced economies. The fund increased its projections of growth for the rich world this year, but shaved its estimate for less-developed regions. It does expect all countries to have gained broad access to vaccines by the end of 2022.
Pfizer said it now thinks revenue from the vaccine it developed with BioNTech will reach $33.5bn this year. The drug company is selling its doses for profit (as is Moderna). AstraZeneca and Johnson  Johnson have said they will not make a profit from their vaccines until the pandemic ends.
South Korea’s economy was 5.9% larger in the second quarter than it was a year earlier, during the depths of the pandemic. On that measure exports also rebounded, as they have in other countries. But by comparison with the first quarter of this year GDP expanded by just 0.7%, the slowest pace since the middle of last year.
Facebook doubled its net profit in the second quarter, year on year, to $10.4bn. Its revenue from ads soared, suggesting that Apple’s new privacy policy, under which iPhone users must give their clear consent for ad data to be collected, has had little impact on Facebook’s business so far.
America’s other tech stars also reported stellar earnings. Apple’s quarterly net income of $21.7bn was driven by iPhone sales; it is on track for a record profit for its fiscal year. Alphabet reported its best-ever quarter for revenue and profit, of $18.5bn, boosted by online advertising as economies reopen. And Microsoft had another bumper three months as the pandemic boon to its cloud-computing and Team communications businesses helped generate a profit of $16.5bn.
A report by a law firm into Credit Suisse’s dealings with Archegos Capital Management delivered a damning verdict on its risk management. The Swiss bank lost billions when Archegos went bust in March. The report highlighted how it had focused on short-term profits, and failed to see the hazard in Archegos’s “voracious” hedging of stocks. Credit Suisse said the incident had been a “turning point” and it was now taking a more “conservative” approach to risk.

All visitors from America and the European Union who are fully vaccinated will no longer have to quarantine upon arrival in most of Britain (they will still have to take covid-19 tests).

1503,"THE HIGHWAY nearly 500km long that links Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, to its second city, Kandahar, was once hailed as a sign of great progress in America’s campaign to pacify Afghanistan. When Hamid Karzai, then president, inaugurated the first stretch in 2003, he said it was one of the best days of his life. Yet the road quickly became a troubling example of what was going wrong. A month after the Taliban took power, the journey from Kabul to Kandahar illustrates both how the country changed overnight and the failures that helped precipitate that shift.
Only weeks ago, driving down this stretch of Highway 1, a sort of national ring road, was unthinkable for many Afghans. Impromptu Taliban checkpoints stopped traffic and scoured buses and taxis for members of the armed forces to kidnap or kill. Military convoys were blown apart by bombs hidden under the road. Some districts, such as Saydabad in Wardak province, not far from Kabul (see map), became notorious as danger spots.

The biggest dangers have subsided now that the very fighters who once attacked the road are the ones guarding it. The Taliban’s checkpoints are still there, but now they are formal, waving traffic through. By contrast, the American-built security posts which lined the road in an unsuccessful effort to protect the route are already decaying. Some fly the white banner of the Taliban. Others are deserted. In the oldest, scrap merchants have removed the wire holding up the giant sandbags that ring the outposts. All that remains are sinking cubes of earth being reclaimed by the desert.

With the danger of attack gone, it is the quality of the road that is the biggest ordeal. When the resurfaced road was first opened, it could convey drivers from city to city in six hours. The same journey now takes nearly twice as long. Bombs have destroyed some stretches; overladen lorries have carved deep ruts into others.
Road-building was once the second-biggest beneficiary of international aid. NATO generals saw it as a way to win hearts and minds. But the deluge of cash, more than $4bn, attracted the sort of corruption that undermined most development schemes. Road-builders subcontracted their work and skimmed off as much as they could. The resulting highways were of poor quality and quickly fell apart, owing not just to explosions but also to more mundane and predictable problems such as flooding and heavy traffic. Other failed development projects line the road, including several electricity substations, complete with pylons but no power cables.
For the residents of rural Wardak, Ghazni and Zabul provinces, the foreigners’ efforts were of questionable value, says a journalist in the city of Qalat, in Zabul. “The whole focus was on the centres and I could not see any development in rural areas,” he says. “That’s why people started rising against the government.” The war over the road also brought night raids, air strikes and disappearances to the districts. Both sides were ruthless.
The Taliban, too, see the road as important. Just like the previous Afghan government and its foreign backers, they boast of road-building. On September 10th the public-works ministry announced that it had started “comprehensive reconstruction work” and engaged two construction companies to build three bridges and 40 culverts. With foreign aid frozen, the Taliban have little money for such works, but they have the benefit of security.
Those who once fought over the road are returning to their normal lives. At a wholesale dried-fruit market in the backstreets of Qalat, labourers weigh sacks of raisins. One has just returned to work after eight years in the fields with the Taliban. Eyeing this correspondent warily, he asks a friend: “Is he left over from the last lot of foreigners, or have new ones arrived?”

1504,"MYAWADDY, A TELEVISION station owned by the Burmese army, is normally so bad as to be unwatchable. But when the residents of Naypyidaw, Myanmar’s capital, and Yangon, its largest city, woke on February 1st to find soldiers in the streets and martial music blaring from their radios Myawaddy became “must-see TV”. It was a Myawaddy newsreader who announced that the country was in a state of emergency and under the control of Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the army.
Soldiers were stationed in government offices. Airports were closed and, in the cities, the internet shut down. Hundreds of politicians from the National League for Democracy (NLD), which won an overwhelming victory in the country’s parliamentary elections last November, were put under house arrest. The armed forces also rounded up chief ministers from all the country’s 14 states in addition to democracy activists, writers, three monks and a film-maker, Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi. Aung San Suu Kyi, who became a figure of global renown when she led the NLD from house arrest during the 1990s and 2000s, and who as “state counsellor” was the country’s undisputed civilian leader, now finds herself under lock and key again.

The army, known as the Tatmadaw, is used to being in charge. When created through conquest in the 19th century, British Burma lumped together over 100 different ethnic groups. After independence in 1948 many of those groups promptly rebelled against the new government. The army, then as now dominated by officers from the Bamar ethnic majority, began a suppression of such separatism that has gone on ever since. After toppling a democratically elected government in 1962 it stayed in power almost continuously for nearly 50 years, justifying its rule on the basis that it was the only institution capable of holding the country together. In 1988 it savagely quashed a democratic uprising.
In 2011, though, the Tatmadaw amazed the world by making way for a civilian government. There were two reasons. The first was that they were worried about the country’s direction of travel. Decades of diplomatic isolation by the West had forced Myanmar into China’s orbit, something the generals were uneasy about. They were also embarrassed about the country’s economy, which they had driven into the ground. In 1962 Burma had been one of Asia’s richest countries. Fifty years later it was one of the poorest. In 2008 the regime’s woeful response to Cyclone Nargis, which killed 140,000 people, destroyed any vestiges of credibility it might still have had.
The second reason for allowing a civilian government was that the Tatmadaw thought it could do so without really losing power. The generals painstakingly designed a hybrid political system that entrusted the thankless task of governance to civilians but enshrined the Tatmadaw’s independence and many of its powers. In the constitution for this “discipline-flourishing democracy”, as they memorably called it, the commander-in-chief of the army appoints the man who is notionally his boss, the minister of defence, as well as the ministers of the interior and border control. He thus commands all the organs of state security. A quarter of the seats in parliament are reserved for serving military officers appointed to them, which gives the army an effective veto over all constitutional change. Even as tensions rose over the past few weeks, many believed a coup unlikely simply because the constitution already protects the Tatmadaw’s interests so well.
Ms Suu Kyi’s NLD boycotted the first elections held under this new constitution in 2010, ushering in five years of rule by Thein Sein, an ex-general, and his Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), a proxy for the Tatmadaw. But in 2011, following talks with Mr Thein Sein, Ms Suu Kyi engaged in the process. After success in by-elections the NLD won a landslide victory in the general election of 2015.
The army had tried to ensure that, even if her party won at the polls, Ms Suu Kyi could not herself wield power. The framers of its constitution included a novel clause that bars anyone with foreign relatives from the presidency; it is in no way a coincidence that Ms Suu Kyi has two British sons. It was to circumvent this obstacle that, after the NLD took office in 2016, parliament created the new position of state counsellor.
Best laid plans
The generals were able to take some consolation from the fact that, having achieved power, Ms Suu Kyi did not use it very well. A lacklustre performance was to some extent unavoidable, given the constitutional constraints that stopped her from exerting power over the army and the weakness of all other governmental institutions. But the state counsellor added unforced errors. At first she surrounded herself with ministers whose only credentials were loyalty and grey hair, and though some of the duffers were later replaced with technocrats her management wasted their potential; she brooked no dissent and refused to delegate. The economy was sluggish; the country’s precariat grew. Though Ms Suu Kyi continued peace talks with various separatist factions begun under Mr Thein Sein, she alienated many minorities by refusing to take their grievances seriously or to include their representatives in government.

General Min Aung Hlaing had particular reason to hope that this poor record would be reflected in November’s vote. He was due to retire from the armed forces this coming July and appears to have harboured hopes of becoming president; he has a hunger for “raw power”, says David Mathieson, an analyst based in Thailand. With a quarter of the seats in parliament occupied by loyal officers come what may, a reasonable showing by the USDP would have produced a legislature happy to vote him into office even if the NLD was the biggest party.
It was not to be. Myanmar’s system of first-past-the-post constituencies gave the NLD 83% of the elected seats in parliament; the USDP got just 7%. The USDP promptly made allegations of fraud to the electoral commission, which administered the poll. The commission denied them.
There were some problems with the election, and the government refused to allow any voting in some places, citing fears of violence. The same had been done in 2010 and 2015, but this time the no-vote zones in the states of Bago, Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine and Shan were significantly larger. Nonetheless, independent election observers, including those from overseas, agreed that there was no proof of fraud on a scale sufficient to overturn the NLD’s landslide victory.
The army, which thought its handcrafted constitution would never see it in the minority, faced the prospect of taking up permanent residence there. And General Min Aung Hlaing’s personal ambitions were dashed. He still “needed something to guarantee his legacy, his liberty and his family wealth,” says a Western diplomat based in Yangon. But, denied the presidency, “He didn’t have a plan B.”
In a conscious or unconscious echo of what was going on in Washington, DC, the Tatmadaw took up the USDP’s cry of “terrible fraud”. By January 26th its spokesman was refusing to rule out the possibility of a coup. At crisis talks on January 28th the army demanded that the new session of parliament, scheduled to start on February 1st, be delayed while a nationwide recount of the vote took place. The government refused, and over the weekend parliamentarians duly gathered in Naypyidaw to get on with things—which made it easy for the armed forces to gather them all up at once.
Forwards to the past
In many ways post-coup Myanmar looks familiar. The army is again in charge, but the reasons it had for stepping aside persist. Ms Suu Kyi is again under house arrest, but remains by far the most popular politician in the country.
Her international standing, admittedly, is not what it was. In 2017 insurgents from the Muslim Rohingya minority attacked an army base in Rakhine. The Tatmadaw, in concert with Buddhist mobs, responded by sacking Rohingya villages, killing at least 10,000 and impelling 720,000 to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. Many Bamars cheered the army on.
The generals may have hoped that this violence would see Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel-prizewinning human-rights icon, sacrifice support at home by defending the rights of Rohingyas. She went the other way, refusing to denounce the army’s “clearance operations”. In 2019 she went to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to defend the generals accused of genocide. Her reputation abroad will never recover; at home it was burnished. Her performance at the ICJ probably helped win the NLD their massive majority in November.
The army’s best chance of getting out of the cleft stick into which it has reinserted itself is to delegitimise the NLD and make itself and its proxies more popular. To further the first agenda it argues that its coup was a defence of democracy in the face of the NLD’s stolen election, and carried out in a perfectly proper way. The state of emergency was, as the constitution requires, enacted by the president—albeit a rather fresh one, as Myint Swe, a retired general, had been elevated from the vice-presidency only minutes earlier, following the detention of the former president, Win Myint of the NLD. Ms Suu Kyi’s detention is justified by the charge that she had improperly imported walkie-talkies—a charge which puts her at risk of being barred from office. Most of the other politicians originally detained have since been released.
The commander-in-chief will try to “position [his administration] as a more effective government, relative to the NLD,” says Tom Kean, editor-in-chief of Frontier, a magazine based in Yangon. General Min Aung Hlaing has said that his government will focus on battling covid-19, boosting the economy and brokering peace with insurgent forces.
International sanctions might put paid to his hopes of economic growth—but they are not a foregone conclusion. Since 2019 America has had specific sanctions aimed at General Min Aung Hlaing and three other officers associated with the pogroms against Rohingyas. President Joe Biden has threatened to reimpose broader sanctions lifted after the elections of 2010. Such sanctions might well, as they did during the years of military rule, hurt the poorest members of a highly unequal society most. Myanmar’s army rulers and the business networks and smuggling rackets they patronise, used to such constraints, would be much less affected.
One of those sceptical about a policy of isolation may well be the Indo-Pacific tsar in Mr Biden’s National Security Council, Kurt Campbell, who from 2009 on orchestrated America’s rapprochement with Myanmar under Barack Obama. On past form he will argue that engagement with Myanmar is the only hope of getting the democratic process back on track.
Part of Mr Campbell’s strategy in the 2010s was to play on the Tatmadaw’s worries about China’s power over their isolated country. Those fears, like the other drivers behind that opening-up, are still apparent today. The army is wary of Chinese support for insurgencies along their shared border. Chinese interests are deeply embedded in the country’s dysfunctional economy, easily discerned in arms sales, infrastructure projects, an army of small traders and border enclaves that are havens for gambling, smuggling and money-laundering.
The fact that Chinese state media described the coup as no more than a “major cabinet reshuffle” suggests that the Chinese government, which had been wooing Ms Suu Kyi, is keen to be on good terms with the new regime. Myanmar offers it a strategically crucial direct route to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean beyond—a way for China’s imports of oil and gas to bypass the potential chokehold of the Malacca Straits and for exports to be shipped out of its inner provinces. In time it could be a military foothold, too.
The physical manifestation of these strategic desires is the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, over $21bn-worth of country-spanning projects including a railway, oil and gas pipelines and a deepwater port at Kyaukphyu. These projects were troubled even before the uncertainty injected by the coup. It is far from clear how Myanmar can pay for them all. And the links run through the territories of various ethnic minorities, including, in Rakhine, the territory where the ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas took place. Chinese-backed construction is more likely to inflame existing ethnic conflicts in such places than to bring peace and development.
The wars at home
While outsiders vie for favour and seek to engineer an outcome they prefer, political opposition inside Myanmar may be weak. On February 3rd staff at 70 hospitals in 30 towns went on strike. The following day, a small demonstration took place in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second city. The All Burma Federation of Student Unions, which played a role in the seminal protest movement which saw Ms Suu Kyi emerge as a leader in 1988, is planning protests across the country, according to Wai Yan Phyoe Moe, the organisation’s vice-chair. But the NLD itself is in disarray. “Without [Ms Suu Kyi’s] leadership in the short term, I think it will be difficult for the NLD to respond cohesively to this challenge it now faces,” says Mr Kean.

Nay Phone Latt, an activist and political prisoner under the last junta, suspects that at least for the moment people would prefer to express their dissent on social media rather than in the streets, daunted as they are by the twin risks of catching covid-19 and provoking the army. “We saw such brutal crackdowns in the past,” he says. After the coup’s initial restrictions on internet use were eased (they were too disruptive to business) criticism flooded social media, leading the regime to order internet providers to block Facebook, widely used in Myanmar, for four days from February 4th. In the longer term the Tatmadaw has other weapons at its disposal, like disinformation. Mr Wai Yan Phyoe Moe alleges that the army is already trying to sow doubt about the true identities of protesters in order to foment instability.
As these fights continue online, others will be fought on the ground. General Min Aung Hlaing’s talk of reinvigorating peace talks needs to be read in the context of the army’s belief that negotiation works best from a position of strength. “[The coup] is a precursor to a much more aggressive [military] approach,” says Avinash Paliwal, of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He believes that the Kachin Independence Army, one of the more powerful armed groups, has privately warned its rank and file to “prepare for the worst”. It may not escape the junta’s notice that more intense fighting could offer a pretext for extending the state of emergency.
Attending to health and the economy while refraining from violence in the Bamar heartland may win the new regime the support it needs for the next election to produce a parliament more to the Tatmadaw’s liking. To help things along it has already appointed loyalists to a new election commission, and Ian Holliday of the University of Hong Kong suspects that it may seek a way to ditch the first-past-the-post system which has amplified the NLD’s parliamentary majorities.
Their aim is not inconceivable. Most Burmese adore Ms Suu Kyi. But their views on democracy are ambivalent. Although 87% of those surveyed in 2019 by the Asian Barometer Survey say that they support democracy, two-thirds believe it neither promotes economic growth nor maintains order. Nearly half support a role for the Tatmadaw in politics—more than in 2015.
But having had a taste of democracy for the past five years, many Burmese will be loth to give it up. “We are afraid of being beaten or killed or shot,” says Mr Wai Yan Phyoe Moe. “But we have also seen that many people have sacrificed their lives fighting injustice during the military dictatorship in past decades. This time it is our duty to end the injustice.”■",2
1505,"IN RECENT YEARS the presidential palace in Kabul, known as the Arg, or citadel, has been an oasis of calm in a bustling, nerve-racked city. To get to it, visitors must negotiate a mile of checkpoints, staffed by increasingly well-armed Afghan army commandos. Inside the 19th-century courtyard, Afghan government officials would sip lattes from a smart cafe, surrounded by well-tended gardens, and discuss the politics outside, in the real Afghanistan. When your correspondent last visited officials from the National Security Council explained that in their view, the Taliban were weak. The only reason that they had not been defeated by Afghanistan’s American-supported army, in the view of those officials, was that the government of Afghanistan did not want to endanger civilians by going on the offensive. “They cannot win a military victory,” one official said. “Our special forces are very strong. The Taliban can only hit and run.”
On August 15th helicopters were shuttling back and forth to the Arg evacuating those same officials. A plume of smoke emerged from America’s fortress-like embassy as staff burned sensitive documents. Barely a month since President Joe Biden declared that “there’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof” of the American embassy, as in Saigon in 1975, helicopters were pictured hovering above the compound, shuttling diplomats to the airport.

Meanwhile, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s spokesman in Doha, the capital of Qatar where the militants have their diplomatic and political outfit, declared magnanimously that Taliban forces would stop their advance at the gates of the city while negotiations for surrender continued. Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan since 2014, was reported to have fled the country with his closest aides. The Afghan state, built over two decades with trillions of dollars, seems to have vanished into thin air.

How did a government with 350,000 soldiers, trained and equipped by the best armies in the world, collapse so quickly? In 1975 the North Vietnamese army, backed by a superpower, still took months to advance through South Vietnam, fighting hard for territory. The Taliban, thought to number no more than 200,000 soldiers, armed mostly with equipment they have seized from their enemies, have taken all of Afghanistan’s urban centres in little more than a week, generally without much resistance (see map). The answer seems to be that what they lacked in brawn, they made up for in brains, determination and political shrewdness. For the past year, diplomats in Doha had hoped that the Taliban could be compelled to negotiate with Mr Ghani’s government to agree to some sort of power-sharing agreement. The insurgents evidently realised it would be more profitable to negotiate with Mr Ghani’s underlings, city-by-city, and thereby simply pull the rug out from underneath him.
Hence in Herat, a jewel of a city near the Iranian border, Ismail Khan, the warlord who took the city back from the Taliban in 2001, after fighting for days, surrendered and was filmed, in captivity, pleading for “a peaceful environment”. In Kandahar, the city at the heart of Afghanistan’s southern breadbasket and the birthplace of the original Taliban, the governor was pictured handing over to his Taliban counterpart. In Jalalabad, in the east, the Taliban marched in without firing a shot, after elders in the city negotiated a surrender. Mazar-i-Sharif, a northern city which once served as a bastion of anti-Taliban resistance in the 1990s, folded in similar fashion.

In each case, the militants have made wide-ranging promises, to “forgive” those who served in the American-backed government, in exchange for surrender. In Kandahar, former soldiers who surrendered have been issued with laisser passer documents that they can show at Taliban checkpoints. There, throughout Friday night the sound of gunfire echoed throughout the city. According to residents, it was mostly fired in the air in celebration.
The Afghan army, for all its apparent strength, seems to have fallen to what might be called Yossarian syndrome, after a character in Joseph Heller’s second-world-war novel, “Catch 22”. Yossarian was asked what would happen if everyone thought as he did that fighting was pointless, and replied he would “be a damned fool to feel any other way, wouldn't I?” Similarly, the Washington Post quoted one Afghan officer explaining why his soldiers would not stop the Taliban: “Brother, if no one else fights, why should I?” Afghan military morale was not helped by the government's fiscal crisis, which has led to government staff and troops missing pay for months.

_______________
What does the Taliban takeover mean? For all their promises to show mercy in victory, few among Afghanistan’s intellectual elite are reassured. After the militants took Spin Boldak, a town on the Pakistani border that was among the first to fall in late July, credible reports emerged quickly afterwards of dozens of government supporters being massacred. In Kandahar in late July, when the militants began to take the outskirts of the city, they kidnapped Nazar Mohammad, a popular comedian, and murdered him. Reports from Kandahar say that armed Taliban have been going door to door seeking out people who worked for Western governments. In recent weeks, thousands of refugees have collected in Kabul’s parks. Hundreds have mobbed visa-processing centres, hoping for a space in the last-minute evacuations being organised by Western powers.
The Taliban’s political arm in Doha has claimed that they are no longer the bloody theocrats who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, when accused criminals were publicly executed at Kabul’s football grounds, including women who were stoned to death for adultery. Their negotiators have stressed that there is no rule in Islam against the education of women, for example. Yet the disconnect between statements made from Qatar and what is being done by Taliban commanders in Afghanistan is now canyon-sized. In Herat, where 60% of the students at the university were women, they have reportedly already been ordered back to their homes. Female employees have been told to give up their jobs to male relatives. On the education of girls one Taliban commander, interviewed by the BBC, was crystal clear. “Not a single girl has gone to school in our village and our district… the facilities do not exist and we wouldn’t allow it anyway.”

Even the best possible outcome, where the Taliban’s leadership decides to show it is serious about reform, looks bleak. For sure, Afghanistan’s government has made only fitful progress in raising the quality of life for ordinary Afghans, even in cities, where it has had far more control than in the countryside. Its corruption has been deep and galling, and no doubt part of the reason the Taliban were able to conquer the country so effectively. Footage of Taliban soldiers walking through the opulent interiors of the captured house of Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord and former vice-president, who is said to have fled to Uzbekistan, underline the rottenness of the state. And yet, buoyed by a tsunami of aid money, the government did educate people, and few Afghans starved. As embassies close and foreigners flee, the aid that has sustained the country’s economy, and helped to educate its children, including girls, will now surely dry up. A humanitarian catastrophe could quickly follow.
The humiliation of America and its Western allies could hardly be more severe. Once the evacuation of their nationals—and of those few Afghan workers lucky enough to get a ticket out—is over, Western governments will have little choice but to accept that the Taliban are in power. In the late 1990s, the Taliban government was recognised by only a handful of countries, notably Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Back then, the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, a collection of militia concentrated in Afghanistan’s north, held out against the Taliban; this time round, the group was savvy enough to knock out the north first. Today Taliban officials have already met with diplomats from several other powers. In late July a delegation of Talibs met China’s foreign minister. Russia’s embassy has declared that it will not evacuate from Kabul. The European Union has promised to “isolate” the new government if they seize power through violence. That seems less and less credible by the minute.
Editor's note (August 15th 2021): Several details of this article have been corrected and updated since publication.",2
1506,"Editor’s note: On November 11th, after The Economist was published, Memorial, the human-rights group mentioned throughout this briefing, announced that Russian prosecutors have demanded it be shut down for violating the “foreign agents” law described in the article.
ON OCTOBER 14TH Twins Garden, in Moscow, was among the first Russian restaurants ever to be recognised with Michelin stars. In celebration it treated guests from the beau monde to magnums of Bollinger alongside its signature “sea urchins with citrus and shiso leaves” and innovative “3D-printed bean ‘squid’ with asparagus and black caviar”. From its rooftop terrace overlooking Pushkin Square guests could marvel at Moscow’s beautifully lit skyline. Below them pedestrians strolled along recently repaved streets lined with cafés and boutique shops, or rushed to catch the new production of “Tosca” at the Bolshoi. Delivery bikes sped back and forth attending to the needs of those staying at home—or stuck in their offices.
The diners might also have made out, less than a kilometre away, the building housing Memorial, Russia’s oldest human-rights organisation, which was at the time being stormed by masked thugs. Dozens of them, accompanied by state TV crews, crashed into a screening of “Mr Jones”, a film by Agnieszka Holland, a Polish director, about the famine Stalin inflicted on Ukraine in the early 1930s. The thugs jumped onto the stage and pumped their fists in the air, shouting “shame”, “fascists” and something about Goebbels. When the police arrived, they used a pair of handcuffs to lock the building’s doors closed, sealing the staff inside until the small hours of the morning.

In 1987, when Memorial was set up to document Stalinist repressions, the state was holding about 200 prisoners of conscience. Today, according to Memorial’s count, Russia has at least 410 political prisoners. On the day the Michelin stars were awarded, Vyacheslav Egorov, an activist involved in protests against a landfill site in a historic town near Moscow, was sentenced to 15 months in prison. A few days earlier, Sergei Zuev, the rector of the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences (known as Shaninka), one of the country’s leading independent universities, was taken to a prison cell from his hospital bed; the university faces closure. After being released and undergoing cardiac treatment he was jailed again on November 9th.
On October 27th Gleb Maryasov, a libertarian activist, was sent to a penal colony for ten months for blocking roads during a protest in January. On October 29th, the day on which the victims of Stalin’s repression are commemorated, four Crimean Tatars were sentenced to 12-17 years in jail. Hardly a day goes by without someone being fined, sent to jail, officially deemed “undesirable” or declared a “foreign agent”, as Memorial has been—a distinction which requires targeted organisations and individuals to preface every public utterance, in capital letters, with these exact words in Russian:
THIS MESSAGE (MATERIAL) IS CREATED AND/OR DISSEMINATED BY A FOREIGN MASS MEDIA PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS OF A FOREIGN AGENT AND (OR) RUSSIAN LEGAL ENTITY PERFORMING THE FUNCTION OF FOREIGN AGENT.

The increasing number of political prisoners—there are eight times as many as there were six years ago, according to Memorial—is not a return to Soviet form, as the high life which surrounds the repression bears witness. But the people of late-1930s Berlin would find the mixture of the two quite familiar.
Echoes of that era are also to be found in Russia’s official rhetoric of ressentiment and imperial nationalism. They can be recognised in media images of the male body beautiful, encouraging healthy living, and in laws against homosexual propaganda. They were voiced in a recent speech by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, extolling the country’s “spiritual values and historical traditions” and denouncing the decadence of Western liberalism. Mr Putin took the opportunity to praise Ivan Ilyin, a philosopher who in the 1920s embraced Italian fascism as a model for Russia.
Sitting pretty
For much of his rule, Mr Putin was more readily associated with kleptocracy, fakery and cynicism than with a coherent ideology which inserted the state deep into everyday life. During his first decade in power, the 2000s, economic growth—much of it to the benefit of his friends and former KGB colleagues, but significant amounts enjoyed more broadly—provided more or less all the support his regime needed. In his second decade, when growth faded and protests broke out in large cities, nationalist propaganda and anti-Americanism became more prevalent. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war in Ukraine kept people entertained, excited and on-side. There was repression, but Russia’s ruling elite was more interested in wealth than violence. Literary-minded Russians could take comfort in lines from “Letters to a Roman Friend” a poem by Joseph Brodsky: “You are saying procurators are all looters, But I’d rather choose a looter than a slayer.”
Mr Putin’s regime is now rendering that distinction moot. As Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader poisoned in August 2020 and jailed this year, recently wrote from his prison cell: “An official taking a bribe and a policeman pulling a bag over the head of a prisoner tied to a chair are one and the same person. His law is the superiority of the strong over the weak. The superiority of the interests of a corporation over the rights of an individual. The willingness to commit crimes as an act of loyalty.”
Grigory Okhotin of OVD-Info, a media and human-rights organisation that monitors political repression and provides legal help to its victims, notes a shift in the government’s tactics. Once it wanted to contain, and by doing so deter, political threats. Now it wants to eliminate them. Political power has shifted from civilian technocrats to militarised and often uniformed “securocrats” happier with violence. The regime has moved from being a consensual autocracy supported by co-option and propaganda to a dictatorship resting on repression and fear.
This aspect of Mr Putin’s power has deep roots. In 2015 it claimed the life of Boris Nemtsov, a liberal opposition politician. Having warned of the lethal danger of Mr Putin’s corruption he was subjected to a hate campaign before being shot dead on a bridge next to the Kremlin. But since the summer of 2020 it has been applied more widely. According to a poll by the Levada Centre, also a “foreign agent”, the fear of repression, now shared by 52% of Russia’s population, and of state violence (58%), are at all-time historic peaks, trumping the fear of losing a job, falling into poverty or being struck by natural disaster.
Politics has been banned. Mr Navalny’s organisation has been crushed and declared “extremist”. His entire team has been forced out of the country; their remaining relatives are harassed and persecuted. The father of Ivan Zhdanov, one of Mr Navalny's right-hand men, was put on trial in October. On November 9th Liliya Chanysheva, a 39-year-old politician who ran one of Mr Navalny’s regional offices, was arrested on a retroactively applied charge of “extremism”. She could face ten years in jail.
Open Russia, a pro-democracy organisation funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former billionaire once jailed and since exiled, has been declared “undesirable” and forced to close. Its former boss, Andrei Pivovarov, is facing six years in jail for Facebook posts. Thousands are denied the right to stand for election because of real or imagined association with Mr Navalny—as are 9m people (8% of the electorate) with previous criminal records or dual citizenship, according to Golos, an election-monitoring outfit that is also a “foreign agent”.
One example is Violetta Grudina, who once worked for Mr Navalny in Murmansk, an Arctic port, and who is profiled in a film produced by The Economist and Hardcash Productions (see economist.com/russia-film). After Mr Navalny’s organisation was banned, she decided to stand as an independent candidate in local elections. Her office was vandalised, she was forced into a covid hospital, and then disqualified for being part of an “extremist organisation”.
The crackdown has not been as harsh as some before it. The regime has not used lethal force—at least not in its own name. Many have been allowed—indeed encouraged—to leave the country. This is not a liquidation, nor is it a tyranny built on a cult of personality. Rather it is something cobbled together to retain power in the face of falling popularity and eroded legitimacy. It is similar in kind, if not yet in resistance and violence, to that of Alexander Lukashenko in neighbouring Belarus. It does not thrive on mass mobilisation and hysteria. Its aim is to suppress crowds not excite them. It neither inspires nor requires enthusiasm in the masses.
Maybe this time
Just as well. Mr Putin’s access to the masses is not the easy matter it once was. He was brought to power by television, which then helped him consolidate his control. The public was dependent on the medium that he monopolised. Anything that was not televised did not exist, which was bad news for opposition figures. And that which did not exist could still, when necessary, be televised—as in the case of Ukrainian “fascists” in Crimea.

The rise of the smartphone changed all that. By 2018, 80% of the population was using the internet and 82% of 18- to 44-year-olds were watching YouTube. According to a recent report by Liberal Mission, a think-tank, the share of TV, radio and newspapers in overall media consumption has shrunk from 70% to 45% since the mid-2010s, while online sources’ share has grown from 18% to 45% (see chart 1).
In the same period, trust in Mr Putin has fallen from 60% to 30%. In the 2000s members of the younger generation were among Mr Putin’s most loyal supporters. That has now been reversed (see chart 2), and not just because of internet access. The young feel more disgust at corruption, which deprives them of prospects, and have a more positive view of Europe and America. They resent the state’s increasing intrusions into their lives and they value human rights. But the internet has undoubtedly helped cement those feelings and bring together those who feel that way.

One way of looking at the change is by comparing the three waves of protest in 2011-12, 2017 and 2019. The protests of 2011-12, the largest up to that time, were a response to elections seen as rigged and to the return of Mr Putin, who had previously switched from president to prime minister, to his previous office. They were political protests spurred by political events.
The next protests of comparable size, in 2017, were triggered by a YouTube video. An account of the corruption of Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s prime minister at the time, put together by Mr Navalny, was seen by 4.5% of Russians within a couple of weeks, his supporters say, and its claims were heard by three times as many. Mr Medvedev’s approval rating fell by ten percentage points. Encouraged, Mr Navalny called on people to take to the streets, and they did.
In the Liberal Mission report, Kirill Rogov, a political analyst, argues that “The biggest threat to the regime is not the protest itself, but the reaction of society.” On that basis the 2019 protests were the watershed. Barred from standing himself, Mr Navalny nominated allies to run in Moscow’s local elections. When the Kremlin blocked them, people took to the streets and violence ensued. After the 2017 protests, 40% of the public had sided with the police and only 27% with the protesters. In 2019, 41% sympathised with the protesters and condemned the police violence. The Kremlin lost nearly half of its seats on the city council. The protesters had, for the first time, garnered real support.
That did not mean they were winning. Though Mr Navalny had support in Moscow and some other places, only 20% of Russians approved of him. But 80% now knew who he was. One of the key assets of any autocracy—the apparent absence of any alternative—had been lost. The Russian elite started to talk about succession. So Mr Putin changed the constitution to let himself stay in power indefinitely and reinforced that change with repression.
It has been largely a pre-emptive strategy. Many Russians believe Mr Navalny’s videos showing the extent of the regime’s corruption and think him brave, but few are committed to doing anything about the situation. That is how Mr Putin wants to keep it. The difference in the treatment of those arrested during the protests of 2019 and those arrested in protests at the time of Mr Navalny’s return in January is revealing. In 2019, the vast majority were quickly released with a fine, whereas in 2020 roughly half of the 11,000 arrested were held for up to two weeks. More than 130 criminal cases have been launched in the aftermath, according to OVD-Info.

Facial-recognition technology also allowed the police to make arrests weeks or even months after the main protests—a delayed response that adds to the anxieties of all who participated. Mr Okhotin of OVD-Info argues that such anxiety has become an important instrument of oppression in itself. So has the cynicism of jailing protesters during the pandemic for “violating epidemiological restrictions”, in a country where 80,000 people can be gathered into Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium to cheer Mr Putin. If Mr Navalny tried to inspire a sense of agency, the Kremlin wanted to plunge them back into a state of helplessness.
In 2019 Mr Putin signed a “sovereign internet” law which forced internet providers to install special equipment that allows the state to block, filter and slow down websites. Gregory Asmolov, an expert on the internet at King’s College London, says the goal is not to build a Chinese-style firewall but to influence people’s choices. If people don’t know what they are missing, they will not look for it.
The Kremlin has cracked down on “influencers” and independent media outlets that feed interest in politics, while herding web users towards local social-media networks—which happily share information with the security services—and video-hosting platforms that are easy to control. International services are harried with fines and hobbled with slow download and upload speeds, making video sharing almost impossible. Most Russian opposition figures believe that within two years YouTube will not be available in Russia.
Tomorrow belongs to me
For now the Kremlin seems to have succeeded in applying enough repression, and thus generating enough fear of worse to come, to accomplish its needs.But the screw continues to be turned. For one thing, the repression is not limited to achieving the Kremlin’s political aims; those close to Mr Putin are able to use this machinery for their own ends. Mr Zuev’s persecution, for example, appears to be to some extent collateral damage in a fight between a detained former vice-president of Sberbank, Russia’s largest state bank, and Arkady Rotenberg, one of Mr Putin’s closest business associates.
And Russia’s securocrats are not going to pack their bags and go home when they control a significant and growing chunk of public expenditure. More than 10% of the national budget is spent on internal security. There are a third more police and security staff than active-duty soldiers.

Mariya Omelicheva of the National War College in Washington, DC, points to another self-perpetuating dynamic: she calls it a “repression trap”. Expanding the role of the security services amplifies the Kremlin’s perception of threat at home and abroad, justifying more repression. As long as the regime relies on the demonisation of foreigners—and “foreign agents”—this trap looks set to keep tightening.
So repression worsens even as resistance is held at bay. Protesters know that the people understand the regime’s corruption. According to a Levada survey, 55% found the picture of Mr Putin’s ostentatious wealth and corruption that Mr Navalny posted to YouTube on his return in January convincing. But they also understand that this in itself will not change things, at least not quickly. Only 17% said that the video changed their opinion of Mr Putin for the worse. And increased comforts provide a palliative for some.
On the eve of the last large protest in April, in a candle-lit Moscow café, members of the liberal intelligentsia sat huddled around small tables, bracing themselves for arrest at a protest the following day. Tatiana Gnedovskaya, an art expert, sang for them. Her normal repertoire is Russian and romantic. On that evening, though, she ended her set instead with night-club songs from 1930s Germany. No one needed to ask why. “We, too, have a sense of dark times coming” she said later, “but we continue to live and enjoy our lives while we can.” ■

1507,"WHEN THE evacuation of Saigon began in March 1975, fixed-wing flights were quickly abandoned. Keeping runways open under artillery fire was too difficult. Instead, the American army used helicopters to bring people from all over the South Vietnamese capital to aircraft-carriers in the South China Sea. In landlocked Kabul, the American government does not have that option as it tries to evacuate its own citizens and Afghans who have worked for the United States. And so the scenes beamed all over the world from the city’s airport on August 15th and 16th were not of choppers carrying people to safety, but of an Apache attack helicopter hovering low over the runway to chase off a crowd of desperate Afghans so that planes could take off. The image that people will remember will be that of an air force transport plane taking off with desperate Afghans clinging to its undercarriage, from which they fell to their deaths.
The chaos was predictable. For weeks, flights out of Kabul had been packed with foreigners and those Afghans lucky enough to have passports, visas and money. When the city fell to the Taliban, less than 24 hours after President Ashraf Ghani visited the edge of the capital to inspect its defences, it was inevitable that people would try to flee. The airport is now the only part of Kabul not held by the militants. Instead, it is defended by several thousand American and other foreign troops, many flown in specifically for the evacuation. The Americans have taken over air-traffic control, and their Boeing C-17 transport planes have been leaving packed tightly with refugees. One was reported by Defence One, a website, to have landed in Qatar with 640 passengers, a near record. In one case, the dead body of an Afghan was found in the landing gear of a C-17. A picture showed families crammed into every available space of the cargo bay.

Over the coming weeks, the evacuation could lift away tens of thousands of people. The Pentagon has said that at least 22,000 Afghans who qualify for “special immigrant visas” (SIVs) will be airlifted out, at a rate of 5,000 per day. Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, told her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party that 10,000 will be admitted. Priti Patel, Britain's home secretary, says that the country will take up 20,000 refugees, up to 5,000 of them within a year. It had already planned to evacuate 2,700 people, including 900 Britons and 1,600 Afghans who had worked directly with British forces. How exactly all this will work is unclear. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told a radio show that the government had set a deadline of August 31st to finish its immediate evacuation. But as he noted, choking with emotion, “some people won’t get back.”

The last-minute panic to rescue interpreters and others who have worked for foreign armies could have been avoided. America’s SIV programme has been in existence since 2009. Yet it has been taking years to issue visas to former workers. By June 16,000 Afghan workers and their families had been resettled under the programme, but 18,000 applications were still waiting to be processed. In Britain the government by June had resettled only around 1,300 interpreters and their families. It changed its mind on whether Afghans employed indirectly through contractors ought to qualify as late as August 3rd. The rush now is making up for lost time.
The Taliban, for their part, insist the scramble to leave is unnecessary. They have said they have “no plans to take revenge on anyone”, and have promised a “general amnesty” to government employees and asked them to come back to work. Foreign diplomats have been told that they can stay. The UN has continued to work in many parts of the country. Afghan journalists working for TOLONews, a TV channel, have continued broadcasting; female presenters have even interviewed Taliban officials live on air. But though they have not hindered the evacuation flights, Taliban soldiers are reported to be checking people trying to get into the airport, and preventing many from leaving the country. Thousands of Afghans who might be accepted to fly remain in hiding, wondering if they will be able to escape.

What happens next? Over the past four decades of conflict, millions of Afghans have been displaced within the country’s borders and then spilled into neighbouring countries. The UN counts 2.5m registered refugees, or roughly 6% of the country’s population. Of these, an estimated 780,000 Afghan refugees were in Iran, but the UN thinks a further 2m unregistered Afghans are also there. Another 1.4m registered Afghans have taken long-term shelter in Pakistan. Those are among the largest refugee populations anywhere. Efforts to repatriate some of those people are likely to be stalled, and their numbers will probably swell. Iran is bracing itself for a new influx of Shia Muslims fleeing the anti-Shia Taliban (though it has supported them in their fight against America). It is setting up camps in three provinces along its eastern border.
Many may try to go farther. Even as they evacuate their citizens and local friends, politicians in rich countries are already terrified of a bigger emerging refugee crisis. As many as half a million Afghans may already be in Turkey. Even if fighting does not break out again, many more could flee if the Taliban begin to impose their brutal version of sharia in Afghan cities or if humanitarian aid collapses. As recently as August 5th, ministers from six European countries signed a letter supporting the continued deportation of failed Afghan asylum-seekers (many have halted the practice). Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, has promised to crack down on people-smugglers, saying that “we must anticipate and protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows”. Armin Laschet, the CDU’s candidate to succeed Mrs Merkel after next month’s German election, has said, “We should not send the signal that Germany can take in everyone in need.” German politicians are worried about a repeat of 2015, when more than 1m Syrian refugees arrived. Some Europeans, notably Mrs Merkel, welcomed them, but a nativist backlash soon followed.
Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, called on countries not to “prematurely recognise” the militants. But for now, tens of thousands of Afghans who worked with international forces, as well as their families, have been abandoned. Millions more face an uncertain future. They will be hoping that the Taliban’s promises mean something, but fearing the worst.

1508,"AMERICA HAS a maths problem. Its pupils have ranked poorly in international maths exams for decades. In 2018, American 15-year-olds ranked 25th in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. American adults ranked fourth-from-last in numeracy when compared with other rich countries. As many as 30% of American adults are comfortable only with simple maths: basic arithmetic, counting, sorting and similar tasks. American employers are desperate for science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills: nuclear engineers, software developers and machinists are in short supply. And while pupils’ maths scores are bad enough now, they could be getting worse. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a national exam, 13-year-old pupils’ scores dropped five points in 2020 compared with their peers’ in 2012. The status quo does not add up. But teachers and academics cannot agree on where to go next.
The American maths problem is over a century old, says Alan Schoenfeld of the University of California, Berkeley. In 1890 high school was an elite endeavour: less than 7% of 14-year-olds were enrolled and they were educated in rigorous maths. By the beginning of the second world war, by which time army recruits had to be trained in the maths needed for basic bookkeeping and gunnery, nearly three-quarters of children aged 14-17 attended high school. The cold war sparked a second strategic maths panic in the 1950s. A new maths curriculum, focused on conceptual understanding rather than rote memorising, was developed after the launch of the Sputnik satellite by the Soviet Union. Then that new curriculum was rejected in a move back to basics in the 1970s.

Maths teaching became a worry again when America started to fear being overtaken by Japan. In 1981 the secretary of education appointed a commission to evaluate the curriculum. It produced a report called “A Nation at Risk”. “If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today,” the report reported, “we might well have viewed it as an act of war.”
Since the 1990s, though, maths has become more political. Conservatives typically campaign for classical maths: a focus on algorithms (a set of rules to be followed), memorising (of times tables and algorithmic processes) and teacher-led instruction. Pupils in these classrooms focus on the basics, exploring concepts after obtaining traditional skills, explains Bill Evers of the Independent Institute, a think-tank in Oakland. These methods are familiar to many. For two-digit addition, pupils would be taught a paper-and-pencil method. Add 27 + 45 by stacking 27 over 45. Add up the right column (7 + 5 = 12). Write down the 2, and carry the 1 to the left column. Add up the left column (1 + 2 + 4 = 7). Write down the 7. The answer is 72.
Progressives typically favour a conceptual approach to maths based on problem-solving and gaining number-sense, with less emphasis on algorithms and memorising. In contrast to the conservative strategy, pupils would learn several ways to solve a problem, by using objects and by other means, before learning algorithms. To solve 27 + 45, pupils could add up the digits in the ones place (7+5=12), and then the tens place (20+40=60), and then add them together to get 72. Or they could realise that 27 is 3 digits away from 30. They would add 3 to get to 30. Then add 45 and subtract 3 to get 72. Conceptual maths strategies encourage pupils to find many potential solutions for the same problem to gain number-sense, rather than relying on an algorithm.
Although most teachers agree that maths education in America is sub-par, they have not been able to agree on how to improve it. Copying methods used in highly ranked mathematical nations such as Singapore would be one way. But that would require agreement on what is actually being taught in other countries. According to Mr Evers, successful Asian curriculums reflect the classical position. “What country do you think has totally adopted progressive education and has been a big success? China is very teacher-led. Singapore math is the best in the world. It’s not progressive,” explains Mr Evers. But Mr Schoenfeld reckons countries such as Japan and Singapore implement conceptual curriculums.
Part of the confusion stems from the messy implementation of the most recent maths curriculum, the Common Core. Implemented in 2010 under President Barack Obama’s administration, 41 states and the District of Columbia adopted the principles. Texas, Florida and several others opted out. Despite initially being a bipartisan effort (Jeb Bush and other conservatives supported the Obama administration’s effort), it was eventually criticised by both sides. Some view it as an example of progressive education, while others think it was not progressive enough. Now that test results are rolling in, many conservatives claim that the falling scores show the failure of the Common Core and progressive teachers. But supporters of the current curriculum are not prepared to give up. Whereas NAEP scores declined among 13-year-olds, they stayed steady among nine-year-olds, who would have studied Common Core for their whole school lives.
Further muddling the mess, far-left activists have paired conceptual maths methods with more radical concepts. Many opponents of conceptual maths believe that Common Core, and conceptual maths in general, bans teaching of rote-learning, as in multiplication tables. A prominent maths-education scholar at Stanford University, Jo Boaler, claims that memorising times tables is unnecessary. Conservatives have seized on this idea as an example of liberal activism gone wild. But Mr Schoenfeld claims this does not align with progressive maths values.
Some activists have also paired conceptual maths with “social-justice maths”, the concept that maths should be used to help pupils solve real-world issues and appraise the world around them. Dubbed “woke math[s]” and tagged with headlines such as “In California 2+2=4 May Be Thought Racist” (as a letter to the Wall Street Journal harrumphed), it has done conceptual maths few favours by association.
The maths debate in America is polarised and confused. While other countries implement maths curriculums with a balance of rote and conceptual learning, America continues to swing from one pole to another, decade after decade. Just like the country’s politics, in other words.■

1509,"“THIS IS NOT a sustainable way to live in this country,” declared Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, on August 23rd. He was defending a dramatic shift in covid-19 strategy. Since the start of the pandemic Australia has used an approach dubbed “covid zero”, stamping on outbreaks down to the last case, whatever it takes. From now on, cases will be allowed to rise as long as hospitals can cope with them. The plan is to drop most restrictions once 80% of adults are vaccinated, which looks achievable by the end of the year.
Early in the pandemic Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the Pacific closed their borders and set up quarantine hotels to keep the virus out until vaccines were available. More than 30,000 Australians overseas are waiting to return home because of limits on how many can do so each month. Some who got stuck in India contracted covid-19 there and died. But for most of 2020 life in Australia carried on as usual, with schools, restaurants and theatres open—and no masks in sight. When a covid-19 case slipped through the quarantine wall, meticulous contact-tracing prevented big outbreaks. By August 25th Australia had registered 39 covid-19 deaths per million people, compared with about 1,700 per million in Europe.

But the highly contagious Delta variant, which spread globally this spring, has pushed the zero-covid approach to its limits. “It’s not just that you have to do everything you do better. It actually breaks the system,” says Catherine Bennett of Deakin University in Melbourne. Delta spreads so easily that even if contact-tracers reach an infected person within 30 hours of a positive test, their contacts would already have passed the virus down several chains of transmission, says Dr Bennett.
The only way to curb such outbreaks has been through short lockdowns known as “circuit-breakers”. With more infections slipping through the net, that leads to what Dr Bennett calls an “epidemic of lockdowns”. More than half of Australians have been in lockdown at one point or another since June. Melbourne has seen more than 200 days of lockdowns since the pandemic began. Hence the plan to ditch the zero-covid paradigm and accept that cases, and to a lesser extent deaths, will rise.
How high they will rise depends on how quickly Australians are vaccinated. About a quarter are fully jabbed, compared with 50-60% of Europeans and Americans. In addition, almost no Australians have acquired immunity naturally, through infection. Australia’s campaign got off to a late start because of supply delays. It had pre-ordered large quantities of a vaccine that failed in clinical trials, as well as of the AstraZeneca jab. The distribution of doses to 40,000 family doctors, spread over a vast country, has hit some snags. But vaccination has accelerated in the past week.
Other countries using the zero-covid model are in a similar predicament. All of New Zealand is now in lockdown, as cases have hit their highest level since April 2020. Vietnam’s remarkably successful tracing system has been crushed by Delta. Until April this year the country’s new daily case rate had almost always been in single digits; now it is north of 10,000.
Throughout the pandemic the zero-covid countries have been the envy of the world. The final stretch, however, will be their toughest. ■

1510,"DAVE PARKASH and his girlfriend were strolling down the street one evening in June when an irate man accosted them. Tan Boon Lee accused Mr Parkash of “preying” on his girlfriend, whom Mr Tan, a Chinese-Singaporean, believed was also Chinese, unlike Mr Parkash, who is ethnic Indian-Filipino. He urged the couple to date “people of our own race”. A video of the confrontation went viral and made Singaporeans uneasy. For the country is diverse—nearly three-quarters of Singapore’s residents are ethnic Chinese, 13.5% are Malay, and 9% Indian. It prides itself on how well everybody gets along.
Yet over the past few months several racist incidents have seized public attention. The rising tide of ugliness has provoked a reckoning over race—until recently a taboo subject—which has penetrated even the halls of power. After the episode involving Mr Parkash, a cabinet minister said he was “not so sure any more” that Singapore is “moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony”.

His comment caused a stir. The ruling party sees itself as the guardian of “racial harmony”. It stepped into that role in the 1960s, when deadly riots pitting Chinese against Malays threatened to destabilise the fledgling nation. The city-state’s founding fathers became convinced that they must intervene to defuse tensions. They criminalised racism and anything that would stir up hatred between the races, and designated Chinese, Tamil, English and Malay the four official languages.
They also began funnelling Singaporeans into four categories: Chinese, Malay, Indian or “Other”, depending on the race of their parents. The government was worried about racial enclaves forming in public housing, where some 80% of Singaporeans live. This classification system enabled it to set ethnic quotas in public housing and calibrate the racial make-up of Parliament and even, by controlling immigration, society as a whole.
On one level, the government’s assiduous management of race relations has worked. Racial violence is rare; so too is overt discrimination. Nine in ten Singaporeans surveyed in 2018 by the Institute of Policy Studies, a local think-tank, reported that the level of racial harmony in the city-state was moderate to very high.
Yet tensions between the races have simmered for decades. Chinese chauvinism has deep roots in Singapore, watered by Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister who remained influential until his death in 2015. He believed that Chinese were physically and mentally superior to Indians and Malays. He tried to make Chinese Singaporeans more Chinese, by encouraging people to speak Mandarin and insisting all ethnic Chinese study it at school (though almost all their parents spoke other dialects as their first language). The government opened numerous elite Chinese-medium schools, which were given much more government funding than other public schools. Mr Lee’s Sinicisation programme was intended for ethnic Chinese, but minorities felt pressure to espouse “Chinese” values too, according to Michael Barr, a historian of Singapore.
His successors tread more carefully. Yet they have sustained Chinese privilege. All three prime ministers since independence have been Chinese, and in 2019 a leading politician insisted that is unlikely to change because, he said, older generations are not ready for an ethnic-minority prime minister. The government regulates immigration to ensure that the racial make-up remains stable, which has the effect of maintaining ethnic-Chinese dominance.
For generations, Chinese Singaporeans have been told that they are special, says Mr Barr. “That element has been internalised by a lot of people,” including minorities. Sharvesh Leatchmanan, a 24-year-old student and co-founder of Minority Voices, a website, is ethnic Tamil but grew up wishing he were Chinese. “I changed the way I spoke, I changed the way I dressed, I never had Indian friends, I never spoke Tamil,” he says. He would tell new friends he was mixed-race “so I could say I was ethnically ambiguous, to be included”.
Mr Leatchmanan’s discomfort in his own skin stemmed in part from his experience of being discriminated against as a Tamil. Many minorities say they are treated unfairly. Almost half of Indians and a third of Malays surveyed in 2019 said they faced discrimination when renting a property. More than a third of Malays and Indians polled in 2018 encountered prejudice at work “sometimes” or “often”. Job adverts often solicit applications exclusively from people who speak Mandarin.
Malays, in particular, are marginalised. According to the census of 2020, just 11% went to university, compared with 35% of Chinese and 41% of Indians. The median Malay household income is S$5,700 ($4,200), compared with S$8,000 for Chinese and S$8,500 for Indians.
Stereotypes of Malays as lazy may play a role. In 2019 Peter Chew of James Cook University found that Chinese Singaporean undergraduates rated Malay job applicants as less competent than equally qualified Chinese applicants, and recommended lower salaries. Mr Lee believed that racial differences in performance at school were genetic—an attitude that has lingered, writes Cherian George, a Singaporean scholar at Hong Kong Baptist University.
The government admits that racial harmony is a work in progress but insists that it has protected minorities and improved their lot in life. They are guaranteed representation in Parliament and, periodically, the largely ceremonial presidency (the current occupant, Halimah Yacob, is of Indian and Malay descent). “Self-help” organisations—one for each race—assist needy members of their communities; these groups are chaired by cabinet ministers and partially funded by the government (the rest is paid with contributions automatically deducted from the monthly salaries of working adults). The current soul-searching over racism in itself is a sign of progress; such discussion was verboten until recently.
However, enthusiasm for celebrating cultural differences sometimes wanes where Malays are concerned. Malays share the same ethnicity and religion (Islam) as the majority races in Malaysia and Indonesia, neighbours with whom Singapore has sometimes had testy relations. Until 1977 Malays were excluded from serving in the military because Mr Lee doubted that their loyalty could be relied upon should they fight a war against Malaysia. Today Muslim women in certain public-sector jobs are not allowed to wear headscarves, though Sikh men in the same roles can wear turbans. A Malay-Muslim nurse wonders why this kind of discrimination is needed. She suffers spiritual turmoil each time she removes her veil before starting a shift: “I try to reassure myself that I’m not doing something wrong.”
Far from soothing racial inflammations, the government’s methods may exacerbate them. It is not just that its policies put Chinese on a pedestal. The racial classification system “encourages us to think along those communitarian lines,” says Laavanya Kathiravelu, a sociologist. The nurse, for example, sees herself not as Singaporean but as Malay. In a country where minorities feel belittled by the majority, that’s a recipe for discord, not harmony. ■",2

“WEATHER WAS the ultimate arbiter in the American West,” Marc Reisner wrote in “Cadillac Desert”, his book on water there, published in 1986. Reisner was musing about the great white winter of 1886, which devastated cattle ranching, and the blistering drought that followed. But 135 years later the sentiment still rings true. The West is in the grip of a 22-year megadrought that is the second-worst in the past 1,200 years.
The effects are being felt across the West. Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States, is at its lowest level since it was first filled in the 1930s. Water levels are so low that the Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Interior Department, declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River on August 16th. Reduced snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevadas has turned forests into tinderboxes and fuelled wildfires. Joshua trees, though native to the desert, are parched and dying.

The West, a mountainous region where three deserts meet, is used to drought. Building cities in a place that can resemble Mars required deft engineering and lots of capital. However, the “Millennium Drought'’ is different from its predecessors. Drought refers to a dry period that eventually ends. But now two longer-term trends are at work: climate change, which is making the region hotter and drier, and population growth, as Americans move west. Most of the fastest-growing cities are in the south-west. Phoenix, which gets 18cm (7 inches) of rain a year, grew faster than any other big US city over the past decade.
What can be done? Proper pricing would help. Few things are more precious in the West than water, yet local governments and utilities provide it cheaply. That removes incentives to conserve, aside from neighbourly commitment to the public good. A system that charged people, farms and firms commensurate with their use, and was subject to the laws of supply and demand, would encourage conservation among the more profligate users and prevent costs rocketing for those who may not be able to afford the price of water on an open market—such as poor rural towns or Native American tribes. Such a system would need better metering. If Americans could use an app to see how much water they used, they would find that they consumed more per person than the inhabitants of any other big country.
For pricing to work, the West’s outdated system of water rights will need an overhaul. Agriculture slurps up 70% of the water that flows down the Colorado River, which serves 40m people across the south-west. But in many states, farmers or ranchers forfeit their water rights if they don’t use them. Such “use it or lose it” clauses mean that the reward for conservation can be the loss of one’s livelihood. A law passed recently in Arizona will let people leave water in rivers without jeopardising their rights. Similar schemes are cropping up around the region. Water trading also shows promise. Physically moving water is tricky, but trading within basins, as Australia does, could benefit farmers and cities.
The conservation needed to water the West will require more than just market fixes. Policymakers must accept that a few wet seasons won’t bail them out. One reason water-rationing for the Colorado River basin could be so painful is that rights were allocated based on overly optimistic assumptions about the river’s flows. Some officials would still rather plan for more dams or aqueducts than reckon with the reality of shrinking reservoirs. Instead they should focus on reducing water consumption. In Las Vegas each person uses 47% less water than in 2002, reducing overall usage even as the population increased.
America is rich enough to recycle water and to look after its watersheds. That will help mitigate the effects of climate change. But drought is not a problem unique to the American West. The World Health Organisation estimates that water scarcity afflicts 40% of the global population. The West can be either an exemplar of resilience or a warning to the rest of the drought-stricken world. The region has long been inhospitable. It doesn’t have to become uninhabitable. ■

1512,"WHEN SALIH HUDAYAR visited Tajikistan in 2014, he remembers there being “thousands” of fellow Uyghurs in Dushanbe, the capital. Many of them came from the same city as him, Artush, in western Xinjiang. But since then the number of Uyghurs in the country has dwindled. Mr Hudayar is now an American citizen and the head of a group called the East Turkistan Government in Exile (ETGE), founded in Washington in 2004, claiming to represent the interests of Uyghurs in Xinjiang (or East Turkistan, as some Uyghurs call the region). According to evidence submitted on June 10th to the International Criminal Court (ICC), on behalf of the ETGE and the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, another Washington-based group, China has been working with Tajikistan to round up and deport Uyghurs since at least 2016. The Chinese Public Security Bureau worked with the Tajikistan police to identify any Uyghurs, and then “directly intervened” to deport them back to China. “I knew central Asia wasn’t safe,” Mr Hudayar remembers. “No matter where you go, you have to be careful.”

The lawyers for the two Uyghur groups are asking the ICC’s prosecutor to open an investigation into Chinese officials. They allege that through threats, intimidation and physical force, nearly 3,000 Uyghurs—85-90% of the total population in Tajikistan—have been compelled to return to China, where they are likely to end up in detention camps. The complaint argues that “these arrests, enforced disappearances, abductions and deportations form the first step of a continuum of alleged criminal conduct amounting to genocide and crimes against humanity”. There is no evidence of mass killings of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, but there are credible reports of extrajudicial detentions, torture, sterilisations, forced labour and many other horrors that could constitute crimes against humanity. Uyghur activists will see benefit if the complaint simply serves to discomfit China and draw international attention to its abuses in Xinjiang. But they are hoping for more. If the ICC’s prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, agrees that there is enough evidence of abuses happening in Tajikistan, rather than China, she may then apply to the court’s judges to open an investigation. But even that step would be a long way from actually convicting any officials in China.
The problem for those trying to bring China to book for its abuses of Uyghurs and other minorities is that China, like America and Russia, is not a member of the ICC. Last year the court declined to open an investigation into China’s alleged crimes because it does not have jurisdiction over non-members. Now the lawyers say that they have gathered enough evidence of crimes in Tajikistan, which is an ICC member, to merit opening an investigation. The approach is a fairly novel one. The precedent was established only in 2019, when the ICC agreed to open an investigation into Myanmar, which is not a member, over allegations of crimes against humanity, because some of the effects of the atrocities were felt by Rohingyas in Bangladesh. As well as Tajikistan, the lawyers for the Uyghurs are gathering evidence of deportations from Cambodia and other ICC members to try and strengthen their case.
Chinese officials involved in repressing Uyghurs will not be losing any sleep over the complaint, but the government will be displeased. Even the opening of an investigation would be significant, although the prosecutor will probably take months to come to a decision (last year’s request to investigate China was filed in July, and rejected in December). Since the court was founded in 2002, it has opened a mere 14 investigations, and secured only eight convictions, all of them of Africans. It is inconceivable that China would ever hand over its citizens to the ICC, although the court can issue arrest warrants that would in theory entrap suspects should they step foot in an ICC member state. But the government does not like to be criticised in international forums. When a tribunal in the Hague ruled in 2016 that China had “no legal basis” to claim disputed areas of the South China Sea, the government was furious. It has dismissed the ruling, but continues to argue that its claim on the waters is legitimate. “They don’t give a fuck, except that they do give a fuck, which is what’s interesting,” says Philippe Sands QC, who represented the Philippines in the South China Sea case.
China is not alone in being hard to prosecute at the ICC. Some argue that the court infringes countries’ sovereignty, and America is loth to support an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, which the ICC launched last year. Ms Bensouda’s original request to open an investigation in Afghanistan was rejected in 2019 on the grounds “the relevant national authorities”, ie, America and Afghanistan, were unco-operative—a problem that would also apply to the China and Tajikistan case. But the ICC’s top judges overturned that decision in March 2020, setting a precedent that the court may be willing to proceed without the co-operation of the relevant countries. Should the Uyghur case ever reach a courtroom, the ICC will not try people in absentia; 13 people subject to its arrest warrants are still at large.
But China’s influence in Tajikistan will make this a hard case to pursue. It is Tajikistan’s biggest creditor, and has taken control of much of the country’s border with Afghanistan. The importance of keeping that border secure means that Western aid is also likely to keep flowing to Tajikistan, notes Niva Yau of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think-tank. Between 2005 and 2019 America invested more than $100m in strengthening Tajikistan’s border security, and is increasingly concerned about the border ahead of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. The last thing that America wants is jihadists or Taliban loyalists spilling over from northern Afghanistan into Tajikistan and then into the rest of the world. Tajikistan knows this, and won’t fear consequences from the West if it doesn’t co-operate with the ICC.
Under the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty, Tajikistan is obliged to co-operate with any investigation. But there have been reports of Uyghurs being detained there at China’s behest for at least a decade. It is unlikely to turn on its big brother, and as a Persian country, feels less solidarity with Uyghurs than other central Asian countries with Turkic populations, such as Kyrgyzstan, adds Ms Yau. Other countries in which the lawyers allege that Uyghurs were abused, such as Cambodia, have similarly cosy relationships with China.
Uyghurs are well aware of the scale of the challenge. No one thinks that legal processes alone are the answer to China’s abuses. But an ICC investigation, if it happens, could strengthen the case for further economic and diplomatic responses, as well as giving victims their day in court. Some Chinese officials have already been hit with Western sanctions, and foreign companies are going to greater lengths to distance themselves from Xinjiang. For its part, the ICC has been irritating some powerful countries. Since its founding it has been accused of anti-African bias. But in recent years, it has been setting its sights elsewhere. In March this year, it opened an investigation into the situation in Palestine, much to the chagrin of Israel. The investigation in Afghanistan has annoyed the Americans. Going after China would give it another powerful enemy.",2
1513,"JOSEPH SCHUMPETER, one of the 20th century’s greatest economists, argued that capitalism is shaped by two countervailing forces: creative destruction and popular resentment. Creative destruction drives economic progress but also whips up resistance by destroying old ways of doing things and creating giant fortunes. The historical role of the right is to promote the destruction; that of the left is to mobilise resentment. Schumpeter thought that the left would win in the end. “Can capitalism survive?” he asked himself glumly. “I don’t think it can.”
Schumpeter reckoned without the Conservative Party’s shape-shifting powers. In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher turned it into the party of creative destruction. Boris Johnson rode into power on resentment against globalisation and technological change, winning first an intra-party power struggle over Brexit and then a general election. Conservative MPs now represent parts of northern England that were once flattened on the Thatcherite anvil.

The Tories’ next task is to tackle the root causes of the resentment they so successfully articulated. Critics like to dismiss their stated priority, “levelling up”, as a mere slogan. But as their conference in Manchester, which ended on October 6th, showed, they are as serious about it as their predecessors were about deregulation and privatisation. Levelling up was not only the theme of Mr Johnson’s rollicking address, but also of many of the hundred-odd meetings on the fringe. These featured champions of levelling up, such as Paul Ormerod, an economist who runs the Rochdale development agency and owns the local rugby team. And they were remarkably policy-heavy, with references to Michael Porter’s work on clusters and post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory.
Levelling up means different things in, say, a village with a strong sense of identity but no transport links, and an anonymous housing sprawl near a motorway. Unlike opportunity, ability is evenly distributed, Mr Johnson likes to point out: levelling up means closing this gap. Michael Gove, the secretary of state for the new department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (the “Housing and Communities” bit is silent) adds community to opportunity: “You shouldn’t have to leave the places you love to enjoy the future you crave.” Neil O’Brien, the new minister for levelling up, promises a white paper that will not just give a clear definition of levelling up, but also suggest ways to measure it.
The conference saw some bold examples of what it might mean in policy terms. The most striking was the prime minister’s insistence that he would not buckle to employers’ demands for more immigration: he wants to move from an economic model where immigration is high and wages, skills and productivity are low to the reverse. Three more emerged on the fringe. The first was a shift in focus from the golden triangle of Oxford, Cambridge and London to many mini-clusters, such as wind power in the north-east, plant science in Aberystwyth and nuclear-submarine technology in Barrow-in-Furness. George Freeman, the minister for innovation, pointed out that Britain is good at disruptive innovation, such as fintech, but that such clusters may call for the sort of incremental innovation that require close co-ordination between entrepreneurs and local authorities.
The second is that levelling up cannot work without handing power to local government or community associations. Until very recently, it looked as if the government was pulling back from radical devolution in favour of a more top-down approach. But the overwhelming consensus of the conference was that the grip of the gentleman in Whitehall must be loosened. Mr O’Brien waxed lyrical, not only about giving more power to existing mayors (who represent 40% of the population and a slightly higher share of the economy), but about extending devolution to the counties.
The third is that levelling up is as much about quality of life as about infrastructure and economic development. Rachel Wolf, one of the authors of the party’s 2019 manifesto, argued for paying close attention to small signs that a community is cared for or neglected—such contrasting indications as the prevalence of hanging baskets and graffiti on war memorials. This way of thinking not only strengthens the case for giving people power to make decisions about their own communities, but shifts the policy focus away from conventional tools of regeneration, such as building a new retail park, to smaller, bespoke ways to improve lives.
Is Britain capable of levelling up? It has a long record of promising, and failing, to decentralise its economy and to upgrade technical education. The prime minister’s determination to cut off cheap foreign labour could also prove counter-productive in the short term by starving care homes of carers and road-builders of navvies, and, in the longer term, by slowing growth. Mr Johnson’s allies claim that depriving the labour market of workers will force companies to increase productivity. But economy-wide improvements will not be easy. The population is much older than in the 1980s, when the Tories last set about restructuring Britain. Increasing productivity is also much harder in a service-oriented economy such as Britain’s: such obvious measures as shifting to remote consultations in the health service and remote lectures in universities have provoked widespread opposition.
One more heave
As a classicist, Mr Johnson will be familiar with the tale of Sisyphus, who was punished for cheating death by being forced to roll a boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down every time it neared the top. There is a good chance that, thanks to Britain’s longstanding bias towards London and problems with productivity, levelling up will amount to another such endless, thankless grind. There is no reason to think the economy is less London-centric now than it was when Mr Johnson took over. But there is also no doubt that the Conservatives are determined to put their shoulders to the task. ■

1514,"THERE IS BUT one success story to come out of the Arab spring. Among the countries that toppled dictators a decade ago, only Tunisia emerged as a full democracy. Its free and fair elections, featuring Islamists and secularists, free-marketeers and communists, stand out in a region littered with despots. Liberals consider it a beacon of hope: if democracy could flourish in Tunisia, why not in the rest of the Arab world?
Tunisians don’t see their country as much of a model. Ten governments in ten years have failed to curb graft, improve services or create jobs. The most recent one, led by Hichem Mechichi, struggled to deal with one of Africa’s worst outbreaks of covid-19. On July 25th tens of thousands of Tunisians, braving the heat and defying a lockdown, protested against his inept administration. That night President Kais Saied suspended parliament and seized power.

What a shame that it has come to this. Mr Saied was elected two years ago as a rebuke to the political class. He is popular, in large part because he has no political experience. Many Tunisians celebrated his power grab, hoping that he would clean things up. Yet democracy is a fragile thing and Mr Saied is treating it roughly. His claim to be acting in line with the law rings hollow. Large parts of parliament have rejected his actions, some calling them a “coup”. Already facing economic and health crises, Tunisia now faces a constitutional one as well.
This is not the first time its nascent democracy has been pushed to the brink. Secular and Islamist forces faced off in 2013-14 after two political assassinations. Tunisia’s leaders, urged on by labour unions and civil-society groups, eventually hashed out compromises that saved the system. Since then, though, unemployment has remained high and corruption rife. As in other countries, the coronavirus has added a new layer of instability. Many Tunisians are nostalgic for the period before the revolution, when there was at least the perception of order under Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the last dictator.
However, Ben Ali also left Tunisians angry and despondent (even as he tortured dissidents and plundered the state). A replacement strongman is not the answer to Tunisia’s problems. Does Mr Saied hope to become one? The former law professor strikes many as incorruptible, but also unyielding. Under the constitution, he can suspend parliament for a maximum of 30 days, yet he says he may wait “until the situation settles down”. He has barred public gatherings of more than three people. The police in Tunis have raided Al Jazeera, a media outlet seen as sympathetic to the Islamists of Ennahda, the biggest party in parliament. None of this bodes well for Tunisian democracy.
Mr Saied makes no secret of wanting radical reform of the political system. To begin with, he would like the president to have more power and to get rid of parties and some elections. Such is the dismal state of Tunisia that no idea should be dismissed. But even if he has the solutions to the country’s political problems, Mr Saied will struggle to implement them alone. Supporters of Ennahda, which styles itself “Muslim democratic”, will not roll over. Nor will the other parties pushed aside by the president, who is an independent.
Many Tunisians blame Ennahda for their country’s ills. But Rachid Ghannouchi, its leader and the Speaker of parliament, helped Tunisia through the crisis in 2013-14 by joining a national dialogue and working with Beji Caid Essebsi, a rival at the time. To his credit, Mr Ghannouchi is again being pragmatic. Ennahda has called on its supporters to leave the streets and suggested a new national dialogue. Mr Saied should take up its offer.
Western democracies ought to lend their support. Over the past decade countries such as America and France, Tunisia’s former colonial master, have done relatively little to keep the only true Arab democracy on track. More aid would certainly help. In a sense, the West must outbid Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have opposed the Arab spring. Yet in response to Mr Saied’s actions, America has merely expressed concern.
Ultimately, though, the responsibility for fixing Tunisia falls on its leaders. Painful reforms are needed to bring down big deficits and attract investment. Politicians have squandered a decade by taking, at best, half-measures. Tunisians are right to be angry, but they should not give up on democracy. Rather, when their leaders fail, they should vote them out. ■",2
1515,"WHAT A DIFFERENCE a month makes. In July, during the Eid al-Adha holiday, Tunisia’s health minister opened covid-19 vaccine centres to all adults. The centres were blindsided by his announcement. Large crowds queued for hours, only to be turned away when doses ran out.
The shambles was emblematic of the government’s failure to deal with the pandemic. By August 7th just 17% of Tunisia’s 12m people had received at least one dose. Though case numbers have fallen from their peak in July, the death rate, more than 10 per 1m people, ranks among the world’s worst. Hospitals are full.

On August 8th, though, the government called Tunisians back for another drive. This time workers jabbed more than 551,000 arms—almost 5% of the population—in a single day. Two things had changed since the botched earlier attempt.
First was the arrival of millions of doses from abroad. Saudi Arabia sent 1m last month and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 500,000 more. America delivered 1m doses of the Moderna jab. France, Tunisia’s former colonial ruler, sent 1m as well. All told Tunisia has received 6m doses, says the president, Kais Saied, enough to fully vaccinate a quarter of its people.
Second was Mr Saied’s decision to assume emergency powers on July 25th, when he sacked the prime minister and suspended parliament. It is unclear if he will return power to parliament, call for talks with politicians, unions and other groups or take further steps, such as calling a referendum to change the political system. The glut of vaccines and the political upheaval are related: both are reflections of a struggle for influence in the only country where democracy took root after the Arab spring.
Many Tunisians, fed up with their moribund economy, have greeted the president’s self-coup with cheers or shrugs. GDP shrank by 8.6% last year. Unemployment is 18%—and 30% for graduates. Parliament was paralysed by petty squabbles.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for their part, are enthusiastic. They have long been unhappy about the influence of Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party with the largest bloc of seats in parliament, and have sought to undermine it. Television channels in the UAE, for example, devote ample airtime to Abir Moussi, a demagogue who rails against Islamists (she ran for president in 2019 but won just 4% of the vote).
Neither country has much influence in far-off Tunisia, which has limited ties to the Gulf. But both see an opportunity to gain some thanks to the pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. Since Mr Saied sidelined parliament both the Saudi foreign minister and an adviser to the UAE’s president have visited him to show their support. Many Tunisians believe they dangled the prospect of further aid.
Western countries worry Mr Saied will weaken Tunisia’s democracy, but seem unsure how to react. Since 2011 the EU has sent Tunisia more than €2bn in grants. America has given more than $1bn, and in June pledged $499m over five years for infrastructure. Compared with what other Arab countries receive, these are sizeable sums: annual aid from rich countries to Tunisia amounted to almost 3% of GDP last year, against less than 1% for Egypt or Morocco.
Compared with the size of Tunisia’s problems, though, these amounts are puny. The country’s debt-to-GDP ratio has more than doubled over the past decade, to an estimated 95%. The cost of servicing those loans equals 7% of GDP. There has been some talk in Washington of using American aid as leverage over Mr Saied. But it is probably too small to sway him—particularly if Gulf states can match anything withheld by the West.
The inscrutable Mr Saied, a political outsider elected as a protest against Tunisia’s incapable parties, has offered few hints of where he will take the country. He will have to juggle the competing demands of civil-society activists and politicians wary of his plans; a weak economy that cannot cope with instability; and foreign powers with very different visions of Tunisia’s future. The vaccine drive bought him a moment of goodwill. It may not last. ■",2
1516,"Jeremy Corbyn faces up to a decade in jail if he ever acts as a cheerleader for Hamas again.
Under measures being announced today, the former Labour leader would be treated as a terrorist if he supports the Palestinian group in future. 
Today’s move will see Home Secretary Priti Patel banning Hamas’s political wing as a terrorist organisation.
Until now it has been treated differently from its military wing, which was outlawed in the UK 20 years ago. 
Successive governments have hesitated over taking similar action against the political wing. But Miss Patel will say that approach will change during a visit to Washington. 
Mr Corbyn described Hamas as ‘friends’ in 2009 and later invited members to Parliament. Afterwards he said he regretted using the term. 
Miss Patel said last night: ‘This should be a very strong message to anyone who thinks it’s OK to support an organisation like Hamas.’ 
Under the measures, being a member of Hamas’ political wing, inviting support for it or arranging a meeting backing it will carry up to ten years in prison. 
Wearing Hamas-badged clothing or displaying its flag will carry up to six months. It is understood the measures will be outlined in the Commons today and are expected to become law within days or weeks. 
In a major speech on security in Washington, Miss Patel is set to say Hamas ‘has long been involved in significant terrorist violence. 
'But the current listing of Hamas creates an artificial distinction between various parts of the organisation. It is right that the listing is updated to reflect this. 
'This is an important step, especially for the Jewish community. Hamas is fundamentally and rabidly anti-Semitic. 
'Anti-Semitism is an enduring evil which I will never tolerate.’
Miss Patel urged Labour to support the Hamas measures in Parliament. 
Marie van der Zyl, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ‘The proscription ends the dangerous loophole via which this terrorist organisation can spread its extremist poison here and raise funds and support in the UK.
‘Hamas regularly espouses violent jihad and grotesque anti-Semitism.’ 
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, said: ‘He has never been a supporter of Hamas but recognises the need to bring all sides together for dialogue to promote security, peace and justice.’
In 2010 Mr Corbyn held talks with senior Hamas officials in Jerusalem, but it was claimed he did not meet a single Jewish Israeli. 
Labour later defended the trip, saying he was ‘engaging with actors in the conflict to support peace and justice in the Middle East. That is the right thing to do.’",-2
1517,"FOR AN INSIGHT into the thoughts of teenagers about social-media, TikTok is the place to look. “Anyone else feel like it’s low key kinda cringe to post on Instagram now?” asks one in a clip uploaded to the video-sharing platform in June. It has been liked over 368,000 times. Facebook, which owns Instagram, is under fire after Frances Haugen, a former employee, leaked internal documents suggesting the firm was aware it was causing harm to the mental health of teenage girls in particular. But the internet’s youngest users have been falling out of love with Facebook’s platforms for a while. American children aged between four and 15 spent an average of 17 minutes per day on Facebook in 2020, down from 18 minutes in 2019, according to a report from Qustodio, a security software company. Instagram stayed at 40 minutes, and Snapchat was up from 37 minutes to 47. Screen time on TikTok, meanwhile, surged, from 44 average daily minutes to 87.
These numbers are a consequence of lockdowns, but are also a testament to TikTok’s engrossing “For You” page (FYP), which is powered by an algorithm that serves users an endless stream of videos they might be interested in. Getting featured on it is often an indicator that a clip will go viral (many videos are tagged #FYP to boost their chances), which is part of the app’s thrill. The platform, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has become synonymous with lip-synching teenagers, dances and challenges. And despite interventions from various governments, including the threat of its removal from app stores by former President Donald Trump, TikTok has continued to soar since its launch in 2016: last month it hit 1bn monthly users.

As a newer platform, TikTok also had a chance to learn from the mistakes of its predecessors. It has proposed the creation of a “global coalition” of social platforms to protect users better from harmful content. The FYP makes people internet-famous very quickly—and makes them targets for harassment. To address this, TikTok deleted millions of accounts belonging to users under the age of 13, and limited the use of its more public features from its youngest profiles. It also claims that less than 1% of videos uploaded in the first quarter of 2021 violated its terms of service—and those that did were removed within 24 hours. All this, in theory, ought to mean TikTok is healthier than other social media apps.
The reality is different. Last year the Intercept, a news site, published Chinese moderation documents, revealing a preference to filter out users with “ugly facial looks”, “beer belly” and content that risked “endangering…national honour and interests”. Teenage girls have been targeted with adverts about intermittent fasting. And reports by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think-tank, have found that videos peddling harmful covid-19 vaccine misinformation and white-supremacist content accumulated millions of views before they were taken down by the company. Some of these exploited TikTok’s features, it says, such as trending songs, to extend their reach. The ISD found the firm’s application of its policies to be “lacking in accuracy, consistency and transparency”.
Ms Haugen’s leaks about Instagram have put a spotlight on the platform’s role in perpetuating negative thoughts about body image among teenage girls. A similar culture flourishes on TikTok, too. There are currently 8.8bn total views on videos tagged #whatIeatinaday, a viral trend where mostly young girls document their food diaries, some of which include under-eating. Learning from Facebook’s mistakes, TikTok announced that it would include safety announcements on these videos and do more to direct users to support resources. Yet the lines between what is a direct consequence of social media and what is symptomatic of wider cultural pressures about body shapes are blurred.
Tumblr, a blogging platform, was polluted with content promoting eating disorders and self-harm over a decade ago, prompting the site to censor accounts that were endorsing harmful behaviour. Internet users are wise to moderators, though. Misspellings of hashtags are used on TikTok to bypass censored words. Last month TikTok censored videos tagged “devious licks”—a viral challenge which saw teenagers vandalising or stealing school property—from its search bar. Yet misspellings of the phrase are still accessible and are even suggested by the platform. Similarly, misspelt eating-disorder tags are easily discoverable and the videos tagged under them have thousands of views. One such post, live for a week at time of writing, promotes eating fewer than 500 calories a day.
Most TikToks are innocuous. But like its predecessors, the app has not yet effectively addressed problems that hide in plain sight. If an under-age user wants to create an account, no community guidelines can stop them from lying about their age. If someone wants to view harmful content, they will seek it out. And the features that make TikTok so successful also make it risky: the more a user engages with certain tags, the more the FYP will serve similar content. Much like Facebook’s platforms, in other words. ■",2
1518,"THE MOMENT that Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, on September 16th described the deal as a “stab in the back”, the anger in Paris was plain. The next day, the French recalled their ambassador to Washington, DC (and that to Australia), for the first time since the 1790s. The announcement by America, Australia and Britain of a new security pact (AUKUS), which torpedoed Australia’s A$90bn ($67bn) submarine contract with France in favour of a promise to buy nuclear-powered American submarines instead, has left the French dumbfounded, humiliated and irate. On French television on September 18th, Mr Le Drian accused the trio of “lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt”.
The reaction in France is only partly about the tearing up of a big defence contract, although such decisions are always tough to accept. France has a big enough defence industry to be able to absorb the loss; compensation for breach of contract will be sought. What has enraged the French, rather, is what one source calls the “extreme duplicity and betrayal of good faith” on the part of countries it considers to be close allies.
The French submarine contract was signed in 2016, under the previous Socialist presidency of François Hollande, in the context of a strategic-partnership agreement with Australia. This formed part of French efforts to build up a geo-political presence in the Indo-Pacific and act as a global player in the region in the face of an assertive China. It keeps over 7,000 soldiers there, and regularly patrols through the South China Sea. Nearly 2m French citizens live in the Indo-Pacific, including on French territories such as French Polynesia and New Caledonia. 
On numerous recent occasions, at meetings with representatives of both the Australian and American governments, the French were led to believe that this partnership—and the submarine deal—was intact. As recently as August 30th, at a joint meeting of French and Australian foreign and defence ministers, the two countries made an explicit reference to “the importance of the future submarine programme” and “committed to deepen defence industry cooperation”. Yet two weeks later the Australians tore up the deal. President Emmanuel Macron was kept in the dark until the very last moment. AUKUS is intended to bolster Australia’s naval capability, notably in the South China Sea, and to allow America and its allies to better meet the rising military power of China in the region.“Allies don’t do this to each other,” said Mr Le Drian curtly. “The Americans completely overlooked the fact that this wasn’t just a commercial contract,” says Benjamin Haddad, at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC: “It was the underpinning of France’s Indo-Pacific strategy.”
French anger is directed primarily at Australia and America, rather than at Britain. Hence the recall of only the two ambassadors and not the third. But the decision to bring home the envoys, which Mr Le Drian made at Mr Macron’s personal request, was not taken lightly, and is intended to demonstrate how seriously France is taking this breach of trust. Highly unusual, it is not however the first time in recent years that France has recalled its ambassador to a friendly country. In 2019 Mr Macron brought back his representative to Italy after what he judged interference in domestic French politics during the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) crisis.
It is hard to overstate the current sense of bitterness and grievance in Paris. In the short run, this should not directly affect, for example, operational military cooperation between France and America in the Sahel. France keeps over 5,000 troops in this region of north-west Africa as part of an anti-terrorism operation, for which America provides critical intelligence and logistics support.
But the breach of confidence with America and Australia in particular will take time to overcome. It is bound to make France a distrustful player over other matters, and to make it less likely to compromise when it comes, for example, to enforcing Britain’s Brexit divorce agreement with the European Union. It will also force the French, if not to rethink their ability to pursue their own Indo-Pacific strategy, then at least to confront the limits of it when measured against an Anglophone alliance.
The most probable geo-political conclusion that France will draw from all this is that they were right to judge America an unreliable ally, and to seek greater self-reliance instead. In Paris, Joe Biden’s preference for dealing with English-speaking allies makes the pursuit of what the French call “European sovereignty” even more pressing than ever. “America’s behaviour has been unpleasant, but it reinforces an analysis we have already made”, says an official French source, “which is that, for America, allies count for little. So we have to be able to act by ourselves.”
Whether Mr Macron is able to bring fellow Europeans along with him on this matter, however, is less obvious. As it is, Europeans do not agree among themselves what they really mean when they talk about “strategic autonomy”, and tend to be much better at drafting documents about such concepts than building the real capacity needed to operate them. As if to make the point, AUKUS was announced on the very day that the European Commission presented its own Indo-Pacific strategy.
Some in Europe also suspect that, despite Mr Macron’s assertions to the contrary, his real intention has always been to undermine NATO. Others may be afraid of annoying America by making public any sympathy that they might have with France’s position. The submarine deal may have concerned only France, not the EU; but the lack of expressions of solidarity from European friends has been striking. Whatever the challenges of building greater European autonomy, though, after this week’s events a wounded Mr Macron will doubtless conclude that France, and Europe, are left with no other choice but to try. Others, however, may be slow to follow him in any substantial way.

1519,"“PEOPLE REFER to a corner shop, a bar, a tree—even a tree!” exclaims Rolando Granja Enríquez, a postman. For a place with well-developed public services, Costa Rica’s addresses are a conundrum. Nearly everyone uses vague places, distances and compass directions, rather than street-names and postcodes: 200 metres west of such-and-such juice bar, 100 metres north of the house with the pink fence, and so on. Worse, sometimes the landmarks used as reference points have long gone, says Mr Enríquez.
This archaic method may be quaint and infused with local history—indeed neighbouring Nicaragua has a similar system. But it has a high economic cost, says Geovanny Campos, the head of logistics at Correos de Costa Rica, the postal service. Exactly how much is unknown: the last study, over a decade ago, estimated a toll of $720m annually.

The lack of clear addresses obstructs the smooth delivery not only of letters, but of other public and private services, too. Police, for example, may be slow to respond to calls for help if they cannot find the caller. Food takes longer to deliver, resulting in lukewarm chifrijo (pork and beans). The past year has been particularly troublesome, as many Ticos (as people from Costa Rica are known) have stayed at home and ordered goods online.
In 2002 the post office came up with a plan for naming the streets, which became a government decree in 2005. Since then just 30% of Costa Rica’s 82 municipalities have worked with the post office to name their streets. Overall the initiative has been a failure, admits Mr Campos. Other institutions do not seem terribly interested in change. Even in towns where streets and houses have numbers, all too often locals keep using the old way of specifying places.
Despite this the postal system in Costa Rica is fairly efficient. Only around one in 20 letters is returned to the sender because it cannot be delivered. Many companies that will not ship to Mexico, which has a decent address system but tricky customs, deliver to Costa Rica. That is thanks to old hands like Mr Enríquez, who spend years in the same neighbourhood and come to know it and its residents. But what will happen when Mr Enríquez and his colleagues retire?",2
1520,"Apple, which is rapidly losing ground in the electric vehicle industry to Tesla, GM, Ford and other automakers, is looking to have the 'holy grail' option for its autonomous car by 2025: no human intervention at all.
The lack of human intervention, which is being pushed by the project's new boss, Kevin Lynch (who previously led the company's Apple Watch software efforts) would be something that no automaker has yet to achieve, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news.
Tesla, for all the publicity surrounding the Elon Musk-led company, has come under fire from consumers and lawmakers over its autopilot system and how it works.
In August, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the system over 11 accidents - one deadly - feared to have been caused because the system has trouble spotting parked emergency vehicles. 
Other automakers, such as GM and its Cruise unit, Ford and newly public Rivian, do not yet offer completely autonomous capabilities.
Waymo, which recently said it was helping UPS deliver packages for the holiday season, has demonstrated some autonomous capabilities, but there is still human surveillance. 
Prior to Lynch's arrival in the car-related project, which occurred in July, the $2 trillion tech giant had been pursuing a path of creating a car with limited self-driving capabilities, as well as one with fully autonomous capabilities. 
In September, Doug Field, who had been leading the team prior to Lynch's arrival, left the Special Projects Group (also known as Project Titan) for a similar job at Ford.  
The ambitious timing of getting a car on the road in four years is faster than the five-to-seven target some engineers had previously stated, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the thinking.
The fully self-driving car could have a radically different design and may feature no steering wheel or pedals, Bloomberg noted.
It may have an emergency takeover mode even if it does not have a traditional steering wheel, the news outlet added. 
The vehicle could also offer an option that passengers sit on the sides of the vehicle, as they do in the back of limousines or on some buses.
By having a completely self-driving car, it is going after a 'holy grail' in the automotive and tech industries, Bloomberg reported, as both areas have chased the prospect for years to varying degrees of success. 
In addition to the radical redesign of the interior, Apple could also change the infotainment system of its electric vehicle, similar to how Tesla's Model 3 has an iPad-like touch screen in the middle, removing the traditional dashboard.
The car is also likely to integrate Apple's other products and services. 
If indeed Apple achieves this goal, it would be considered Level 5 (the highest level) autonomous driving, which could pose a problem depending upon the state.
'Some states require a human operator to have one hand on the steering wheel at all times – a law that would pose a barrier to Level 3 through Level 5 ADSs,' the NHTSA said in a safety document. 
Level 5, considered to be full automation, denotes that the vehicle is 'capable of performing all driving functions under all conditions,' according to the NHTSA. 'The driver may have the option to control the vehicle.' 
Other levels of automation - Levels 1 through 4 - vary in some degrees. 
Level 3 is deemed as 'conditional automation,' where the driver is a necessity but not required to monitor the environment.
Conversely, Level 4 is known as 'high automation,'  where the vehicle is capable of all driving functions under certain conditions. 
In a note to investors, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the 2025 timeline is in line with his thinking and could be a significant driver for the company over the next few years as the electric vehicle industry transformation happens.
'We continue to believe its a matter of when, not if, Apple enters the EV race and this will add another $30+ per share of [total addressable market] to the Apple growth story over the next few years given the golden age of EV transformation on the horizon,' Ives wrote in the report.
Earlier this month, Apple reportedly hired Christopher Moore, a former Tesla Autopilot software director, who had a disagreement with Musk. 
Apple has not responded to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. 
In September, the company reportedly met with Toyota in Japan to build the car.  
The Cupertino, California-based Apple has long been rumored to be working on a passenger vehicle.
In December 2020, Reuters reported that Apple's Car would include a new 'breakthrough battery technology',' known as 'monocell,' that could radically reduce cost and increase the vehicle's range before a recharge is needed.
A Reuters source said the technology is 'next level,' adding it is like 'the first time you saw the iPhone.'
It remains unclear who would assemble such a car, but analysts have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles.
'We continue to strongly believe Apple ultimately announces an EV strategic partnership in 2021 that lays the groundwork to enter the burgeoning EV space,' Wedbush analysts said in a note to investors earlier this year.
In February, Bloomberg reported that Apple has an initial target of 100,000 cars per year, a far cry from the 1.6 billion Apple devices in active use CEO Tim Cook told investors earlier this year. 
TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously said the car would have a 300 mile range and go from 0 to 60 in less than 3.5 seconds.
Cook, who helms the normally secretive company, confirmed in 2017 that Apple was working on a car-related project.
'We're focusing on… what we talked about we're focusing on publicly is… We're focusing on autonomous systems,' Cook said in an interview with Bloomberg.
'Clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars — there are others. And we sort of see it as the mother all AI projects.'
'It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on. So autonomy is something that is incredibly exciting for us. But we'll see where it takes us — we're not really saying from a product point of view what we'll do. It's a core technology that we view as very important.' ",-2
1521,"THE COMMUNIST PARTY’S leadership, with “Comrade Xi Jinping at the core”, attaches “great importance” to managing internet content. So declared the government on October 20th when unveiling new instructions about what news could be republished online. This was an understatement. Under the party’s rule, China’s press has never enjoyed more than a small modicum of freedom. Mr Xi has relentlessly tightened controls. Reporters and editors deemed politically wayward have been disciplined, fired or jailed.
The new directive, issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), updates a list, first published in 2016, of news sources that other websites may republish. CAC said the revision was aimed at “resolutely closing the ‘back door’ on illegal newsgathering and redistribution”.

The list names 1,358 approved outlets. That is nearly four times as many as were named in the previous one. It is not a sign of relaxation. The larger number merely reflects the proliferation of news websites run by state-owned media. More important to note are sources that are no longer listed. The most conspicuous is Caixin Online, a popular and trusted website.
Since its launch in 2009, Caixin Online has been an outlier in China’s drab media landscape. It often goes far beyond other outlets with investigative reporting and coverage of topics such as corruption, environmental problems and touchy policy debates. In the early stages of the pandemic it called into question the official death toll in Wuhan, pointing to an unusual workload at crematoria. Its founder, Hu Shuli, previously ran a magazine called Caijing, which once occupied a similar niche. Ms Hu is politically well-connected and has a keen sense of how to skate close to—but rarely over—the party’s red lines.
She and her colleagues may feel the effects of another recent tightening of the party’s grip. On October 8th China’s planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), released a draft regulation reiterating a ban on private investment in most news operations. Such restrictions have been in place since at least 2005, but have not been rigorously enforced. State media suggest that this time, change is afoot. According to one widely quoted Chinese expert, previously non-compliant arrangements will be ”cleaned up”. It will be a big job. Like Caixin, many Chinese media, though fully operated and controlled by the state, have complex ownership structures that include big holdings by private investors.
Pro-government commentators have praised the party’s resolve. Sima Nan, a blogger in Beijing with more than 2.4m followers on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, opined that a loosening of media controls in the Soviet Union had hastened its collapse in 1991. “This is an ideological struggle,” he said, comparing the NDRC‘s ban to “removing firewood from under a cauldron”—a common way in Chinese of describing drastic action taken to deal with an emergency.
Sina Weibo is owned by Sina Corporation, a non-state tech giant. But it is clear that the NDRC does not have news analysts such as Mr Sima in its sights. ■",2
1522,"MANUEL SUFFERED two serious brain injuries as a child in Denver, Colorado. The first was the result of a fall. The second occurred when someone threw a rock at his head, causing him to lose consciousness. He made it the short distance home before blacking out. On both occasions he received brain scans but he does not remember getting any other treatment.
As a teenager, Manuel was sent to a school for disruptive children. In his early 20s he tried to strangle his stepfather who, he says, was violent towards his mother. He was sent to prison. Last year he suffered a third brain injury when he fell out of a pickup truck travelling at high speed. He spent six days in a coma. When he woke up he had no recollection of what had happened. He was later jailed yet again for violating his parole.

Manuel’s story is far from unusual. Brain injuries affect about 8.5% of the general population but rates among prisoners are far higher. Kim Gorgens, a neuropsychologist at the University of Denver, reckons that between 50% and 80% of prisoners and those on parole in America have brain injuries. A review of research in America, Australia and Europe suggests that the average reported rate is around 46%. Research conducted in 2010 by Huw Williams of the University of Exeter put the rate among men in British prisons at 65%. A study published in 2017 found that nearly half of all prisoners in New Zealand had been hospitalised for a traumatic brain injury before committing their crime. Researchers suspect that the numbers may be even higher in poorer countries because road-traffic accidents and violence are generally more common.
People who sustain brain injuries are more likely to go on to commit crimes, including violent ones. They are more troublesome while in prison and more likely to reoffend on release. This is especially true for those, like Manuel, who are injured as children. Adrian Raine, a psychologist and criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, is pretty convinced that there is a causal link. He points to research that follows people over time, as well as natural experiments in which otherwise law-abiding individuals suffer a brain injury and then display antisocial behaviour. “It’s a bit like saying smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” Dr Raine explains. “Most people do not get lung cancer. We will never do a randomised controlled trial for it. But do we act on it? Sure we do.”
For many the damage is done early. Brain injuries are particularly common among boys and young men, whose brains are still maturing. Those from poor backgrounds who live in cities are especially at risk. A curious child who is rarely supervised is more likely to fall and seriously hurt himself. A reckless adolescent who thinks he is invincible is more likely to crash his car or get punched in the head. They are then far more likely to drop out of school and end up in prison. Brain injuries are one of many risk factors for crime which disproportionately fall on poor people (though most lead law-abiding lives).
People tend to associate traumatic brain injuries with sports such as American football, boxing and rugby. In fact they are more usually caused by falls, road-traffic accidents and fights. The front of the brain, where the frontal and temporal lobes are located, is often damaged. Higher emotions, such as compassion, seem to be concentrated there, as does conscious decision-making. Long-term memory formation is mediated by the hippocampi, which are in the temporal lobes. Broca’s area and Wernicke's area, both important in the development of language, are located in the frontal and temporal lobes respectively.
The longer a person is unconscious, and the more injuries they sustain, the more severe the effects. People become forgetful. Many find it hard to concentrate. They may struggle to manage their emotions and to understand the feelings of others. Their behaviour and personality may change, although many sufferers fail to recognise this in themselves.
Brain injuries seem to make a minority of people more violent. Paul (not his real name) had a number of minor convictions when he was involved in an accident which caused a bleed on his brain and left him in a coma. After that his crimes became more violent. Since his accident he has done things that were “out of character”, he says from a prison in Wales. He knows that he has hurt people but he does not remember his crimes. “When I get told later on what I’ve done and what’s happened, I’m gutted.”
Seena Fazel of the University of Oxford has made cross-references between Swedish health-care and crime records. He found that people who had gone to hospital for a brain injury were more than three times more likely then to commit violent crimes than the rest of the population. They were also twice as likely to do so as their siblings. Damage to the prefrontal cortex, which seems to increase aggression and impulsiveness, may explain this. Another Swedish study found that almost half of a sample of (mostly old) patients with frontotemporal dementia exhibited criminal behaviour. The figure for those with Alzheimer’s in the same study was 15%.
Michael has a scar on his head where he was hit by a car at the age of seven. None of his six siblings has ever been in any serious trouble, but he started stealing cars and motorbikes and breaking into factories when he was a teenager. Drugs made his problems worse. He also suffered from anxiety and depression. Michael is now in his 50s. He reckons that he has spent more than 20 years in prison over the course of his life.
His experience fits with what Dr Gorgens has found studying inmates and probationers with traumatic brain injuries in Colorado. Some 96% had problems with substance abuse and 79% suffered from some kind of mental illness. It is a vicious cycle, says Dr Gorgens. Substance abuse is more likely in people who have suffered brain injuries, and people with brain injuries are more likely to develop addictions. Separate research shows that after suffering a brain injury, people with mental-health problems were four to seven times more likely to commit a crime than before. When you are dealing with so many problems at the same time, it is easy for them to spiral out of control, explains Dr Gorgens. This is especially true for those who have alienated their family and friends, as people with brain injuries tend to do. They are more likely to end up homeless, unemployed and to commit suicide.
Addressing the problem head-on
Michael has turned his life around. He and other campaigners want officials to acknowledge the problem of brain injuries among prisoners. Some are beginning to do so. The British and Australian governments are carrying out reviews of how they treat such offenders. They are also looking at a broader set of “neurodiverse” conditions which are disproportionally common among inmates, including learning and intellectual disabilities and autism. Criminal-justice systems need to work better for those whose brains work differently. That might also reduce crime.
In New Zealand, a pioneer in this field, the focus has been on reforming courts. Andrew Becroft, a judge who used to run the Youth Court, was shocked by how many young offenders had neuro-disabilities. “History will judge us very harshly,” he says. The court now screens defendants for brain injuries and has tried to adapt its procedures to take account of their needs. So does the Young Adult List court, which deals with 18- to 25-year-olds. Officers of the court talk to defendants in clear English instead of legal jargon, and provide handouts to those who struggle to understand what is being said. “It’s fundamentally a matter of fairness,” says John Walker, the court’s founder and chief judge. “If a person came into the court who couldn’t speak English, they would be given an interpreter.” He argues the same should be true for those with neuro-disabilities.

Philippa Birch works for The Disabilities Trust, a British charity that trains people to go into prisons to raise awareness of brain injuries among inmates and staff. People working in prisons often think those with brain injuries come across as aggressive or rude, says Ms Birch. They stand too close or do not pay attention to instructions. She explains the effects of brain injury and reassures prisoners about how they can manage them. Prisoners find lessons in controlling their emotions and anger particularly helpful. Overworked prison staff are grateful for the smoother interactions.
TBI in Criminal Justice, a collaboration between the University of Denver, various charities and the Colorado courts and sheriff departments, is helping prisoners with brain injuries adapt better to prison and prepare for the world beyond. Some learn how to use a diary to get to appointments on time. Others master breathing techniques to help them stay calm under pressure. These cheap but effective strategies can be the difference between someone avoiding a needless parole violation and going straight back to prison. The team hopes the project will reduce the state’s recidivism rates which, at 50%, are among the highest in the country.
Some could benefit from better medical treatment. That might mean medication: antidepressants for anxiety or stimulants for fatigue and improved cognitive function. But in the long term most treatments for brain injuries are largely therapeutic. Neuro-rehabilitation relies on recognising that the brain is to an extent able to adapt its structure and function, a process known as neuroplasticity. Physical and speech therapy can help people regain lost function. Computerised “brain training” games can improve recall and attention. The earlier and more intense the intervention, the better the prospects of recovery. But coping strategies can be taught at any stage after an injury.
Identifying those who need support could prevent people from drifting into crime. Mr Becroft, now New Zealand’s children’s commissioner, argues that children should be screened for brain injuries and other neuro-disabilities when they start secondary school to ensure that those who need help get it. Campaigners are also keen to prevent more brain injuries from happening in the first place. That might mean teaching parents about the risks, or encouraging people to wear helmets.
A report in 2016 by the Centre for Mental Health estimated that in Britain the cost of traumatic brain injury in a 15-year-old who goes on to offend is around £345,000 ($475,000). The cost to those affected—and society more widely—is incalculable. ■",2
1523,"FOR EIGHT CONSECUTIVE years ver.di, Germany’s second-biggest trade union, has called a strike during the pre-holiday season at Amazon’s fulfilment centres, the vast warehouses where packages are prepared for delivery. This year the tradition continued. Around 2,500 Amazon employees at seven centres walked out on November 2nd. The union warned that the strikes could continue up to Christmas.
Ver.di demands an“immediate” salary increase of 3% this year, followed by 1.7% next year, in line with a collective labour agreement for the retail sector. Amazon is making heaps of money in Germany and cannot continue to “refuse wage increases that other companies in the sector pay”, says Orhan Akman of ver.di. Mr Akman vows not to give up as strikes in previous years yielded results. Union pressure forced Amazon to increase wages several times, he states.

The wider goal of the strike is the preservation of the Tarifvertrag, a periodic agreement between unions and bosses that sets wage levels for each industry. It is credited with playing a big part in Germany’s harmonious labour relations. Such “tariff” agreements have been eroded over the past couple of decades, especially in eastern Germany. Many firms in service industries in particular no longer adhere to them.
“Amazon is an excellent employer without the tariff agreement,” insists Michael Schneider, a company spokesman. In the summer Amazon raised pay for all employees to at least €12 ($14) an hour—the minimum wage is €9.60. After two years workers earn on average €2,750 a month.Half of its 19,000 employees have worked at Amazon for over five years and seem unwilling to walk out.
Amazon is hiring an additional 10,000 temporary employees for the busy Christmas season in its second-biggest market. The company says it can fulfil all orders in spite of the strikes. In likelihood this year’s industrial action will end like the others every year since 2013 with Amazon making some concession. But by not adhering to the Tarifvertrag, the company is further chipping away at wage agreements both for the retail industry and Germany as a whole. ■

1524,"“PICTURE THIS,” said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, on October 4th, before describing a young family keen to provide the best for their children. “Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?” The response “no” was implied in his speech and demonstrated by his government’s actions, as just two days later it cut universal credit, a benefit for low-income households, by around £20 ($27) a week.

A welfare state is supposed to insure against shocks such as job loss, to shuffle cash from rich to poor and to smooth income between youth and old age. In recent years Britain’s government has been least concerned by the first of these. Spending on pensions has risen, but out-of-work benefits—jobseeker’s allowance until 2013 and universal credit thereafter—have stagnated (see chart). Across the mostly rich countries of the OECD, a typical childless, single person who became unemployed in 2019 saw up to 55% of earnings replaced by benefits. In Britain, that figure was just 12%.

A report in 2019 by Laura Gardiner of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, considered other trends in welfare spending. Non-cash support, such as free school meals, grew. Benefits became increasingly linked to recipients’ outgoings, such as those related to disability or child care. Eligibility rules were tightened, and more support was offered to help people back into work. Meanwhile benefits for middle-income households were trimmed. In 2013, for example, child benefit became means-tested. All this, on top of a rising state-pension age, meant that whereas in 2005 the share of people receiving a benefit or tax credit was 72%, by the eve of the pandemic that had fallen to 62%.
Changes to working-age benefits were largely the consequence of a desire to cut costs, not a thought-through strategy. But taken together, they imply that Britain’s welfare state envisages middling and higher earners insuring themselves against joblessness by saving. The pandemic revealed that system’s inadequacies. When covid-19 hit, ministers in the Department for Work and Pensions wanted to provide specific help for people whose income was affected. But civil servants were unable to distinguish between those who were already receiving universal credit and new claimants.
So the £20 increase went to everyone, and a furlough scheme acted as targeted pandemic support. It replaced previous income at an average rate of over 90%, compared with just 53% if claimants had had to rely on universal credit. As furlough ends and universal credit returns to its previous level, redistribution is being unwound. And the insurance role of the welfare state is returning to its former Cinderella status, too.",2
1525,"“GOT A FEELING ‘21 is going to be a good year,” the stepfather in “Tommy”, a rock opera by The Who, tells his family. The British government is trying to give a similar impression of optimism. After its year of post-Brexit transition, and with a last-minute trade deal that staves off some of the worst effects of leaving the European Union, the new year offers the country a number of opportunities to cut a dash on the world stage. It will take the presidency of the G7 club of big rich democracies, allowing it not just to set the agenda for the group’s annual summit, but also to invite Australia, India and South Korea to come along—an invitation that might be the groundwork for a “D10” of democracies. In November the most important diplomatic event of the year, the COP26 climate conference, will open in Glasgow.
Within weeks Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, will be visiting India, where on January 26th he will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s guest of honour for Republic Day. His visit will be part of a much-touted “tilt to the Indo-Pacific”. Britain has opened discussions on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade area of 11 countries. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is pushing for it also to become a “dialogue partner” of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The Royal Navy’s flagship, the spanking new aircraft-carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, will soon be Asia bound.

Freed from an endless round of EU gatherings, British diplomats expect to have more time for globe trotting. Alexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister, has pointed out that there was a period of 17 years when no British foreign secretary visited Australia; such slights are unlikely to be repeated. Over the year since Brexit various nimble moves—from offering people in Hong Kong a path to British citizenship after China’s crackdown there, to sanctions on Belarus while the rest of Europe dithered, to rapid approval for a covid vaccine—have shown that Britain can stand out. “It’s exciting to see the British government making creative choices in its national security,” says Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, an American think-tank. “That’s a really important way to signal that Britain outside of the EU sees itself as a leader in national security and is willing to take the risks and the consequences of leading with its values.”
For all these tokens of real potential, though, there are serious impediments to the creation, or recreation, of a “Global Britain”—a project with which many of those who brought about Brexit are enamoured. Through leaving the EU the country weakened its economic prospects; since then covid has hit it hard. The economy has longer-term problems, too. Since 2005 British firms’ share of world market capitalisation has fallen from over 7% to 3%, a much greater slippage than any other large European economy. Over the same period the share of the stock of global cross-border investment attributable to British-headquartered multinationals has fallen from 10% to 6%, also a bigger drop than for any other major economy.
At the same time the world is returning to an era of great-power competition: deepening rivalry between America and China, Russia’s brazen opportunism, the EU’s stubborn assertiveness, at least in economic policy. “The next chapter of world affairs will be about the political, economic, regulatory, technological and military interplay between the US, China and Europe,” says Sir Simon Fraser, one of Britain’s former top diplomats. “The task for the UK is finding our place in this.”
To do so will require a clear strategic vision and coherent implementation. Yet these are just the things which, according to a recent report by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, British foreign policy currently lacks. Unless Britain applies itself to acquiring those necessities, good years will prove hard to find.
No reason to be over-optimistic
It is easy to dismiss Britain’s strengths, and many of its inhabitants delight in doing so. But though Britain is no longer the leading power it was in the first half of the 20th century (see chart) it is still a manifestly significant one. It has the world’s fifth-largest economy, according to the IMF, and is one of the five nuclear-armed states with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. It is a muscular member of NATO and its signals-intelligence service, GCHQ, makes it a potent part of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing elite, together with America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Its imperial past has left it one of the few countries to have a number of overseas territories, which extend its presence while also adding to its obligations. Its head of state is the head of state of 15 other countries, too, as well as leader of the 54-nation Commonwealth. The Anglican Communion is the world’s third-largest Christian church. Britain is rare among rich countries in spending a hefty chunk of its national income on foreign aid and doing so well. It is the biggest voluntary contributor to the World Health Organisation and to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance.
Britain has a high profile in sport, thanks in large part to the Premier League’s global following among football fans, and is one of the most popular destinations for international tourists. It has the world’s most respected public broadcaster, the BBC, and some of its best universities. Though the British government, like many others, botched its response to covid-19, its scientists have excelled themselves, as they do in many fields. They have helped to develop what may prove to be the most widely used vaccine (the one from Oxford-AstraZeneca) and to identify the most effective treatment for those who get ill (the steroid dexamethasone).
But none of these advantages is new. Britain enjoyed them all when it was a member of the EU—while also benefiting from being part of the world’s largest trading bloc and its most important grouping of democracies. To have any chance of getting more out of its native strengths now than it did then, it will need a foreign policy which understands both how to build on them and what that requires. Rory Stewart, who resigned from his ministerial post running the Department for International Development (DfID) when Mr Johnson became prime minister in 2019, says that the self-examination needed has so far been lacking. “We do these things, but we have no very settled, confident idea about why we’re doing these things.”
The delayed but now imminent report of the government’s “Integrated Review” of foreign policy, security, defence and international development should provide some of the foundations required; it has been billed by Mr Johnson as the biggest rethink of Britain’s international stance since the end of the cold war. But several key decisions on the direction of policy have already been taken. In June 2020 Mr Johnson (himself a former foreign secretary, if not a terribly good one) announced that DfID would henceforth be subsumed into the Foreign Office.
In theory, that will make British policy more co-ordinated, combining the diplomats’ lobbying power with DfID’s technical expertise. It may also go some way to reversing the decline of Britain’s diplomatic representation around the world. In the 1990s, says Mr Stewart, Britain had perhaps 25 diplomats in Zambia. Over the decades that dwindled to an ambassador, one other diplomat and local employees. Bringing in DfID may make representation more beefy. But many fear that any such benefits will come at the expense of lasting damage to the capabilities that made Britain an “aid superpower”. “It’s not a merger, it’s the demolition of DfID,” Andrew Mitchell, another former head of the department, has lamented. In November new legislation reduced foreign-aid spending from 0.7% of GDP—an established benchmark—to 0.5%.
Military spending has fared better. It is set to rise by £6.5bn more than previously planned over the next four years, reversing a decade of cuts and confirming Britain’s status as the leading military spender among European members of NATO, with an annual budget of some £47bn. The pattern of spending leans heavily towards the maritime; there is also spending on technology, with the creation of an agency for artificial intelligence and a new emphasis on mounting attacks in cyberspace.
Freedom tastes of reality
Defence spending up, aid outlays down, the Foreign Office and development departments merged: the resources and institutions with which Britain’s new strategy will be implemented seem set. The strategy which informs these choices, though, has yet to be clearly enunciated.
The government will want to remain as close as possible to America. Marta Dassù, a foreign-policy expert at the Aspen Institute Italia in Rome, sees the increased investment in security as “a sort of down-payment to the US, to show the incoming American administration that the UK is still very relevant”. The government will take heart from the idea that the administration led by Joe Biden, the president-elect, will emphasise allies rather than “America First”. Yet the degree to which Donald Trump’s dramatic turn away from global leadership was accepted by the American people will not be forgotten. Nor is Mr Biden likely to favour aggressive interventions like those which Britain has been willing to back in the past.

What of the world’s other major powers? There was a time when Britain’s Conservatives saw Chinese investment as playing a big part in Britain’s economic future and went out of their way to court it. The authoritarianism of President Xi Jinping, the clampdown on Hong Kong and a toughened American stance—one that Mr Biden will not reverse—have forced a rethink. British policy towards Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, diverged from America’s for some time; but in 2020 the company was barred from involvement in Britain’s 5G plans. There are still some in Mr Johnson’s party who want to see a deeper relationship with China. But the Sinosceptics seem to have the upper hand.
And then there is Europe. Britain is keen on its continuing “E3” security discussions with France and Germany (despite covid-19, the troika met five times in 2020 at foreign-minister level to discuss Iran and other matters). But it insisted that foreign policy, external security and defence co-operation be excluded from the negotiations which led to the deal reached on December 24th. Britain “can’t actually tackle Europe in an entirely rational way at the moment,” says François Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a French think-tank. “Although it’s an integrated review, it’s integrating everything except Europe.”
Mr Johnson’s government has avoided almost any mention of the EU in its foreign-policy discussions; but relations with the rest of Europe will play a crucial role in the success of any such policy, both directly and indirectly. Directly because Britain is still, physically and militarily, part of Europe. The adventurism of Russia under Vladimir Putin means that global Britain’s military commitments will remain concentrated in its own European region, handled through NATO and in concert with its former EU partners.
What is more, many of Britain’s global goals will be shared by the EU, and best pursued in partnership. Sometimes, though, the two parties’ goals will clash. Ms Dassù warns that Britain will find itself competing with the EU in its relationship with the Biden administration, which “will look to Germans first and the UK second.”
The deepest influence may well be the effect that leaving the EU will have on Britons themselves. If the divorce with the EU leads to ever greater internal tensions, Britain will remain hopelessly distracted and potentially diminished. A particular worry in strategic circles is that, were such divisions to extend as far as independence for Scotland, the future of the British nuclear-armed submarine force, which is based there, would be in doubt. Though independence will not easily be won under a British government which will not grant the people of Scotland the necessary referendum, it is not the unthinkable outcome it once was. Even without such a rupture, according to Sophia Gaston of the British Foreign Policy Group, a think-tank, Brexit has produced, or revealed, “an enormous amount of volatility” in public attitudes to foreign policy.
All alone, cousin
The prime minister, whose hero is Winston Churchill, frequently claims Britain to be “world-beating”. A nostalgic devotion to such ideas is likely to be evident in the Integrated Review. Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser, expects it to exhibit a tension “between the sort of exceptionalism that seems to be very much the leitmotif of the whole Brexit saga, and the reality that Britain will only make a difference in the world in partnership with other friends and allies.” Karin von Hippel of RUSI, a British think-tank that specialises in military affairs, warns that the review risks resembling “a Christmas tree” with “a bit of everything” hanging off it. Britain could find itself overstretching and underachieving in a number of areas.
Take the tilt to the Indo-Pacific. Sceptics question how central this is to British policy, and what the country can hope to achieve. They view the idea of Britain as anything other than a secondary player in Asian security as “fanciful”. There also appears to be little public enthusiasm for it. “The British people don’t fundamentally buy into the argument of us having a specific role in the Indo-Pacific region at the moment,” says Ms Gaston. And spending on a military presence well beyond Europe and the Atlantic may prove hard to justify. “I’m a great fan of the British military, but much of it is symbolic,” says Mr Stewart. “They’re going to end up with maybe 25 fighting vessels, at incredible expense. Are we actually going to go to war with China to stop them from taking Taiwan?”
In general, Britain has not looked like a very effective power over the past few years. Observers overseas have not just puzzled over its willingness to inflict harm on itself by leaving the EU. They have also marvelled at its lack of a plan for doing so and the years of political chaos that ensued. Britain’s credibility as a champion of the rules-based international order plummeted when its government showed itself to be willing to break part of the withdrawal agreement it had just signed with the EU. And Mr Johnson’s handling of the pandemic has hardly inspired faith in British pragmatism and competence.
That recent experience leads to doubts about whether the government is deploying sufficient resources on the projects that it most needs to succeed. Lord Ricketts, who was ambassador to France in the run-up to COP21, which produced the Paris agreement on climate change, worries that COP26 may be an example. He recalls that France’s foreign minister at the time, Laurent Fabius, “spent a year travelling the world and putting it together, and we’ve got a part-time Alok Sharma [the business secretary] as our special envoy for climate change.” He suggests Britain is “underweight” in preparing for it.
The common thread in all these doubts is whether Britain is fundamentally serious in what its leaders talk of achieving. Can it prioritise a few areas and devote sufficient attention and resources to make a real difference? And can it find a way to develop a proper policy towards Europe? Until it does so, the suspicion will remain that there is too much symbolism and too little substance in its thinking on foreign policy. Britain’s accumulated assets in the game of nations will not make up for a failure to take that game seriously. ■",2
1526,"BRINGING HOME the bacon is about to get harder in California. Proposition 12, a ballot initiative passed in 2018, prevents the pork, veal and egg industries from raising animals within confined spaces for all products sold within the state. And while the egg and veal industries met new rules in 2020 (43 square feet, or four square metres, per calf raised for veal, one square foot per egg-laying hen), the pork industry may fail to meet the requirements for breeding pigs (24 square feet) by January 1st.
California’s new restrictions are part of a larger movement to release animals from cages. McDonald’s, Kellogg’s, Kroger’s and other businesses announced plans to use only cage-free eggs by 2025. Eight states, including Massachusetts and Utah, passed laws that in effect ban eggs produced by caged hens . California’s law is the most impactful on the pork industry. As the largest consumer of pig products, 116m kilos per year (about 15% of all produced in America), California’s standards have weight elsewhere.

The industry is, naturally, claiming that the law is unconstitutional. So far, challenges have been unsuccessful. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) and American Farm Bureau Federation's petition to strike down the law in July. And the Supreme Court denied a petition filed by the North American Meat Institute a month earlier.
Michael Formica, general counsel at the NPPC, says that the new law places an unreasonable burden on pork producers. Currently breeding pigs, which typically weigh about 225 kilograms, are placed in 14-square-foot gestation crates. Less than 4% of all sow housing meets the new standards, according to Rabobank, which finances agriculture.
Activists blame the pork industry. “[They] had three years to change their housing systems. They instead chose to not comply,” says Chris Green of Harvard Law’s Animal Law and Policy Programme. Californians could pay the price. The Hatamiya Group, a consulting firm hired by opponents of the law, estimate that consumers could pay up to 60% more: a $6 pack of bacon could now cost $9.60. Bacon smugglers in Nevada are, presumably, licking their lips.

1527,"“BUILD A BETTER accelerometer and the world will make a beaten path to your door.” Not, perhaps, as snappy as Ralph Waldo Emerson’s original aphorism about a mousetrap. But it is the hope of Graeme Malcolm, a physicist at the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow. Dr Malcolm’s speciality is high-purity lasers. These can be used to make instruments of great precision. And those, in turn, can be employed to build devices which can detect the tiniest of forces—as tiny, for example, as the gravitational pull of a passing lorry.
Laser light is famously pure. The way lasers work means that the beams which emerge from them are monochromatic. But there is purity, and then there is purity. In a truly monochromatic beam, all light would be of exactly the same frequency. In practice, this never happens. Wobbles caused by small temperature changes and vibrations, and by imperfections in the mirrored cavity in which the beam is generated and amplified, mean no laser beam is perfectly pure. The light from a cheap laser pointer might have a frequency range—known as its line width—of 500 megahertz (MHz), while the line width of a specialised scientific laser would be nearer 1MHz. Dr Malcolm’s latest offering, by contrast, has a line width of a mere 20Hz.

This device, dubbed SolsTiS, has a cavity containing titanium-doped sapphire. This is a common material for lasers, but SolsTiS’s cavity is shaped, by precise engineering and the locking of the components into place after calibration, in a way that both encourages single-frequency emission and ensures that waste heat is dissipated rapidly.
The purity of the resulting beam permits it to do something that seems extraordinary to those (ie, most human beings) who are used to dealing with the world of classical, rather than quantum, mechanics. This is, in effect, to divide atoms temporarily in two using a trick which takes advantage of the fact that all particles, however apparently substantial, are actually also waves.
To pull off this trick the output from the SolsTiS is divided into multiple beams. The atoms in question are a diffuse gas of rubidium in a cell refrigerated to within ten millionths of a degree of absolute zero. This extreme coldness is achieved by using six of these beams to slow the atoms down, in a process called Doppler cooling.
Location, location, location
In conditions of such quietude atoms hit by a pulse of light of the correct frequency (to which the SolsTiS laser is tuned), will split into two quantum waves which move apart (see diagram). A second pulse reverses this, bringing the two waves back together, and a third allows them to interfere with each other, creating a characteristic interference pattern that depends on any acceleration the waves underwent when they were separated. A further laser pulse can detect the different interference patterns in the different atoms in the cell, and that information will reveal the amount of acceleration the atoms underwent. To exploit this phenomenon, Dr Malcolm has started a company called M Squared. The plan is to use this atomic interference to create an accelerometer with at least 100 times the precision of existing versions.

Miniature accelerometers are already common (most mobile phones, for example, contain one), but these are mechanical rather than laser-based devices. Their job is inertial navigation, which divides acceleration by time to work out speed and direction travelled, and hence location. Drive into a tunnel, and inertial navigation tracks your position after you lose the GPS satellite signal.
Such devices drift rapidly, however. The slightest error is quickly amplified into a big miscalculation of position. Your phone will not stay on track for more than a few minutes, and even the best military-grade inertial-navigation systems, which employ lasers, but not atomic interference, drift by kilometres a day. Atomic-interference accelerometers would, by contrast, drift only 2km a month.
To start with, this reliability will be expensive and require fairly large pieces of kit. It will therefore be of interest mainly for military use, and for one or two other specialist applications, such as mining, where satellite-based navigation is impossible. But the equipment needed should ultimately shrink to chip-size, with a corresponding fall in cost. That would permit its inclusion in vehicles, phones and other mobile electronics, which could be useful in a world of driverless cars, deliveries by drone and autonomous air taxis.
Atomic-interference accelerometers would have other uses, too. Point one vertically and it would become a gravimeter—a device to measure gravity, the strength of which varies subtly from place to place depending on the local geology. Prospectors for oil and minerals have employed gravimeters since the 1930s. Atomic-interference gravimeters promise to be a thousand times more sensitive than current devices. Dr Malcolm says the firm is testing a prototype that, when placed on a barge going over an aqueduct, can detect lorries passing beneath by their gravitational attraction. Such sensitive instruments will provide a finer-grained understanding of an area’s geology before expensive drilling begins.
The first lasers were laboratory curiosities with little practical use, but that has changed enormously over the years. Now, lasers are the basis of multiple better mousetraps, from broadband fibre networks to barcode scanners. Using them to manipulate the quantum properties of atoms in this way promises more such mousetraps in the future. ■",2
1528,"BEBATU, Indonesia, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged developed countries on Tuesday to commit to their pledge to provide financing for poorer countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at this month's UN climate conference.
Rich countries have missed a target to raise $100 billion a year to support developing countries in their climate action projects, which experts say could break down trust at the Oct. 31 - Nov. 12 COP26 conference in the Scottish city of Glasgow.
""It's impossible if we don't get funding help. If we don't have the technology, it's also difficult,"" the president, who is popularly known as Jokowi, told Reuters on Tuesday after planting a patch of mangrove in the village of Bebatu on Borneo island.
Indonesia, the world's eight-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has pledged to cut back its carbon emissions to 29% below business-as-usual by its own efforts, but with the help of international funding and transfer of technology, it believes it could increase the reduction to up to 41%.
The country earlier this year brought forward its long-term target to reach carbon neutrality to 2060 or sooner, from 2070 initially, which includes plans to phase out the use of coal-fired plants.
Jokowi said Indonesia wants to invest in renewable projects to capitalise on its potential in hydropower, geothermal, wind, solar and marine current and this will require billions of dollars of funding.
A government study has shown the Southeast Asian country needs $150 billion to $200 billion per year in investment in low carbon programmes over the next nine years to meet its net zero emission goal.
""This is a big work. It needs investment, it needs technologies,"" Jokowi said, adding that he did not want ""just talk"" at COP26.
Indonesia has also launched a programme to restore 600,000 hectares of mangrove forest in the next three years to absorb carbon emission, Jokowi said.
European Union Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans told Reuters on Monday that the EU and the United States would  meet their commitments, but he is still urging other rich countries to come on board.
""I think we still have a shot at getting to $100 billion. I think it would be very important for Glasgow to do that. Also as a sign of thrust and confidence to the developing world,"" he said.
Indonesia would also promote sustainable economic growth when it takes over the G20 presidency in December, alongside an even economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, Jokowi said.
""We want to fight for the chance for poor countries, developing countries, vulnerable groups, to get back on their feet and not get left behind by developed countries,"" he said.",3
1529,"AT ORBITAL SPEEDS a tennis-ball-sized piece of space junk packs enough energy to obliterate a satellite. It makes good sense, then, to track orbiting debris, the better to steer spacecraft away from danger. That this is hard was underscored on April 23rd, as a SpaceX capsule sped toward the International Space Station (ISS). The crew were preparing to sleep when ground control hastily announced they had just 20 minutes to complete a safety procedure before a potential impact. The object, probably a piece of defunct spacecraft, later whizzed past harmlessly.
At the moment, space-going junk is mapped mostly by radar. But of an estimated 34,000 orbiting objects ten or more centimetres across, only about 29,000 are being tracked with reasonable accuracy. Smaller pieces are more numerous, and harder to follow. Those between one and ten centimetres across number more than 900,000; those at least a millimetre across, perhaps 128m. Even tiny bits of debris can do damage. In May the Canadian Space Agency said an untracked piece of junk had punched a hole 5mm across in Canadarm2, a robotic limb attached to the ISS.

As orbiting objects multiply, the danger grows. Roughly a dozen sizeable pieces of space debris break up every year as a result of collisions, exploding rocket fuel, or the rupturing of pressurised tanks or old batteries. Solar radiation chips off bits of paint and metal. And the number of launches is increasing. According to BryceTech, a consultancy in Virginia, at the end of 2001 there were 771 active satellites orbiting Earth. Ten years later that population had grown to 965. Since then, it has nearly quintupled, to roughly 4,500—and this does not include defunct satellites. And small, cheap satellites are a booming business. Maciej Konacki, an astronomer at the Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw, who has studied the matter on behalf of the European Union, reckons there could be 100,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of the decade.
One sign of this crowding is that forecasts of potential impacts have roughly doubled in the past few years, says the Space Data Association, an industry group based in the Isle of Man which calculates collision risks for its members. But the rise conceals some good news. Part of the reason for more predicted impacts is better forecasting. As the quality and quantity of information grows, many potential collisions which would have gone unnoticed in the past are now foreseen.
Collision warning
Radars operated by America’s Department of Defence have long been the biggest providers of “space situational awareness”. Little more than ten years ago, position fixes were generally accurate only to within a few hundred metres. Since then, says François Laporte, an expert at CNES, France’s space agency, the accuracy of America’s debris tracking has improved by an “extraordinary, marvellous” order of magnitude, to a few tens of metres.
One big advance has been “Space Fence”. This is a system built in the Marshall Islands for America’s air force. It is billed (admittedly by its maker, Lockheed Martin, an arms firm) as the world’s most advanced radar. It went into service in March 2020 and now makes 2m observations a day, many of closely spaced objects just 5cm across. In time, that level of scrutiny should more than triple the number of items which have their orbits regularly updated in a catalogue maintained by the 18th Space Control Squadron, at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
Since 2014 the EU has been chipping in too. Seven of its members pool their space-surveillance and tracking assets in an arrangement called the EU SST Consortium. Europeans worry that American data on debris may not remain forever free and freely available. Pride also plays a role. Mr Laporte says Europe’s spacefarers want to see debris for themselves, “not just through the Americans”. The consortium has yet to increase meaningfully the number of catalogued objects—“We’re not even in the same league” as America, says Mr Laporte. But satellite operators welcome the effort nonetheless.
One problem is that there is no consensus on the best way to predict an object’s future orbit. To do this its position must be recorded several times, to observe how its path is being altered by the gravitational pulls of the Earth, Moon and sun, the pressure imposed on it by solar radiation and, in low orbits, the drag caused by wayward wisps of air from the upper atmosphere, and so on. Different teams often come up with different results, says Dr Konacki, who was once a delegate to the EU SST Consortium. Any extra data should help make the process more accurate.
The private sector is gearing up its efforts, too. In April LeoLabs, a firm in Silicon Valley, switched on its fourth debris-tracking radar station. This facility, in Costa Rica, joins others in Alaska, New Zealand and Texas. A fifth is being built in the Azores. LeoLabs can currently track objects slightly bigger than tennis balls. The short wavelength and high power of the radars mean it may eventually be able keep tabs on bits of junk just 2cm across.
LeoLabs sells data to satellite operators, space agencies, America’s armed forces and insurers keen to calculate better actuarial tables for spacecraft. Dan Ceperley, the firm’s boss, notes that government agencies often take several “hand-wringing” hours to answer requests for a satellite’s probability of collision. His firm’s website lets customers see within seconds whether a proposed manoeuvre will lead, over the next week, to danger from any of the objects in LeoLabs’ catalogue.
Besides using radar, debris can also be tracked optically. In collaboration with Curtin University, in Perth, Lockheed Martin runs FireOPAL, a system of 20 cheap cameras aimed at the sky from various parts of Australia. For several hours at dawn and dusk, when these cameras are in the dark but sunlight still illuminates debris orbiting above, the cameras take pictures every ten seconds. The closer an object, the more it appears to move relative to the stars, allowing triangulation of its position. For items at an altitude of 400km, says Phil Bland, who is in charge of Curtin’s side of the project, the system is accurate to within 30 metres.
FireOPAL’s greatest success so far was locating a satellite half a metre across, 26,000km up. The smallest objects the lenses capture in low orbits are about 30cm across. Rod Drury, Dr Bland’s counterpart at Lockheed, says the firm now plans to expand FireOPAL around the world.
Lasers are another option. Around 40 outfits, including some belonging to the members of the EU SST Consortium, are shooting laser pulses at “retro-reflectors” fitted to many satellites. Clocking the return time allows positions to be calculated with an accuracy of a few millimetres. Seven laser stations also use a more powerful pulse that can spot debris without retro-reflectors, to within around a metre.
For finding stuff in high orbits, though, neither lasers nor radars are much help. But telescopes work. ExoAnalytic Solutions, a Californian firm, tracks junk up to 170,000km away—nearly halfway to the Moon—using instruments “just laying on the shelves” at astronomy shops, according to Clint Clark, the firm’s “Vice President of First Impressions” (as some marketing bosses like to be known in California). As for debris in geosynchronous orbit, a mere 36,000km up, ExoAnalytic’s 300 telescopes, scattered in 35 clusters over five continents and Hawaii, track grapefruit-sized objects to within an accuracy of about ten metres. The company is adding a couple of sites a year, to improve the degree of precision. Customers include insurers keen to see if policyholders fly their satellites as safely as they claim to.
These efforts are impressive. Even so, back at LeoLabs Dr Ceperley reckons that ten times more tracking capability is needed than is available today. Such demand has allowed Northstar Earth  Space, a new firm in Montreal, to raise money to build, at $25m a pop, three 100kg satellites that will use telescopic cameras to track junk from orbit. The plan, according to Northstar’s boss, Stewart Bain, is to launch the satellites in 2023, into an orbit with an altitude of 575km—the celestial equivalent, he quips, of “riviera or beach-front property”. If this goes well, another nine will join them in subsequent years, to create a panopticon a dozen strong.
Where there’s muck there’s brass
For customers, none of this comes cheap. Northstar, for example, plans to charge annual subscriptions of between $10m and $100m. But that will buy more than just a degree of collision-proofing. It will also permit the manoeuvres made to avoid such collisions to be fine-tuned, or even deemed unnecessary. That will save fuel, extending a satellite’s useful life. And it will also reduce pauses in service, which are almost inevitable when a satellite’s orbit is being adjusted.
Naturally, this orbital-tracking technology has military value as well. Knowing objects’ orbits can reveal much about an adversary’s capabilities—including, perhaps, orbital combat. Movements that represent any deviation from normal patterns are most telling, says Scott Norr, an expert at Lockheed in the use of Space Fence for military intelligence. To illustrate why, he points to an object that had been considered to be just a piece of debris from a Russian military launch. In May 2014 the “debris” sprang to life. Its movements since then have fuelled fears that it could be an anti-satellite weapon. Whether other such “sleepers” are hidden in plain sight among the clouds of rubbish orbiting Earth remains to be seen. ■

1530,"IN BRANDING TERMS, Ireland is a superpower, from world-famous writers and musicians to the Irish-themed pubs scattered across the globe. But for business, as its government’s department of finance cheerily acknowledges, the 12.5% corporate-tax rate introduced in 2003 is “at the centre of the ‘Irish brand’”. Irish operations are central to the tax planning of many multinationals, among them Google, Apple, Pfizer and Johnson  Johnson. And they, in turn, have been so central to Ireland’s economy that its government long held fast against demands to raise the rate, despite endless complaints from other members of the European Union about undercutting and unfair competition.
On October 7th Ireland finally buckled, agreeing to raise its corporate-tax rate for large companies to 15%, a proposed global baseline, as part of a broader attempt to crack down on corporate tax avoidance. It was not only a big policy shift for the Republic, but a reminder, if one were needed, of the weakness of the devolved administration in Northern Ireland, and its politicians’ inability to seize opportunities and make trade-offs.

For the six counties of the island that remain part of the United Kingdom, the Republic’s low-tax policy has long provoked envy and an urge to emulate it. In 2015, after more than a decade of lobbying Westminster, the devolved administration in Stormont gained the power to lower its corporate-tax rate. It was the sole big idea for transforming a region that had been left painfully dependent on the public sector by 30 years of sectarian violence. When it was first mooted, the UK-wide rate was 30%. But by 2015 it had fallen to 20%. Nevertheless, Stormont announced that year that it would cut its rate to 12.5% in 2018.
Under European Union state-aid law, such a policy was permissible only if Northern Ireland bore the cost, estimated at the time as around £275m ($375m) a year, or 0.6% of its GDP. The British Treasury imposed another condition: that the devolved administration got its finances in order. But in 2016 the “cash for ash” scandal came to light. A scheme intended to boost renewable energy was so badly designed that people who burned wood pellets received subsidies higher than the cost of the fuel.
The scandal caused the devolved government to collapse, and Northern Ireland did without an administration for three years. In the meantime came the vote to leave the European Union. Then covid-19 struck. But as the province emerges on the other side of both Brexit and pandemic, a corporate-tax cut looks as distant as ever.
Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, European state-aid law still applies to swathes of Northern Ireland’s economy. And post-covid belt-tightening means that Westminster would in any case be unlikely to make up a revenue shortfall. Cutting corporate taxes “would only be possible if it was affordable,” says Conor Murphy, the finance minister for the devolved government, “which it is not at this time, given the very constrained budgetary position we face and the huge pressures on public services, particularly health”.
In March the Northern Irish administration appointed Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London-based think-tank, to examine whether more tax powers could be devolved to the province. Last month he told an audience in Belfast that although low corporation tax had played a role in the Republic’s prosperity, other policies had mattered, too: a long-term economic strategy and stable tax system, investment in technology and education, access to the single market, and plenty of immigration. “You need to pull that lever alongside a whole bunch of other things to be effective,” he said, “and it may be less effective now than it would have been 20 years ago.”
Hold me back and let me at him
That highlights Northern Ireland’s dilemma. Even if it slashes corporation tax, it does not have the Republic’s consensus on keeping the rate low. Companies considering investing in Northern Ireland would worry that politicians would change their minds. Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, which is expected to gain the largest number of seats in next year’s elections to Stormont, likes the idea of cutting corporation tax mainly because it likes harmonising policies across the island, never mind what those policies are. But on corporate tax, that nationalistic principle clashes with its left-wing economic ideology (it regards leftists in Cuba and Venezuela as fellow-travellers, though has been much less radical in government).
In April 2023 the UK-wide corporation-tax rate is slated to rise to 25%, re-widening the gap that the tax rise in the Republic is about to narrow. A higher mainland rate means the possibility of gaining a larger competitive advantage—but also a bigger loss of revenue, unless the lower taxes are more than counterbalanced by an ensuing boost to investment and economic activity. But given the chance to test their big idea, politicians used to other people doing the taxing while they do the spending have failed to screw up the courage. ■",2
1531,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",3
1532,"She is one of Britain's most brilliant actresses who is still, aged 88, winning rave reviews for her latest West End role. 
Now, in the first extract from our exclusive serialisation of her reissued and updated memoirs, Dame Sian Phillips reveals how she fell helplessly in love with the charismatic Peter O'Toole — and how their marriage began to be corroded by his drinking and obsessive sexual jealousy . . .
One night, in the early hours, I was woken by a noise coming from the ground-floor window of my front room in Notting Hill. I got out of bed without putting on the light.
Improbably, there was a face pressed to the glass and a tall ﬁgure perilously straddling the gap between the window and the steps to the front door.
I raised the sash slowly and two hands plunged in to seize the window frame. Then, with a heave, two long, slim feet swung down to the ﬂoor, and over 6ft of Peter O'Toole sketched a little bow.
I wanted to applaud. At the same time, I was astonished: we'd become close friends after acting together in a play, but had fallen out spectacularly.
I had innocently repeated to a friend something he'd told me about a former girlfriend — and when O'Toole found out, he had reacted with such fury that I never expected to see him again.
'I've got a car,' he said now. 'Coming for a cup of tea?'
'It's three in the morning.'
'So?'
'I'm in my nightie.'
'Put a mac on.'
That was the start, in 1958. We were in our early 20s and had no trouble adjusting our living habits to suit each other.
I'd never stayed up late, but came to love it. And he began to enjoy seeing the world in daylight hours — streets and parks as well as the dark interiors of bars.
The only slight difficulty was drink. Before meeting O'Toole, I'd never tasted beer, let alone whisky. I realised quickly that an appreciation of draught Guinness was essential in my new life and persevered, sipping the hated drink slowly during evenings when O'Toole drank his own age in the stuff.
Everyone we knew drank so much; incredible quantities of alcohol were lowered on every conceivable social occasion. Coming from a nonconformist, teetotal Welsh background, I was cautiously intrigued by the guilt-free, amusing nature of drinking to excess.
It was easy living together — and with wonderful sex thrown into the mix, it was ecstatic. While I played lead after lead in live television plays, O'Toole was in Willis Hall's The Long And The Short And The Tall, his ﬁrst big London success.
After the play, the company would move to the bar next door. When the pub shut, there would be a muttered conference and a large part of the crowd would drift off to parties in basement ﬂats, then hit the after-hours clubs.
The fag-end of the night was my favourite part. The two of us would walk to the all-night tea-and-sandwich stand in Covent Garden and order huge mugs of tea and hot-sausage sandwiches, which we ate sitting opposite Lloyds Bank.
Fortiﬁed, O'Toole would say, 'OK. Now for a little climb,' and he'd scale the wall of Lloyds.
The ﬁrst time he did this, I was terriﬁed and tried to dissuade him. But in a remarkably short space of time, I came to accept his dangerous behaviour as fairly unremarkable and would sit on the low wall with the tramps, nursing my tea, watching him.
He was sure-footed. And lucky. The regulars knew him as 'Pete' and gave him a little cheer as he ﬁnished the descent.
In our bedroom one day, O'Toole looked at my wardrobe of good clothes and said, 'You look as though you're in mourning for your sex life — all this black and violet. Give it here.'
It was late at night and raining as he gathered up armfuls of organza and wool, bags, shoes, gloves, frocks, hats and suits and, opening the window, ﬂung thousands of pounds' worth of clothes on to the wet cobbles below.
I had a momentary pang of regret. 'But what will I wear?' I asked.
'My clothes,' he said grandly, gathering me into his arms.
So we became the only couple in London who shared a wardrobe. Winter and summer, we wore cotton trousers, canvas shoes, lumberjack shirts and big knitted ﬁsherman sweaters. I had to roll his trousers up, of course, which made me look like a waif (he looked like a handsome pirate).
O'Toole's friends didn't approve of me. They felt his free spirit was being sucked into a conventional relationship and, with no special ill-will towards me, tried to put a stop to it.
I didn't mind. They weren't to know we had a new kind of equal partnership and that the last thing I had in mind was domesticity — as alien to me as it was to him.
My friends, advisers and employers were equally appalled and bluntly said that he would destroy my career, trample all over me.
They must be mad, I thought. I was deliriously in love. What could possibly go wrong?
During a break in Ireland in 1959, O'Toole suddenly clutched me and said, 'Have my children.' I instantly said, 'Yes.'
Five weeks later, it dawned on me that I must be pregnant. It turned out there was a conventional side to O'Toole after all: although he never proposed, he kept saying, 'We must arrange this marriage.'
Our wedding in Dublin was essentially an excuse for a p***-up. From pub to pub, we criss-crossed the city that night, gathering well-wishers. By 3am there were just ﬁve of us left, standing in a shebeen.
Was it marriage that changed him? Back in London, he would come grumpily home at night and sometimes go straight out again. Without me. Some nights, he didn't come home at all.
I knew what he was doing: he was leading the life we used to lead together, but now I was the wife and not really eligible. Nor, I realised, was he keen on me working, or at least not in leading roles.
I said nothing. All I'd ever wanted was to act — but the idea of a wife with a career, demanding rights, was laughable back then.
Then came an offer for O'Toole to play Shylock in The Merchant Of Venice in Peter Hall's new company. So in January 1960, as I neared the end of my pregnancy, we moved to Stratford-upon-Avon. We'd rented a big Edwardian house called Mount Pleasant (promptly re-christened 'Mount Unpleasant' by O'Toole).
Heavy now — and resenting it — I was surprised to ﬁnd that my free spirit, my equal partner, expected me to clean the house, wash, iron, provide meals and be on parade when needed.
Drink now became a dominant factor in our marriage. I made meals at night and threw them away uneaten before I went alone to bed. Often I'd wake to ﬁnd O'Toole asleep in an armchair, by an overturned glass.
In 1960, clever women shrugged tolerantly in the face of masculine stupidity. They knew if they complained, they would be branded as 'strident'. And when women did stamp and scream, they were laughed at. 'Stupid cow'. No one had any sympathy. But what happened next would have defeated me utterly, had I not understood that O'Toole was beside himself with nerves.
Word of his drinking habits had spread, and we knew his professional future depended on his performance as Shylock.
Although he was prepared, his moods became darker and more erratic. He justified this in a most unexpected way — by taking the moral high ground over my sexual past (no worse than that of most of the actresses he admired and respected).
Weeks went by with constant criticism of my morals. Even in public, he'd be savagely critical.
Why did I put up with this? In spite of everything, I believed O'Toole was worth it. I loved him; I also knew he'd had a terrible childhood and that a lot of his bad behaviour resulted from that. (He swore me to secrecy, so I'll never reveal what he told me.)
In any case, his occasional periods of sobriety brought wonderful interludes of repentance and irresistible charm, when I believed myself supremely loved and needed; but when I was made to feel like a useless encumbrance, I believed that just as fervently.
After the birth of our daughter, Kate, he visited the ward just once, bearing a white television set. There was no aerial. It sat in a corner, silent and glamorous.
I first met Rudolf Nureyev in 1962 but by our next meeting, he had become a huge star and partner to the ballerina Margot Fonteyn. 
At a dinner given in Belgravia, he arrived straight after a performance, picked up a small bottle of plum brandy and drained it in seconds. 
Next, he seemed to levitate on to the table and danced down its length, extending his arms and deftly but forcefully lifting off several women's false hair-pieces. 
Margot had now also arrived, smiling and imperturbable. 
I was pregnant and wearing a green Dior velvet dress and jacket, trimmed with heavy jet beads. 
The heat and excitement proved too much and, as I stood chatting to Margot, I knew I was going to faint. 
As I began to fall, I felt someone catch me. 
And when I regained consciousness, I was floating in a stairwell. 
Rudi, I realised, was carrying me above his head. 
He was drunk and I weighed a ton.
 He took me to a nursery and we chatted until he began to throw up violently. 
'Come on, mush,' barked O'Toole, as he seized Rudi's legs and began to bump him down the thickly carpeted stairs. 
There were cries of, 'Be c­areful! Take care of his feet.' 
'To hell with his f*****g feet,' muttered O'Toole.
One night, I woke to hear the sounds of drunken revelry from the grounds outside — O'Toole and a car full of actors had left the pub to come and serenade his daughter. Hoping no one would wake up and complain, I lay silently in the dark, looking at the ceiling until they went away.
Another day, I overheard my doctor talking to the Sister. Referring to a gypsy girl and me, he said, 'Keep both of them in. Neither has a suitable home environment.'
I couldn't look at my daughter for shame.
At home, there was a flow of people to cater for while I kept my eye on the clock for Kate's next meal. My mother-in-law paid a brief visit. It was hard not to react when she urged drink on her son. Didn't she know, 'Just one more small one, son' marked the beginning of the end of an evening?
Later, we had a visit from his father — a bookmaker from Leeds who was a feckless, occasionally violent drunk. I saw only the man O'Toole had told me about: the father sitting his little boy on the mantelpiece. Arms outstretched, he'd say, 'Jump, boy. I'll catch you. Trust me.'
When the child jumped, the father withdrew his arms and, as the child fell to the ﬂoor, he said, 'Never trust any bastard.'
O'Toole thought this was a good story. I found it despicable.
Producing a baby did nothing to improve my status. When a childhood friend of O'Toole's came to visit, my husband abused my character in front of me and then collapsed into a deep sleep.
His friend looked at me, picked up a big bowl of dressed salad, and smiled as he slowly emptied the oily contents on to the pale green carpet. Then he picked up a half-empty bottle of Scotch and, still smirking, sauntered to his bed in the guest room.
I picked up the salad, washed the carpet and fetched a rug to cover O'Toole, asleep in an armchair.
When Kate was four weeks old, I went to the opening of The Merchant Of Venice. 'One of the great nights in the theatre,' they called it. At the wild curtain calls, I sat with tears rolling down my face. Whatever it cost, I had to do all I could to help cherish this talent.
Soon afterwards, I opened in a play myself — The Taming Of The Shrew. The atmosphere at home worsened; the scenes resumed.
By the time Kate was nearly ﬁve months, our house had become a kind of ramshackle hotel for people who wanted to see the plays and stay over. O'Toole was lavish in his offers of hospitality but usually not there to attend to his guests. I muddled through from one nightmare meal to the next, constantly doing laundry and making beds.
Early one morning, after hours of close, drunken questioning about my past, O'Toole overturned a table. Doors slammed and his car sped erratically down the long drive.
I walked out of the house and lay in the wet, long grass on the lawn in my nightgown. It was almost dawn but I didn't feel the cold. My wish was to get ill and die. 'Let me just leave,' I said aloud.
As dawn broke, I heard the country noises around me and returned to my senses. Kate was inside, sleeping in her basket. What was I thinking of? So long as she was there, I'd have to be there for her. Getting up, I returned to the house and sat on the ﬂoor, leaning against the wall, waiting until she woke. It was never worth confronting O'Toole about his behaviour. But sometimes, unable to resist speaking up for myself, I'd add fuel to the ﬂames.
In a rage, he would erupt out of the house, running in bare feet across the dark Warwickshire ﬁelds while I stood alone, crying.
O'Toole knew, of course, that he was wiping out my self-confidence. At times, he would be remorseful and beg for forgiveness — though never for anything specific.
One day, he announced that my parents were taking Kate for a week and he and I were going to the west of Ireland. I was back in favour. Why? For how long?
In seconds, bags were packed, the fridge emptied, the car loaded. Then O'Toole held out his hand and I could no more resist him than stop breathing. Two days later, I was sitting in an Irish pub with him, totally happy with my decision to stay married.
For a while, the trip had a miraculous effect on our home life. Now, most nights after his show, Kate and I were invited to supper at a restaurant, where she slept in her basket under the table.
At times, O'Toole clutched at me as though his life depended on me. Then, every so often, our bubble of normality would be punctured by scenes of appalling verbal abuse.
I lost my precarious happiness. Sadness, which I didn't think to characterise as depression, crept closer. The criticisms of me grew more frequent and one night, I decided to leave.
The next day, I assembled Kate's things, packed and called a taxi.
It was over. Or so I thought . . .

1533,"“I WILL BE back in the office [in two weeks] and have limited Wi-Fi connection in the meantime.” It is safe to assume that readers of this column are familiar with something like this message (which, like all the others cited below, comes from real life). As with all aspects of office culture, the autoreply has evolved over time—and more quickly in the past 18 plague months. Good etiquette has not always kept up.
The precursor of the electronic “out of office” is sometimes found in Mediterranean countries, where a handwritten note taped to a shop front announces to the world: “Closed for August, back in September”. The digital autoreply was initially a quirk of Microsoft, a software giant, dating back to the company’s Xenix email system of the late 1980s, before bleeding into the mainstream in the following two decades.

In those early days responses tended to be terse and to the point. That style persists to this day, especially in the higher echelons of corporate hierarchies. C-suite executives’ autoreplies seldom feature jokes or emojis—if, that is, they are set up in the first place. A chief executive does not have to explain her or his absence or lack of prompt response, except possibly to the board (which will invariably have been informed of the boss’s movements).
Lower down the pecking order, however, people increasingly try to put their personal mark on their autoreplies. And if this stand-in Bartleby’s inbox is a guide, creativity has burgeoned in the age of lockdowns and remote work. Some try to be witty (“I will have limited enthusiasm for access to email”). Others share (“I am out of the office getting married!”). Others still plump for exoticism (“Please note that I am out travelling in a remote area in Greenland and will have no internet or phone connection for the majority of the period”).
Often, the autoreply involves people beyond the sender and recipient. Your columnist has on numerous occasions been named as the person to whom addressees of her colleagues’ autoreplies ought to direct queries. That can have long-running consequences. Public-relations types still refuse to remove her email address from their mailing lists even though she has patiently, and repeatedly, explained that climate change is not her beat so there is no point in sending her daily press releases about agroforestry in Kenya. Occasionally autoreplies turn into a cyberspace version of a treasure hunt. During the summer Bartleby’s email address was given out while she herself was on holiday so the recipient ended up being redirected again.
Such foibles notwithstanding, most office workers have no problem with the “out of office”. A survey of 1,000 people conducted in 2015 by Microsoft found that most respondents liked the practice. That is partly because setting it can mark the beginning of a holiday (which it did for 77% of the surveyed). But 60% also confessed to enjoying a jolly reply received from others.
Still, clear dos and don’ts exist. As an “out of office” connoisseur (and victim), Bartleby recommends being straightforward and informative. State the dates when you are away. If the period of absence is longer than a typical holiday, a word of explanation may be in order (jury duty, parental leave, sabbatical).
The message itself does not have to be a labour of love. Oversharing is awkward. “I’m on PTO” (paid time off) has been common in the corona-era despite the inelegance of reminding strangers that you received compensation for being unavailable. Humble-brags or an air of self-importance strike a false note.
Trying to be funny often falls flat on its face. Including suggestions to follow you on Twitter or emojis of an umbrella on a beach are best avoided. Three in ten respondents to Microsoft’s survey reported succumbing to sentiments of envy and fear of missing out upon being notified that others enjoyed tropical vacations. Veering off-topic, whether by including personal confessions or quotes from Muhammad Ali, shows not erudition or finesse but a distracted mind given to rambling. It is like having water on the knee—the best things found in the wrong places.
Being aware people want your attention before you return to your post can be instrumental in the management of any other large organisation. But if you are surfing in Maui, attending a conference, running an ultra-marathon in the Mojave desert, writing a novel, or taking time off to paint your mother’s garage, no one really needs to know the details.

1534,"BREAKING CONSTITUTIONS is often easier than making them. Kenya’s first two presidents, Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi, took a hatchet to the one negotiated at independence from Britain in 1963. By the time the butchery ended, Kenya was a one-party state run by untouchable kleptocrats. Fixing the damage took decades. Under international and domestic pressure, Moi repealed the provision banning all parties but his own in 1991. But it took 19 more years of bitter struggle before Kenya again had a constitution worthy of the name.
In recent years the hatchets have been out again. Kenya’s politicians finally accepted a new dispensation after post-election bloodshed claimed more than 1,000 lives in 2007-08. But the chastening effect of the violence did not last long. After another election controversy, in 2017, Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s president (and Jomo’s son) joined forces with Raila Odinga, his rival-turned-sidekick, to push for yet another constitutional overhaul under the sweetly named Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). On August 20th Kenya’s Court of Appeal thwarted the initiative and granted the constitution from 2010 a reprieve.

On the surface the BBI seemed a worthy enterprise. It was purported to be the glue that held the reconciliation between Messrs Kenyatta and Odinga (pictured, right and left) together. In 2017 the president secured re-election in a brace of contentious polls. Kenya teetered dangerously for months as Mr Odinga rejected the president’s initial victory, boycotted a court-ordered re-run and finally had himself sworn in as “the people’s president” before a baying mob of supporters. Nearly 100 people died in the accompanying political violence. The stand-off was defused only after the two rivals shook hands in March 2018 following secret talks. They have been inseparable ever since.
Yet it was little more than political expediency that underpinned the reconciliation. For the president it defused a nasty crisis, shored up his iffy legitimacy and neutralised an opponent. Better still, it offered a handy opportunity to ditch his deputy president, William Ruto, whose uses had waned after he helped secure his boss a second term. Although Mr Ruto remains in office, he is clearly an outcast, his place in the sun now taken by the more malleable Mr Odinga. (The deputy president is all too familiar with the carousel of betrayal in Kenyan politics, having previously abandoned Mr Odinga for Mr Kenyatta.)
Mr Odinga also benefited. After four failed bids for the presidency, he appears to have concluded that a share of power was better than none at all. More important, the president would now presumably back him rather than Mr Ruto as his successor in the election next August, when Mr Kenyatta is required to stand down.
A deal built on rank expediency needed a cloak of respectability, however. Mr Odinga had to justify to his supporters his reconciliation with the man he accused of thrice cheating him. The BBI helped cover the stink. Kenya’s ethnic and political divisions could be presented not as man-made but the result of surmountable constitutional flaws. A popular initiative to fix these would usher in a new era of peace and prosperity and allow its architects to cast themselves as saviours.
Kenyan civil society was appalled. However the politicians dressed it up, there was no popular clamour to alter the constitution. Nor was the initiative suggesting the odd tweak here and there. It would do real damage to the essence of the charter. The BBI would have altered 14 of its 18 chapters, reckons Jerotich Seii, an activist who campaigned to stop it.
Buried in the verbiage was what the activists considered the real purpose of the initiative: an expansion of executive power by creating the post of prime minister and two deputies. This would ease efforts by Messrs Odinga and Kenyatta to build an electable coalition by allowing them to dangle plum positions before the kingpins of smaller tribes.
Kenya’s judges were quick to sense a stitch-up. In May the High Court sided with Ms Seii and her fellow plaintiffs, who argued that the BBI was a meretricious attempt to hoodwink the Kenyan people. The judges ruled that the constitution permitted amendments resulting from a popular initiative, but the BBI had clearly been driven by the president, not the people. On August 20th the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s judgment and put a halt to a referendum to enshrine the BBI’s proposals into the constitution. Although there may yet be another appeal, Mr Odinga said he would accept the judgment and focus instead on next year’s election.
Some good has come out of a tawdry process. Kenya’s judiciary, which ordered a re-run of the presidential election in 2017 over irregularities, has again shown its mettle. The constitution itself has proved resilient, while the judgment has made it harder for politicians to meddle with it.
Bridges to nowhere
If the BBI enhanced the reputation of Kenya’s judges, its politicians emerged with less credit. Mr Kenyatta had hoped to secure his legacy with a grandiose national-development strategy meant to reach full speed by the end of his term. It has largely stalled, partly because he chose instead to waste his efforts on a failed piece of opportunistic scheming. His ally seems equally damaged. During the president’s first term, Mr Odinga offered robust and often principled opposition. Given how readily it was sacrificed for the sake of ambition, such principle looks increasingly coincidental.
If there is a political winner, it is Mr Ruto, who has noisily been thanking God for delivering Kenya from the disaster of the BBI. In reality the opposition he offered was tepid. Had the matter gone to a referendum, it is doubtful he would have led a “no” campaign. “It’s not worth expending political capital on,” a senior ally confided earlier this year.
That won’t stop Mr Ruto from making mileage out of the BBI’s failure. The deputy president believes his ticket to the top job lies in casting himself as an alternative to the corrupt political dynasties embodied by Messrs Kenyatta and Odinga (whose families have dominated Kenyan politics since independence). Never mind that Mr Ruto is rich and has been linked to numerous scandals (he denies any wrongdoing). Reinvention is a staple of Kenyan politics, and he has been able to recast himself as a principled outsider. Standing apart from the BBI fray has strengthened his narrative. With less than a year to go before Kenyans vote for a new president, Mr Ruto will be content with his position. ■",2
1535,"BEING AN OIL-INDUSTRY boss is an exercise in displeasing all sides. Pumping hydrocarbons out of the ground is lucrative, but angers environmentalists—including those sitting in boardrooms and governments. Renewables and other green projects are more palatable, but often fail to woo investors. TotalEnergies this week showed one way to straddle the divide.
On September 5th the French oil major signed an agreement with the government of Iraq to invest $27bn there over 25 years. The money will go to projects from the virtuous (a big solar farm) to the carbon-spewing (expanding an existing oilfield). One scheme will capture natural gas burned off as a by-product of oil extraction and use it to make less grubby electricity.

The deal is a boon for Iraq. It has struggled to lure investors to its energy sector. Corruption and political instability have pushed many of Total’s rivals, such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil, to exit Iraqi projects or consider doing so. The solar plant and rescued gas will reduce reliance on gas imports and electricity from Iran, an old foe, which has cut Iraq off before owing to unpaid bills. Regular blackouts in an oil-soaked country look awkward for politicians ahead of elections next month.
Total, for its part, has buttressed its reputation, tinging its carbon-belching operations with a green touch. A rebrand to TotalEnergies earlier this year is part of a push away from the black stuff and a commitment to “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050. The plan is backed by lots of climate-friendlier spending pledges.
In seeking greener pastures the firm has waded into places others avoid. Patrick Pouyanné, Total’s pugnacious boss, has made clear that only old-fashioned oil profits can fund a shift to clean energy. He is avidly chasing the world’s most cheaply extractable hydrocarbons, often in the Middle East and Africa. While rivals have poured money into American shale, Total is investing in countries that grace the bottom rungs of ease-of-doing-business rankings (think Libya and Venezuela). If things go well, Total can expect a gusher of rewards—profits of $95bn may flow to it over the life of the Iraqi contract.
Often they do not. Total’s big gas projects in Mozambique and Yemen have been disrupted by war and terrorism. This summer it lost $1.4bn as it wrote off some assets in Venezuela. In Iraq, too, Total has its work cut out. It will have to sink perhaps $5bn before seeing returns. It can at least expect help from high places as it seeks to manage political risk. The deal was signed in the wake of President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to the country in late August—his second in less than a year. ■

1536,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. To see them visit our hub
THE PLACE that is now known as George Floyd Square is these days blocked to cars, creating an effective memorial. Walk in from the Powderhorn Park end and you see posters giving advice about proper behaviour, rather like those signs outside a church advising that shorts and flash-photography are forbidden. A few doors down from the Cup Foods grocery store, the last place that Mr Floyd entered before he was murdered, an arts centre has been converted into a museum for all the protest signs that were waved on the street outside. Within the arts centre there is discussion of the importance of protest gardening. In a park nearby stand around 150 white plastic headstones, each of them marked with the name of an African-American killed by the police, their dates, a fist that was the emblem of the Black Panther party and the words “Rest in Power”. The combination of hippydom with symbols that are drawn from black radicalism gives the place something of the feel of the 1960s.
Powderhorn is nothing like such places as West Baltimore, Chicago’s South Side or East Cleveland, where neighbourhoods are full of abandoned houses, entrenched poverty, violence and heavy-handed policing. About half its residents are white, 30% Hispanic and 15% African-American, a patchwork that is as rare in Minneapolis as in other cities. Barbecue restaurants run by African-Americans coexist with places selling tacos and cafés in which everything is vegan, fair trade or both. This menu echoes the alliance of white liberals with African-Americans and Hispanics that keeps Democrats in power in almost all of America’s big cities. In Minneapolis the mayor, Jacob Frey, is young, Jewish and progressive, and the chief of police, Medaria Arradondo, is an African-American. This alliance can be uneasy—Nakima Levy Armstrong, a lawyer-professor turned activist, accuses the city council of being obsessed with “bike lanes and things white folks care about”. But it mostly holds together.

Minneapolis is an unlikely avatar of American racism. The city to which Mr Floyd moved from Houston was built by Scandinavian immigrants, who exploited the steep natural weir on the Mississippi river to create the milling capital of the world. These immigrants brought with them a distinctively Scandinavian form of capitalism. There is still an expectation that large companies will give away 5% of their pre-tax profits, and the chamber of commerce compiles a list of companies that have done so. “The list is long and you do not want to not be on it,” says David Mortenson, boss of Mortenson, a Fortune 500 construction company founded by his Swedish great-grandfather that is based in the city. One of these causes is refugee resettlement. Minnesota is home to large Hmong and Somali refugees from civil wars. Both groups are thriving: from time to time delegations of Swedes visit to try to work out why Somalis do so much better in Minneapolis than they do in Malmo.

Within this progressive utopia, though, are areas of concentrated poverty, where inhabitants are segregated by race and a boy is more likely as an adult to go to prison than to own a home or get married. Head north from Powderhorn Park towards downtown, where the old brick mills and warehouses on the Mississippi have been converted into attractive apartments and offices, and you find yourself in Phillips. Number-crunching by Raj Chetty and colleagues at Harvard University found that a black child born poor here 35 years ago would live today in a household where the average annual income is just $23,000 (£17,000). The number is a bit lower for boys, slightly higher for girls.
This poverty, passed from parent to child, is a feature of many big cities. Mr Floyd was raised in public housing in Houston, but seemed to find an exit via a sports scholarship to a community college in Florida. When that did not work out he bounced between part-time work, jail and struggles with drugs, finding hope through a religious awakening and moving to Minneapolis to start afresh. One of his jobs there was at a nightclub where Derek Chauvin worked off duty. Mr Floyd left one neighbourhood scarred by deep poverty only to land in another.
A pattern of deprivation
The persistence of deprivation in the same places, generation after generation, reflects how cities were settled. The South, where a majority of African-Americans still live, had formal segregation. Something similar was created in the north after the great migration of 6m black people, who moved from the bayous to the great lakes between 1916 and 1970 to flee Jim Crow and get better jobs. On arrival in Minneapolis, blacks who tried to make their homes in white areas were chased out by mobs and lawyers.
Even in the north, the threat of extreme violence was never far away. Although most of the 4,400-odd lynchings recorded by the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, took place in the South, this was a northern phenomenon too. In Duluth, a city in northern Minnesota, six African-American circus workers were accused in 1920 of raping a white woman. An examination by a physician found no evidence of this. Three were lynched anyway. A black-and-white photograph shows two men stripped to the waist and hanging by ropes from a pole, with a third man dead on the ground. They are surrounded by a large group of white men in suits and hats, some of them smiling. Duluth has had an awokening too: it put up a memorial to the victims last October.
Racial boundaries were often enforced by restrictive covenants on homes. The Mapping Prejudice project at the University of Minnesota has uncovered thousands of these, forming a ring around downtown Minneapolis. One clause in such a deed reads: “This property shall not be sold, mortgaged or leased to or occupied by any person or persons other than members of the Caucasian race.” These clauses reflected racial classifications common at the time. Some referred to Aryans, the category placed first by the Minnesota Eugenics Society run by Charles Fremont Dight, who believed the key to progress was a mix of socialism with state-sponsored sterilisation of the feeble-minded. He counted Adolf Hitler among his correspondents.
When the Federal Housing Administration, created as part of the New Deal, began to underwrite mortgages in the 1930s, these racial covenants helped determine where to lend—and where not to. Light-skinned borrowers received subsidised credit to buy or build new homes, dark-skinned ones did not. In 1948, in Shelley v Kraemer, the Supreme Court ruled that such covenants, which were common in most big cities, could not be enforced. But anyone who sold to a black family could still be sued for damaging the value of nearby properties.
This practice was only finally stopped by the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But after the act was passed, a large number of whites fled to the suburbs, sometimes along new federal highways that were either built right through black neighbourhoods or were actively planned to wall them in. Chicago constructed a 14-lane expressway that separated a predominantly black neighbourhood with lots of public housing from the rest of the city. In Montgomery, Alabama, the federal highway follows a snaking path that seems to make little sense—unless you know which parts of town were black and which white.

Despite this, the first half of the 20th century and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 marked big progress for African-Americans. In 1900 life expectancy for black Americans was just 33 years, against 48 for white ones. By 1960 the gap had narrowed to seven years. After that, progress stalled. One of the most counter-intuitive facts about economic progress for African-Americans is that most of it happened before the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s. Rates of black home-ownership in 2021 are lower than rates of white home-ownership were in 1870. In Minneapolis, three-quarters of white families own homes but only a quarter of black families do, the second widest gap in the country. A survey by Robert Putnam and Shaylyn Romney Garrett in their book “The Upswing” concluded that there was “essentially no relative economic progress” for black men after 1970.
This presents a paradox. All but the most determined pessimist would concede that racism has declined since Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968. So why have the life prospects of African-Americans, particularly men, stopped improving? The answer often given by campaigners is still racism, but transmuted into a new hidden and insidious form. This is true, yet it is more complicated than that word implies.
The great stalling
Shortly after African-Americans were guaranteed voting rights by Lyndon Johnson and a coalition of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, the great migration ended. Deindustrialisation swept through northern cities that would soon form the rustbelt. Racism did not do this: recession, shifting trade patterns, technological change and the appeal of non-unionised workforces in the South were more responsible. But, as the sociologist William Julius Wilson puts it, racist housing policies had put African-Americans in places where job losses were worst, and racist education policies had over generations left them with fewer skills to adjust and compete. Decades later the scarring is still visible. Only 60% of African-American men are employed, compared with 66% of white men and 73% of Hispanics.
At the same time two things happened to black neighbourhoods. The first was a crime spike, the causes of which are still disputed. African-American men were more likely to be both victims and perpetrators. For black men who dropped out of high school, a spell in prison became a normal stop on the road to middle age, damaging their prospects on release and making African-American families less stable. By the mid-2000s two in every 100 black men were behind bars (the share has since fallen). The spree of lawlessness began to wane in the 1990s, for reasons that were as mysterious as they were welcome. But crime remains higher in predominantly African-American spots: 40% of black Americans say they are afraid to walk around after dark, compared with 30% of whites. This is one reason why defunding the police is so unpopular in black neighbourhoods.
The second big change was that not only did many whites leave for the suburbs, but so did many middle-class African-Americans who could get out. Thus began also a reverse migration to the South. In northern cities where the population has shrunk, residential segregation is harder to undo because little new housing is now being built. Minneapolis, which in the 1970s built the majority of its public housing in the suburbs, now builds it in more deprived areas, concentrating poverty there. The city and state also paused a politically awkward effort to integrate schools. As a result, even as cities have grown more diverse and gentrified, at a neighbourhood level black-white residential segregation is still stuck in the 1970s.
Those left behind have not fared well. Black boys born 30 years ago in the area now known as George Floyd Square would go on to live in households with an average annual income of $17,000 a year in their 30s. One in ten would spend time in prison. This was the neighbourhood where Mr Floyd found himself outside Cup Foods that night in May 2020, with a police officer on top of him. But what brought Derek Chauvin there?■

1537,"MOST NATIONS are born in a flurry of optimism. South Sudan was no different. Ahead of its independence day on July 9th 2011, Salva Kiir, the country’s first and only president, promised his people “a just, equitable and prosperous nation”. Unshackled from its former overlords in the north, the new state would be “united and peaceful” within three years, its founding fathers predicted.
If any nation deserved some slack, it was South Sudan. In the half-century before it seceded from Muslim-dominated Sudan its people had known little but war, famine and enslavement. A decade later, however, South Sudan is neither just, nor equitable, nor prosperous. Having scoffed at those who suggested that it would “slip into civil war as soon as our flag is hoisted” in his independence-day speech, Mr Kiir helped unleash one just two years later. It claimed perhaps 400,000 lives before a tenuous ceasefire in 2018.

The blame for South Sudan’s tragedy does not rest only on the shoulders of its leaders. The country’s Western backers, particularly in America, were ludicrously unrealistic about what a state created from scratch, with little infrastructure or national identity, could achieve.
Such was the naivety that, in the years before independence, some American officials took to handing out Milton Friedman’s “Capitalism and Freedom” to warlords preparing to swap their uniforms for suits. Others took up roles advising the new government on how to woo the foreign investment that would surely follow.
The American advisers have since slunk away. (One now runs a distillery in South Carolina.) Most foreign investors, after all, shy away from war-ravaged states. That South Sudan is ranked the world’s sixth-hardest place to do business by the World Bank and sits at the bottom of Transparency International’s corruption index may clinch the matter for any still wavering.

South Sudan’s leaders turned out to be neither the cuddly human-rights champions imagined by the American left, nor the market-loving Friedmanites hoped for on the right. Instead, Mr Kiir’s ruling Sudan People’s Liberation Movement has proved to be murderous, larcenous and incompetent, as even once supportive Western officials now admit. “We veer between despair and disgust,” says one.
Beyond the political elite, it is hard to find many people who are better off than they were before independence. Few have seen any benefit from the country’s dwindling oil wealth. Humanitarian agencies calculate that a South Sudanese girl is more likely to die in childbirth than to complete secondary school.
There are a few reasons for cautious optimism. In 2018 President Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, agreed to a peace agreement that more or less ended the fighting between their respective tribes. Mr Machar was reinstalled as first vice-president. Yet killing by ethnic militias continues. Four aid workers have been murdered in the past two months. Roughly a quarter of the population is still being fed by aid agencies; otherwise there would be famine. The deal between the president and his deputy is fragile. Should South Sudan ever hold its first election (as it is supposed to do in December 2022), civil war could easily re-erupt.
Such a catastrophe could be averted. Western diplomats and regional powers hope to persuade both sides to strike a bargain whereby election losers are still granted a share of power. This could be done by rotating the presidency among ethnic alliances and guaranteeing vice-presidential slots to losing parties. South Sudan is short of many things, but not of vice-presidents: it has five. A federal system may pacify disgruntled minority groups.
Such reform would happen only if the president and his deputy, who both dream of holding untrammelled power, were persuaded to resign. That step might help South Sudan avoid becoming a failed state. Sadly, it seems most unlikely to be taken.■",2
1538," (CNN Business)Entering the new Amazon Web Services Skills Center is a bit like walking into a high-tech museum. Among its exhibits are a rotating, globe-shaped screen that displays images of planets or weather patterns, an interactive ""smart home"" model and a table full of small robot vehicles trained by machine learning.  The space is designed to introduce visitors to practical applications of cloud computing — an increasingly popular set-up in which companies' technical operations are run in data centers managed by Amazon or other cloud companies, rather than in costly on-site servers. AWS hopes the center will interest some visitors in the possibility of a career in the industry. The Skills Center, which is located on Amazon's corporate headquarters campus in Seattle, Washington, and opens to the public November 22, is the first of its kind for the company. It's part of a larger commitment to train 29 million people globally in cloud computing by 2025 that AWS made last year.  It's also one of the first major announcements that new AWS chief executive Adam Selipsky has made since taking over from Andy Jassy, who was elevated to Amazon CEO when Jeff Bezos left the post in July. The Skills Center is ""going to be a free, accessible space for anybody who wants to learn more about cloud computing, what it is, what the applications are ... everything that illustrates the true breadth of the cloud, and importantly, there's going to be a lot of skills training here,"" Selipsky told CNN Business in an exclusive interview ahead of the center's opening.""There's a dramatic need for digital skills overall, and for cloud skills in particular, and this is part of a very broad effort,"" he said. ""We're going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to bring that training to tens of millions of people worldwide.""  Although the company declined to disclose an exact amount, it's a big investment into free training for people who will mostly become employees of other companies. But it's crucial to AWS's business because of a significant talent gap that threatens to hamper potential customers' adoption of cloud technology.""I have that conversation with executives of companies all the time,"" said Maureen Lonergan, vice president of AWS Training and Certification. ""So we work not only on training new people to cloud but working with customers to transform their traditional IT staff to cloud-fluent individuals.""  The talent gap comes as demand for cloud computing has surged during the pandemic. But AWS, long the cloud industry leader, is facing steep competition from rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOGLGOOGLE) Cloud, something Selipsky will have to address as the unit's new leader.  Though Amazon (AMZN) is best known for e-commerce, its cloud unit has long been its biggest money maker. In the most recent quarter, AWS contributed nearly 56% of the company's overall net income, and it now has a revenue run rate of around $64 billion. ""The cloud is actually one of the most transformative technological changes of our generation,"" said Selipsky, who started at AWS in the division's early days and spent 11 years with the company before leaving to run data visualization firm Tableau for five years. ""I know that sounds like a big statement but if you think about, when is the last time you went to rent a DVD or incurred late fees? Netflix changed all of that by streaming and that happens on AWS ... No matter what sector you look at, no matter what application you look at, it's now more and more not running in data centers that companies build and operate and put capital into and stress out about, it operates through a place like AWS."" At the Skills Center, Amazon plans to invite anyone from the Seattle community — students, unemployed workers or others looking for a career change — to get a better sense of what cloud computing is and why it matters; for example, it makes real-time, mobile gaming over the internet possible. From there, visitors interested in career opportunities in the field will have access to free tech and cloud basics courses at the center, and may be directed to AWS's other training resources. The company hopes tens of thousands of people will visit the center to explore or take classes each year. As part of Thursday's announcement, the company also said it will add around 60 free, digital cloud computing training and certification courses to Amazon.com. It is also expanding access to its Re/Start program, a free 12-week training course that prepares people for an entry level job in cloud computing, from 25 cities in 12 countries in 2020 to more than 95 cities in 38 countries by the end of 2021. The company expects to open more Skills Centers around the world starting next year, according to Lonergan.The company also hopes to reach people who have had a harder time accessing roles in tech. The Skills Center and the training programs are free and target people who don't have prior experience in tech. The company also plans to partner with local workforce development agencies in Seattle to bring people from diverse backgrounds into the facility. That effort could help increase diversity in the cloud computing field, which, like the larger tech world, still skews white and male. Amazon's own global corporate staff was comprised of nearly 69% men and 47% white employees in 2020, according to its most recent workforce data report.  ""Our customers are so incredibly diverse and who they are, and their use cases and their industries, and the companies in which they operate are so diverse, it's hard to imagine that we could really deliver what they need from us if we are not equally diverse,"" Selipsky said.

1539,"THE AVATARS are mostly cartoon versions of people. They are all milling around a swimming pool built like a funnel, with virtual water sliding out of sight through its navel. To move, users manipulate keyboard controls familiar to anyone who misspent their youth playing computer games: W, A, S, D to walk forwards, left, backwards and right; space bar to jump. A sign next to the pool reads “diving allowed”. Your correspondent presses W and her flaxen-haired simulated self climbs up and over the edge of the red diving board, plunging into the pool’s centre.
This is what it is like to enter Decentraland, a virtual-reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, also known as a “metaverse”, where virtual shops sell digital collectables and tokens. The disorientating “down the rabbit hole” feeling of diving in is all too similar to what you feel when you first hear of developers’ efforts to “decentralise” everything you do online. A growing number of them are seeking to rebuild both the financial system and the internet economy using blockchains—databases distributed over many computers and kept secure by cryptography. The ultimate goal is to replace intermediaries like global banks and tech platforms with software built on top of networks that direct the value they generate back to the users who own and run them.

Of all digital activities, it is efforts towards decentralising finance that are most advanced. Far from the self-aggrandising ambition of Wall Street, decentralised finance (DeFi) instead seeks Utopian-sounding crowdsourced control. Applications and functions are run not by a single centralised entity or company, but by user-operated “decentralised autonomous organisations” (DAOs). “I will be just a regular community member,” says Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO, a DeFi organisation. “In the end, it is mostly about how you contribute, not who you are.”
Talk of blockchains, DAOs and metaverses sounds so utterly bewildering and far-fetched that it might be tempting to give up listening to the DeFi crowd. The success of this nascent technology is, indeed, far from guaranteed. But piece by piece a new kind of economy is being built through applications on various blockchains. Each addition makes it more likely that the whole will amount to something meaningful and powerfully disruptive.

DeFi has grown tremendously in scale and scope in recent years. The Ethereum blockchain, which underpins much of DeFi activity, settled $2.5trn-worth of transactions in the second quarter of 2021, including payments and transactions to facilitate trading and lending. (Visa, a payments giant, settled about the same amount in the same period; Nasdaq, a stock exchange, traded six times as much.) Around $90bn of collateral is being used for various DeFi functions, compared with less than $1bn in early 2018. More than half is held in the five most popular DeFi applications, but developers are working on more than a hundred others, dozens of which are rapidly amassing assets. Innovations, such as automated marketmakers, arbitrage systems and self-stabilising currency regimes, are already pushing the boundaries of financial technology.
The promise of DeFi is that it could lead to a better kind of finance: a system that is quicker, cheaper, more transparent and less reliant on powerful centralised institutions. It could also underpin a digital economy that is less dominated by a handful of tech giants. But there are plenty of pitfalls in the way, not least the huge amount of speculation taking place in the world of DeFi and the risk that it becomes colonised by dirty money or sullied by blockchains’ vast energy use.
DeFi’s opportunity comes about because centralisation brings problems. True, it is cheaper to build a financial-settlement system run by an entity everyone trusts, such as the Federal Reserve, than to get a diffuse group of individuals to verify transactions. But government infrastructure ossifies. Private networks can tend towards monopoly, encouraging anti-competitive behaviour and rent extraction.
The Fed’s adoption of an instant-payments system, for instance, has proceeded at a glacial pace. Card-network operators like Mastercard and Visa make gross profit margins of 60-80%. Tech giants can wield their market power anti-competitively, or in ways their users dislike. Apple changed how its platform worked with third parties to stop Facebook tracking users; Facebook itself alters its content-delivery algorithms as it pleases; YouTube “demonetises” content creators on a whim. Each takes the lion’s share of the profits associated with their networks.
Decentralisation offers an alternative: interoperable, transparent, often efficient systems that, by distributing control over software, guard against the concentration of power. The first instance of such a decentralised system was Bitcoin, a digital-payments network verified by a blockchain, which was created in 2009 with the aim of replacing centrally issued money. But technology has evolved since then, and Bitcoin is now largely a distraction. People “seize on the money part, and either glorify it as a new kind of monetary system…or crucify it as a danger to economic stability,” writes Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm that has raised some $3bn to invest in crypto-technology. They are missing the point. “Crypto represents an architectural shift in how technology works and therefore how the world works.”
That shift is distributed consensus—the ability for many “decentralised” participants in a network to establish trust. Its potential to facilitate more than payments became clearer with the creation in 2015 of the Ethereum blockchain (see chart 1). This stores and records lines of computer code, including entire programs, which are visible to all. That makes it possible to construct smart contracts—self-executing agreements in which a chain of actions follows when certain conditions are met. These are automatically enforced and cannot be tampered with.

The Ethereum blockchain and others designed to store lines of code, like Cardano, also issue and use their own tokens, called “ether” and “ADA”, respectively. To verify a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain you must pay a variable “gas” fee, owed in ether.
The advantage of using a blockchain is that it is like a new sort of computer. A physical computer is a way to store data and process it with a set of instructions, called a program. The Ethereum blockchain, too, is a way to store data and operate on it, like a virtual computer that runs on top of a network of physical computers. The consequence is that it ensures that “the computer will continue to operate as designed”, as Chris Dixon, who launched Andreessen’s crypto fund, has described it.
Every computer, outside a blockchain, is controlled by a person or organisation that can change their mind. This is sometimes true at the physical, hardware level: Apple, in many ways, retains broad control over the devices it sells through its ability to push software updates (the way in which it neutered Facebook’s trackers). More important, this applies across all web pages and applications. Each time someone logs on to Facebook, say, they rely on the servers the company runs to host its website. By controlling the hardware, companies can change the software as they please.
On a blockchain, though, this relationship is inverted: the software governs the hardware, and can make guarantees. Computers that are controlled by blockchain technology are, in Mr Dixon’s words, “computers that can make commitments”.

Once a decentralised foundation to store and execute lines of code has been laid, anything can be built on top—assets, say, or applications (see chart 2). The only limit is the developer’s imagination. All kinds of “tokens”, or digital representations of assets, exist. Some resemble financial building-blocks, like shares, bonds and “stablecoins”, which are typically pegged to conventional currencies. Others are governance tokens, which work as votes determining how DAOs are run. And “non-fungible” tokens (NFTs) represent unique assets, like an image or a video. The market for these has boomed over the past year. Some $23bn-worth of NFTs now exist.
Tokens can be swapped or lent out through “protocols”—the rules that govern how transactions take place. These in turn are governed by DAOs and can be altered only by consensus. Users can then buy and swap tokens through a web-browser-based interface that connects them to protocols.
Off with their heads
To enter the decentralised world it is necessary to create a wallet, which stores tokens. One type of wallet is managed by a centralised exchange, like Coinbase. Another, like MetaMask, lets users hold their own private keys. Centralised systems feel familiar: they have usernames and passwords that can be reset. They also hold tokens on users’ behalf, making them a target for attacks. Dishonest or incompetent exchange operators have lost or had customers’ assets stolen from them. Users of MetaMask or a similar wallet, by contrast, have full control over their assets. But if they lose their key, their tokens are lost for ever. MetaMask counts 10m active users, up from about 600,000 a year ago.
Creating a wallet creates a unique online identity, which allows you to interact with any DeFi application, including metaverses like Decentraland. This in turn lets you deposit tokens to earn interest, swap them for other coins, or shop in metaverse malls. Genuine innovation is also taking place in the world of DeFi, which could improve upon real-world finance. Three particularly impressive examples stand out.
One is decentralised exchanges. Given the vulnerability of centralised exchanges to attacks and theft, developers have set about building alternatives on a blockchain. Rather than depositing assets for, say, Coinbase to trade on your behalf, execution is instead carried out through smart contracts. Both sides of the trade are performed in one indivisible transaction. This eliminates the need for intermediaries such as escrow services and central counterparty clearing-houses. UniSwap, one of the largest decentralised exchanges, is especially popular for swapping Ethereum-based tokens. It trades tokens worth around $1bn every day.
The second example relates to the difficulty of issuing a reliable stablecoin. Stable assets are useful: tokens pegged to the dollar or other currencies facilitate transactions between other tokens and provide the basis for financial contracts. Early solutions relied on centralised control, which makes it hard to know for sure that they are fully collateralised. The two biggest stablecoins, Tether and USD Coin, have together issued around $100bn in tokens. The collateral for these, a mix of cash and short-term corporate debt, is held not on a blockchain, but in bank or brokerage accounts. Both firms decide how to back their stablecoins and when to publish their accounts. In March New York’s attorney-general found that Tether was not fully collateralised for periods in 2017 and 2018, and fined it $18.5m. (Tether denied wrongdoing.)
One way of knowing for sure that a stablecoin is fully backed is by keeping the collateral on an open blockchain, which is transparent, and storing it in a smart contract. The problem is that the collateral must be held in an asset native to a blockchain, like bitcoin or ether, which fluctuates wildly. There is, however, a clever workaround. The biggest “on-chain” stablecoin is dai, run by Mr Christensen’s MakerDAO. Anyone can create new dai tokens, as long as they lock up enough collateral, usually ether, in a smart contract.
Because ether is volatile, the protocol requires users to over-collateralise the tokens they create. If the value of a user’s collateral falls below 150% of the value of the outstanding dai, the smart contract automatically auctions off the collateral to cancel the debt in dai. To reclaim collateral the dai must be returned, plus a small variable “stability” fee (paid in dai) which tends to climb with volatility in collateral.
Dai is remarkably stable against the dollar. Only once, when ether dropped sharply in 2020, did the peg break, with dai falling by around 10% in 12 hours. This occurred in part because developers had fixed a maximum stability fee into the protocol. To replenish funds and restore the peg new governance tokens were issued, diluting the current owners. The coding problem was solved over the following months by a consensus of those holding the governance tokens. In 2021, when ether crashed again, dai remained stable. Around $6.5bn in dai currently exists.
A third example of innovation is lending protocols. Because users can remain unknown, in order to borrow from a lender they must first deposit some tokens, like dai, as collateral. Users can then borrow against that collateral in a different token. But developers have come up with a way to avoid such deposits for “flash loans”, which are instantly issued and settled.
Transactions on blockchains are finalised only when a new bundle of transactions, called a block, is accepted by the network. Adding blocks takes time, around ten minutes on Bitcoin and 13 seconds on Ethereum. For a flash loan on Ethereum a borrower requests and repays the funds, plus a 0.09% fee, within the same block. If the borrower fails to repay, the entire transaction is cancelled, so that no funds were ever borrowed. The lender takes no risk at all. These loans are mostly used for arbitrage opportunities between token-trading platforms. Since their creation, says Fabian Schär of the University of Basel, the markets for most tokens have become more efficient. Two of the biggest lending protocols on the Ethereum blockchain that offer flash loans are Aave and Compound. They have lent out some $16bn and $11bn in tokens, respectively.
All these services are efficient and creative solutions to financial problems. Automated exchanges, like those built through UniSwap, and flash loans, which make seamless arbitrage possible, enhance the efficiency of financial plumbing. The automatic stabilisers built into dai are a clever fix for a difficult problem. And DAOs are fascinating experiments in the democratic governance of entities that oversee billions of dollars in trading and lending. The problem is that, so far, they are all being used to facilitate an incorporeal casino. Most of these applications are used to speculate on unstable tokens, including bitcoin and ether.
If DeFi is to go beyond speculation, one of two scenarios must come to pass. The first is expansion into the realms of conventional finance. Much of the energy in DeFi is spent on enabling finance for a universe that is “on chain”. That is understandable: those that bridge the gap with the real world, like centralised exchanges and stablecoin issuers, have been the source of hacks and fraud. But to be useful for everyday finance—mortgage lending, say—DeFi would have to straddle the virtual and real worlds.
NFTs, for instance, could become more widely used. Today they are digital collectable claims, but in theory they could represent ownership claims on homes. Mortgage creation could then be wrapped into a single, efficient bundle: the owner of the “Red Cottage, Whitburn” NFT would swap it with the buyer, who would deposit it with an automated collateralised-lending platform like Aave or Compound. The buyer would receive tokens in return, which would then be automatically transferred to the seller. To hold the NFT again the buyer would, over time, deposit enough stablecoins with the platform to pay off the loan.
Because tokens can be digital representations of nearly anything, they could be efficient solutions to all sorts of financial problems. Deposit accounts with banks can be expensive; the stock-settlement system is slow. By contrast, stablecoin transactions settle almost instantly, and incur no or low fees. For DeFi to be the answer to real-world problems, though, the legal system must enforce on-chain outcomes in the “off-chain” world, and regulation must guard against fraud and misuse.
It is generally tricky to convert conventional money into tokens without identification checks. Most services that exchange dollars into ether or bitcoin, like Coinbase, conduct “know your customer” checks, intended to deter money-laundering. Yet the fact that, once in the on-chain world, anyone can easily move tokens around, has raised legitimate fears about the ways in which DeFi will be harnessed by criminals to launder and move dirty money.
Regulators want financial intermediaries to be on the lookout for suspicious transactions, but DeFi rejects this role. The attempt to include a vague but seemingly modest provision to regulate the industry in an infrastructure bill in America, for instance, was met with howls of outrage from the DeFi crowd. Fierce resistance to regulation only fuels the perception that it is up to no good, and could strengthen regulators’ desire to clamp down on flows into the on-chain world.
If DeFi does not merge with off-chain finance, it could instead thrive in a distinct world built on blockchains. Science-fiction writers have long explored the idea that people will one day live their lives—go shopping or visit virtual offices—in online metaverses like Decentraland. The parallel virtual world could also develop if the centralised tech platforms are supplanted by decentralised rivals.
The Tea Party
Imagine, for instance, a rival platform to YouTube that awards users various kinds of tokens: those that act as compensation for uploading videos, and can be scaled to reflect how popular uploads are, to attract content creators; or governance tokens, to determine how the platform is run. If the platform caught on, these tokens might rise in value, rewarding early adopters and luring new users. This sort of model is made possible because blockchains hold organisations to their promises about how their platform would work.
You could go on to imagine new models for all kinds of industries. Once an artist sells a work, she has no stake in its value. If she later gains popularity, the gains all go to the buyer. If she sold an NFT image she could retain a stake in future sales of that work, by coding into the smart contract that she will receive, say, 10% of any transaction value. This would have been far too expensive to enforce without a smart contract on a transparent blockchain.

Emily Ratajkowski, a model who has written about her inability to retain ownership over her image because photographers own all rights to pictures, has issued a selfie NFT in this way. Musicians are starting to monetise their fan base by issuing albums as NFTs or creating tokens that offer fans exclusive merchandise and front-row seats at gigs, all without intermediaries. If this activity booms, the financial system underpinning it will become critical.
This is not to say that decentralisation is always the answer. “The question to ask is: why can’t I just use a centralised database? It is much simpler and faster than a decentralised system,” says Dan Boneh of Stanford University. But for some problems decentralisation is the way to go. “If there is no single party that everyone trusts, then decentralisation is a good option.” But, he admits, “there is greater complexity as a result.”
The biggest problem is that verification by consensus can slow down systems. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use a process called “proof of work” to verify transactions, which can consume vast amounts of energy. One way to improve the system is to use other proof mechanisms. Other workarounds exist, too. “Much of the focus today is scalability, which is achieved by touching the blockchain as little as possible,” says Mr Boneh.
The incentive to become more efficient can be self-reinforcing. As DeFi usage grows the demand for verification by the blockchain also climbs, prompting a rise in gas fees. This has led developers to pursue things like “roll-ups”, which group transactions together and verify the bundle via the blockchain, reducing demand and therefore the energy needed to verify transactions.
With such workarounds still being developed and attempts to create platforms in their infancy, it is speculative to think that decentralisation will take off. The problems of DeFi—not just the energy intensity of blockchains but the rampant speculation, the potential to be flooded with dirty money and the apparent resistance to regulation—all stand to deter mass adoption. Yet the potential gains from payment and digital content platforms owned and governed by their users, a more open digital economy and a more efficient financial system are vast. The hope is that it is not all just a dream. ■

1540,"WHEN COVID-19 led to a scramble for face masks, Lloyd Armbrust saw America’s shortage as “a really dumb problem to have”. But after his company’s first face mask came off the production line in Austin, Texas, he faced problems of his own. A small sensor went down, halting operations, and he realised that a replacement would take five days to arrive from Taiwan. He found himself competing for American customers with Chinese companies selling masks for less than they cost to ship. Without government intervention, he warned that America would again face shortages of crucial protective equipment. “We need to make some of this locally,” he says. “We just do.”
Mr Armbrust is not alone in thinking supply chains warrant government intervention. The virus came with a flurry of export restrictions on medical products and a plunge in Chinese exports that raised doubts over whether its production clusters had exposed the world to excessive risk. The private sector promises to adapt. Jacob Wallenberg of the European Round Table for Industry reports more plan Bs in place than two years ago, as well as supply-chain issues appearing on boardroom agendas. But inflation has now popped up as often as logistics, so the emphasis on just-in-case rather than just-in-time may prove fleeting.

Policymakers are unlikely to leave everything to private companies. Indeed, the Biden administration has blamed some vulnerabilities on the drive for corporate efficiency, and a goal of greater resilience now frames its trade policy. Luz María de la Mora, Mexico’s undersecretary for foreign trade, says “there’s a reassessment of how far we can go in this globalisation.” That means looking at strengthening domestic industry according to criteria beyond just the market. In Japan officials are considering how to maintain industrial bases in sensitive technologies and industries. The European Commission has adopted resilience as a “new compass for EU policymaking”, persuading even champions of open trade to fret about “strategic dependence”.

The rhetoric around greater resilience is further advanced than any concrete action. And over time, some will turn out to be little more than hype, or window-dressing for policies that were planned already. Many poor countries worry that the pandemic has exposed long-standing vulnerabilities that are hard to fix, most obviously their dependence on tourism. But in richer places the policy responses will involve a grab for three things: facts, friends and fortification.
The urge to gather information has taken the form of a wave of supply-chain reviews. The Biden administration is doing one, as is the British government, which has a secretive “Project Defend” to identify supply-chain vulnerabilities. These reviews seek to dig into individual industries and identify sources of supply so concentrated that they justify intervention. Such investigations can be hard, requiring data that often do not exist. The extent of dependence will vary according to domestic production, the concentration of foreign sourcing and the availability of close substitutes. The American review found that the Food and Drug Administration did not know how many pharmaceutical ingredients were sourced from abroad, only the number of registered facilities. As important as knowing what is made and imported is knowing what could be made or procured in a pinch. Such information is even harder to find.
Some results are trickling in. A review by the European Commission identified 137 of 5,000 imported products with a dominant foreign supplier. Of those, only around 34 were hard to substitute by using other suppliers, representing just 0.6% of EU imports by value. That sort of finding has prompted Simon Evenett of Global Trade Alert, a trade watchdog, to describe the problem of resilience as “a bit like a Russian doll—there’s less and less there.” Such exercises may understate the problem, however. The sensor Mr Armbrust needed was worth more to his operation than the $5 it cost him. And if a single-sourced input is processed in different places, a buyer may miss a key vulnerability. In June the G7 floated the idea of supply-chain stress tests, rather like those that are now carried out for banks.
The information gathering will continue—and with it demands on private companies to share data. Policymakers appear to be coalescing around a set of products of particular concern. In a review of critical supply chains that was published in June, the Biden administration honed in on electric vehicles, active pharmaceutical ingredients, semiconductors and rare earths. (In 2019 Taiwan accounted for 92% of high-end semiconductor production.) The European Commission emphasised lithium batteries for electric vehicles, active pharmaceutical ingredients, semiconductors and raw materials (including rare earths), as well as cloud and edge computing.
The second strand of actions to foster resilience involves bolstering alliances between like-minded allies, to diversify and “friend-shore” production away from China. Some of this has an air of performance, though after four years of Donald Trump badmouthing America’s allies, some public schmoozing may be welcome. But much responds to problems that have been recognised for years, such as the heavily concentrated business of mining and processing rare earths. Possible collaborations include one between America, Australia and Japan to increase processing capacity outside China, and another between the EU and Canada to match investors with potential projects.
Subsidy wars
Much of this co-ordination is only at an early stage. In June a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies between America, Britain and the EU was settled by creating two new co-operative frameworks, to analyse jointly “non-market practices”—that means Chinese subsidies—“with the goal of establishing the basis for joint or parallel action in the future”. Other links are meant to manage a shift of supply chains, like the agreement in April between Japan and America to collaborate over semiconductors.
The third prong of governments’ quest for greater resilience involves fortifying domestic economies. This implies sharpening defensive trade tools. In May Katherine Tai, the US trade representative, called for new defensive tools to deal with prospective damage to American business from foreign competition rather than responding only after the fact. Britain is also reviewing trade remedies, out of concern that in 2020 33% of goods exports were potentially in competition with companies benefiting from state subsidies, up from 7% in 2010. And the EU is creating defences in its single market against foreign subsidies.
It also implies an inward turn. The “Buy America” laws that the Biden administration hopes to strengthen will further reduce foreign access to a massive public-procurement market. Mr Armbrust has heard that help from the government is coming; the innovation and competition bill before Congress includes a supply-chain resilience programme to reshore production of personal protective equipment and medicines. In China, where the authorities were rattled by American restrictions on exports of some technologies, the government has reportedly issued new procurement guidelines setting local content requirements of up to 100% for 315 items, including medical equipment and seismic instruments. The government’s 14th five-year plan in March included a strategy to increase self-reliance by raising spending on research by 7% a year.
This fits with a general tilt towards industrial policy. In the pandemic, the fear was that foreign suppliers might protect national interests at the expense of trade flows. When British and American cash for vaccine-makers came on condition that production would go first to their populations, other countries like Australia, Canada, South Africa and South Korea that wanted to secure supplies invested in the final stage of production. In July the WTO valiantly published a list of vaccine inputs, to help governments assess which trade flows not to impede. Many politicians now believe that in a crisis foreign suppliers are unreliable.
The semiconductor industry is being vigorously chased by government cash, in part because of the perception that existing production sites arose from public subsidy. The Biden administration’s review noted that the Taiwanese government covers 50% of land costs and 45% of construction and facility costs for semiconductor fabrication facilities; and that South Korean subsidies cut the cost of owning a semiconductor manufacturing facility by 25-30%. A bill to support semiconductor manufacturing to the tune of $52bn is currently going through Congress. Japan is dangling financial incentives to entice TSMC, a Taiwanese company, to set up a facility. EU members are similarly eyeing a partnership with Intel.
It remains to be seen how far such spending might spread. The European Commission has funnelled €6bn ($7bn) to a pan-European research and innovation project to support the battery supply chain since December 2019, but it faces sharp budget constraints. Japan has allocated up to ¥457bn ($4.2bn) in grants for companies to diversify supply chains, with little enough effect to show how expensive incentives can be.
Mr Evenett worries that these behind-the-border measures will further distort trade. Places already comfortable with the idea of localising production may be emboldened. Trudi Hartzenberg of the Trade Law Centre, a South African think-tank, says the pandemic has bolstered the resolve to develop productive capacity in South Africa, which is linked to the government’s push to waive intellectual-property provisions in WTO rules. In April 2020, as part of its resilience drive, India introduced “production-linked incentives”, first for large-scale electronics manufacturing and pharmaceutical ingredients, and from November for ten other industries, including textiles, car parts and solar modules. If qualifying companies increase sales by a certain amount, they receive cash equal to 4-6% of the gain.
If governments successfully foster critical industries, their alliances will go from nice to necessary. For when supply shoots up, prices crash and everyone tries to export the same subsidised products, trade tensions quickly increase. That was the lesson from Mr Armbrust’s complaints about Chinese competitors, and indeed from the fight between America and the EU over aircraft subsidies. And if conflict seems likely over supply-chain reshoring, it is even more inevitable from another source of strain on the trading system: the wish to fight human-rights abuses.■

1541,"FOR MOST people, coming into work is about more than picking up a pay slip. Not everyone aims to change the fate of humankind at the office. But even a sense that one’s employer is making a useful product helps escape the lure of the duvet in the morning. Bosses hype this up. It has become fashionable to claim that the pursuit of purpose in the service of “stakeholders” matters more than pleasing shareholders. The outcome of a takeover battle shows how removed from reality the rhetoric is.
On September 20th Philip Morris International (PMI), a giant cigarette-maker, announced it had convinced over three-quarters of the shareholders in Vectura, a British pharmaceutical business, to back its takeover plan. Thus a maker of inhalers designed to combat respiratory diseases will soon be fully owned by a firm whose products often cause them. Whatever sense of purpose the research scientists toiling at Vectura may have had when it was independent is unlikely to survive intact becoming Marlboro’s sister company.

If stakeholderism had any teeth, this would have been the moment to bare them. Vectura is certainly among those beyond-mere-shareholder companies. It was spun out of academia in 1997. Its annual report talks of building a business that delivers value to stakeholders, among them employees, suppliers and patients. Staying independent was probably a stretch given Vectura’s ho-hum performance in recent years. But the winning bid of £1bn ($1.4bn) valued each share at just 6% more than an offer by Carlyle, a private-equity group without PMI’s health baggage.
Self-interested legal analyses exist on both sides as to whether Vectura’s directors were compelled to recommend the highest cash offer. Justifying its decision, the board spoke of its “fiduciary duties”. It appears to have interpreted these duties as weighing whether 165p a share offered by PMI was indeed a larger figure than the 155p offered by Carlyle (Bartleby has run the numbers and concludes that it was). That did not stop the directors from insisting that “wider stakeholders could benefit” from a deal with PMI.
Where the battle lines were drawn is telling. Anti-tobacco campaigners led the charge against PMI. They did not pretend stakeholders beyond the shareholder register were in a position to block the deal, not even staff (who may receive bountiful bonuses). Instead, their main argument was to point out that a PMI-owned Vectura’s long-term profitability would suffer if its scientists were left unable to participate in industry conferences, or if doctors balked at prescribing medicinal products tarred with big tobacco’s brush. The implication was that stakeholders matter, but only in so far as keeping them happy leads to bigger shareholder profits down the line.
Ultimately, nobody disagreed that the outcome was for owners of the stock to decide. Even that might have derailed the creation of a pharma-tobacco group, given the presence on Vectura’s share register of many fund managers whose bosses trumpet their stakeholderist tendencies. Plenty make money peddling funds that specifically exclude tobacco, and rarely lose an opportunity to paint themselves as visionaries looking beyond just profits. But if a high-minded portfolio manager held out from handing over his Vectura shares to PMI on moral grounds, he has been hiding behind a thick pile of glossy reports about the importance of ethical investing.
Quite often, stakeholder satisfaction will align with shareholder success. A happy workforce, satisfied customers and so on tend to lead to good financial outcomes. In this case, PMI will get from Vectura something that matters more than its target’s (modest) earnings. The purveyor of cigarettes has pushed hard into smoke-free products. This started with vaping, but is now extending to things that have nothing to do with nicotine. Buying Vectura, which will be run independently, is a signal that PMI is serious about that strategy. This seriousness of intent matters more to investors than Vectura’s narrow prospects.
Helping PMI pivot from cigarettes could itself be painted as delivering such large societal benefits so as to offset the likely impact on Vectura’s current stakeholders. Perhaps in future such arguments will feature in takeover battles. That would at least be consistent with the airy pronouncements of how business has moved beyond shareholder value. For now, deciding which bid is better is still a case of comparing two figures and going with the bigger one.

1542,"ONCE THE history of Ethiopia’s latest civil war is written, the battles of June could well be recounted as one of the great rebel victories of recent years. For it will explain how a group of insurgents in the mountains of Ethiopia’s northern region of Tigray routed two of Africa’s largest armies, Ethiopia’s and Eritrea’s, to reclaim Mekelle, their capital.
At sunset on June 28th—seven months to the day after Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, declared victory over the ruling party in Tigray as his troops occupied Mekelle—Tigrayans came onto the streets to celebrate the flight of federal troops. Officials appointed by Abiy’s government to run the region were whisked out of town as if from a crime scene. “There are celebrations in every house in Mekelle,” said Haile Kiros, a teacher in the city, before phone lines were cut.

The recapture of Mekelle marks a turning-point in an atrocity-filled war that Abiy had thought would last just a few weeks. It has not only scuppered Abiy’s attempt to bring Tigray to heel by force of arms, but also threatens to break up the factious ethnic federation that makes up Africa’s second-most populous country.
The fighting in Tigray started in November amid a struggle for power between Abiy and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the region’s ruling party. The TPLF had controlled the central government for almost 30 years until it was ousted by the protests in 2018 that ushered Abiy to power. At first the TPLF seized control of much of the army’s heavy weaponry by attacking federal bases in the region. But the pendulum soon swung in Abiy’s favour. Federal forces, backed by air power and soldiers from neighbouring Eritrea, swiftly captured the big towns and cities.
Yet the fighting degenerated into a grinding guerrilla war as fighters of the self-styled Tigrayan Defence Force (TDF) took to the hills, much as their grandfathers had in a successful insurgency in the 1980s against the Derg—a communist dictatorship—and as their fathers had in a conventional war against Eritrea from 1998 to 2000. Some Tigrayans were provoked into taking up arms by murders and rapes, many committed by Eritrean forces whom UN officials also accuse of attempting to starve Tigray into submission.
Then in mid-June the TDF’s fighters came back down from the hills under the command of Tsadkan Gebretensae, a veteran Ethiopian army chief who had been at the helm during the war with Eritrea, to launch “Operation Alula”, named after a 19th-century general. At first few observers believed the TDF when it claimed to have defeated several Ethiopian and Eritrean divisions and taken thousands of prisoners in a succession of battles on the roads to Mekelle. The Ethiopian government insisted it was in full control of the region and was mopping up sporadic resistance. But the truth was exposed when, as quickly as they had arrived, Ethiopian troops left, pausing only to dismantle telecommunications equipment and raid a UN office.
With Ethiopian and Eritrean troops scrambling towards the exit, the federal government announced a unilateral ceasefire on June 28th, ostensibly on humanitarian grounds. More probably it was an effort to mask the defeat of its forces and allow them time to retreat (just days earlier Ethiopia’s deputy prime minister had told Western ambassadors for the first time that his government wanted a ceasefire and peace talks).
However, the TDF is in no mood to halt its offensive. Its spokesman called the government’s ceasefire a “sick joke” and said that the TDF would continue pursuing “enemy” forces. Some Tigrayan leaders have threatened to fight on northwards, towards Asmara, Eritrea’s capital, and westwards, towards the border with Sudan, intending to expel occupying Amhara militias. As The Economist went to press, the TDF appeared to be in control of most of Tigray, including the towns of Axum, Shire and Adwa.
The priority for all parties ought to be ensuring that aid agencies are able to get access to Tigray, where up to a million people are at risk of starvation because they have been unable to plant crops and because Eritrean and Ethiopian forces have not allowed in sufficient supplies of food (see map). Yet Will Davison of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank based in Brussels, sees signs that officials in Abiy’s government plan to continue to blockade Tigray, allowing in some aid but little else. If so, the TDF may seek to break the blockade by fighting for access to the Sudanese border or trying to topple the government in Eritrea.
Abiy, happily, has much to gain by lifting the blockade and starting talks, beyond ensuring the well-being of Tigrayan civilians. For a start it would help to repair his relationship with Western governments, whose support he needs to rebuild and get Ethiopia’s battered economy back onto its previous path of rapid growth. In addition to the military bill, Abiy claims Ethiopia’s government has spent about $2.3bn on associated costs such as repairing roads and food aid. Because of its concerns about war crimes, America has asked the IMF and World Bank to withhold economic assistance. America has also pressed the United Arab Emirates, which has provided Abiy’s government with financial support (and possibly arms), not to bail it out.
Diplomats are concerned about the risks of the conflict spreading beyond Tigray’s borders. Eritrea’s dictator, Issaias Afwerki, may already be regretting his decision to join the attack on Tigray, largely to settle scores with the TPLF, which had humiliated him in the border war. A second trouncing at its hands is unlikely to strengthen his hold on power.
Foreign officials also worry about a deterioration in relations between Sudan and Ethiopia. Since November the Sudanese army has been skirmishing with Ethiopian forces, Amhara militiamen and at least some Eritrean troops over a disputed area of farmland on the border and over a huge new dam under construction on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia. In a speech on June 30th Abiy suggested his forces had withdrawn from Tigray in part to redirect their attention towards the Sudanese front. “Another force threatens us and we need to prepare for that,” he said.
Still, the deepest concern of Western diplomats and officials from countries in the region is the stability of Ethiopia’s fragile ethnic federation. Although TPLF leaders have yet to call for secession, many young Tigrayans now champion it unambiguously. “The only way is for independence,” says Tekleberhan Weldeselassie, an Ethiopian air-force pilot who fled abroad at the start of the war. “We Tigrayans will never stay together with Ethiopia.” Abiy has the almighty task of convincing them to do just that. ■

1544,"SIR DAVID AMESS was the quintessential local MP. When party whips whispered that he might become a minister if he voted the right way, he laughed. When his invitation to the Leigh Duck Race, where the local scout group ceremonially released hundreds of rubber ducks, went missing, his staff turned his office upside down. His relentless campaign to have Southend-on-Sea, the town in his constituency, recognised as a city is the stuff of parliamentary legend.
It was while attending a constituency surgery, where MPs meet locals to hear their problems, that he was stabbed to death on October 15th, in an apparent Islamist terrorist attack. The murder was the latest in a grim series. Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, was killed on her way to a surgery by a far-right extremist in 2016. Stephen Timms, MP for East Ham, was stabbed at one in 2010. Nigel Jones, MP for Cheltenham, was attacked at one in 2000. His assistant, Andrew Pennington, died protecting him.
Speeches in the House of Commons attract more attention, but all MPs have a second job akin to that of a social worker: supporting asylum claims, dealing with benefit enquiries, looking into anti-social behaviour and so on. When the system works, the latter informs the former. Appalled by the death of an elderly constituent who died in a cold house, Sir David introduced legislation to tackle fuel poverty. Campaigns he ran to ban the cruel tethering of animals and to raise awareness of endometriosis also sprung from local concerns.
The constituency surgery is at the heart of this job. It is up to MPs to decide how to arrange them: some insist that people book in advance; others, like Sir David, prefer to be more relaxed, allowing anyone to drop by. Yet this sort of openness is becoming difficult to maintain. The majority of MPs report facing “aggressive or intrusive” behaviour as part of their job. After Ms Cox’s murder, parliamentarians were advised by police to screen appointments more carefully and to avoid meeting constituents on their own. Spending on security, such as CCTV and alarm buttons, has risen.
Priti Patel, the home secretary, has now asked police to review MPs’ security arrangements, to see whether more can be done to protect them. The National Police Chiefs Council will contact every MP to discuss security precautions. Many are resistant to anything that would put distance between them and their constituents. Jess Phillips, a Labour MP, said she would disregard measures that did: “You can’t put me behind a screen when I’m walking my kids to a café. I’m not the pope.”
But the direction of travel is clear. Tobias Ellwood, a Tory MP, has urged fellow parliamentarians to put face-to-face meetings on hold; Diane Abbott, a Labour one, has said she would prefer a screen. Necessary or not, it is a trend Sir David would have lamented. “We are advised to never see people alone, we must be extra careful when opening post and we must ensure our offices are properly safe and secure,” he wrote in a guide to life as a politician published last year. “In short, these increasing attacks have rather spoilt the great British tradition of people openly meeting their elected politicians.” After his murder in a Methodist church, meeting his constituents and hearing their problems, that tradition is under even greater threat.",2
1545,"THE STRICT Islamism of the Taliban may be back in Afghanistan, but peaceful Islamists in the Arab world have struggled of late. Ennahda, which styles itself “Muslim democratic”, had been the biggest party in Tunisia’s parliament—until President Kais Saied suspended the assembly in July. Just over a month later, in Morocco, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), another moderate Islamist outfit that led the ruling coalition, suffered a crushing defeat at the polls, losing 90% of the seats it had held.
A decade ago Islamist parties were on the rise in the Arab world. Often seen as more virtuous than their rivals and adept at providing services, the parties were well placed to take advantage of the democratic revolutions that swept across the region in 2011. In Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood won the country’s first free and fair elections. Ennahda became a force after Tunisia adopted democracy. And the PJD was Morocco’s largest party for ten years.

“Look back to the Arab spring, these parties swept to power promising to bring hope and change,” says Hamza Meddeb of the Carnegie Middle East Centre, a think-tank. “They haven’t delivered that.” Egyptians quickly soured on Muhammad Morsi, the Brotherly president who declared himself immune from judicial oversight and rushed through a flawed constitution. He was pushed out by the army in 2013, amid enormous protests against his rule.
Ennahda and the PJD may have learned from the Brotherhood not to overreach. For example, when large protests pushed Tunisian democracy to the brink in 2013, Ennahda compromised over a new constitution and relinquished power. But its willingness to work with opponents and its concessions led some Tunisians to accuse it of opportunism. “I think there was a failure to explain why that was necessary,” says Ahmed Gaaloul, a party leader.
Even if it wasn’t fully to blame, Ennahda became associated with a decade of economic hardship, endemic corruption and poor governance. “By compromising with economic elites and accepting the status quo, they failed economically,” says Mr Meddeb, referring to Ennahda and the PJD. “By compromising with other parties and on policy, they failed ideologically.”
Like Ennahda, the PJD tried to shed its Islamist image. Nevertheless, it struggled to get its way. It was unable to stop laws authorising the therapeutic use of cannabis, pushing the French language in education (at the expense of Arabic) and reforming the voting system. Last year the PJD prime minister, Saad Eddine El Othmani (pictured), vowed never to deal with Israel. Weeks later Morocco normalised relations with the Jewish state. Critics called the party spineless, weak and incompetent.
Defenders of the PJD say it ran up against Morocco’s most powerful institution, the monarchy. Though King Muhammad VI gave more power to parliament after the Arab spring, most big decisions remained his to make. He directs economic and foreign policy. The agreement with Israel was hashed out by the royal court. Media in thrall to the king give him credit for successes, such as the rollout of covid-19 vaccine, and blame failures on the government. The PJD also accuses rival parties of buying votes.
The party is not alone in feeling that the system is rigged against it. In Egypt the Brotherhood faced opposition from the police and civil servants, who refused to do their jobs, and judges, who dissolved parliament. The intelligence services, aided by foreign governments, worked to bring the group down. Ennahda had a freer go of it, but it eventually butted heads with Mr Saied. His power grab, though clearly undemocratic, has been enormously popular.
The risk is that Islamists in the Arab world learn a dangerous lesson. Why take part in political systems that aren’t free or fair? Why put faith in parties that get nothing done? Better to follow the example of the Taliban, which took up arms and defeated a superpower. Mr Gaaloul, though, is sanguine. He thinks Tunisian activists and civil-society groups will safeguard democracy. “If they show they are really able to make a difference, you’ll no longer even have a need for Islamism,” he says. “You’ll just have a democracy run by Muslims.” ■",2
1546,"The European Union unveiled ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) and to reach net zero by 2050. The plan sets out a range of policies to help meet the targets, but the main thrust is an expansion of the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme, in which companies pay to pollute. It would also introduce a Carbon Border-Adjustment Mechanism, in effect a tariff on goods from outside the EU that are not green-friendly. The announcement came days before China was expected to announce an emissions-trading scheme that will create the world’s largest carbon market.

China’s economy expanded by 1.3% in the second quarter, compared with the previous three months, helped by growth in manufacturing, retail sales and investment. China’s exports, meanwhile, rose by 32% in June (in dollar terms) over June 2020. Although the rebound in trade reflects an easy comparison with the depths of the pandemic, it is much stronger than analysts had forecast.
America’s annual rate of  inflation hit 5.4% in June, another 13-year high. Consumer prices have been driven up by higher energy costs, including for petrol, and also by demand for used cars. Prices for second-hand vehicles have accelerated as the production of new cars stalls amid a global shortage of chips.
The Bank of England scrapped the restrictions on banks’ dividend payouts and share buybacks that it imposed during the pandemic. The Federal Reserve has already removed similar curbs on most banks in America; the European Central Bank is expected to follow suit.
Meanwhile, the ECB gave the go-ahead for a pilot project for a digital version of the euro as an alternative to crypto currencies, such as bitcoin. In London police seized £180m-worth ($249m) of cryptocurrency linked to money-laundering and other nefarious activities. It was one of the biggest such seizures globally and came a few weeks after the city’s police confiscated £114m in cryptocurrency from other illicit gains.
The European Commission said it had put plans for a digital tax on hold. America has been lobbying hard for the proposal to be scrapped. Janet Yellen, America’s treasury secretary, suggested this week that the G20 agreement on a global minimum corporate tax of 15% depended on getting rid of “discriminatory” levies on digital companies.
America’s biggest banks reported earnings for the second quarter. Revenues dropped at Bank of America and Citigroup year on year; income from loans was down at both. Revenue also fell at JPMorgan Chase, but net profit doubled, to $11.9bn, as it released money set aside for loan losses that didn’t materialise. At Goldman Sachs revenue from asset management compensated for a drop in income from trading, by comparison with its gains from the market turmoil of a year ago.

The United Nations reported that efforts to end world hunger and malnutrition by 2030 were dealt a serious blow by covid-19. The prevalence of food insecurity has been rising slowly in recent years, but in 2020 an additional 320m people did not have regular access to food, as many as the increases for the previous five years combined. Last year also saw the biggest rise in undernourishment (food intake that is below the minimum needed) in two decades. The economic turmoil in 2020 that caused sharp rises in food prices has left 2.4bn people without adequate food.

1548,"THE ASSESSMENT of the science of climate change released by the IPCC in August looked at various future-emission scenarios. In every one the best estimate for the difference in temperature between the mid-19th and the mid-21st centuries was above 1.5°C. Only two scenarios, both with close to net-zero emissions by mid-century and net-negative ones thereafter, had best estimates lower than 2°C for the final two decades of the century.
What the report did not say was how the world would pay for the net-negative decades needed to provide a climate both stable and within the Paris temperature limits. In a net-zero economy, it is possible to imagine “polluter-pays” schemes under which emitters pay for the negative emissions that cancel out their activity. They might conceivably evolve from emission-trading schemes like the EU’s. But once you need to remove more CO2 than is being put in an insufficient number of polluters makes things trickier.

Some companies, including Microsoft and Ikea, plan to go net-negative at their own expense. Microsoft aims to remove from the atmosphere an amount of carbon equivalent to all the emissions it has been responsible for over its corporate life. But it is hardly likely that all big emitters will volunteer to behave so admirably.
An imaginative group of academics writing in the journal Nature recently described a polluter-pays scheme which might force companies to become at least somewhat carbon-negative. Well before net zero is reached, emissions would start to attract a “carbon-removal obligation” requiring later removal. To incentivise companies to act promptly, the obligations would grow over time: leave a tonne up in the air long enough and you would have to pull two tonnes out. It is an ingenious idea. But it would do nothing to remove emissions made before the scheme began.
It is hard to imagine negative emissions on a scale large enough to make up for overshooting the carbon budget being paid for by anyone except governments. Any agreement on how that should be done would surely reflect some version of “common but differentiated responsibilities”: countries disproportionately responsible for using up the carbon budget in the first place would be asked to take on most of the burden of dealing with the overshoot.In a world where rich countries had already invested heavily in helping poorer ones reduce emissions, that added expense might be borne willingly. But it is also possible that it would not.
What is more, in a world where some, presumably richer, countries have enough negative-emissions capability to get to net zero and beyond, other countries—either poorer or just more bloody-minded—might abandon further emissions reduction, gambling that the countries with negative-emissions capability would rather increase their use of that capability than see the CO2 level continue to rise.
They might win that gamble; they might not. It is all too easy to imagine a world where most people in poor countries continue to think that climate change is not their fault and someone else should sort it out, while people in richer countries don’t want to shoulder the full burden of doing so. A stand-off develops in which the overshoot is never sucked down and temperatures eventually stabilise at a level considerably higher than 2°C over pre-industrial levels—if they stabilise at all.
The alternative to this game of chicken would be to meet the Paris temperature limits through other means. Solar geoengineering is an approach to the climate that concentrates not on making it easier for the Earth to cool itself, as removing carbon dioxide does, but stopping it from warming so much in the first place. The way of doing this which has been studied in most detail, albeit almost entirely in models, is to create a thin layer of reflective particles in the stratosphere that reflects sunlight back into space before it warms the surface. Studies suggest that, for good or ill, such a scheme could be implemented by a relatively small fleet of purpose-built aircraft.
These ideas have, for understandable reasons, long been marginalised in policy circles. They reek of hubris and the potential for unintended consequences. And if, by providing another way of limiting temperature rises, they reduce the perceived urgency of curbing emissions, they might weaken or even stall the commitment to emissions reduction.
That would be disastrous. Though it has the opposite effect on temperature, the cooling offered by solar geoengineering is not, in physical terms, an exact counter of the warming created by greenhouse gases. One difference is seen in the world’s hydrological cycle; solar geoengineering tends to suppress precipitation. The more the world came to rely on it, the more this and other mismatches would become harmful. This, alongside the fact that it does nothing about ocean acidification, is a strong part of the reason why researchers looking seriously at solar geoengineering never advocate using it instead of mitigation. Those not turned off by it completely see it as a possible complement to mitigation, not as an alternative.
In this it is very like negative emissions—one reason they are sometimes called “carbon geoengineering”. The way a solar-geoengineering capability might reduce the incentive to continue with emissions reduction is similar to the way existing negative-emissions capacity might work. And in both cases that reduced ambition might well come about even if the proposed geoengineering did not.
A crucial difference between the two, though, is the cost of instigating them. It seems likely that putting a veil into the atmosphere would be comparatively cheap (in the tens of billions of dollars a year, perhaps even less), though the externalities not included in the cost might be high. Another difference is that negative emissions would affect the climate in more or less the same way whoever undertook them; the world’s carbon-dioxide level is what it is. Different sorts of solar geoengineering, though, would have distinctly different regional effects.
Design for living
If the world as a whole were able to design a solar-geoengineering scheme, studies suggest it could come up with one that provided climate benefits to almost everyone and serious problems to almost nobody. A plausible way to use such an optimal scheme might be to offset the temperature rise caused by overshooting the carbon budget. That would provide a sort of breathing space to allow the excess CO2 to be drawn down more slowly and cheaply than would be necessary if its warming effects were actually being felt. A comparatively gentle acceleration of chemical weathering, rather than a huge investment in DAC or other schemes, might prove sufficient. As those measures slowly wore the overshoot down the solar geoengineering could be reduced. When the CO2 level was low enough it would be phased out completely, leaving behind a stable climate.
But the world as a whole might not get to choose the wisest path. A small group of countries, or even a single large one, could undertake a solar-geoengineering scheme unilaterally. Such a club would be likely to optimise its own interests rather than those of the world. It might, for example, choose to cool some places to a degree that, because of geoengineering’s effects on the water cycle, risked desiccating others. That might lead to resentment, rancour or reprisals.
Nor would any given set of solar geoengineers be sure to get things their own way. The late Marty Weitzman, a pioneering economist of climate change, pointed out that though emission reductions (and by implication negative emissions), because of their cost, have a free-rider problem, solar geoengineering, because it looks cheap, has a “free-driver” problem. Where free-rider problems lead to underprovision (countries are unwilling to commit to cutting emissions when others do not, as 26 years of COPs has made clear) free-driver problems may lead to overprovision. Solar geoengineering looks cheap enough that countries wanting more of it can provide it unilaterally, whatever others think.
This implies that, other things being equal, the level of solar geoengineering would be a trade-off between the amount that the most enthusiastic countries wanted and the amount that the least enthusiastic would endure before taking decisive action, quite possibly through force of arms. Another game of chicken.
The difficulties involved in negative emissions and solar geoengineering are very different, and the second looks much more unfamiliar and threatening than the first. But in both cases the problem is fundamentally similar—and closely related to the contradiction between global temperature goals and national emissions-reduction commitments at the heart of the Paris agreement. The world has needs which can be agreed on; but the decisions necessary to meet those needs are made by countries which differ in their interests, their capabilities and the amount of persuasion they can exert or resist. The responsibilities may be common; the differentiation is endless.
Glasgow will show the degree to which national governments are able to deliver progress in terms of the increased ambition of their NDCs, the realisation of long-promised transfers of money from north to south, and workable rules for the parts of the Paris agreement which remain sketchy. The progress is unlikely to be spectacular, reinforcing the point that managing global issues like the climate purely through national lenses is impractical. But coming up with an alternative in which individual countries will allow the interests of others to be placed above their own is implausible. And if the world is to stabilise the climate at an acceptable level, something will have to give.
The climate crisis was brought about as part of the creation of a new world economy. Coming through it successfully may well require a new world politics. Failing to do so will be calamitous in terms of politics and economics alike.■

1549,"Crime and victim campaigners have savaged the Met Police's new 44-question handcuff policy, calling it 'embarrassing' and treating trained police officers like children'.
The Centre for Crime Prevention said crooks would not give PCc the luxury of the time to mull over the near-50 considerations in the guidance.
And it suggested the document would raise yet more of its own questions - but this time about the leadership of under-fire Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick. 
David Spencer, research director at the centre, told MailOnline: 'Plenty of people are of the view that police priorities tend to be the wellbeing of criminals rather than the law abiding public and this will go some way to reinforce that perception.
'It is also quite simply treating trained police officers like children and is hugely patronising to the vast majority of police officers who are arresting potentially dangerous suspects every single day.
'Most arrests will not give police the luxury of considering 44 questions before apprehending a suspect. They are working on instinct and applying their training and this is where such questions should be, and are, drummed into them.
'It is difficult to imagine how Cressida Dick’s time as Commissioner could get much more embarrassing for the Met, but this policy is certainly doing its best. 
'There are already serious question marks about whether Cressida Dick is the right person to be leading the Met and proclamations like this are only going to undermine her authority still further.' 
The policy on handcuffing tells officers to ask themselves 44 questions before arresting a suspect and details the procedure in a child-style ABC guide. 
Its mammoth decision process is laid out in full in the new 25-page document published by Scotland Yard.
It puts into official policy nearly 50 questions officers should consider when they are using the police-issue restraints.
The questions include, 'What could go wrong (and what could go well)?', 'What is happening?', and, 'What do I not know?'.
Other advice to mull over also includes, 'Do I need to take action immediately?' and 'What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?' 
Most are from the College of Policing's National Decision Model but are now enshrined in the official equipment policy. 
It is not clear what the Met's previous policy on the police restraint tactic had been.
But the new rules have been drawn up after complaints from the black community they had been disproportionately targeted in stop and search.  
1. Is what I am considering consistent with the Code of Ethics?
2. What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?
3. What does the police service expect of me in this situation?
4. Is this action or decision likely to reflect positively on my professionalism and policing generally?
5. Could I explain my action or decision in public?
6. What is happening?
7. What do I know so far?
8. What do I not know?
9. What further information (or intelligence) do I want/need at this moment?
10. Do I need to take action immediately?
11. Do I need to seek more information?
12. What could go wrong (and what could go well)?
13. What is causing the situation?
14. How probable is the risk of harm?
15. How serious would it be?
16. Is that level of risk acceptable?
17. Is this a situation for the police alone to deal with?
18. Am I the appropriate person to deal with this?
19. What am I trying to achieve?
20. Will my action resolve the situation?
21. What police powers might be required?
22. Is there any national guidance covering this type of situation?
23. Do any local organisational policies or guidelines apply?
24. What legislation might apply?
25. Is there any research evidence?
26. If decision makers have to account for their decisions, will they be able to say they were proportionate, legitimate, necessary and ethical?
27. Reasonable in the circumstances facing them at the time? 
28. Does anyone else need to know what you have decided?
29. What happened as a result of your decision?
30. Was it what you wanted or expected to happen? 
31. How were the principles and standards of professional behaviour demonstrated during the situation?
32. What information or intelligence was available?
33. What factors (potential benefits and harms) were assessed?
34. What threat and risk assessment methods were used (if any)?
35. Was a working strategy developed and was it appropriate?
36. Were there any powers, policies and legislation that should have been considered? 
37. If policy was not followed, was this reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances?
38. How were feasible options identified and assessed?
39. Were decisions proportionate, legitimate, necessary and ethical?
40. Were decisions reasonable in the circumstances facing the decision maker?
41. Were decisions communicated effectively?
42. Were decisions and the rationale for them recorded as appropriate?
43. Were decisions monitored and reassessed where necessary?
44. What lessons can be learnt from the outcomes and how the decisions were made? 
Also featured is an alphabet-themed guide to handcuffing that warns to, 'Always ask the suspect if the cuffs are too tight'.
It includes the advice to 'always double-lock the handcuffs'. 
The Met publicised the new policy yesterday morning, which came after a review by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist. 
Industry insiders and former police officers have slammed the alphabet-style guide, with former Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley warning it was indicative of the 'weakness of senior police leadership'.
He told GB News: 'Frankly, it's an example of the ineptitude, the pusillanimous, the weakness of decision-making that we now see with senior police leadership.
'Police officers, when they decide to use force or apply handcuffs, need to run through in their mind a lot of different things which comes down to: ""Is this the right thing to be doing, and can I defend my options?""
 'What we've now see happen is something that's going to affect three groups of people. 
'First, it is going to put off the cops using force or arresting people. There's nothing more difficult than trying to get some officers to deal with confrontation.
'It's very easy to back down. The hard thing is to motivate a police officer to be nosy. 
'The second thing is, the public are going to think: ""What on earth is going on here?""
'The third point really is that those who are ""baddies"", it's going to give them an opportunity for an outer.'  
Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said of the force's new policy: 'My number one priority remains tackling violent crime and keeping people safe from street crime – which is blighting the lives of too many young people.
'Alongside that, I have set out to increase the trust and confidence of communities in their police service.
'We know that not all communities have the same level of trust in us – I am determined to change that.
'The handcuffing review could not have taken place effectively without the input and contribution of many front line police officers and members of the public. I thank them all for their time, effort and valuable honesty.' 
The policy follows a review commissioned by the Met Commissioner Cressida Dick in 2019 into the use of handcuffs before an arrest has taken place.
It came after complaints from black communities they were being disproportionately targeted.
The Met said the review would make sure the tactic, for which there is a sound legal basis in some circumstances, was justified and recorded on each occasion.
It fed in consultation responses from young black men aged between 16 to 25 years-old.
A Met spokeswoman said: 'The launch of the policy, which covers all aspects of the use of handcuffs, is the final recommendation from the 2020 review to be implemented.
'Officers are already receiving additional legal training, more public and personal safety training, with further emphasis on de-escalation; and more community input to understand the respective experiences of the public and police officers during encounters on the streets of London.' 
Last October a highly criticial review of the Met's use of stop and search powers has revealed officers stopped two black men after they were seen 'fist bumping,'.
The review by the Independent Office for Police Conduct revealed the officers thought the pair had just completed a drug deal, in one of a number of issues raised by the watchdog.
It found handcuffs were used in nearly all instances where other tactics could have de-escalated an encounter, while officers also failed to use bodycam video from the outset of their interaction with some members of the public.
The IOPC said their review 'mirrors concerns,' already raised by communities in the Capital.
Regional director Sal Naseem said: 'We saw a lack of understanding from officers about why their actions were perceived to be discriminatory.'",-2
1550,"“CUBANS HAVE always been resourceful,” says Ana, the owner of a private farm-to-table restaurant near Havana. “But now we need to be magicians and acrobats.” The communist island is facing its worst shortage of food since the 1990s. Finding ingredients was never easy in a place which imports around 70% of its food. Over the past year it has become nearly impossible. When grocery shops are empty, as is so often the case, Ana tries the internet or the black market, only to find that prices are prohibitively high. Farmers no longer want to sell produce to her, she says, as they need to eat it themselves.
The government blames the shortage of food mostly on sanctions imposed by the United States—sanctions which, on June 24th, the UN General Assembly voted to condemn, as it has done nearly every year since 1992. But since 2001 the sanctions have exempted food. Indeed, the United States is the largest exporter of food to Cuba, though last year those imports were at their lowest level since 2002.

Some external factors have affected the food supply. The jump in global food prices, which in the year to May surged by 40%, the largest increase in a decade, has made imports more expensive. But the main problem is the government’s lack of hard currency. Tourism, normally 10% of GDP, has atrophied because of the pandemic: whereas 4.2m people visited in 2019, just over 1m did last year, nearly all in the first three months of the year. Remittances have also suffered. Before covid-19, commercial airlines would operate as many as ten flights a day between Miami and Havana, all packed with cash-toting mulas. But now only a handful of flights go to Havana each week. In addition, this year’s harvest of sugar—one of Cuba’s main exports—was the worst in more than a century, as a result of drought (the dollar shortage also sapped supplies of fertiliser and petrol).
The government is trying desperately to eke out dollars and skimp on imported goods. Cubans can no longer buy greenbacks from state-operated exchanges at the airport. State-owned bakeries are replacing a fifth of the imported wheat flour they use in bread with substitutes made from home-grown corn, pumpkin or yucca, much to the dismay of consumers, who have complained that bread now tastes like soggy corn. The sale of biscuits has been limited in certain cities to cut back even more on imports of flour.
Since February, in a desperate attempt to collect hard currency, the government has required that foreigners pay for their seven-day mandatory stay in a state-owned quarantine hotel in dollars (since June, this has even applied to some Cubans). To earn more from its diaspora, the state also operates e-commerce sites through which Cubans abroad can pay in dollars or euros for food and gifts to be delivered to people on the island.
Indeed many Cubans abroad are trying to help their family members stave off hunger by sending their own care packages. But even these have become harder and more costly to post. Goods from the United States that once took two weeks to deliver can now take up to four months to arrive, as shortages of fuel and trucks in Cuba make the final leg of the delivery trickier.
Bungled policy responses have made things worse. On June 10th the Cuban central bank announced that, from June 21st, Cubans would not be able to deposit dollars into their bank accounts for an undisclosed amount of time. This is despite the fact that, in order to buy goods in state-owned shops, Cubans need to have a prepaid card loaded with dollars. They will now have to exchange their dollars for euros or other currencies, which involves a fee. Emilio Morales, the head of the Havana Consulting Group in Miami, thinks this was a way to scare people into depositing more before the deadline.
Rather than stabilise the economy, the policy is likely to do the reverse. Some exchange houses in Miami soon ran out of euros. Cuban banks were overwhelmed by queues of panicking people trying to deposit the dollars they needed to buy groceries. “Cuba has 11m hostages and is expecting Cuban exiles to pay their ransom,” says Mr Morales. Ricardo Cabrisas, the deputy prime minister, was recently in Paris negotiating another extension on the roughly $3.5bn of loans owed to foreign governments—the island has been in arrears since 2019. An ultimatum from creditors may help explain the government’s desire to hoover up greenbacks.
Despite making some attempts to liberalise the economy, the government is bafflingly poor at boosting agricultural production or wooing foreign investors. Firms producing food in Cuba earn only pesos, which have little value internationally, but must buy almost all their inputs abroad in a foreign currency. The government requires farmers to sell their harvest to the state at uncompetitive prices and imposes draconian rules on livestock management.
Up until last month it was illegal to slaughter a cow before it had reached an advanced age, as determined by the state. Now farmers may kill them either to sell the meat or to eat it themselves. But before they do so, they must jump through a series of hoops, including certifying that the cow has produced at least 520 litres of milk a year. They are also not allowed to let their herd shrink overall, and so can only slaughter one cow for every three calves they add to it—a tall order in the long run, mathematically. As it is, Cuba is having trouble maintaining its existing cattle herd: last year, in the province of Las Tunas alone, more than 7,000 cows died from dehydration. Farmers have to complete paperwork and wait a week for approval, too. “The process of applying to eat a cow is enough to make you lose your appetite,” says a farmer in Bahía Honda.
Cubans are no strangers to difficult times. Eliecer Jiménez Almeida, a Cuban filmmaker in Miami, was a child during the “special period” of hardship after the fall of the Soviet Union, and remembers how his grandmother sold her gold teeth in exchange for soap, just so that he and his siblings could take a bath. For him and for many Cubans, the question is not how many more of the same indignities their people can endure, but how much longer.
Discontent was slightly less likely when Fidel Castro was in power. He had charisma and mystique that neither his brother and successor, Raúl, nor Cuba’s current president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, can replicate. What is more, the Cuban diaspora is larger and wealthier and the internet has shown Cubans that many of their economic difficulties are created by their leaders, not the United States. The best way to stave off popular discontent would be to implement more and bigger economic reforms, at a faster pace, starting with farms and small businesses. It is a measure of Cubans’ disillusionment that the old revolutionary cry of “Hasta la victoria siempre” (On to victory, always) has largely been supplanted by the longsuffering “¿Hasta cuándo?” (How much longer?) ■",2
1551,"A PERK OF being locked up by a fascist dictator is that it leaves you with a lot of time on your hands. Altiero Spinelli, an Italian communist, spent the bulk of his youth imprisoned by Benito Mussolini. During one stint of internment in 1941, Spinelli used his spare time to come up with the Ventotene Manifesto, named after the island off Naples to which he was banished. Pieced together on cigarette papers, it provided a socialist blueprint for a federal Europe, earning the communist thinker a legacy as one of the more obscure founding fathers of the EU.
Aside from the European Parliament building in Brussels, which bears Spinelli’s name, communists left little mark on the club. Across western Europe, moderate Christian and Social Democrats ran the show. The Eurocommunists, who looked to Brussels rather than Moscow, were briefly in vogue in the 1970s and 1980s. Wily socialists, such as François Mitterrand, soon put them out of business. In Italy, where communists once won 34% of the vote, the party fell apart after communism collapsed in eastern Europe. And countries that had lived under communism were desperate to join the EU, in part so the ideology could not return.

The spectre of communism no longer haunts Europe. But it does occasionally jump from behind the curtain and shout “boo”. Sometimes the surprise comes from the least likely spots. Austria is probably the most bourgeois country in Europe: rich, cosy and more than a little smug about it. Yet its second city, Graz, is now run by the Austrian Communist Party, which came first in local elections with 29% of the vote. Wags soon renamed it Leningraz.
It was a revolution decades in the making. A low threshold for winning seats on the city’s council meant that communists could scrape a few even in dry years, and busy themselves with running the city’s housing policy. Popular measures helped, such as communist councillors donating two-thirds of their salaries to the needy. “What we are doing now would have been ordinary social democrat policy in the 1970s,” says Max Zirngast, a councillor who spent three months in a Turkish jail for criticising Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s autocratic regime before entering the world of Austrian municipal politics. A world without capitalism is still the aim. But a city with more social housing will do for now.
Tradition rather than grassroots fervour keeps the red flag flying in Cyprus. The island’s communist party, AKEL, is one of the country’s two main parties. It prospers thanks to an almost Anglican attitude to communism: just as one does not have to believe in God to go to church every Sunday, so Cypriots can vote for communists without wishing to seize the means of production. Card-carrying communists in shiny Mercedeses are a common sight. Force of habit rather than belief explains the party’s persistence, argues James Ker-Lindsay of the London School of Economics. As one of the biggest parties, AKEL is helped by being able to dish out the patronage that still dominates Cypriot politics.
In Europe, parties can be tiny but still influential. Christian Democrats found themselves supporting decidedly unChristian ideals due to panic about those to their right. Crackdowns on asylum-seekers and cuts to welfare budgets were triggered by parties that mustered barely a tenth of the vote. The same logic works for the far left. In an age of fragmentation, any party that can win even 5% of the vote becomes relevant. Take Portugal. Antonio Costa, the Socialist but still centre-left prime minister, relied on both the Portuguese Communist Party and the Left Bloc to remain in office.
Parties do not always use this power well. The communists voted against Mr Costa’s budget, leaving elections likely early next year. It was an odd decision. The budget was stuffed with lefty spending pledges, such as increased pensions and free child care. Now the leftist parties face losses in an election, the polls suggest. Such cock-ups are common. In the Czech Republic, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia opted to support Andrej Babis, a billionaire, as prime minister. Three years later, the party was kicked out of parliament for the first time since 1948.
It is little surprise that the most successful far-left parties of recent years have eschewed outright communism. Some of Syriza’s leaders spent time in the Greek communist youth movement, but the party which ran Greece from 2015-19 bristled at mention of the c-word. (Hardcore lefties repay the favour by seeing Syriza and its eventual compromise with the EU as an example of what not to do in power.) Podemos, a far-left Spanish party, is part of the governing coalition, but its brand of anti-austerity populism comes from a different tradition to Europe’s remaining reds.
That country of single blessedness
Yet some traditional Marxist parties are savvy. The Workers’ Party of Belgium (PTB), which began life as a home for Marxists who found Belgium’s Communist Party a bit soft, is now a mainstream party. Pressure from the PTB led to Belgium gumming up a free-trade deal between the EU and Canada, which sent diplomats on a crash course on the rules of Belgian federalism. Popular campaigns to slash taxes on energy put left-wing rivals in government in an awkward spot. In the Flemish parliament, it mischievously complained that a pay cut for MPs had not actually gone through, two years after its approval. If polls are borne out, the far-left party is set to become the third-largest in the national parliament.
Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, provides the base of the PTB’s support. The region was the centre of continental Europe’s Industrial Revolution; now it is the apogee of deindustrialisation. Disaffected voters in depressed regions have been fodder for the radical right across Europe. Canny politics from the far left in Belgium has flipped that trend, dragging voters to the other side. In 1869 Karl Marx called Belgium the “the snug, well-hedged, little paradise of the landlord, the capitalist, and the priest”. In 2021 Belgium offers the EU’s best hope for the ideology that bears his name.■",2
1552,"WHEN LAWMAKERS from South Korea’s ruling Minjoo party discuss their plan to impose tougher penalties on the media for reporting “fake news”, they stress that they merely want to safeguard vulnerable citizens. “It’s the least we can do to protect the people from fake news,” one legislator told reporters earlier this month. “We have to remember that our people’s basic rights and freedoms are more important than the freedom of the press,” said another. The proposed changes to the Press Arbitration Act of 2011, the party argues, would improve the quality of reporting and increase the public’s trust in it.
Hogwash, says the conservative opposition, which quashed a first attempt to pass the bill last month by threatening a filibuster. The proposal, it argues, is an attempt by the government to shield itself from criticism. Other observers appear to agree. Last week, a coalition of activist groups including Human Rights Watch called on legislators from all parties to reject the bill when it is put to another vote in the National Assembly on September 27th.

The bill introduces new provisions allowing individuals and small businesses to go after reporters and media organisations for, among other things, causing “emotional distress” by spreading false information either intentionally or as a result of “gross negligence”, for instance without fact-checking. Critics worry the vague wording of some of the clauses would give the authorities too much discretion to decide which reports qualify for corrections or damages. A letter from the UN’s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, sent to the government in August, warned that the law could be used to limit ordinary news reporting and criticism of the government, and could see writers held liable for parody and satire or simply for expressing unpopular opinions.
The ruling party’s concerns are not entirely unfounded. Like people everywhere, South Koreans are exposed to mountains of humbug. A noisy minority of mostly elderly right-wingers watch YouTube channels that spread misinformation about vaccines, American politics and President Moon Jae-in’s supposed chumminess with North Korea, the Chinese Communist Party, the devil, or all three. Even beyond the radical fringe, most people get their news from online aggregators whose algorithms reward sensationalist clickbait and which take little responsibility for sourcing. The biggest newspapers have long-standing links to big conglomerates; the heads of public broadcasters change with the government. Unsurprisingly, less than a third of South Koreans say they trust the news.
But if legislators are indeed trying to solve these problems and bolster their democracy, they are going about it in a curious way, says Park Kyung-sin, a law professor and free-speech activist at Korea University in Seoul. Most fake news and conspiracy-mongering originates on social media, he notes. But the law only applies to newspapers and broadcasters, leaving the main source of falsehoods untouched. Mr Park suspects the party’s real motive is a feeling of being under siege by the press: they find it hard to accept that, in government, “they’re being criticised by all journalists, not just the right-wing media”.
It is all the more surprising given that press freedom in South Korea has improved significantly since Mr Moon took power in 2017. South Korea climbed 30 places in a global press freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, a watchdog, after his election. And it is an unusual bill for a liberal democracy to propose, carrying as it does elements of similar laws passed in recent years by bossier places such as Singapore.
The many complaints have not fallen on deaf ears. Minjoo legislators have responded by drafting a revised version of the bill. But it still fails to resolve the main worry, that the law would unduly restrict speech. Given the party’s absolute majority, it is likely to pass, unless legislators decide to withdraw it. If it does, South Korea will surely drop a few places in next year’s press-freedom ranking. ■",2
1553,"IN MARCH, President Joe Biden asked his spooks how the covid-19 pandemic had started. Contradicting claims made last year by Donald Trump, who said the intelligence services had shown him very strong evidence on the matter, they told him that they did not know. So on May 26th he asked them again, publicly this time, admonishing them to try harder and to report back in 90 days.
This is a direct rebuke to China’s secretive government. When experts convened by the World Health Organisation (WHO) travelled to Wuhan, the city where covid-19 was first identified, in January and February this year their hosts refused to share crucial data. A senior Biden administration official said recently that he found those efforts to “undermine serious investigations” into the pandemic’s beginnings particularly troubling, and that they left “many more questions than answers”.

At the crux of this distrust is the possibility that SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes covid-19, may have emerged accidentally from research on animal coronaviruses conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or another nearby lab. In early 2020 this idea, sometimes conflated with the idea that the virus had been developed as a biological weapon, was publicly dismissed by eminent scientists. In February 2020 a number of them used the pages of the Lancet, a medical journal, “to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that covid-19 does not have a natural origin”. Most in the media followed their line. By far the most plausible account of covid-19’s origins, they reported, was “zoonotic spillover”—that is, a virus jumping unaided from animals to humans, as is taken to have been the case for SARS, a disease caused by a different coronavirus, in 2002. Lab-leak theories were widely dismissed as conspiracy-mongering.

In the past few months, though, discussion of lab-leakery has gained currency among politicians and policy elites and in the mainstream media, as well as in influential blog posts by science reporters. This is in part because of the departures of Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state, who promoted the theory with gusto. To be able to consider the possibility without giving them succour will have made it easier for some.
But the resurgence is not a purely political phenomenon. On May 13th Science, a journal, published a letter from a group of senior scientists who had not previously weighed in on the matter arguing that “theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable”. In this they were taking the same position as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s boss, who refused to rule out the possibility of a laboratory origin after the WHO mission in January and February was stonewalled, and has since called for further inquiry.
This is not going down well in China. On May 21st, at a Global Health Summit convened by the EU and G20, Xi Jinping, China’s president, urged world leaders to “firmly reject any attempt to politicise” the covid-19 pandemic. On May 25th China’s representative at the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, said the country considered the inquiry into the origins complete and that the focus should shift to other countries, strongly suggesting that it would not accommodate further investigation.
High on the assembly’s agenda were responses to the current pandemic and the prevention of future ones. Felicity Harvey, chair of an oversight committee for the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said that new virus threats must in future be handled with more transparency, better data-sharing and an ability to give informal early warnings to the world. Earlier in May a WHO panel of experts recommended that countries be placed under a greater obligation to report new outbreaks and that the WHO’s authority to seek out and share relevant information with the world be strengthened.
It would be surprising if China (and, indeed, some other countries) were to accept all these ideas. Its leadership has consistently fought to deny international bodies the right to stick their noses into the affairs of sovereign countries, and it does not always welcome the WHO’s attentions. In 2018 it declined requests from American officials, made under WHO guidelines, for lab samples of the H7N9 strain of avian flu.

China has instead recently indicated it will reform its own public-health system. On May 13th the authorities announced a reorganisation of the national public-health bureaucracy under a new entity, the National Administration of Disease Prevention and Control. A priority in the shake-up is to improve top-down control, so that lower-level officials have more incentive to report new public-health threats up the chain of command.
Chinese authorities tried to deal with a similar issue after the SARS outbreak of the 2000s, in part to tackle the problem that national health officials were outranked by provincial authorities who had covered up the early spread of that coronavirus in southern China. They made the monitoring of new threats more systematic, raised their game with the WHO and even co-operated with America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the model for China’s own CDC—the Wuhan office of which is now being mentioned in the context of a possible laboratory origin.

There is as yet no evidence in the public domain that a laboratory leak actually took place; just evidence that the possibility is real. Mr Biden’s request suggests anything the secret world can currently add to that is pretty weak stuff. His statement says that, at present, two “elements” within the intelligence community lean towards the zoonotic explanation, one prefers the laboratory origin, and no one has high confidence in any of these assessments. Without help from China, a harder look will not necessarily change this. But it is still worth taking, even given the risk of a confrontational response which will make the enhanced transparency and co-operation talked about at the World Health Assembly unlikely to blossom any time soon. ■

1554,"WHEN TALKING about Apple, it is hard to avoid superlatives. It is the world’s most valuable firm, with a market value of $2.5trn. Over 80% of that has been amassed during the tenure of Tim Cook. No other chief executive has created more absolute value for shareholders. As he celebrates his tenth anniversary at the helm this week, he can look back with satisfaction. Instead of trying to imitate Apple’s co-founder, he took Steve Jobs’s creation and made it better and bigger. Much of that success has come from maintaining Apple’s record of innovation and its brand. But Mr Cook has also made the most of an era of open, globalised capitalism that is fading away. He plans to stay in charge for five years or more. How he deals with the new environment will form the next epic chapter in Apple’s story.
Even by the standards of other tech giants, Apple is unusual. It is older (established in 1977); it mainly sells hardware; it is controlled by investors not founders; and it is more global, with a higher share of sales outside its home market than Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Alibaba or Tencent. Under Mr Cook’s supervision, it has exploited four trends. One is global supply chains: it has built an immense production network with China at the centre and components coming from around the world. This machine is being cranked up ahead of the launch of the new iPhone 13 next month, with unit sales of some 90m expected. As well as employing Chinese workers, Apple has made a killing from Chinese consumers, the second big trend. Its annual sales from China have roughly quintupled from a decade ago, to $60bn, more than those of any other Western firm.

Apple has also thrived in an era when governments were relaxed about firms with high market shares. While the handset sector used to be brutal (think of the rise and fall of BlackBerry), and is still very competitive for cheaper phones, at the high end Apple is ascendant, with a revenue market share of over 60% in America and a dominant position in operating systems there. Rather than compete with rival tech giants, it has been a beneficiary of a cartellish cosiness, receiving vast payments from Google in return for making it the iPhone’s search engine. The last trend is tax avoidance. Thanks in part to legal structures using tax havens, Apple has made average cash-income tax payments of just 17% of pre-tax profits over the past decade.

However, those four trends are becoming less favourable. Geopolitical tensions threaten global supply chains. President Xi Jinping’s authoritarian policies have dulled the attractions of relying on Chinese consumers for 18% of sales. His new slogan of “common prosperity” may signal a desire to cut corporate profits. Western trustbusters are targeting tech, including those Google payments and Apple’s App Store, which Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite”, accuses of levying excessive fees. And a deal this year brokered by the OECD may gradually force multinationals to pay more tax.
So what, exactly, is Mr Cook’s plan? One of his achievements has been to maintain Apple’s cult of secrecy. Wall Street survives on a diet of generous share buybacks and meagre information about the firm’s strategy. Still, some things are clear.
Apple will find ways to sidestep tax bills, but the rate it pays will probably rise. It will continue to shift towards being a subscriber-based firm with over 1bn users who enjoy an array of services (which already generate 21% of sales). Apple is still about beautiful design and flawless manufacturing, but it also wants to be a trusted intermediary in a toxic and unruly digital sphere, able to charge handsome fees. And it will continue to try to invent a new generation of hardware—iGlasses or iCars, say—that can supplement the iPhone as the gateway to Apple’s world.
Yet on the two thorniest problems Mr Cook has not made up his mind. On supply chains, although Apple has shifted the mix of its own long-term assets to America—the share has risen from 38% in 2012 to 70% now—key suppliers including TSMC, a chip firm, are lukewarm about putting production there. If the Sino-American rift deepens, or Apple’s relations with Beijing sour, Mr Cook will need to pivot away from China, with momentous consequences for its margins and for world trade.
Meanwhile heat from trustbusters and Apple’s shift into services may catalyse competition with other tech firms. Apple has skirmished with Facebook over privacy this year; it could yet push deeper into search, e-commerce or entertainment, breaking apart tech’s cosy club. The rest of Mr Cook’s tenure is unlikely to be as successful as the first decade was, but his decisions will be just as momentous. ■

1555,"Editor’s note: On September 9th, shortly after this article was published, President Joe Biden announced tougher vaccine mandates covering as many as 100m Americans, including federal workers and employees at larger private-sector companies.
A GLANCE AT the chart of global vaccine scepticism shows an alarming trend for Americans: while other rich countries see a steadily downward slope, America is flatlining. The highly contagious Delta variant continues its march across the country, wreaking exceptional havoc on the South, one of the country’s least-vaccinated regions. Six states— Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas—have more than 90% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds occupied. Deaths have risen to levels not seen since March, before the vaccine was widely available: numbers that recall the early months of the pandemic.
Some optimists had hoped that the spread of the Delta variant, though regrettable, might eventually persuade the naysayers to get vaccinated. Local news sites and stations have profiled people who had been sceptical and have now had their jabs. The Douglases in South Central Pennsylvania were vaccine-hesitant until “the Delta variant changed that”. The Columbus Dispatch wrote about a supervisor at a local plant who said: “The Delta variant was what really got me out.” In Oklahoma, Grace Zeiba, an emergency-room nurse, told her local station that because of Delta she decided “it's time to be vaccinated”. But these anecdotes are not representative of the overall picture.

One way of measuring whether people are more likely to get vaccinated when their neighbours are very ill with covid-19, is to compare county-level ICU capacities (which tell you whether a hospital is full of covid-19 patients) with the change in vaccination rates in the ensuing weeks. The Economist did this while controlling for potentially confounding variables, like state-level vaccination rates.
Our calculations show that full hospitals lead to only a slight increase in the number of people getting vaccinated. For every 10% decrease in available ICU beds, there were roughly 14 additional first doses administered per 100,000 people in a county the next week. For a median-sized American county with a population of 26,000, that translates to 3.5 additional first doses, or just half a dose per day.

Counties with ICUs that were 80% full or more saw only an additional 104 first doses administered per 100,000 people the next week, compared with counties where ICUs were 20% full or less. That is consistent with what happened this summer, when areas hit by the Delta variant saw only slight upticks in vaccination rates compared with other counties.
Polls paint the same picture. As many Americans have scrambled for futile cures like ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug, interest in the most effective solution—the vaccine—is stuck. Polling from Morning Consult shows that the share of individuals who say they are unwilling to get the vaccine, or are uncertain if they will, has fallen only slightly—from 31% at the end of May (the month the World Health Organisation declared Delta to be a variant of concern) to 28% on August 30th. By contrast, the average share saying the same across the other 14 countries Morning Consult has surveyed fell from 25% to 14% (see chart).
The remaining Americans who have not had their jabs are not just hesitant but rather hardened—committed to shunning the vaccine despite its availability, safety and efficacy. If the Delta variant, and the wards full of patients suffering from it in local hospitals, cannot change their minds, then it is hard to see what will. ■

1556,"ON THE MACEDONIAN shore of Lake Ohrid in July, a choir was practising Abba’s “Dancing Queen”, forever “looking out for a place to go”. In a hotel next door, the leaders of the six western Balkan countries that want to join the EU were also singing familiar tunes. It has been 18 years since the EU pledged to let them in once they fulfil its criteria. The process is alive, says Edi Rama, Albania’s prime minister, but “moving—not so much”.
Two years ago France and the Netherlands temporarily stalled accession for all of the so-called Western Balkan Six: Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia. Now Bulgaria is blocking talks for North Macedonia and Albania. It demands Macedonian concessions on interpretations of history and language that have nothing to do with the EU‘s requirements. Albania is collateral damage because its negotiations are paired with its neighbour’s.

“We have perfected patience,” says Nikola Dimitrov, deputy prime minister of North Macedonia. For 27 years his country was dogged by a row with Greece, which objected to its former name of Macedonia. Mr Dimitrov helped negotiate a deal to change the name to North Macedonia. Now, by failing to stand up to Bulgaria, EU leaders are reneging. As for Kosovo, the EU made a number of demands in exchange for allowing its citizens visa-free travel. The Kosovars delivered in 2018; the EU‘s member states have not.

Miroslav Lajcak, the EU’s special representative, admits the bloc’s image has been “damaged” but notes that 68% of the Western Balkan Six’s trade is with the EU, which is also giving the region €9bn ($10bn) in aid over the next seven years. Others see grounds for gloom. One reason EU-moderated talks between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo are deadlocked, says a diplomatic source, is that the bloc becomes “powerless in the dialogue” if it breaks its promises. Among EU member states, many suspect that champions of enlargement, like Hungary, want to bring in autocratic Serbia to expand their “illiberal bloc”.
Outside powers are encroaching on the region. On July 10th Serbia’s free-trade agreement with the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union came into force. That is incompatible with EU membership. In the meantime plans abound for what the Six should do next. Last year they agreed to form a common regional market. On July 29th Serbia, North Macedonia and Albania signed an agreement to implement some of its provisions, but Kosovo, Bosnia and Montenegro will not sign that deal.
Mr Rama chides his colleagues to stop using growing Russian, Chinese and Turkish investments in the region as a tool to put pressure on the EU (or as he put it, “If you don’t take me, there are some bitches that will”). He thinks that, rather than letting the EU’s paralysis slow the six down, they should get on with their own regional integration. But Kristof Bender of the European Stability Initiative, a think-tank in Berlin, is sceptical: “You want to be in a common market with larger, richer economies, not a few neighbours who are as poor and underdeveloped as you are.” ■",2
1557,"THE DAILY flag-raising ceremony at sunrise on Tiananmen Square draws a youthful crowd, often from out of town. Queues form even in the biting Beijing winter. The show is over in minutes: China’s red flag is hoisted and an army band strikes up the national anthem. The first rays of sunlight illuminate the portrait of Mao Zedong hanging in the square. In a tribute known to all Chinese youths, Mao once said: “The world is yours as well as ours. But in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people...are like the sun at eight or nine in the morning...We put our hopes in you.”
China’s youth merit attention for the simple reason that they will one day be the people in charge. Over the next decade they will gain influential positions in China’s booming private-sector firms—or set up their own. More than half of Chinese in their 20s express a desire to start their own business. Others will climb up the ranks of the ruling Communist Party. How they understand their country’s past and what they ask of its future are essential to understand how they might one day lead China.

But China’s youngsters also deserve scrutiny for what they are now: vitally, young. Youth often stands for trendsetting and rebellion. In China, the young must navigate an authoritarian state and a bruisingly competitive education system. This is when big life decisions are made and adult identities formed. China’s young face unusual pressures. They were born under the one-child policy, a harshly enforced system that from 1980 to 2016 let most urban families have only one child (many rural families were allowed two, and ethnic minorities like Tibetans were in theory exempt). Without siblings, they shoulder alone the full weight of their parents’ (and grandparents’) expectations: to excel at school, secure a stable job, marry and have children, all before the age of 30.
This special report focuses on those in their 20s. Many have spent some time living away from home, but are not yet in the thick of parenthood themselves. In China this cohort has a generational identity: the jiulinghou, or “post-90s”, a shorthand term for those born between 1990 and 1999. They number 188m—more than the combined populations of Australia, Britain and Germany. The jiulinghou are already making their mark, in ways unimaginable to those born a decade earlier.
Many are defying social convention, often to their parents’ alarm. The jiulinghou are China’s best-educated cohort yet. Last year the country churned out a record 9m graduates. But increasing competition for good jobs means that returns to education are falling. Lots plump for stable civil-service jobs, yet some resent doing tedious work. One 27-year-old live-streamer who sells cosmetics asks why he should settle for a government job that is “bullshit and boring”? A pay cheque is no longer enough; young people want a sense of purpose. As labour-intensive manufacturing winds down, young migrants from the countryside are taking up gigs that give them more freedom in the booming informal sector.
Young Chinese are also making choices about when, whom and whether they wed. Their elders, who would once have made matches for them, have never been less involved. Newlyweds hit a ten-year low in 2019. Women in Shanghai marry on average at 29, later than Americans and a jump of six years in a decade. Even in rural areas the age is 25 and rising. Young Chinese are adept at avoiding traditional norms. Many gays and lesbians, who once felt compelled to marry straight folk, unite in “lavender” marriages thanks to matchmaking apps. (China does not allow gay marriage, and homosexuality remains taboo.) This pleases conservative parents while letting gay people choose their own partners.
The identities of the young are also shaped by the digital age. On social media they start trends, vent frustrations and circulate knowing memes. Despite pervasive censorship, they use China’s online networks to promote such causes as feminism, environmentalism and nationalism. When they feel insulted by foreign entities, be they K-pop bands or America’s National Basketball Association, millions clamour online for consumer boycotts that cow even mighty multinationals. Patriotic sentiment has long been strong. But increasingly youths do not question the regime’s claim that loving country and party are one and the same.

Where they now show reverence for the flag and the armed forces, young Chinese once displayed remarkable defiance. In June 1989 tanks and guns cleared student protesters from Tiananmen Square with murderous force. To many Westerners and older Chinese liberals, the young lack the qualities that made the Tiananmen generation remarkable: ideals, rebellion, even guts. The jiulinghou are seen as apolitical, except in their naive and brash patriotism; concerned with getting ahead, but only to buy the latest iPhone. Many see them as materialistic and entitled, a generation of “little emperors” doted on by their parents.
This does not always describe the jiulinghou. When police arrested a human-rights lawyer called Pu Zhiqiang in 2014 for joining a private memorial to the victims of Tiananmen, students uploaded photos of themselves to Weibo, a microblog, holding signs in his support. “We are the jiulinghou,” the message read. “We are certainly not brain-dead!...In fact, we are passionate, we are rising and we are ready to take on responsibility.”
This report argues that they are living up to these words. Yes, there has been no direct youth-led challenge to the regime. But young people speak out for social causes. Many join volunteer groups or donate to charity. No generation has been more vocal in its support of LGBT and women’s rights. Students have backed factory workers trying to unionise, and staged silent street protests about climate change. This takes guts. Under Xi Jinping, China’s president since 2013, intimidation and arrests of activists have become common.
Young people do not intend to challenge the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party. Their social liberalism has grown even as support for the party rises. The jiulinghou are comfortable with a rising, assertive China. The party knows how to play on this. It has hammered home that China stopped the spread of covid-19 within its borders as the West bungled its response. Spin doctors have not had to exert themselves on the calamitous failings of Donald Trump’s presidency. More overseas Chinese students are returning home, disillusioned with the West. Young pride feeds off a new worldly confidence.
Yet not every young Chinese holds rosy views of the party. In Hong Kong, young protesters fighting for Western freedoms have made clear their fury at their erosion by the Beijing government. Tibetan and Uyghur youths seethe in silence as brutal state-led campaigns erase their cultures and languages. In Xinjiang more than 1m Uyghurs have been locked up without trial. Students are told their good behaviour decides if relatives get out. Ethnic Mongols in the northern province of Inner Mongolia staged rare protests last year over an order requiring more use of Mandarin in schools. Hundreds were arrested. Geriler, a young ethnic Mongol, says she feels “deeply unhappy” with the government, but also “terribly afraid”.
Jiulinghou lingo
China divides its generations by decades. The qilinghou (post-70s) are defined by childhoods after Mao’s death in 1976. The balinghou (post-80s) grew up as China reformed and opened to the world under Deng Xiaoping. It is often now argued that generations change every five years, or even every three—the talk is already of the linglinghou, most of whom are still in school. To speak of millennials, whose definition in the West is those born between 1981 and 1996, is to shoehorn four Chinese generations into one.
The gap is easy to grasp if you ask parents to recall their 20s. They mention jobs allocated by the party through their danwei, a government-controlled work unit. Only with its permission could they marry and divorce. For years women had to report their periods to the danwei to ensure they were complying with the one-child rule. The danwei provided welfare benefits such as free housing, schooling and health care. Their children’s lives, by contrast, are defined by choice, individualism and more personal freedom.
The lives of jiulinghou share two features. One is that they began after the pro-democracy protests of 1989. The state relentlessly scrubs from the internet any reference to the bloody suppression of the Tiananmen protests. Terrified parents, not wanting to put ideas into children’s heads, keep silent. Some youths know a terse official version that casts the students as rabble-rousers, and says nothing of their deaths. Some observers ask if this enforced amnesia could embolden the young to rise up again. Others argue that, because they do not know that the army gunned down students in cold blood and see only a China that has become richer and stronger under the party’s rule, they are more likely than older generations to see it as a benevolent force.
The second feature is that those born since 1991 spent their late teens with Mr Xi in power. They might be called Generation Xi. Since primary school, they have received an education with more emphasis on patriotism than at any time since Mao, following an overhaul of the syllabus after Tiananmen. Students take obligatory courses on Marxism, nationalism and the doctrines of Mao; last year “Xi Jinping Thought” was added. This affects how they see the world. A survey in 2019 by China Youth Daily, a state organ, found that three in four of those born after 1995 think China is “not perfect, but always improving”. But the first thing this report explores is a divide: between rural and urban youth.■",2
1558,"Budget Champagnes from Sainsbury's, Tesco and Lidl have beaten bottles from high-end brands costing three times as much in a Which? blind taste test. 
An expert panel of judges sampled 19 non-vintage champagnes from supermarkets and best-selling brands for the consumer group's annual Christmas report.
Waitrose Blanc De Noirs Brut NV Champagne, £24, was declared the overall winner, with a score of 82%. 
Second place went to Co-op Les Pionniers Non-Vintage Champagne, £19, with a score of 81%, followed by M&S Champagne Delacourt Brut NV, £20, at 81%.
Lidl's Veuve Delattre Champagne Brut NV, which at £12.49 was the cheapest bottle tasted, scored 77% and was named best value. It came in sixth overall. 
In contrast, Moët & Chandon Brut Imperial NV Champagne, £38, scored 73% and Piper-Heidsieck Brut Champagne, £35, scored 71%. Both finished outside the top 10. 
Supermarkets were asked to nominate two widely available champagnes that they thought would stand up to the bestselling brands, including a premium own label costing up to £38 and, if available, a second, lower-priced own label champagne.
Each member of the panel tasted the champagnes in a different order to avoid any bias. 
After all the champagnes had been tasted, the panel agreed on a score for each bottle and which ones deserved to be Best Buys. 
Results proved a higher price does not always mean a higher quality bottle, with supermarket wines dominating the top 10. Sainsbury's Lidl 
Which? commented that Lidl's 'Great Value' Champagne was 'the cheapest on test, yet it outshone many pricier rivals'. 
Lidl's Veuve Delattre Champagne Brut NV received a higher rating than bottles from some of the top Champagne houses.
It was was the cheapest bottle the experts tested, at around £26 less than the price of those by the more renowned brands. 
The Lidl champagne scored higher than £35 a bottle Piper-Heidsieck Brut and £36-a-bottle Taittinger Brut Reserve N/V.  
Richard Bampfield, Lidl's Master of Wine, commented: 'The results of this expert blind-tasting are a well-deserved endorsement for what truly is a great value bottle of Champagne.  
'Proving once again that Lidl cannot be beaten on price or quality! 
Lidl's Veuve Delattre Champagne Brut NV is a brilliant option for those looking to save and impress over the festive period.'",-2
1559,"IN THE STAID world of Chinese banking, it is rare for executives to voice public criticism. So Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, made headlines in 2008 when he bemoaned how hard it was for small businesses to get loans: “If the banks don’t change, we’ll change the banks.” He has not repeated his warning since then. He has not needed to.
Through Ant Group, which began life as a payments service on Alibaba, Mr Ma’s impact on the Chinese financial system has been profound. Ant has helped establish China as the world leader in digital transactions, given entrepreneurs and consumers far greater access to loans, and changed the way that people manage their money. It is now a giant in its own right. Over the past year it counted more than 1bn active users. Last year it handled 110trn yuan ($16trn) in payments, nearly 25 times more than PayPal, the biggest online payments platform outside China (see chart 1).

An initial public offering (IPO) in the coming weeks will bear testimony to Ant’s growth. It is expected to raise more than $30bn, eclipsing Saudi Aramco’s debut last year as the biggest IPO—a symbol of the world’s transition from a century in which oil was the most valuable resource to an era that prizes data. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 40, in line with big global payments companies, Ant could fetch a market capitalisation in excess of $300bn, more than any bank in the world.

A four-legged insect
More important than its size is what Ant represents. It matters globally in a way that no other Chinese financial institution does. China’s banks are huge but inefficient, burdened by state ownership. By contrast foreign financiers look at Ant with curiosity, envy and anxiety. Some hawks in the White House reportedly want to rein in the company or hobble its IPO. Ant is the most integrated fintech platform in the world: think of it as a combination of Apple Pay for offline pay, PayPal for online pay, Venmo for transfers, Mastercard for credit cards, JPMorgan Chase for consumer financing and iShares for investing, with an insurance brokerage thrown in for good measure, all in one mobile app.
Given the abundance of consumer data in China and the relatively lax safeguards around its use, Ant has more to work with than fintech peers elsewhere. More than 3,000 variables have gone into its credit-risk models, and its automated systems decide whether to grant loans within three minutes—a claim that may seem far-fetched but for Alibaba’s proven ability to handle 544,000 orders per second. Ant is, in short, the world’s purest example of the tremendous potential of digital finance. But as it advances further, it may also be an early warning of its limitations.
Start with a deceptively simple question: what is Ant? In its decade as an independent company it has changed names three times—from Alibaba E-Commerce to Ant Small and Micro Financial Services to Ant Group. The company once called itself a fintech leader. Then Mr Ma inverted the term to techfin, in order better to capture its priorities. Such are its efforts to distinguish itself from a purely financial firm that it has asked some brokerages to assign tech analysts to cover it. (Of course, it does not hurt that the valuations for tech stocks are much plumper than for bank stocks.)
Yet there is no doubt that Ant, at its heart, is about finance. The clearest way of understanding its business model is to look at the four sections into which it divides its revenues. The first is payments—how it started and still the foundation of the company. Ant began in 2004 as a solution to a problem. Shoppers and merchants were flocking to Alibaba but lacked a trusted payment option. Alipay was created as an escrow account, transferring money to sellers after buyers had received their products. With the launch of a mobile Alipay app, it moved into the offline world, super-charging its growth in 2011 with the introduction of QR codes for payments. A shop owner needed to show only a QR code print-out to accept money, a big advance for a country previously reliant on cash.
For China as a whole, digital transactions reached 201trn yuan in 2019, up from less than 1trn in 2010. Alipay’s market share has been whittled down by Tencent, which added a payments function to WeChat, China’s dominant messaging app. Both companies earn as little as 0.1% per transaction, less than banks do from debit-card swipes. Given the sheer volume, this still adds up to a lot. Ant generated nearly 52bn yuan of revenues from its payments business last year. But growth is slowing, dropping from 55% of Ant’s revenue in 2017 to 36% in the first half of this year. Instead, the crucial point is that payments are a gateway: how Ant attracts users, understands them and ultimately monitors them.
The biggest beneficiary of all this data is Ant’s lending arm, the second part of the company (which Ant, never one to shy away from jargon, calls CreditTech). Ant began consumer lending as recently as 2014, with the launch of Huabei, a revolving unsecured credit line for purchases—basically a virtual credit card. Alipay users can tap into Huabei to defer payments by a month or to break them into instalments. Credit cards had never taken off in China, so Huabei was lapped up. That led to Jiebei, an Alipay feature which allows users to borrow larger sums. Ant also offers loans, with a focus on very small businesses. Annualised interest rates hover between 7% and 14%, lower than the alternatives from small-loan companies.
Like many Ant clients, Zhu Yifan, owner of Rabbits Go Home, a convenience store in Dongyang, an eastern city, started small. Four years ago she and her husband wanted to open their store. With no property as collateral, they could not get a bank loan. Instead, they pulled together money from friends and relatives, and, on a whim, borrowed 10,000 yuan from Ant, the most they could obtain then. By repaying that initial loan and getting customers to use Alipay—giving Ant a look at her cash flow—Ms Zhu’s credit score improved. Now, she has a 100,000 yuan credit line from Ant, which lets her stock up before busy holidays.
In barely half a decade Ant has reached 1.7trn yuan in outstanding consumer loans, or roughly a 15% share of China’s consumer-lending market. Its loans to small businesses total about 400bn yuan, about 5% of the micro-enterprise loan market. From a financial perspective, Ant’s biggest innovation is the way that it funds the credit. Initially, it made the loans and then packaged them as securities, sold to other financial institutions. But regulators feared parallels with the securitisation boom that preceded the financial crisis of 2007-09. They required that the originators of securities hold capital much like any bank—a rule that cut into Ant’s margins.

So Ant devised a new approach. It now identifies and assesses borrowers, but passes them on to banks which extend the loans. Ant collects a “technology service fee”. For borrowers it is seamless. With a few taps on their smartphones, their credit requests are approved or rejected. Ant ends up with a cash-rich, asset-light lending model. Fully 98% of the loans are held as assets by other firms. Credit has become Ant’s biggest single business segment, accounting for 39% of its revenues in the first half of this year (see chart 2).
The strength of Ant’s platform is what enables its third and fourth business segments: asset management and insurance (InvestmentTech and InsureTech, to use Ant’s nomenclature). Ant got started on asset management in 2013 with the launch of Yu’ebao, or “leftover treasure”. The idea was that merchants or shoppers with cash in Alipay could get a small return by parking it in a money-market fund. That attracted people interested in Yu’ebao purely for storing cash, since its yields (now roughly 1.7%) were higher than those available on current accounts at banks. By 2017 Yu’ebao had given rise to the world’s biggest money-market fund by size.
Ant broadened its offerings to become one of China’s most powerful distribution channels for investments. Today 170 companies sell more than 6,000 products such as stock and bond funds on Ant. Altogether these firms have roughly 4.1trn yuan in assets under management enabled by the app. As with its lending business, Ant screens prospective clients and directs them to products. It then collects a service fee. “Our growth on Ant has been faster than on any other digital platform,” says Li Li, deputy CEO of Invesco Great Wall Fund Management. Her group’s two money-market funds soared from 665m yuan in assets under management in early 2018, when it started selling them on Ant, to 114bn yuan in June.
Ant’s push into insurance happened more recently. For a decade it offered shipping insurance for purchases on Alibaba, letting dissatisfied customers return goods for no charge. But it is only in the past two years that it has applied its asset-management template to insurance. In partnership with big insurance firms, it has unveiled life, car and medical insurance—again collecting fees as a distribution platform. Asset management and insurance now make up nearly a quarter of revenues.
All the ants are marching
Simply looking at the numbers, Ant can appear unstoppable. It has chalked up dizzying growth rates in every market that it has targeted. It benefits from the network effects so familiar in the tech world: the more people use it, the stronger its attraction for yet more borrowers, lenders and investors. It is a virtuous cycle, especially for Ant’s shareholders. Nevertheless, there exist three kinds of risks that could slow it down: regulatory, competitive and those that are intrinsic to its own model.
The regulatory landscape in China is treacherous. Officials endlessly tweak rules for banks and investors, patching up holes as they emerge in the fast-growing but debt-laden economy. Many have long assumed that the government will give Ant, a private-sector firm, only so much leeway in the state-controlled system.
Indeed, regulators have already put numerous hurdles in Ant’s path. Its first attempt at launching a virtual credit card was blocked. The securitisation crackdown upended its lending model. A government plan to standardise QR codes could weaken it in payments, potentially reducing Ant’s market dominance. Another new rule, taking effect in November, will force Ant to hold more capital.
But if all these hurdles were meant to stop Ant, they have not succeeded. So there exists an alternative explanation. Regulators, wary of the pitfalls in financial innovation, continue to erect guardrails around Ant. In general, though, they like it. Not only has it steered credit towards small consumers and businesses, it has also given the government more information about money flows. Duncan Clark, author of a biography of Jack Ma, notes that regulators have long struggled to monitor all corners of China, referencing the old saying that the mountains are high and the emperor far away. “Ant has basically let Beijing tunnel through the mountains and fly drones over their summits,” he says.
Another threat to Ant is its competitors. Until 2013 mobile pay was, more or less, Ant’s exclusive domain. But Tencent has used its ubiquitous WeChat app to muscle in, taking nearly a 40% market share. Other firms also have financial ambitions. Meituan, an app known for food delivery, now also offers credit. The financial arm of JD.com, an e-commerce firm, and Lufax, an online wealth-management platform, are on track for IPOs this year.
So far these competitors have a much smaller financial footprint than Ant’s. Partly this is because they do not have the same breadth. Shawn Yang of Blue Lotus, a boutique Chinese investment bank, says that Tencent, for instance, has high-frequency but low-value consumption data, less rich than the trove that Ant has thanks to Alibaba, which accounts for more than half of Chinese online retail sales.
But it is also a matter of business culture. The most controversial episode in Ant’s history came in 2011 when Mr Ma spun it out from Alibaba, without notifying SoftBank and Yahoo, which together held about 70% of Alibaba’s shares back then. Mr Ma explained that Chinese regulations forbade foreigners from owning domestic payments firms, though there may have been work-arounds. Some suspected that he wanted to bring in powerful investors closer to home. Ant’s earliest rounds of fundraising as an independent firm did indeed attract major state-owned enterprises. A stake was also sold to a private equity firm managed by the grandson of Jiang Zemin, China’s paramount leader during Alibaba’s early years.
Yet in retrospect the spin-off has a clear strategic rationale. As a standalone company Ant has had the motivation to explore distant corners of the banking system and act aggressively. An executive with another e-commerce company says that its financial unit worries about making mistakes that might taint the group’s core retail business. Ant, by contrast, has diversified, with less than 10% of its revenues now from Alibaba. For China’s other e-commerce dynamos, its success offers a template. They may be several years behind but the fintech race is far from over.
The final danger for Ant has the most global resonance: the nature of its model. Unsecured lending to small borrowers is risky, whichever way it is done. Indeed the coronavirus pandemic has offered a sharp test for Ant. Delinquent loans (more than 30 days past due) issued via its app nearly doubled from 1.5% of its outstanding total in 2019 to 2.9% in July. Yet that is better than most other banks in China. Is that because of Ant’s prowess? Some critics say that it reflects its market power. Given the centrality of Alipay and Alibaba to their operations, few dare to default on Ant loans, worried that a downgraded credit rating may damage other parts of their business.
Still, many bankers are persuaded that Ant truly does have an advantage in its analytics. “They don’t need quarterly statements. They see your daily flow of funds. They know who your customer is. They know who your customer’s customer is,” says one. Based on the address for e-commerce deliveries, Ant has more up-to-date information about where someone lives and works than a bank. Based on what that person buys, Ant can work out their income bracket and their habits, preferences and way of life.
But according to Hui Chen, a finance professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has worked on research projects with Ant, individual and systemic risks are different. The machine learning that underpins Ant’s algorithms observes individual behaviour again and again, and is then able to detect patterns and anomalies. But if risks do not appear in the historical data—say, a big economic shock—the same machine learning may stumble.

There are also some limitations hard-wired into Ant’s strategy. By design, it aims for high-volume, small-scale borrowers and investors. “Their analytical advantage is most significant with this mass market, where traditional banking models are most inaccessible,” says Mr Chen. Most corporate lending—about 60% of all credit in China—will remain off limits. Ant also has an awkward relationship with banks. It relies on them to fund the loans on its platform, but as it grows it may become a competitor in their eyes. For now that is not much of a concern, given that it focuses on borrowers ignored by banks. But it means that Ant must befriend the very institutions that it once set out to disrupt.
Doubts exist about its investment and insurance platforms, too. Ant has excelled in selling money-market funds to a plethora of retail investors. Moving up the value chain could be harder. “They are great at selling penny products. But that’s not where you make the money in insurance,” says Sam Radwan of Enhance, a consultancy. To close a deal on a valuable, complex policy like a variable annuity, brokers typically speak with consumers several times. “No ordinary customer is going to trust an online broker for something that complicated,” says Mr Radwan.
Doing the jitterbug
Ant’s global ambitions are also running into problems beyond its control. It has stakes in around ten different fintech companies in Asia, such as Paytm in India. Boosters once imagined a world connected by Ant, its credit-to-investment architecture straddling borders. The first blow to that vision came in 2018 when America blocked Ant’s acquisition of MoneyGram, a money-transfer firm, which would have established Ant as a force in global remittances. Security concerns over Ant have increased as China’s foreign policy has become more aggressive. Little wonder that Ant plans to devote just a tenth of its IPO proceeds to cross-border expansion.
Despite all these limitations, one lesson from Ant’s decade in existence is that future possibilities remain vast. Ms Li of Invesco gushes about her fund-management firm’s mini-site within the Alipay app, one of the tens of thousands of separate sections that constitute the Ant ecosystem. In September Invesco hosted a live-stream on the mini-site to discuss its market outlook. More than 700,000 tuned in—just one example of how Ant has become the main doorway into the financial system for tens of millions of people. And for all those who have walked through it, many more have not. Ant will soon know where they live, how much they earn and what they want. It is coming for them. ■",2
1560,"EKATERINA ENGALYCHEVA never got her badge showing Lenin as a child. The week she was supposed to join the Oktiabriata (“little Octobrists”, a reference to the revolution of 1917), as all Soviet children did at the age of seven, the Soviet Union fell apart. But 30 years later Ms Engalycheva is a member of the Communist Party and a Moscow city councillor. She campaigns against Vladimir Putin’s crony capitalism; Lenin would no doubt have approved. But he would have been horrified by her other demands: for fair elections and impartial justice. She has been detained and fined for protesting against the jailing of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s opposition leader, and recently had to barricade herself in her office while police waited outside to arrest her.
She is far from the stereotype of a Communist. She is not a red-flag-waving pensioner, and does not care about Stalin. Nor does she feel any attachment to the Soviet-era Communists who “betrayed our country and our people, switched sides and settled in United Russia” (the vehicle through which Mr Putin now controls the Russian parliament). She is not bothered that the Communist Party today is led by Gennady Zyuganov, a Stalin-praising former Soviet ideologue. What matters more to her is that the party is showing signs of becoming a genuine opposition. And this is making the Kremlin, and indeed Mr Zyuganov himself, nervous.

Mr Zyuganov founded his post-Soviet Communist Party in 1993, aiming to benefit from some of the resentment and nostalgia brought on by the Soviet Union’s collapse. It was in fact a nationalist and imperialist party, which that year was involved in an unsuccessful armed revolt against Boris Yeltsin’s democratic government. In 1996, when Mr Zyuganov challenged Yeltsin in presidential elections, Russian liberals and businessmen, fearful of a Communist revanche, threw all their resources behind the ailing president. “I would rather elect a dead Yeltsin than a live Zyuganov,” one TV executive said at the time.
Mr Zyuganov lost, but for the next two decades his presence allowed the Kremlin to frame politics as a binary choice between democracy and Soviet-style communism. Today many Russian democrats, desperate to get Yeltsin’s successor out of the Kremlin, find themselves voting for the Communists.
They are well aware of the irony. But, as Yevgenia Albats, a firebrand of Russia’s opposition media, says, “this bitch of a government has left us no choice.” With nearly all forms of politics banned and Mr Navalny behind bars, the Communist Party has become the main beneficiary of his “smart voting” strategy. He urged Russians to vote for whichever candidate was best placed to beat United Russia’s. Had the votes been counted honestly in parliamentary elections in September, the Communists would have got roughly the same number as United Russia. Even after all the rigging it won 19% of the vote, up from 13% in 2016.
This success has discombobulated Mr Zyuganov. Financed and controlled by the Kremlin, he has enrolled his party in Mr Putin’s system of “managed democracy”, which presents an illusion of choice while reinforcing the Kremlin’s control. “Smart voting” has spoiled that game. Not only did it boost the Communist vote, it gave its younger deputies a sense of power.
It is not only protest votes that are buoying the Communist Party. Several young politicians running on the party’s ticket are using it as a platform from which to launch their own left-wing agenda. Many of them would fit comfortably into a European-style social democratic party.
Consider Mikhail Lobanov, a 37-year-old maths lecturer at Moscow State University. He ran a Western-style campaign, crowdfunding and canvassing door-to-door, in a relatively affluent part of Moscow. He ditched ideological clichés to focus on urban activism and social welfare. “I believe in the left idea as a way of restraining the excesses of capitalism through equal opportunities and access to universal health care and education,” he says. The Kremlin’s blatant rigging robbed him of victory, but not of his appeal.
With leftism advancing in much of the rest of the world, it is striking how long it has taken to come into vogue in Russia, particularly given the inequality that Mr Putin’s rule has entrenched. An obvious explanation is that it takes time for people to forget the Soviet attempt to enforce equality, the millions who were murdered in its pursuit, and how catastrophically it failed. Now, however, six years of falling incomes have prompted many Russians to reconsider the politics of the left.
The Communists’ current shift is largely a reaction to Mr Putin’s policies. By annexing Crimea in 2014 he stole the party’s previous nationalist agenda, leaving it to make a choice, explains Gregory Yudin, a sociologist. “They could either move further to the right and become extinct, or they could step out of their ghetto and shift to the left.”
Valery Rashkin, a Communist MP and head of the party’s Moscow branch, decided to experiment. At the September election he backed a number of young candidates such as Evgeny Stupin, a 38-year-old former police investigator who had served in the Urals but quit his badly paid job (along with the obligatory membership of United Russia) and moved to Moscow to look for work. The injustice and corruption that he encountered there led Mr Stupin to the Communists.
The Kremlin is now directing Soviet-style repression against young Communists, and trying to paint them as Stalinists. Meanwhile, the Communists are standing up for human rights, for example by demanding investigations into reported torture in Russia’s prisons. Mr Putin’s Russia is indeed a looking-glass world. ■",2
1561,"THE CELEBRATIONS seemed fit for a conquering hero returning home. As the trucks crossed the border, women showered them with flower petals and rice. Banners hailed the mastermind of the operation for “breaking the siege” imposed on his country by malevolent foreign powers. A few men fired bullets and rocket-propelled grenades in the air—a particularly ill-advised form of salute given that the trucks were carrying 4m litres of diesel.
It says much about today’s Lebanon that a few petrol-tankers were greeted with such jubilation. The fuel is meant to ease an energy crisis that has paralysed the country. But 4m litres is less than a day’s consumption. Moreover, it will exacerbate the long political crisis in Lebanon. The shipment, arranged by Hizbullah, a Shia political party and militia, came from Iran to the port of Baniyas in Syria (see map), where it was transferred to trucks. It violates a range of American sanctions on Iran, Syria and Hizbullah itself. America, in turn, has put forward its own plan to keep the lights on in Lebanon—yet that proposal, ironically, will also fall foul of American sanctions on Syria.

Lebanon needs fuel, whatever the source. It is two years into a financial crisis that has left the currency all but worthless. Foreign reserves plunged from $38bn in 2019 to $15bn this summer. The government is struggling to import fuel and make it affordable for an impoverished population. It has steadily reduced subsidies. Twenty litres of petrol now cost 30% of the monthly minimum wage.

That is when fuel is available, which often it is not. Petrol queues stretch for kilometres. At home many Lebanese receive just two hours of electricity from the grid, while back-up generators that long filled the gaps have run out. Water authorities and the telecoms monopoly have cut service in some areas because they cannot power pumps and mobile-phone towers.
None of this is caused by a Western “siege”, as Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hizbullah, is fond of claiming. American sanctions on Lebanon are mostly limited to his party. In fact, some of Lebanon’s energy woes can be traced to Hizbullah’s role as a guardian of a corrupt political system.
Founded in the 1980s, Hizbullah is now the most powerful force in Lebanon, with a militia that outguns the army and an ever-stronger position in politics (it helps to be able to assassinate your critics). Yet it insists that its focus is national defence. Domestic policy, it says, falls to others.
But some of those others are its closest partners. In recent years it has forged an alliance with the Free Patriotic Movement, a Christian party led by Gebran Bassil, the president’s son-in-law, which has controlled the energy ministry for a decade. Mr Bassil served as minister from 2009 to 2014. He pushed a widely criticised scheme to build a power plant in Selaata, a Christian-majority village that is not even connected to the national grid. He also hired power plants on barges, which were meant as a stopgap but have become permanent, at great financial and environmental cost.
Loth to let Hizbullah pose as a saviour, America and its friends have offered their own energy plan, which relies on the 1,200km Arab Gas Pipeline. Though built to export Egyptian natural gas to other Arab states, for much of its history it has sat idle. After the Egyptian revolution in 2011, militants repeatedly bombed the feeder pipeline. Then Egypt ran into gas shortages caused by falling output and surging demand. By 2015 it had halted exports and become a net importer.
The picture is quite different today. The eastern Mediterranean is awash in natural gas thanks to massive finds such as the Zohr field in Egypt, which went online in 2018, and Israel’s Leviathan, which started production in 2019. Last year Israel began piping gas to Egypt, some of which can be liquefied and shipped to customers in Europe. (A few Lebanese wags have asked how their government will ensure that none of the gas arriving through the Arab pipeline contains Israeli hydrocarbons.)
Yet this American plan also faces American obstacles. Since the pipeline crosses Syria, Bashar al-Assad’s regime stands to collect transit fees. Rather than paying in cash, Syria could be paid in kind. One option would see it receive electricity from Jordan, which has a surplus, to help ease blackouts in regime-held territory. Either approach, however, would infringe the Caesar Act, an American law passed in 2019 which prohibits business with the regime.
Much of this is hypothetical. Syria must first fix its decrepit infrastructure, which will take months. But it underscores the fecklessness of an America that is hooked on using sanctions as a weapon. The Caesar Act was meant to give Mr Assad a choice between political reform and economic isolation. He chose the latter—not surprising for a man who destroyed his country to stay in power. But America is struggling to keep him isolated. Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states—all American partners—are restoring ties. Now Syria is set to become Lebanon’s energy broker.
As for the Iranian fuel shipments, they violated a host of American sanctions. Yet short of seizing tankers at sea, America had no power to stop them. It could impose sanctions on the Lebanese state (which insists that the imports were a private transaction), but that would only add to the country’s misery. Sanctions have already failed to change the behaviour of regimes in Syria and Iran, and America will find it ever harder to enforce them consistently.
Lebanon has long been buffeted by larger geopolitical struggles. A few tankers of fuel from Iran, or a trickle of gas from Egypt, will not repair its long-mismanaged energy industry. As ever, though, fixing Lebanon’s problems is not the real goal. ■",2
1562," (CNN)In a directorial father-son baton pass from Ivan Reitman to Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air""), ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is undeniably nostalgic and fairly sweet, while who-ya-gonna-calling directly back to the 1984 original. And yet with its focus on teenage heirs to that legacy, the movie simultaneously feels as much like the Disney Channel version of ""Ghostbusters"" as a long-delayed sequel.Happily, the kids are the very talented Mckenna Grace (""Gifted,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale"") and ""Stranger Things'"" Finn Wolfhard, the grandchildren of Egon Spengler (originally played by the late Harold Ramis). Egon has died, leaving a remote farmhouse to his estranged daughter (Carrie Coon), who for financial reasons finds the move timely.Moving into the place, Phoebe (Grace) and Trevor (Wolfhard) discover a lot of strange stuff happening around town -- starting with all those unexplained earthquakes -- and some nifty artifacts among grandpa's possesses. Phoebe possesses scientific acumen far beyond her years, while her brother mostly just crushes on one of his new classmates (Celeste O'Connor).Mom, meanwhile, strikes up a somewhat unexpected relationship with one of the kids' teachers (Paul Rudd, seemingly everywhere at once), adding to an adult component that produces some laughs but frankly rides in the passenger seat for much of the movie. (Coon is a gifted actress, but there's a bit of the ""E.T."" mom syndrome here, where she can't see all the weirdness happening her.)Cleverly, the film (written by Jason Reitman, Dan Aykroyd and Gil Kenan) does set up a dense mythology connecting this flurry of spectral shenanigans back to the 1980s, while playfully incorporating visual touches that recall the ""Ghostbusters"" of the past. There are also funny unrelated gags, such as Rudd's character getting through summer school by simply running wildly inappropriate horror movies.In some respects, ""Afterlife"" represents a rather conspicuous exercise in fan service, after the bizarre temper tantrum thrown by some in response to the female version of the concept that premiered five years ago. While that movie was flawed, the reaction seemed completely out of whack, elevating ""Ghostbusters"" to an overblown level of ""You ruined my childhood!"" exaltation.The elder Reitman serves as a producer on the movie, which -- with Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson promoting the movie -- isn't the only link to its Reagan-era roots. Still, this is one of those films that doesn't so much cross the streams as dip into a deep well of goodwill, hoping to bridge the gap between those who actually saw the original in a theater and kids and grandkids who will hopefully identify with the youthful protagonists.At its best ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" simply delivers a good time, combining the upgraded special effects with comedy and youthful angst, while taking a little too long to get to the good stuff.Broken down into those components, the younger Reitman has dutifully answered the call to carry on his family legacy, without quite conjuring the kind of sparks that would have made ""Afterlife"" completely rise to the occasion.""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.",0
1563,"THOUGH AMERICAN and Chinese tech platforms started the e-commerce gold rush, one Canadian company realised early on what money was to be made from selling shovels. That was Shopify, which supplies tools such as software, logistics and payments to allow firms to set up their own online stores rather than selling via giant platforms like Amazon. Its value, at $175bn, is only about a tenth that of Amazon. But in the past five years its share-price rise has outstripped that of “The Everything Store” more than tenfold.  
Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, is an evangelist for small retailers. Shopify’s more-than-1m merchants range from $1bn-plus brands like Allbirds to tiny startups that make their first sale on its platform every 52 seconds. Yet he believes that consumers will be the big winners from the transformation of retail, giving them more influence over how and what they buy. Not since John Wanamaker set up one of America’s earliest department stores in 1876, he says, has there been such a shift in favour of the customer.

Shopify may be the biggest e-commerce firm that most people have never heard of. Mr Finkelstein says it is “arming the rebels” by enabling independent retailers to survive and thrive via multiple sales channels, from Amazon to social media to bricks-and-mortar stores. Yet it is not the only fifth columnist. Across the world, regional platforms are competing fiercely to avoid American and Chinese dominance.
In Japan Amazon and Rakuten, a local e-commerce veteran, are in a battle for market leadership, but Softbank also plans to merge Yahoo Japan, an online shopping site in which it has a big stake, with Line, a messaging app, to make it a three-horse race. Amazon also has designs on South Korea via a partnership with 11street, owned by a local telecoms giant. But the market, led by Coupang, an online platform, is highly competitive. The South Korean affiliate of eBay, a big American platform, may be up for sale soon, making the contest fiercer still.
The Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have e-commerce stakes in South-East Asia via holdings in Lazada and Tokopedia, and Sea, respectively. In India, though the bulk of retailing still takes place in corner shops called kirana, e-commerce is a battle between Amazon, Flipkart (owned by Walmart) and JioMart, owned by Reliance, a conglomerate, with backing from Facebook, the American social-media giant. The Western firms are not just vying for a share of India’s vast retail market. They also want to learn how best to entice new smartphone users in emerging markets to shop online. That means more voice search, because of the plethora of local languages, as well as more video, says Leigh Hopkins, Walmart’s head of international strategy.
In Europe Amazon dominates, but marketplaces selling other people’s goods such as Berlin-based Zalando and Manchester-based Boohoo are mounting challenges. In Latin America Alibaba is the model, not Amazon. Buenos Aires-based Mercado Libre, the market leader in the region, does not sell its own products, unlike Amazon. Like Alibaba, it has a strong digital-payments arm. Yet Amazon is strong in Mexico, where it goes head to head with Mercado Libre, and competition between the two is growing in Brazil. Amazon is named after the country’s longest river. So far its business in Brazil does not live up to the name. But that is a rare exception.",2
1564,"WITH FOREIGN competitors such as Facebook and Google blocked, domestic tech giants have for two decades dominated the Chinese market. The Communist Party has kept a firm grip on politics, but the tech firms have had considerable leeway in their business activities. “It was a Wild West within an authoritarian system,” says Martin Chorzempa of the Peterson Institute, an American think-tank.

Now the Communist Party is reminding internet billionaires who is boss. President Xi Jinping has authorised an extraordinary crackdown. Last year the planned IPO of Ant Group, a giant internet finance company, was halted at the last moment. In July, two days after Didi, a ride-hailing firm, went public in New York, China’s internet regulator ordered it to stop signing up new users, and forced its apps off mobile stores. The city of Beijing on September 6th denied reports that it is considering taking Didi under state control.
Video-game companies are being pushed into scanning their users’ faces to help enforce a ban on children playing online games for more than three hours a week. The crackdown has shifted the balance, says Mr Chorzempa. Now, “technocrats, who have been frustrated for years that companies ignore proper, sensible regulations, are empowered.”
The party is pushing for more than superficial change. It is using a suite of new laws and regulations to force tech firms to alter both their behaviour and their products. The aim is to control what Chinese people see and do online. The new rules will require tech firms to write code for their platforms so that they promote content that the government likes, and inhibit what it does not. This is likely to be more efficient than the whack-a-mole approach of enforcing the party’s will case by case, and plausible at a scale that the labour-intensive approach of trying to control technological systems directly would not be.
In the past month alone Chinese lawmakers have finalised at least four new laws and regulations which, as they go into effect over the next three months, will have the potential to reshape the Chinese internet. Technology regulations in other countries and regions, such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), mostly require companies to obtain their customers’ consent for the specific processing of their data. China’s new rules are much stricter and more wide-ranging. Tech firms will be expected to protect national security and public order, says Nicolas Bahmanyar, a data-privacy consultant with Leaf, a law firm in Beijing. “A little banner is not going to cut it,” he adds.
A Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), China’s first privacy law, comes into effect on November 1st. Years in the making, it is much shorter and less detailed than GDPR, which inspired it, laying out principles that are both broad and intentionally vague. Details and future reinterpretations are to be dealt with by regulations particular to certain industries or technologies. This, says Mr Bahmanyar, allows regulation to keep pace with fast-changing technology. It also gives the government leeway to enforce vague rules as it sees fit. Didi was hit by rules brought in to govern companies whose digital services are seen as critical infrastructure. These were rewritten to cover foreign listings just as the firm was attempting to go public.
Not all new laws will worry investors as much as the ones used to clobber Didi. Some deal with problems that affect the West, too. One forthcoming set of regulations published in draft on August 27th by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) looks to set the rules for the use of recommendation algorithms. This is the sort of software that companies like Amazon and Alibaba use to recommend products based on a customer’s shopping history, or that short-video apps like TikTok use to work out what viewers like in order to give them more of it.
The draft regulations require, for instance, that companies expose the keywords with which they have labelled their users, and allow users to delete them. This, in principle, will mean that internet users in China will no longer be dogged by advertisements for the refrigerator that a recommendation algorithm has decided they might like to buy. Writing algorithms which lead users to “addiction or high-value consumption” would also be banned. Algorithms which dispatch workers, such as Didi’s driver-management system, must “ensure workers’ rights and interests”. The regulations read like an attempt to fix the problems griped about by consumers everywhere.
They also require firms that deploy recommendation algorithms to “uphold mainstream values” and to “vigorously disseminate positive energy”. Such algorithms must not be used to “engage in activities harming national security” or to upset the economic or social order. As such, their aim seems to be to withhold algorithmic juice from any content that does not make the government look good.
Kendra Schaefer of Trivium, a consultancy in Beijing, has written that the publication of these new algorithm regulations marks the moment when Chinese tech laws have gone beyond those in Europe (in America, only California has such rules).
Data-protection experts say many of these changes will be beneficial. Chinese internet users are constantly assailed by spam messages and phone calls. An app developed by the ministry of public security, which promises to screen fraudulent calls and messages, has become one of the most downloaded in China since it was released in March. The Chinese press is full of stories about people’s personal data being stolen. In 2016 Xu Yuyu, a prospective student, died of a heart attack after transferring her life savings to fraudsters who used personal data purchased on the black market to trick her into thinking they represented her university.
Protecting people from such predations will burnish the party’s reputation for standing up for the little guy. The new rules give citizens more rights against companies than people in any other country. But they give Chinese internet users precisely no privacy rights enforceable against the state. Indeed, says Sajai Singh of J. Sagar Associates, a law firm in Bangalore, the creation of a single common standard for the treatment of data in China will make it easier for the state to spy on citizens. Mr Chorzempa says rewriting the law to make firms rewrite software is a sea change. Once they start feeling they can intervene “at this level and granularity, what else will they do?” he asks. ■",2
1565,"TAKE A ROAD trip to Indianapolis, home to a certain two-and-a-half-mile race track, and you will find yourself in good company. A survey carried out before the pandemic found that about 85% of local commuters drive to work, alone. Standing on a bridge over 38th Street, which runs by the state fairground, you cannot escape the roar of six lanes of petrol-fired traffic below—and, reports a local, this is quiet compared with the noise on pre-virus days. Getting Americans to kick their addiction to fossil fuels will require many of these drivers to find another way of getting to work, and to move on from the flaming hydrocarbons celebrated each May at the city’s famous oval.
Joe Biden hopes to use what looks like a narrow window of Democratic control of Congress to encourage this transition. The last time lawmakers came close to writing climate legislation on anything like this scale was in 2009, when the Waxman-Markey bill, which would have established a trading system for greenhouse-gas emissions, was passed by the House. Since then, a Democratic White House has tried to nudge America to reduce emissions, by issuing new regulations, and a Republican White House has tried to undo them. That record illustrates what a delicate political operation this is.

Yet despite having a much weaker grip on Congress than Barack Obama had in the first year of his presidency, Mr Biden and his legislative allies have put forward a sweeping set of proposals for decarbonising America’s economy. These would promote everything from clean energy on the grid and electric vehicles on the road, to union jobs making green technologies and measures for left-behind communities.
Were this wish list passed in its entirety, which is unlikely, it would give a boost to Mr Biden’s pledge to reduce America’s emissions by roughly half from their 2005 level by 2030. A chart released by the office of Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s majority leader, suggests that implementing all of these provisions could reduce America’s emissions by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030, thus achieving almost all of Mr Biden’s goal of cutting them by roughly half in that period (see chart 1). Passing a law, even a less expansive one, would allow Mr Biden to travel to the UN climate summit in Glasgow in November representing a country that is making progress towards internationally agreed goals, rather than asking for the patience of poorer, less technologically sophisticated countries while America sorts itself out.

Some of the Democratic proposals are in an infrastructure bill with bipartisan support that spends $1trn over ten years. But most are in a budget bill disbursing $3.5trn (also over ten years) that, on account of Senate rules, can only pass through a partisan parliamentary manoeuvre known as reconciliation. This requires the assent of all 50 Democratic senators. The likeliest outcome is a compromise between Democratic progressives and moderates that yokes together the agreed infrastructure bill with a much slimmer version of the $3.5trn proposal. Yet it is possible that neither bill will become law.
This raises two questions. First, how good can a salami-sliced version of Mr Biden’s agenda, the result of a negotiation between 270 Democratic members of Congress each angling for their constituents’ interests, really be for the climate? Second, how bad would it be for America’s decarbonisation efforts if both bills fail?

Happily even reconciliation-lite could bring meaningful progress, if key bits of the current proposals survive the negotiations. Paul Bledsoe of the Progressive Policy Institute, a think-tank, is confident a deal “likely a bit under $2trn” will happen this month. Only a fraction of that spending will be on climate, because the bill also contains proposals to make the social safety-net more generous. The Rhodium Group, an analysis firm, reckons that just six proposals would cut emissions by nearly 1bn tonnes in 2030 compared with no new policies (see chart 2), about a sixth of America’s total net emissions per year. That is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from all cars and pickup trucks on American roads, or the emissions of Florida and Texas combined. The six include proposals related to “natural carbon removal” (from forests and soil), fossil fuels (making it more expensive to emit methane) and transport (a generous credit for buyers of electric cars).
Carrots beat sticks
The big prize, though, is the power sector. Two proposals for decarbonising the grid account for the lion’s share of likely emissions reductions: a new Clean Electricity Performance Programme (CEPP) and more mundane reforms to the tax credits received by clean energy. The CEPP has been touted by Mr Biden’s cabinet officials and leading progressives as a linchpin of the climate effort. It is loosely based on the mandatory clean-electricity standards imposed by over two dozen states which have successfully boosted adoption of low-carbon energy.
The CEPP is flawed in a couple of ways, though. Because it has to be primarily a fiscal measure in order to squeeze through the reconciliation process, it does not involve mandatory regulation—unlike those successful state energy standards. Rather, it uses (biggish) subsidies and (rather punier) penalty fees to try to nudge utilities to build more clean energy. It is politically vulnerable because it is unfriendly to natural gas and coal (unless they have expensive add-on kit to capture and store related emissions). That has incurred the hostility of Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents coal-rich West Virginia, without whose approval the bill will fail. Some influential utility companies with coal assets, including Ohio-based American Electric Power, do not like it either.
Despite the attention paid to it, CEPP is actually less potent as a greenhouse-gas slayer than those boring tax credits, which are less controversial because they do not overtly penalise coal or gas. Two energy veterans, one at a top renewables lobbying outfit and the other at a fossil-heavy utility, agree that the tax credits would sharply boost investment in low-carbon technologies. That is because they improve the current set-up by replacing stop-go uncertainty with a predictable long-term tax regime, and make tax breaks “refundable” rather than needing to be offset against tax liabilities, meaning even utilities that do not have such tax liabilities can enjoy them as freely as cash in the bank.
Thus the CEPP is overshadowing the real star proposal. The tax credits have “a huge impact potentially”, reckons Rhodium, accounting for over one-quarter of the greenhouse-gas emissions reductions in the legislation, at a cost of roughly $150bn over ten years. A former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) puts it bluntly: “Take the wind and solar tax credits at ten years if you had to choose—and let everything else go.”
What if Democrats fail, the negotiations fall apart and Mr Biden is left empty handed? That would be embarrassing. And it could make it difficult to pursue ambitious federal climate policies through Congress for years, just as the failure of Waxman-Markey in 2009 haunted lawmakers. However it would not mean America can do nothing at all about climate change.
First of all, as Mr Biden’s officials have already made clear, they stand ready to use regulations to push ahead on decarbonisation efforts, just as the Obama administration did. Last month the EPA issued rules cracking-down on emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, an especially powerful greenhouse gas. The administration also has plans for loan guarantees for energy innovations and for speeding-up approvals for offshore wind farms. Yet this is tinkering compared with the federal law being discussed, especially as new regulations are likely to encounter legal challenges.
Even if the federal government fails again, states and cities have climate policies too. Drawing on analysis funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, Leon Clarke of the University of Maryland calculates that decentralised policies emulating the current best efforts of states like California could achieve roughly one-quarter of Mr Biden’s objective. But this is a bad deal: such efforts would fall a long way short of the federal proposal in reducing emissions, and what reductions they achieve would be more expensive than if done at the federal level. Still, it is not nothing. Last month, Illinois passed the country’s boldest climate-change law. Democratic states such as New York and California have green policies, but Republican states such as Texas and Indiana have big wind industries too.
Although Mr Clarke says Congress has to act if America is to achieve Mr Biden’s targets, he believes that progress will continue even if Congress falters, because there is now a deeper sense of ownership of climate policy among local and state governments. “The Trump years really changed the way that subnationals in the US view climate action,” he says. “They can’t rely on the federal government.”
Change is happening in surprising places. Take that flyover in Indianapolis. The city’s officials have made it into a bike path that will be connected to 55 miles of commuter-friendly trails traversing the city. The city has allocated $100m for building a bus-rapid transit system, which is a cheap and efficient substitute for underground rail, with more such rapid bus lines on the cards. Bloated 38th Street will undergo a “lane diet” with car and lorry traffic yielding two lanes to the buses. Come back in a few years and the view from the bridge should be a bit quieter. ■

1566," (CNN)The hesitancy of many people to get a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday.""Those who are vaccine hesitant have had their hesitancy enhanced by a variety of things that are happening right now, particularly the unfortunate mix of science and politics,"" Collins said at an event hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than half of respondents -- 54% -- said they would not get the vaccine if it was available for free before the November 3 presidential election. Along party lines, 60% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they would not. Half of Democrats said they would. ""I don't want to have us, a year from now, having a conversation about how we have in our hands the solution to the worst pandemic of more than 100 years, but we haven't been able to actually convince people to take charge of it,"" Collins said.People need to understand that if not enough people get vaccinated, a vaccine won't help reduce the spread of the virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.""It's a combination of how effective a vaccine is and how many people use it,"" he said. ""If you have a vaccine that is highly effective and not enough people get vaccinated, you're not going to realize the full, important effect of having a vaccine.""The less protective a vaccine is, the more people need to get it to provide population-wide immunity, Fauci said.President Donald Trump has said a vaccine could be available before the election November 3, and on Wednesday he said a vaccine could be released by mid-October. Fauci said he still thinks it will be the final months of the year before a vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.''I would still put my money on November/December,"" Fauci said during a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute panel on global pandemics.The CDC head gave a timeline. The President disputed itThe timeline for a Covid vaccine became a major headline Wednesday, when Trump challenged assertions by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Dr. Robert Redfield said earlier that a ""very limited supply"" of a vaccine might be ready in November or December, but it would have to be prioritized for first responders and those at greatest risk for death.""If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at third, late second quarter, third quarter 2021,"" Redfield told a Senate appropriations subcommittee.On top of that, ""in order to have enough of us immunized so we have immunity, I think it's going to take us six to nine months,"" he said.In the meantime, ""These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,"" Redfield said, holding up a blue face mask, adding that masks may offer more protection than a vaccine. Trump said Redfield was ""confused"" in his testimony. ""I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information,"" Trump said about Redfield's vaccine timeline.The President also said Redfield's comments to Congress about masks possibly being more effective than a vaccine were incorrect and that Redfield may have misunderstood the question.""Maybe he misunderstood it,"" Trump said, later adding, ""As far as the masks are concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks.""A CDC spokesman said in a statement that Redfield was answering a question he thought was in regard to the time period in which all Americans would have completed their Covid vaccination, and his estimate was by the second or third quarter of 2021.""He was not referring to the time period when Covid-19 vaccine doses would be made available to all Americans,"" the spokesman said.In a later statement, Redfield said that he believes in the ""importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a Covid-19 vaccine.""Distrust is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spreadDistrust in government agencies is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,"" he said during an American Public Health Association webinar.Surveillance helps public health officials by collecting information on infected people, such as where they were exposed and who they've been in contact with, and the course of their illness. Fauci said the variability in how the coronavirus affects people has helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.""One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently... propagating the outbreak..."" Fauci said during a virtual panel sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Fauci said he has ""never seen anything with a range"" like this virus.""It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,"" he said.7 coronavirus deaths are linked to 1 weddingA wedding in Maine is linked to 176 Covid-19 cases and the deaths of seven people who didn't attend the celebration -- showing just how easily and quickly coronavirus can spread at social gatherings, public health experts say.  For months, doctors have stressed the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. But outbreaks have stemmed from Memorial Day events, Fourth of July celebrations and a massive motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.The wedding in Millinocket on August 7 had about 65 guests, a violation of the state's 50-person limit for indoor events, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.The event is linked to outbreaks that have unfolded at a nursing home and a jail, both more than 100 miles away from the wedding venue, among people who had only secondary or tertiary contact with an attendee. Residents at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center accounted for 39 cases tied to the wedding and six of the seven deaths thus far, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said.""The virus favors gatherings,"" Shah added. ""It does not distinguish between happy events like a wedding celebration, or sad farewells, like a funeral.""Despite such somber warnings, about 1,500 people descended on a New Jersey boardwalk house featured in MTV's ""Jersey Shore"" on Monday night, ending in eight arrests, Seaside Heights police said. The event was organized by a group of YouTube pranksters, according to Seaside Heights Police Detective Steve Korman, and officials say they are now worried about how they will track possible infections among more than a thousand people.Universities try to get ahead of outbreaksOutbreaks keep cropping up at colleges and universities, prompting some to go to virtual learning again. More than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at colleges and universities in all 50 states. Citing a significant rise in cases among students, the University of Colorado Boulder announced a 14-day quarantine period for students living within the city.The University of Arizona is taking a similar approach, urging students to shelter in place until the end of the month after a large number of positive cases. The university reported 261 positive cases on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard.At the University of Missouri, two students were expelled and three were suspended for violating rules that require students who test positive to isolate and comply with social distancing.""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable. We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students,"" the university said in a statement Tuesday.",0
1567," (CNN Business)The biggest news this week in the criminal trial of Elizabeth Holmes is that the government expects to rest its case against the former CEO and founder of failed blood testing company Theranos in a matter of days.In a surprise disclosure after jurors were excused for a long weekend, assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Schenk said the government will likely rest its case against Holmes sometime next week, which will mark the eleventh of the trial and is slated to be a marathon, with court in session all five days. In anticipation, Schenk asked the defense to privately share the first witnesses it expects to call, something the government has been providing to the defense each week but is not disclosed publicly. Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces a dozen federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison. Whether jurors will get to hear from Holmes herself remains an open question. She's listed as a possible defense witness.Here are some other highlights from week 10 of the trial, where court was in session for just two days.Theranos' final lab director testifies Jurors heard from Theranos' final laboratory director, Dr. Kingshuk Das -- the fourth lab director to take the stand in the trial.Like other former employees, Das, a pathologist, testified that he'd been excited to join Theranos, even though he was hired in December 2015, when there was much scrutiny surrounding the company following a damning Wall Street Journal report. He said he still believed in the mission when he was laid off in mid-2018, shortly before Theranos shuttered entirely.Das, who previously worked at UCLA, testified that soon after he was hired, his primary responsibility became addressing a 121-page deficiencies report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services following its audit of the company's lab in the fall of 2015. Das ultimately recommended the company void two years of test results, or roughly 50,000 to 60,000 tests, from its proprietary Edison blood analyzer machines. While Das testified that Holmes didn't push back on voiding the tests, he said she did provide an ""alternative explanation"" for why they should be voided: Quality control issues, not its machines. Das testified he disagreed with that reasoning. Das also testified that Holmes presented an ""alternative explanation"" for why Theranos' device had detected a prostate-specific antigen in women even though women do not have prostates. When he raised the issue to her, she said it may have shown up in some women with breast cancer. Das said he found the explanation ""implausible.""In cross examination of Das, Holmes' defense attorney Lance Wade tried to position him as part of Holmes' effort to overhaul its clinical lab operations, focusing on the latitude that Holmes gave him to dig into and clean up issues. Through Das, Wade pointed the finger at past lab directors, and Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, Theranos' former COO and Holmes' ex-boyfriend who will face the same charges in a separate trial slated to begin next year. (Balwani has pleaded not guilty.) Das, Wade pointed out, reported to Holmes -- one of several structural changes meant to illustrate she was attempting to address problems.The prosecution poked holes in this framing in re-direct examination when Das testified he hadn't been made aware regulators conducted an audit when he interviewed with Holmes for the job, or in his initial weeks at Theranos.A frustrated investor takes the standIt was clear in email exchanges shown in court that Holmes grew to consider early investor Alan Eisenman a nuisance. Eisenman, a retired money manager who took the stand on Wednesday, said his family invested roughly $1.2 million in the company. About $1.1 million of that came in 2006, after he was introduced to Theranos by a friend who was a financial adviser to the Holmes family. ""He told me Elizabeth was brilliant,"" Eisenman said.He testified that Holmes was his source of information about the company. He said there were a number of factors that led to his decision to invest, including that Oracle's Larry Ellison was a board member and investor, that he was told the company had several contracts with major pharmaceutical companies, and revenue projections Holmes provided.For several years, he had quarterly calls with Holmes, but that stopped in mid-2010. Jurors learned that after Eisenman inquired via email about setting up their next call and asked for updated projections on the number of testing cartridges Theranos expected to sell (a metric Holmes had previously provided), the tension was palpable. He didn't get a reply and followed up. Holmes replied: ""June is a tough month for us and I don't know when we can do our next call. As you know, we don't do quarterly calls with our other investors, many of whom invested greater amounts than you did, and I cannot commit to an exact quarterly schedule going forward. As discussed in our call in March, we cannot provide the level of communication you keep requesting."" ""Given your frustration level and our frustration level with this interaction, I strongly encourage you to re-consider the opportunity to realize the return on your investment,"" she continued. Eisenman testified that while he was given the opportunity to exit then, he didn't. He sought information from Theranos' chairman of the board, Donald Lucas. The inquiry was forwarded to Holmes, who reprimanded Eisenman. ""We have communicated about this multiple times before yet you choose to continue going down this path,"" she wrote. Eisenman testified that this outreach on his part ""was not taken very kindly by Elizabeth.""Despite no direct interaction with Holmes thereafter, he received an email to stockholders in late 2013 that the company was raising a new round of financing to help scale to consumers and decided to invest again. Eisenman testified that he'd read a glowing Wall Street Journal opinion article, which has been repeatedly shown in the courtroom, and presumed that its technology was working. When he emailed that he wanted to have a call ahead of investing, despite years of failing to get the company to communicate, Balwani quickly replied and agreed to speak. Eisenman testified that he was shocked by the sudden change. However, the relationship took a turn for the worse again when Eisenman started asking for a business update and possibly exiting his investment. Eisenman is set to resume his testimony next week.High-profile trial hit by yet another delayThis week, a technology issue arose and further delayed the criminal trial by roughly two hours. The court's computer displays used to present exhibits for jurors failed to work Tuesday morning. The court temporarily addressed the problem by setting up a lamp on the witness stand, dimming the lights, and using a projector to display exhibits on a courtroom wall. Judge Edward Davila explained the setup and inquired whether anyone had trouble viewing the exhibits in this manner. One juror excused himself to claim his glasses. ""I'm very embarrassed that our courtroom has had these problems,"" the judge said. The displays were working as normal on Wednesday.Two weeks ago, court was canceled for a day after a water pipe burst near the courthouse, leaving it without water. The coronavirus, Holmes' pregnancy, and other juror issues have resulted in delays in the criminal case. Judge Davila has added court days in November, as well as stretched the number of hours the trial is in session on most days, to make up for lost time. ",0
1568,"“I NEVER ENVISIONED sending my children to a Catholic school. I have a good public school down the block from my house,” says Laura Camisa, mother of two girls aged five and seven. She and her family live in an expensive Brooklyn neighbourhood in a high-performing school district. Ms Camisa’s older daughter was in kindergarten when schools shut down in 2020 because of the pandemic. Remote learning was difficult for her daughter. Once happy and outgoing, she became withdrawn. “This is not working”, Ms Camisa remembers saying to herself. After hearing good things about St Joseph the Worker, a nearby Catholic school, she decided to send her children there.
The Camisas are one of thousands of families newly enrolled in Catholic schools. Falls in pupil numbers of a couple of percentage points a year had been the norm for years. The number had fallen from a peak in the early 1960s, when Catholic schools had 5.2m pupils, to around 1.6m last year, which meant a lot of empty desks. But this autumn dioceses all over the country are seeing increases in enrolments. The National Catholic Educational Association is still collecting and analysing the latest pupil data, but its preliminary numbers show increases in most dioceses.

The Brooklyn-Queens diocese in New York, one of the biggest in the country,  saw increases for the first time in a decade or more. Nearly 60% of its schools are growing, with many increasing by 10%. Partnership Schools, a network of Catholic schools in New York City and in Cleveland, saw a 16% increase. The diocese of Springfield, in Massachusetts, is up by 13%. Arlington’s diocese, which takes in the suburbs of Washington, DC, increased by 6%. The Archdiocese of Baltimore, the county’s oldest, saw a similar increase. Chicago’s archdiocese, which includes some suburbs, saw a 5% increase. Enrolment increased by nearly 4% in Catholic elementary schools in Philadelphia’s archdiocese.
Why are Catholic schools suddenly growing? Last autumn many public-school systems delayed reopening and did not offer full-time in-class learning. When Catholic schools reopened, most provided in-person learning. This appealed to families who struggled with remote learning—many of the new pupils are children whose parents cannot work from home. Most Catholic schools had plenty of space to socially distance: those empty classrooms came in very handy.
Families took note, including non-Catholics. In 1970 only 2.7% of the pupil population was non-Catholic. Last year it was one in five. In some dioceses it neared two in five. Kathleen Porter-Magee, superintendent of Partnership Schools, says the children in her Cleveland schools are nearly all non-Catholic: “We like to quote the late Cardinal Hickey of the Archdiocese of Washington who said, ‘We educate our communities, not because they are Catholic, but because we are’.”
Catholic superintendents and enrolment directors are giddy about the increase. Mary Pat Donoghue of America’s Conference of Catholic Bishops hopes it will stabilise the pupil population. Father Joe Corpora of the University of Notre Dame warns: “We’ll never get another chance like this again.” Some dioceses and schools are working on retention and marketing plans, a first for many.
Catholic schools are not cheap. Tuition averages $4,800 a year for elementary schools and high school costs more than $11,000. Historically, parishioners helped offset tuition costs with what they put in the offertory basket. But as fewer people went to church, that funding stream decreased. The many sexual-abuse scandals have also hurt enrolment. Charter schools, which share some of the attributes of Catholic ones (uniforms, discipline, community values) also drew prospective pupils away from Catholic schools. It is hard to compete with free.
Even so, many families are willing to pay. Ms Camisa and her husband have had to rejig their finances to afford tuition. “We moved [schools] because of the pandemic, but we stayed because of what we saw at St Joe’s.” When public schools restored in-person learning, she did not return. “We’ll probably stay Catholic the whole way to high school.” ■

1569,"SINCE HANDING over the reins as Microsoft’s chief executive in 2000, Bill Gates has been best-known for his philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest charities, has given billions of dollars to vaccination drives, family-planning clinics, research into drug treatments for malaria and more.
But Mr Gates has not abandoned the business world entirely. On June 2nd TerraPower, a company he founded in 2008, announced that it would build a demonstration of an exotic, high-tech nuclear power station in Wyoming. The firm’s Natrium reactor is one of a gaggle of new designs that have emerged in recent years, as engineers try to come up with cheaper, simpler nuclear power plants that can provide low-carbon electricity with fewer of the cost and safety worries that have plagued the industry in the past.

The Natrium reactor makes two big changes to the standard nuclear-power-plant design. It replaces the liquid water that normally courses through the core with hot, liquid sodium (natrium, in Latin). And instead of using the heat generated by the reactor to make electricity directly, it first employs it to heat a tank of molten salt that acts as a giant battery. The upshot, the firm hopes, will be a cheaper reactor that is better suited to power grids that will increasingly be dominated by intermittent sources of energy such as wind turbines and solar panels.
Start with the reactor itself. Most nuclear power plants are light-water reactors (LWRs), a technology developed in America in the 1950s. They use ordinary water both to cool the reactor core and to increase the intensity of the chain-reaction by moderating the speed of the neutrons that are emitted when uranium atoms split. Thus slowed, these neutrons are more likely to go on to split more atoms in turn.
Natrium employs hot, liquid sodium as a coolant, and dispenses with the moderator entirely. This is another idea that dates back to the 1950s, but one which has never been widely deployed. Yet sodium offers several advantages as a coolant, says Chris Levesque, TerraPower’s boss. The liquid sodium’s high temperature—around 500°C—makes the reactor more efficient. At the same time, liquid sodium is much less corrosive to pipes than hot water. And though the water in LWRs is pumped through at high pressure, Natrium is designed to operate at close to atmospheric pressure. That means pipes, containment buildings and the like can be less beefy without affecting safety. TerraPower reckons its reactor needs only 20% of the concrete required by an LWR of equivalent power, which helps keep down costs.
The firm’s second big idea is its molten-salt energy-storage system. Inspiration for this came from the solar-power industry, says Mr Levesque. Solar-thermal systems (in contradistinction to the more familiar photovoltaic ones that generate electricity directly) have, for several years, used similar tanks to store excess solar energy harvested during the day. In Natrium’s case, the sodium coolant transfers heat from the reactor into the molten-salt tanks. A separate set of pipes then removes heat from the tanks and uses it to produce electricity.
TerraPower hopes this arrangement will let the new reactor ramp its power output up and down, depending on the price of electricity. This is something that LWRs struggle to do. The firm’s demonstration plant will usually produce 345 megawatts (MW) of electrical power. But by releasing the energy stored in the molten-salt tanks, it will be able to boost that to 500MW for over five-and-a-half hours. This should be a useful trick as power grids fill up with wind and solar farms that are likely to cause power prices to fluctuate more than they do at present. Combined with lower construction costs, TerraPower hopes such agility will make its plant more economically attractive than older designs.
It all looks good on paper. But then, nuclear power always does. The industry has been plagued by delays and cost overruns for decades. Existing sodium-cooled reactors, most of which are experimental, have a spotty record. A plant in Japan suffered a serious fire in 1995 and was shut down for over a decade. The Superphénix reactor in France, built in 1974, proved extremely unreliable, and was offline for years at a time. It closed for good in 1998. (Other reactors, such as the Fast Flux Test Facility in Washington state, have better records.)

The Union of Concerned Scientists, an American not-for-profit organisation, argues in a report published in March that sodium’s advantages as a coolant are counterbalanced by drawbacks. One is that a reactor which ran too hot might see its power output rise as a consequence. Unlike water, the loss of which shuts a reactor down for lack of moderation, sodium slightly damps the chain-reaction. If bubbles of sodium vapour formed in the coolant, that damping effect would diminish, risking a dangerous feedback loop of rising temperatures and growing power output.
The physics of such judgments are tricky. Few countries have as much nuclear experience as France, which generates around 70% of its electricity that way. Yet in 2015 French regulators said they could not determine whether sodium-cooled reactors are significantly safer than modern LWRs. TerraPower, moreover, insists that its Natrium plant is designed in a way that makes runaway reactions impossible.
America’s government, for its part, thinks the technology has merit. It is chipping in $80m to help TerraPower build the demonstration plant, which the firm says should be ready by 2028. In the meantime, says Mr Levesque, TerraPower has been fielding inquiries from electricity firms interested in its technology. Whether Mr Gates’s bet on a nuclear-power revival will pay off remains to be seen. ■

1570,"SHOULD VIDEO websites have to review content before they publish it? Where does the boundary lie between hate speech and incitement to violence? Is pornography created by artificial intelligence an invasion of privacy? These are all hard questions, but behind them lies an even more difficult one: who should provide the answers?
On the internet, such dilemmas are increasingly being resolved by private firms. Social networks are deciding what kinds of misinformation to ban. Web-hosting companies are taking down sites they deem harmful. Now financial firms are more actively restricting what people can buy.

The digital gatekeepers are doing a mixed job. But it is becoming clear that it ought not to be their job at all. The trade-offs around what can be said, done and bought online urgently need the input of elected representatives. So far governments have been better at complaining than at taking responsibility.
For an example of how private firms have become the digital police, consider the rules on internet pornography being introduced by Mastercard on October 15th. In a bid to weed out illegal material, the card firm is demanding that porn sites take steps that go beyond what the law requires, including reviewing footage before publication and checking the identity of those who upload or feature in it. Sites that think these sorts of rules too onerous are under no obligation to work with Mastercard. But Visa is also cracking down, and the two firms handle 90% of card payments outside China, meaning that they are becoming the industry’s de facto regulators.
Liberals must strike a balance. Private firms should in general be free to deal with whom they like. Just as Facebook may legally ban people like Donald Trump from its network and Amazon Web Services can decline to host alt-right-friendly apps like Parler, Mastercard is free to drop particular porn sites. Yet the market power of these firms and their often like-minded rivals means that without their approval and support, individuals or businesses may face exclusion, even if they have broken no law. In edge-cases, private gatekeepers will err on the side of caution. What incentive is there for a social network to allow borderline hate-speech, or for a bank to deal with a legally tricky industry like cannabis?
The best remedy would be more competition, so that if Visa and Mastercard bar a porn site or Facebook cancels a controversial figure, consumers have alternatives. That will not happen soon: network effects are powerful in social media and crushing in the payments business.
In the meantime, private companies that find themselves acting as gatekeepers should be transparent about their rules, how they make them and what redress they offer. Under public pressure, social networks have taken steps in this direction. Facebook sends difficult decisions to an independent “oversight board”; Twitter this week published a set of principles for regulating online speech. Financial institutions are more opaque. Mastercard explained its new rules in a blog post. When OnlyFans, a site known for sexually explicit content, blamed banks for forcing a change in its content policy earlier this year, the banks in question made no comment.
Yet the bigger responsibility lies with governments. They are right to be wary of constraining speech. In much of the world leaders are only too ready to muzzle online debate. But carefully laying out a method for drawing lines around free expression and building in safeguards would help clarify where despots have overstepped the boundary.
What is more, in many areas the gatekeeping power wielded by private firms is really a consequence of government inaction. Keeping revenge-porn off the web or limiting children’s access to viral content are areas where governments could act if they wanted to. Instead, the approach of many has been to do nothing and then feign shock when profit-maximising companies come up with answers that may not be in the interest of society.
Politicians are right to warn that some private companies have too much power online. But those firms have ended up with so much responsibility partly because politicians themselves have abdicated it. ■",2
1571,"AS GOVERNMENTS SPEND more, it becomes increasingly important that they design their taxes carefully. Large European welfare states such as Sweden or Germany rely on growth-friendly value-added taxes (VATs) to help raise the vast quantities of cash they dole out. America can get away with a tax system that is grossly inefficient and needlessly complex only because the amount of revenue it raises overall is relatively small.
Small, but growing. Democrats in the House of Representatives are working out how to pay for President Joe Biden’s proposed social-spending bill, under which America would take a step in the direction of Europe with cash handouts for parents, child-care subsidies, green investment and more money for health care. The bill will probably be watered down in the Senate, but its present size is $3.5trn (1.2% of projected GDP) over the next decade. To help pay for it, lawmakers are proposing the biggest rise in taxes since 1993.

The plan does little to move towards the efficient taxation that would be necessary were America ever to have the European-style welfare state to which many Democrats aspire. That is because the proposals have been crafted with the goal of raising taxes only on households with incomes in excess of $400,000. The left thinks the rich do not pay their fair share. They would like to raise the top rate of federal income tax from 37% to 39.6%, and introduce a new 3% levy on earnings over $5m. They also want to raise the rate of federal tax on corporate profits in excess of $5m, from 21% to 26.5% (glossing over the fact that wages will fall at least a bit as a result). The plan would raise the rate of capital-gains tax and introduce various new levies.
The federal government has some scope to raise more money from high earners. But the idea that the main problem with the existing system that tax rates are too flat is wrong. In 2018 the lowest fifth of earners on average paid no net federal taxes at all. The top 1% paid a total rate (ie, after all deductions) of 30%, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Include state and local levies, and high earners face a marginal tax rate on each extra dollar they take home—the rate that matters for work incentives—which is middling by rich-country standards. Tax refunds for poor families are exceptionally generous. In 2019 a single parent of two children earning two-thirds of average pay faced total net labour taxes of only 10%, according to analysis by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. In egalitarian Sweden the rate was nearly 33%.

Inefficiency is a bigger problem in America than the failure of rates to be sufficiently progressive. Myriad deductions allow the very rich to disguise labour income as lightly taxed capital income. And unwillingness to levy a VAT, which is a tax on consumption, means America relies on taxes that deter work and investment. America is one of only three rich countries to collect more than 70% of its tax revenue from labour income and corporate profits. Sales taxes, levied by states and localities, are the only significant taxes on consumption.
The plan does far too little to boost efficiency. On the upside it would curtail the carried-interest loophole which lets investment managers class their fees as capital gains not income. It would reduce tax evasion by increasing enforcement, such as through audits of the tax-returns of high-earners, which more than pays for itself. And it would try to get more money from “pass through” companies, shells which let many professionals treat their income as business profits, incurring a lower tax rate.
Yet much is wrong with the Democrats’ plans. They appear to have forgone closing one of the most costly loopholes, which writes off capital gains when assets are inherited. The rise in corporation tax would take the total rate, including average state and local levies, to 31%, the third-highest among rich countries. In the House they seem uninterested in a carbon tax to combat climate change. And although it is not yet in the plan, they are talking about lifting the cap on an exemption, from federally taxable income, of money used to pay state and local taxes. The cap was introduced in 2017 under Donald Trump. Lifting it would further subsidise high-tax states and almost exclusively benefit the rich. Democrats would be raising top income-tax rates while narrowing the tax base—the opposite of good tax policy.
America’s economy would survive these proposals. But its creaky and cumbersome tax code should not be asked to support the size of government that many Democrats want in the long term, which includes, say, government-funded universal health care. Republicans know this is implausible. They typically oppose VAT because they see it as too convenient a source of funds. Democrats dislike the tax because it is mildly regressive. But there is a reason VATs underpin European-style welfare states: there is no desirable alternative. ■

1572,"IT HAS BEEN 11 months since anyone hugged Larry. The 62-year-old accountant lives alone in Chicago, which went into lockdown last March in response to covid-19. He has heart problems so he has stayed at home since then. The only people to touch him have been latex-sheathed nurses taking his blood pressure. Larry describes himself as a “touchy-feely” person. Sex is nice, but more than that he longs for casual platonic contact: hugs and handshakes. He lies in bed, he says, yearning to have someone to hold or to hold him.
The pandemic has been an exercise in subtraction. There are the voids left by loved ones who have succumbed to covid-19, the gaps where jobs and school used to be, and the absence of friends and family. And then there are the smaller things that are missing. To stop the spread of covid-19 people have forsaken the handshakes, pats, squeezes and strokes that warm daily interactions. The loss of any one hardly seems worthy of note.

And yet touch is as necessary to human survival as food and water, says Tiffany Field, director of the Touch Research Institute at the Miller School of Medicine, part of the University of Miami. It is the first sense to develop and the only one necessary for survival. We can live with the loss of sight or hearing. But without touch, which enables us to detect such stimuli as pressure, temperature and texture, we would be unable to walk or feel pain. Our skin is the vehicle through which we navigate the world.
Certain groups have long been starved of touch. For centuries lepers were deemed untouchable. Dalits, the lowest caste in India, were literally known as such. Solitary confinement is used as a punishment in prisons. In a film made before his death in 2015 Peter Collins, a Canadian convict locked up alone, said he craved so intensely the touch of another human that he pretended the flies walking on his skin were his wife’s fingers. But not until the pandemic, with its widespread social distancing, have such vast swathes of the population been deprived of friendly physical contact for so long.
Humans need touch to form close relationships. To improve its chances of survival, Homo sapiens evolved to live in groups. Humans “need to interact with each other”, explains Alberto Gallace, a psychobiologist at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which may explain why, like other social animals, they have developed a neurological system designed to respond to affectionate touch. Stimuli applied to the skin at a certain pressure and speed—“basically a caress”, says Dr Gallace—activate a dedicated nerve fibre in the skin. Stimulating this fibre lights up parts of the brain responsible for pleasure, releasing a cocktail of hormones, including dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin, that soothe anxiety and make us feel happier.
The importance of touch starts early. A review of scientific literature conducted in 2016 found that babies who had skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately after birth were 32% more likely to breastfeed successfully on their first attempt than those who did not. Several hours later, they also had better heart and lung function and higher blood-sugar levels. In one study in 1986 in America premature babies who were given regular massages for ten days shortly after they were born gained weight more quickly and left intensive care sooner than premature babies who were not. Their physical and cognitive development was also better than the control group in tests a year later.
The positive health effects continue. Touch depresses levels of cortisol, a hormone produced in response to stress. In addition to triggering the “flight or fight” response, cortisol smothers “natural killer cells”, a type of white blood cell that attacks viruses and bacteria. Touch can also increase the production of natural killer cells in patients with HIV and cancer, according to Dr Field. In 2014 researchers at Carnegie Mellon University observed that healthy adults who were hugged more frequently were less likely to get colds, perhaps because such embraces are a way of communicating affection, and people who feel cared for are less likely to fall ill.
A lack of touch, by contrast, is damaging. After controlling for factors such as poverty and quality of medical care, studies of infants show that the absence of touch leads to a broad range of developmental problems, argues David J. Linden, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, in a book called “Touch”. Children who are not cuddled tend to develop certain cognitive skills later than their peers. A lack of touch may fuel aggression. In 2002 Dr Field observed that compared with French adolescents, children in America received less affectionate physical contact and were more combative. But those who received daily massages became less aggressive after five days.
Without regular contact people can become “skin hungry”, a state in which they experience less touch than they want. The few studies that have been done into skin hunger suggest it is harmful. A survey of 509 adults from around the world in 2014 suggested that being deprived of touch was linked to loneliness, depression, stress, mood and anxiety disorders and secondary immune disorders.
The pandemic supercharged that. In a poll of 260 Americans who had been under lockdown for a month last April, conducted by Dr Field, 60% said that they longed for physical contact. The impact may be particularly acute in places where people are normally more tactile. In southern Italy “keeping your distance from someone is almost offensive”, says Luca Vullo, the author of a book on Italians’ non-verbal communication. And yet even Italians have surprised themselves with the level of their compliance with social-distancing measures. Most wear masks and keep their distance in queues (although when restrictions have been eased, many have found it harder to maintain, especially in restaurants, and particularly after a glass or two of wine). In Brazil, however, Claudia Matarazzo, an etiquette coach who wrote a guide in mid-2020 on how to limit physical contact without being rude, has given up trying to convince her compatriots to swap kisses for elbow bumps. Her efforts have not been helped by the president, Jair Bolsonaro, who regularly hugs and shakes hands with supporters. He failed to keep his distance even when he had covid-19.
By contrast, people from more reserved countries may hardly notice they are receiving less physical contact. Leonard Lim, a Singaporean tech worker, has not met anyone in the flesh, except for his wife, with whom he lives, and their parents, since last February. It did not occur to him that he had received less physical human contact over the past year until asked whether he had noticed its absence.
The sense of touch is easily overlooked. Its flashier cousins, vision and hearing, have entire art forms dedicated to them while chefs and perfumers serve our taste buds and nostrils. Scientists neglect it. For every research paper on touch, there are 100 on sight. In the 19th century European intellectuals dismissed touch as “a crude and uncivilised mode of perception”, inferior to sight, according to Constance Classen, a cultural historian. In Anglophone countries, the Victorian horror of the body gave popular ballast to this bias. Strictures against touch persisted in those countries into the next century. In the 1960s Sidney Jourard, a psychologist at the University of Florida, observed the behaviour of couples in coffee shops around the world. Over the course of an hour couples in Paris and Puerto Rico touched each other 110 and 180 times respectively. Their counterparts in Florida touched each other just twice. Those in London avoided any contact at all.
Out of touch
People in such countries are more demonstrative today. But Dr Field argues that many Americans were suffering from skin hunger before the pandemic. Among those surveyed by Dr Field in April only a fifth said that they touched their children frequently. Outside the home, tactile interaction has effectively been outlawed in many places. Many American states have banned teachers from touching their students. A lot of schools have similar policies. The MeToo movement means physical contact is rare in offices. And in recent decades the number of people living alone has shot up in many rich countries. So too has the time spent online. Virtual spaces bring users together but these connections are forged in an immaterial dimension. Screens are portals to digital worlds that require us to leave our bodies behind. Richard Kearney, a professor of philosophy at Boston College, calls this process “excarnation” and argues that it is fuelling a “crisis of touch”.

Some were trying to mend this before the pandemic. In Japan Deguchi Noriko, the founder of the Japan Touch Counselling Association, instructs new mothers, nurses and nursery teachers in the art of what she calls “skinship”, the act of “deepening our bond and trust with others” through clasping hands, hugging and stroking. In America urbanites were congregating at “cuddle parties”, hopeful that draping themselves over strangers would banish their loneliness.
In 2015 Madelon Guinazzo and Adam Lippin founded Cuddlist, a company which trains “cuddle therapists”. They suspected that many people longed for “platonic, mutual, consensual touch that’s purely about affection”, says Ms Guinazzo. That need was not being met, she argues, because of the “hypersexualisation” of touch in America. Their company has put therapists in contact with 50,000 clients around the world. They tend to be people experiencing too little touch or the unwelcome kind. Larry, the accountant from Chicago, began seeing Ms Guinazzo three years ago. He was uncomfortable with the idea of paying for hugs but his desire for contact exceeded the brief embraces he received from friends. He was surprised to find that the shoulder rubs, hugs and hand-holding brought him comfort and “a sense of joy”.
At present Larry can only meet Ms Guinazzo online. They evoke the sensation of touch through words and their imaginations—or try to. Zoom cuddles are not as potent as those in the flesh, says Larry. But in the age of distance, the skin-hungry must make do with what they can. Between February 10th and 13th 2020 sales of massage chairs in China were 436% higher than in the same period in 2019, according to Suning.com, a big retailer. Others are turning to technology to simulate caresses. CuteCircuit weaves haptic sensors into shirts which, it claims, can transmit the sensation of a hug using Bluetooth technology to corresponding shirts. Between April and December, traffic to its online shop surged by 238%. The pandemic has made many more people aware of their craving for touch, says Ms Guinazzo. Her business has suffered, but once covid-19 ebbs she expects demand to surge. People need to touch people, not just screens. ■

1573,"IN MANY PLACES where seaweed used to thrive, often growing in vast “forests”, it is disappearing. The cause is global warming, which, by heating the ocean’s upper layer, reduces its density through thermal expansion—thus making it more buoyant. That extra buoyancy means it is less likely to mix with cooler, denser and more nutrient-rich waters below. This is bad for the marine environment in general. More specifically, it is bad for commercial seaweed farming, a business with revenues of (depending on whom you ask) between $6bn and $40bn a year.
The algae involved, particularly kelp, are popular in Asian cuisine. They are also used as fertiliser, and are processed into carrageenan, a natural binder and emulsifier employed in foods, cosmetics and drugs. Most are grown either on the seabed or on ropes attached to it (see picture above). But some are cultivated on small floating platforms.

To counter the effects of surface heating, which are particularly pronounced in the tropics, researchers are trying to improve the floating-platform approach by assisting the upwelling of cooler waters to stimulate algal growth on such platforms. This would also increase the area available for seaweed farms, by allowing them to be located well away from coastlines. An experimental floating farm installed in August, off the coast of the Philippines, by a group led by the Climate Foundation, an American charity, is one of the largest attempts so far to do this.
Pictures of a floating world
Artificial stimulation of upwelling is not a new idea. It has been touted for years as a way to regenerate kelp forests, in particular. And for good reason. With enough nutrients, fronds of giant kelp, which grow to an average length of about 30 metres, can elongate by more than 50cm a day. Only now, however, is upwelling-stimulation being attempted seriously.
The foundation’s test platform has an area of 100 square metres. It employs solar-powered turbines to suck water up from a depth of several hundred metres through flexible, cylindrical pipes. The foundation plans to experiment with wind-powered and wave-powered turbines, too.

If this works, which early results suggest it does, and can be scaled up, not only could such technology boost seaweed production, it might also help ecosystems that depend on seaweed forests. And—at least in theory—if part of the harvest were sacrificed by sinking it into the deep ocean, that might act as a novel form of carbon capture and storage which could help slow the warming that caused the problem in the first place.
According to Brian von Herzen, who runs the foundation, the organisation carried out smaller-scale experiments, using similar technology, in 2020. These showed that seaweed grows four times faster on platforms irrigated with upwelled water than on equivalent, unirrigated platforms. Moreover, it continues to grow during the warmest months of the year, when seaweed not so irrigated actually shrinks.
Dr von Herzen and his colleagues hope to use experience gathered from their latest rig to develop a platform that would cover an entire hectare of the ocean’s surface—100 times the area of the one just launched. To that end, they are collaborating with the Marine Bioproducts Cooperative Research Centre, a public-private partnership in Australia. At this scale, the partners estimate, a seaweed farm could pay for itself within five years.
Moreover, seaweed farms bring benefits beyond the immediate value of their crop. Seaweed is a habitat for many marine creatures, including fish. Some of these can be harvested for food. Indeed, for artificial upwelling to bring about that desirable state of affairs it may not even be necessary to farm seaweed. Ocean artUp, a project led by the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany, is experimenting with the use of upwelling to encourage the growth of the small, planktonic creatures eaten by sardines.
That could help restore stocks of these fish, which are shrinking rapidly in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Ocean artUp, which began in 2017 and is scheduled to run until the end of this year, has concentrated on simulating and measuring exactly how artificial upwelling affects the quantities of nutrients transferred between ocean layers. One thing the project’s researchers have discovered is that if you pump too hard, some of the upwelled water simply drops back into the depths, without mixing properly. Stirring the ocean in this way may thus require the design of floating water-mixers, too, to keep the nutrients at the surface.
Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Otherlab, an independent research laboratory, is working on an underwater robot intended to screw large tethers firmly into the seabed, to ensure that floating seaweed farms stay put, and can better survive stormy weather. Otherlab is part of a consortium paid for by ARPA-e, an American-government agency that is exploring the idea of using seaweed as a source of biofuel.
Those squeamish about anything that smacks of geoengineering—in other words, technology intended to change the world’s climate in ways that oppose global warming—view artificial upwelling with scepticism. They argue that it could damage other parts of ocean ecosystems, and might even create unwanted side-effects that end up accelerating climate change rather than slowing it. Proponents, conversely, see these early efforts, at least, as simply restoring upwelling that has been suppressed by climate change.
Stratified, not stirred
A study published last year in Nature Climate Change, by a team of researchers from America and China, suggested that the overall stratification of the world’s oceans has increased by 5% since 1960, with up to 20% more stratification in the tropics. This is despite any countervailing effect of the more extreme weather that global warming brings, which leads to greater churning of the oceans. Any such churning is overwhelmed by the extra buoyancy of the warmer surface layers.
Cooling the ocean surface by encouraging upwelling might also have a direct effect on the local air temperature. Warmer surface waters keep the atmosphere above warmer, too. Cooler waters do the reverse. But the technology would have to be deployed on a vast scale—over millions of hectares of the ocean’s surface—before it had a noticeable effect on the atmosphere.
As Dr von Herzen, who does not advocate geoengineering, points out, any such plans would face more than just economic barriers. The London Protocol, an international legal framework that regulates marine pollution, sets stringent limits on deliberate geoengineering of the oceans. The protocol does, however, tolerate justifiable commercial exploitation, along with some carbon capture.
If large-scale seaweed farming were, nevertheless, to be considered for geoengineering, there would be a certain irony in that fact. To do this would mean dumping the algae thus grown on the ocean floor, to stop the carbon in them returning to the atmosphere. That would probably work in the short term. But it was just such a process of sedimentation of organic matter which, over millions of years, produced modern-day petroleum fields. And it is their oil, furiously pumped up for over a century, that has generated much of the excess of greenhouse gases of which the world is now trying to rid itself. ■

An early version of this article was published online on September 29th 2021",2
1574,"Candace Bushnell walks into the Carlyle Hotel in New York, an uptown vision in a pink cashmere dress and Dolce & Gabbana coat.
On her feet are a pair of divine Manolo Blahnik slingbacks and, frankly, anything less would have been a disappointment.
She sits down, crosses her fabulous legs and orders a cappuccino.
‘I feel like celebrating,’ she says. ‘Last night I didn’t forget a single line.’
At the age of 62, Candace has taken the bold step of starring as a version of herself in a one-woman show which has just opened off-Broadway and comes to London next year.
Is There Still Sex In The City? is adapted from her memoir of the same name and traces her life from well-to-do Connecticut childhood to her cosmo-drinking, party girl heyday, then through her marriage, divorce, the menopause and beyond.
It is funny, poignant and inspiring, all of it delivered by Candace standing atop various pairs of five-inch heels on a stage set furnished with her own pink satin sofa from her Upper East Side apartment, her own carpet and even her own poodles, Pepper and Prancer, who bound on at the end.
If the message here is that her dogs have made her happier than any man ever did, it is one she delivers without rancour or regret.
‘Actually, being a writer has meant more to me than any man could, unfortunately that is true. Writing is the one thing I have that I can totally rely on,’ she says. ‘One of the reasons why a lot of relationships did not work out for me was a lack of respect from the man towards my work. Totally. And I just I can’t do that.
‘Out in the world, women get a lack of respect, but in the home I need a cheerleader. And a lot of guys are not that because there can only be one star in a relationship. And it’s going to be them.’
Bushnell broke out in the mid 1990s as a sex and relationship columnist for The New York Observer. Back then, she didn’t want her parents to be embarrassed by her frank scrutiny of modern sexual manners in her Sex And The City columns, so she invented a character called Carrie Bradshaw, a chic cipher for Bushnell herself.
Even now, an unexpected strain of good girl conservatism informs her opinions, an unusual trait in a celebrated former sexpert. She loathes porn (‘don’t get me started’) and even raises one of her perfect eyebrows at some of the more exuberant passages in E. L. James’ mummyporn bestseller, Fifty Shades Of Grey.
‘Look. I don’t want to say anything negative about the writer. If you can write a book and make millions of dollars, that’s fantastic. Great for you because you know, it’s hard. But I started reading one of the books. And in the first paragraph the guy puts a turnip or something up . . . And I was like, I can’t. I just can’t bear what I have been reading.’
In the velvety plush of the Carlyle’s breakfast parlour, coffee cups are stilled and an enthralled hush descends. ‘Porn has changed sex,’ she continues in her clear, steady voice. ‘I mean, nobody talks about women having orgasms any more.
‘In the early 1980s, the Big O was like a new discovery. And men worked really hard at giving women orgasms. It felt like there was a pride among men; ‘‘I’m going to please my partner.’’ Now you never hear that. Now it’s all, I’m going to please myself.’
Yes well, um, would you like a croissant or something?
‘Now it’s all, I’m going to demand that my partner does things that I see in porn, like anal sex or choking.’
Perhaps some toast?
‘Jan, it is all about the man’s pleasure, not the woman’s. You go on a date and it’s transactional; a lot of guys just want their wiener waxed. I don’t want to get into a whole thing about porn, but I am not a fan.
‘It makes the 1990’s look like an age of innocence, it really does. For a start, there was no social media or cell phones back then, so if you wanted to have sex with someone, you had to do it in person, right?’
Damn right.
In the hit HBO TV series, which ran for six seasons and was made into two Hollywood films, the Carrie/Candace character was played by Sarah Jessica Parker. A lover of beautiful shoes and unsuitable men, Carrie became a feminist and fashion icon for generations of young women who adored her, despite her flaws.
Now she is back to stalk the streets of Manhattan once more in And Just Like That . . ., the rebooted HBO series which starts next month.
The new show finds Carrie reunited with gal-pals Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), although Kim Cattrall will not be returning as sexpot Samantha.
Did she make the wisest decision of all, one wonders?
For nearly three decades later, the landscape of these characters’ lives must have changed completely, along with their physical appearances on and off screen.
Before the show has even been broadcast, the participating actresses have been criticised for daring to age — it’s just so pathetic, but there you go.
Sarah Jessica Parker, now 56, has called comments about her grey hair ‘misogynist chatter’, while Davis (also 56) has been the target of uncharitable comments about plastic surgery treatments. Nixon (55) is also being targeted by trolls.
‘There are people who feel that women over 50 really shouldn’t even be seen in public,’ sighs Candace, whose own hair is a buttery whip of glamorous blonde and whose toned body bears testament to regular Pilates workouts and a 16,000 steps a day dog walking habit.
Despite this, she can still be as vulnerable as the next woman when it comes to the indignities of the ageing process. She once spent £3,000 on face creams after a saleswoman told her she had ‘too much filler in the cheeks’. She has also suffered the double mortification of not one but two boyfriends offering to pay for her to have a boob job.
‘I’m so flat-chested that one boyfriend’s mother used to call me ‘‘The Ironing Board’’,’ she says. ‘Anyway, there are people out there who are envious, people who just want to put someone down to make themselves feel better. Young men in particular have very rigid ideas about what women should and should not be.’
Of course, the truth is that although they are forever twinned in the collective imagination, Candace’s life diverged from Carrie’s many years ago.
After Sex And The City was adapted for the TV series in 1998, Bushnell had nothing more to do with the shows nor the films nor the lucrative revenue streams that followed.
‘As the show has grown it gets farther and farther away from the source material. I mean, there are fans out there who don’t even know it was originally based on a book,’ she says. ‘Did I earn my fair share from it? I often wonder.
Women in the entertainment industry never do as well as the men. I was cut out of certain deals. And I really shouldn’t talk about it because one’s got to be grateful. Yeah. As a woman back then you were told to be grateful for whatever you got.’
She appears not to be embittered by any of this, not even by the universally panned second film, and not her characters’ tendency to indulge in what one critic called ‘featherbrained feminism’.
‘No, the film wasn’t great, but people did their best,’ she says. ‘And as for everything else, I let that all go a long time ago. I don’t even know what a “Carrie” is any more. I just keep moving forward, trying to explore my own creativity.’
She has written ten books, married and divorced ballet dancer Charles Askegard (he had an affair with a younger dancer, Candace named her in the divorce papers) and now lives in contented singledom, mostly in her house in Sag Harbour in the Hamptons.
A recent relationship with a millionaire property developer called Jim Coleman has evolved to ‘just good friends’.
‘These things happen. And anyway, he moved to Palm Beach,’ she says.
Much of this is chronicled in her warts and all stage show, charting the highs and lows of her remarkable life.
‘There I am, 48 years old, my hair falls out, my vagina dries up and I am exhausted,’ she says at one point, cocktail glass in hand, telling it like it is, or was.
On stage she also reveals for the first time that she became pregnant when she was dating ‘a count from Luxembourg’ sometime in the 1980s, but decided to have an abortion.
‘Yes, I did,’ she tells me. ‘And if I had the baby, Sex And The City would not exist. That’s something that people need to understand.
‘Lots of women make this choice because it’s just not the right time. It wasn’t the right time for me to have a child and he wasn’t the right person, he was very unstable.
‘I don’t regret it and I don’t think there is any shame attached to having a termination. To me, bringing a child into the world under the wrong circumstances is what is morally wrong.’
Her stage show is set out in a series of life lessons, which include Men Lie About Everything; When It Comes To Sex There Is No Free Lunch; and perhaps the most important one of all; Your Girlfriends Are Forever.
After the turbulence and hurly-burly of the dating game, Bushnell seems to have happily settled down into a Hamptons existence shared with her dogs and her single girlfriends; a period of her life she calls The Bonus Years.
‘There is so much fun and joy being with a bunch of single women again, all supporting each other, being there for each other. The reality for women is there is a big chance you are going to be single at some point in your life. Statistically, it’s going to happen. And it is something that women need to know how to do; you need to know how to be in a relationship and also know how not to be in a relationship.’
Bushnell is slender with a porcelain doll face, but she shimmers with the strength of a survivor, a woman who has persisted.
As a young girl at acting school, she had to learn how to deal with ‘creepy’ behaviour.
‘At auditions or photoshoots, men would tell me to take my clothes off. I always refused.’
As an older woman, she had to negotiate the privations of the menopause. ‘It’s a big psychological moment for all women, because we’re always told that our worth is based on an ability to have children, then suddenly that is gone, it’s a tool no longer in our toolbox.
‘Some women don’t really have anything else to fall back on. I had a moment of ‘‘Oh my God, this is happening to me’’. It lasted for an hour or so, then I got over it.’
Despite being ‘as horny as hell when I was 18’ she doesn’t miss the sex, not at the moment anyway.
‘Oh God, I don’t really want to talk about my sex life. I honestly don’t. Once you get over a certain age, people don’t want to hear specifics. Anyway, right now I feel like I don’t really have time to pursue a big sexual relationship.
‘I don’t want to be with some twentysomething guy just for sex. I’m too old to have sex just for sex, and that was never me anyway.
‘If I have sex it’s got to be a cool thing. There’s got to be conversation, he’s got to be interesting, there has to be a continued form of communication. That is what I want. I want to have the best sex.
‘But then there is the possibility of emotional disappointment. You know, if I had sex tomorrow with someone and they didn’t call me the next day, I’m probably still going to feel be a little upset. And that is not a good look when you’re 62 going on 63,’ she says, and roars with laughter.
Candace is a card, she really is. You might think that Sex And The City has changed her life and made her fabulously rich, but it hasn’t, not really.
She still lives in a tiny apartment in New York, not far from the tiny apartment she had when she was writing her columns all those years ago. Yes, she says, she bought the house in the Hamptons but one that was ‘on the market for two years because nobody wanted it’.
However, she is not pleading poverty, she still drinks cosmopolitans and she still loves shoes.
‘Last week I bought a new pair of Manolos. I think they were $900. But they are a costume, right? I need them for the show.’
How many new pairs has she bought? ‘Only four,’ she says unabashed.
Nearly 30 years ago, Candace Bushnell entranced millions of women with her buccaneering adventures, her independent spirit and her unshakeable belief that good shoes will bring you good luck. Today, she must sometimes wonder what all that boy-crazy fuss was about. Her life has been no fairy tale, her Prince Charming is still noticeable by his absence, but thrillingly, she still has faith in the power of shoes.
‘If you believe they will bring you luck, then they will,’ she says, wiggling her own Manolos. ‘All you have to remember is that this is not a Cinderella story. It is the opposite of Cinderella. It is not sitting at home waiting for life to happen, saying ‘‘Oh, I lost my shoe and somebody needs to find me’’.
‘It is about putting on your shoes and going out there and finding that life for yourself.’",-2
1575,"BANANAS, APPLES and avocados continue to ripen after they are picked. Cherries, blackberries and grapes do not. The difference between climacteric fruits (the former) and non-climacteric fruits (the latter) matters to fruit growers and greengrocers, who must make sure their wares are in tip-top condition when they arrive at the marketplace. But how those differences originally came about remains unclear.
In a paper in Biology Letters, Fukano Yuya and Tachiki Yuuya of the University of Tokyo proffer a suggestion. Fruits, they observe, exist to solve a problem faced by all plants—how best to spread their progeny around. Wrapping their seeds in a sugary pulp, to provide a tasty meal, serves as a way to get animals to do this for them. They do, however, need to make sure that their fruits favour the animals most likely to do the distributing. Dr Fukano and Dr Tachiki propose that climacterism, or its absence, is a way to achieve this. If ground-dwelling animals are the main distributors, then the continuing ripening of fallen fruit (ie, climacterism) is beneficial. If, by contrast, those distributors are arboreal or aerial, and so can feed on unfallen fruit, then non-climacteric fruits will do well.

To test their idea, the two researchers combed through 276 papers reporting on 80 sorts of fruit, and noted which animals each depended on for its propagation. Thirty-five of these fruits, they discovered, were eaten by both ground-dwelling animals and arboreal and aerial ones. But of those where one group or the other were the predominant consumers, 15 of the 19 eaten principally by ground dwellers were climacteric, while 21 of the 26 fed on by arboreal or aerial animals were non-climacteric.
That is a suggestively strong correlation. And the authors’ hypothesis is fortified by other evidence. They point out that non-climacteric fruits tend to have vivid colours, especially reds and purples. This may help them stand out amid the foliage of their parent plants, advertising their presence. Climacteric fruits are generally better camouflaged. That makes them harder to spot until they have fallen to the ground.
The main limitation of their work, say Dr Fukano and Dr Tachiki, is that most of the papers they looked at concerned fruits eaten by people. This has probably contaminated the sample, for thousands of years of selective breeding for traits that human beings find appealing may have blurred any signal optimised by natural selection. The next step, therefore, should probably be to confine the analysis to wild fruits.",2
1576,"IN 1972 PIERRE TRUDEAU, Canada’s Liberal prime minister, lost his parliamentary majority in an election and found himself in charge of a minority government. Two years later he went to the country again, regained his majority and remained in office (with a brief interruption) for another decade. His son Justin (pictured), Canada’s prime minister since 2015, now hopes for a similar triumph. On August 15th he called a snap election, to be held on September 20th, with the aim of regaining the Liberal majority he lost nearly two years ago. He may hope to exceed his father’s 15 years in office. After 17 months of pandemic, he said when he asked the governor-general to dissolve Parliament, “we're all wondering what the next 17 months, not to mention the next 17 years, will hold.”
Mr Trudeau has reasons to be confident. Half of Canadians think his government has handled the pandemic well; less than a quarter think it has done badly. After a faltering start the country is among the leaders in administering vaccines: more than 70% of people aged 12 and older are fully inoculated. The IMF expects the economy to grow by 6.3% this year, well above the rich-country average of 5.6%. Mr Trudeau’s main rival for the prime ministership is Erin O’Toole, the leader of the Conservative Party, who is new to the job and has made little impression on voters.

Yet Mr Trudeau is taking a risk. And it is not certain that success—should he secure it—would be as much of a boon for the country as it would be for the Liberal Party.
The prime minister insists that the stakes are high. Canada stands at a “pivotal” moment, “maybe the most important since 1945”, he declares. But it is hard to see why. Mr Trudeau’s lack of a parliamentary majority has little constrained his ability to govern. He has needed the support of just one of the other main parties—if not the Conservatives then the left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) or the separatist Bloc Québécois—to enact his programme.
Most of the time he has got it. His government had cross-party support for pandemic aid to households and businesses worth nearly 20% of GDP. The NDP voted in April for his budget, which proposes high levels of spending (but promises a gradual decline in the deficit). Among its pledges is making child care available to families for C$10 ($8) a day within five years. In June Parliament enshrined in law the goal of reducing Canada’s net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050.
If re-elected, Mr Trudeau promises more aid to cope with the effects of the pandemic, for example by offering subsidies for the wage and rent bills of tourism businesses. He says he would continue to “build back better” and greener. But he could probably find the votes to do that in the current Parliament.
The main reason for holding an election now, rather than waiting until the end of the parliamentary term in 2023, is probably that a later contest would be harder for the Liberals to win. Canadians might tire of their scandal-prone government, which would then be entering its ninth year in office. The political immunity conferred by the vaccine will have worn off. Mr O’Toole will be better known, and perhaps more appealing to voters. Better to act now, Mr Trudeau may reckon.
His opening gambit has been to put the Conservatives on the defensive for their lack of enthusiasm about vaccinations. The Liberals want to make the jab mandatory for federal workers and passengers on trains and aeroplanes. When calling the election Mr Trudeau chided a Conservative MP for calling such mandates “tyrannical”. Mr O’Toole, whose supporters include anti-vaxxers, prefers frequent testing.
A record-setting heatwave this summer in British Columbia, a western province, also plays into Mr Trudeau’s hands. His most important climate policy has been to set a national floor for the price of carbon. The government intends to raise this from C$40 a tonne to C$170 by 2030. The Conservatives oppose the plan. That may be Mr Trudeau’s most convincing argument for delaying their return to power.
But being green and pro-vaccine is no guarantee of victory. In an election on August 17th Nova Scotia’s Progressive Conservative party defeated the Liberals, who had governed the province since 2013, because voters were angry about failures in health care, such as long waits for ambulances and doctors’ appointments. That may not be an omen: the Progressive Conservatives are not the same party as Mr O’Toole’s.
Perhaps a bigger worry for Mr Trudeau is the Conservatives’ perceived weakness. Few left-leaning voters, who are a majority, fear that the Conservatives will win. That will tempt them to vote for parties to the left of the Liberals, especially the NDP, which has the support of around 20% of the electorate. If that rises to 23%, “it’s an entirely different election,” says Darrell Bricker of Ipsos Public Affairs, a pollster.
Another risk for the Liberals is low turnout. A fourth wave of covid-19, now gathering strength, the complexity of voting by post and doubts that the election is as pivotal as Mr Trudeau says will discourage lukewarm Liberal supporters more than backers of the other parties. The latter are eager for change. “For pollsters this is going to be an incredibly difficult campaign,” says Mr Bricker.
The main risk is not that the Conservatives will beat the Liberals, but that Mr Trudeau will govern from a weaker position than he does currently. It is possible that in the new Parliament the Liberals will need the support of two parties rather than just one to enact legislation. According to 338 Canada, a politics website, gives the Liberals a 85% chance of winning the most seats, but just a 32% chance of winning an outright majority. Even so, Mr Trudeau seems to like those odds. ■",2
1577,"DENIZE XAVIER DE CARVALHO, a 40-year-old single mother, scoops rice onto the four plates in front of her. She adds a small spoonful of beans to each one as she turns off the stove. The pressure cooker sitting on the burner hisses as it cools, with a few chicken feet inside to feed her and her three children. This is the first time the family, who live in a slum in Rio de Janeiro, have eaten meat in months. Ms Carvalho, who lost her job as a waitress at the beginning of the pandemic, often can only feed her children bread and margarine. “It’s really hard,” she says, “to hear your children crying for a piece of bread and sometimes not having anything to give them.”
For decades malnutrition was a problem in Brazil, as the country struggled to lift millions of families out of extreme poverty. In the mid-1990s a series of programmes, starting with the creation of a National Council for Food and Nutritional Security ( CONSEA), began to curb poverty rates, and with it rates of hunger. Thanks to the commodity boom in the 2000s, and a push under the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was president from 2003 until 2011, Brazil was removed from the list of undernourished countries in the World Food Programme’s Hunger Map in 2014. This was achieved by a mix of policies, including the introduction of a national school-meals programme, an increase in the minimum wage and the Bolsa Família (family grant), which provided stipends to people who kept their children in school.

But the improvements in nutrition appear to be reversing. Food insecurity—a lack of consistent access to enough food—affected over half of homes, or 117m Brazilians, during the first year of the pandemic. According to a study by the Brazilian Research Network on Food Sovereignty and Security ( PENSSAN), an NGO, some 19m Brazilians, or 9% of the population, suffered from severe food insecurity in 2020.
As in most countries, hunger afflicts some groups more than others. Single black mothers, such as Ms Carvalho, tend to be the worst affected. According to the study by PENSSAN, those in the north and north-east were most likely to go hungry last year. Rural people also have a higher rate of severe food insecurity.
The numbers of hungry Brazilians started creeping back up after the recession in 2014-16, when millions of workers lost their jobs and most programmes to fight hunger suffered drastic budget cuts. When Jair Bolsonaro, the president, took office in 2019, he scrapped CONSEA, too. According to Elisabetta Recine, co-ordinator of the Observatory of Food Security and Nutrition Policies at the University of Brasília (and formerly the head of CONSEA) this meant that the country was already in a bad way before the pandemic.
But covid-19 has made everything worse. For a start, rising consumer prices, caused by a tumble in the the real, have hit the poorest hardest. During the first year of the pandemic food prices rose by 15%, almost three times the overall inflation rate of 5.2%, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The price of rice jumped by 70%, that of soya oil by 88%, potatoes by 48% and milk by 21%. Ms Carvalho complains that a bag of rice that once cost 10 reais ($1.90) is now three times as expensive.
At first, federal emergency aid was fairly generous. In April last year Mr Bolsonaro’s government announced that poor families would receive 600 reais a month, and those headed by single mothers twice as much, to help them weather the pandemic. But five months later, the amount was halved. According to Vilma Pinto, an economist at the Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university in São Paulo, the government had underestimated how much this would cost, thinking that only those already enrolled in government assistance programmes would need it. In the end the government spent 293bn reais, almost treble what it first announced. The government had not realised just how many people were living in a state of precarity, explains Ms Pinto.
Last month the budget for emergency aid was reduced further, to 44bn reais a year. Eligibility for payments was restricted to those who already receive food aid or families with incomes below 550 reais per person per month. As a result some 22m people who received emergency aid last year will not do so again this year. Similarly, some state-level programmes which provided aid in lieu of free school meals have become slightly less generous (though some schemes, such as Rio de Janeiro’s, are now offered to all public-school students, not just those who receive Bolsa Família benefits).
For Ms Carvalho the emergency aid is a boon, but she claims that it cannot be relied upon entirely, and that there are months when nothing is deposited onto the card she was given to receive the meal benefit, possibly because of an error. “Sometimes I go to the supermarket and when I go to pay with the card there’s nothing on it,” she says. “Then I have to put everything back and leave with nothing.” ■",2
1578,"MARIE WORKED as a nanny for 14 years, until last October, when health problems made her switch to work she could do from home: selling amateur pornography. Today she makes $12,000 a month on OnlyFans, an online subscription platform where she updates a feed of “BBW” (Big, Beautiful Woman) photos and videos, and sells extras including knickers-by-mail.
Perhaps not for much longer. On August 19th OnlyFans said that, from October, it would ban the explicit content that dominates the site. Contributors, some of whom had been reassured that it would “always” allow X-rated material, were outraged. Amid an exodus, on August 25th it suspended the ban. Performers like Marie, who thinks nannying is no longer an option after her spell in porn, are shaken. “OnlyFans was a godsend,” she says. “Now it’s kind of a nightmare.”

The site, founded in 2016 by 33-year-old Tim Stokely, tends not to feature in official promotions of Britain’s startup scene. Yet with projected revenues of $1.2bn this year, it is one of the country’s most successful internet firms. After three slow years, during which a majority stake was sold to Leo Radvinsky, an American porn mogul, it boomed in 2020 as youngsters sought to make a living under lockdown. It now claims 130m users and 2m contributors, who earn more than $300m a month after OnlyFans takes its 20% cut.
The botched pivot, likened by some to a strip club focusing on chicken wings, was attributed to “the requests of our banking partners and payout providers”. Mr Stokely told the Financial Times that banks including BNY Mellon, Metro Bank and JPMorgan Chase had made life difficult (the banks declined to comment). The U-turn was credited to “banking partners’ assurances”.
Payment handlers have been tightening their rules on porn. From October Mastercard will require banks to certify that sites complete checks including reviewing content before publication. OnlyFans says it does this; in July it deleted 655 accounts, 15 for publishing child-sex images. But a BBC investigation found the site gave second chances to accounts that broke its rules.
This has spooked investors. The “creator economy” is all the rage among venture capitalists, who have piled into firms like Cameo, which sells celebrity videos. Yet despite its growth and fame (Beyoncé has namechecked it in a song), investors have passed on OnlyFans. Some see reputational risk. Others probably hesitated “while the threat of being shut down by payment processors hung over its head”, says Josh Constine of SignalFire, a venture fund.
Following its flip-flop, OnlyFans risks losing contributors, too. “What they’re trying to say is, ‘We’ve gone soft-core from hard-core,’ but their messaging has been so poor that they have gone to no-core,” says Myles Jackman, a lawyer who represents sex workers. Contributors have been circulating spreadsheets comparing other platforms’ payout rates. The Adult Performance Artists Guild (APAG), a union, has offered advice on how to switch to other sites, such as Fansly and PocketStars.
There is “a continuous migration of sex workers around the digital domain”, says Mr Jackman. Mira, a 23-year-old who has sold selfies since her teens, says her main worry about the OnlyFans fiasco is that “it may become a trend with any future site”. Payment firms like PayPal and Square have ditched porn. Cryptocurrencies may offer an alternative. Pornhub, which was dropped last year by Mastercard and Visa after being found to have hosted videos of minors, accepts Bitcoin and the like.
Without sex, OnlyFans’ purpose would be unclear. A few celebrities use it for non-X-rated purposes, including Floyd Mayweather, a boxer, but none has been a hit. Bella Thorne, an actress, made a fortune last year selling a “nude” photo for $200, but had to issue refunds after buyers complained that she was still in her smalls. OFTV, a new venture that is clean enough for app stores, is full of bland “influencers”. Meanwhile, OnlyFans’ parent company was recently handed a demand by British tax authorities for more than £10m ($13.6m) in backdated VAT (the firm paid up but is appealing), and APAG is considering legal action. A quietly successful startup suddenly looks all too short of fans.■

1579,"He's been living in Italy since October 2018 after being deported from the states.
And now Joe Giudice, 49, has lawyered up to fight for a chance to return to the United States.
'I would like to be able to see my children again in our home state, be a part of their lives, be physically present when they need me and watch them grow up,' he told Us Weekly on Friday.
Joe shares Gia, 20, Gabriella, 17, Milania, 15, and Audriana, 12, with ex-wife Teresa Giudice. 
The two each served time in prison after being found guilty of fraud. Following Joe's three-year stint behind bars he was exiled.  
Giudice is also vying to be back with his older family members, including his mom and grandmother.
'I yearn to hold my grandmother in my arms again before the time comes [in which] she is no longer on this Earth. [I want to] be with my mother [and] my family, to be in the place I have called home since I was a year old,' he told the media outlet.
The entrepreneur has enlisted immigration attorney Jessica M. Cadavid to help in his legal pursuit.
The former Bravo TV personality is feeling positive. 'I'm hopeful and pray that I can finally go home in the near future,' he remarked.
Cadavid plans to file a waiver of inadmissibility to try to workaround Joe's current status as a deportee. 
It likely wouldn't have been approved under the Trump administration, but the law professional thinks with Biden in office now there's a better chance.
'We are hopeful that this time around, we can take a look at his file with time that has passed from his deportation and the fact that he has a family here, he still has children here...he could ask the government for forgiveness and at least come back to be able to see his family,' Cadavid noted to the publication.
Giudice seems to spend the most time with his oldest daughter Gia, who often meets up with her dad in the Bahamas or Italy.
The two have a penchant for affectionately sharing daddy-daughter photos on their respective Instagram pages.
Earlier this week the father-of-four shared an outtake with his first born as they embraced each other, holding an adorable black puppy between them.
'My love,' he captioned the sweet outtake with a pink heart emoji. 
Earlier this month, the influencer took to the photo-sharing app to share snapshots with the patriarch.
In one photo they stood side by side with Joe looking dapper in a blue button up shirt, and the young beauty rocking a printed knee-length dress.
In another image Gia wore a green bikini and flip flops as her dad sported black shorts and sneakers as they smiled in front of turquoise water.
'Weekend recap. Love u dad,' she wrote under the post.",-2
1580,"YOU CANNOT avoid his face anywhere you go. More than a year after the murder of George Floyd, and a few months after the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on his neck, the memory of Floyd remains almost hauntingly imposed upon Minneapolis. The street where he was killed is demarcated by two enormous constructions of black fists raised in the air; the site of his death is a makeshift memorial with fresh flowers in spite of the stiff October chill; murals of him and of protests envelop the city.
Despite the upheaval that his death and its ensuing protests caused in the city and the country, precious little about policing in America seems to have changed. Cities that hastily cut police budgets are now reversing course in the face of resurgent violence. After months of negotiation, a vaunted bipartisan police-reform deal in Congress has collapsed.

On November 2nd, however, voters in Minneapolis will have the chance to do something drastic. As well as passing judgment on Jacob Frey, the incumbent mayor seeking re-election, they are also voting on whether to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety that “employs a comprehensive public-health approach”, and to eliminate a mandatory minimum of police officers established in the city’s charter.
In a city where there were as many as nine Biden voters for every Trump supporter in the last presidential election, such a referendum would pass easily if Democrats were united. They are not. Mr Frey is running against the measure. The state’s governor and senators, all Democrats, are opposed to the idea of repealing and replacing the police department. But Keith Ellison, the state attorney-general who won a murder trial against Mr Chauvin, is for it. “If we don’t make changes to the circumstances that brought us to George Floyd and the aftermath, we’re going to get more of it…And I want to do something different,” he says.
Rhetoric and reality
The critical division is over whether or not the plan is a pretext to “defund the police”. Opponents insist it is sloganeering masquerading as policy. Shortly after Floyd’s murder, a majority of the city council appeared at a rally at Powderhorn Park on a stage in front of which “DEFUND POLICE” appeared in gigantic block letters. “The narrative all along until maybe five months ago, six months ago, was that they would be defunding the police and allocating the money elsewhere. The only thing that’s changed is the political winds,” says Mr Frey. He insists that alternatives to policing can still be funded without modifying the city charter, and that, if anything, more funding for the police is needed: “Right now, in Minneapolis, we have fewer officers per capita than just about every major city in the entire country.”
Advocates for reform have adjusted their language. As with the civil-rights movement, “those farthest on the left are what pushed the movement…we shifted the narrative from reform to defund,” says Sheila Nezhad, a community organiser running for mayor who is posing a stiff challenge to Mr Frey. Having contributed to a report on policing that argued that “abolition is the only way forward”, Ms Nezhad now avoids such rhetoric on the campaign trail, preferring words like “reinvest”. Kate Knuth, another candidate for mayor who supports the reform, says: “My vision of a department of public safety absolutely includes police,” funded at the same levels as today.
Reform campaigners in Minneapolis favour a less provocative slogan, “Expand public safety”, for their yard signs. The established minimum size of the force—17 officers per 10,000 residents—is not particularly high for a large city, though it is unusual in being so explicit. The argument for abolishing it is that it is an impediment to reform. “It’s not revolutionary or radical, it is literally a common-sense step to keeping people safe, and quite frankly benefits police officers”, who are overstretched, argues JaNaé Bates, a church minister and leading campaigner. Law-enforcement officers would remain, she says, but some funding would be reallocated towards other means of emergency response, such as mental-health professionals.
Advocates hope that the proposed rebranding and the rerouting of funding towards unarmed social services will restore trust among minority communities, without risking a backlash among white residents. Such an approach is necessary to win. Public opinion in favour of “defunding” police departments was never high. The increase in violent crime has made it even less so.
In June 2020, 41% of Democrats told survey-takers for the Pew Research Centre that they wished to reduce local police budgets. By September 2021 that had shrunk to 25%. Among the general public, support declined from 25% to 15%. Official data recorded a 30% jump in homicides nationwide between 2019 and 2020, the largest single-year rise on record. The preliminary evidence for 2021 suggests that the rate may continue to grow. Minneapolis is on pace to have 88 murders this year—the most in the city in the past 25 years.
The energy for police reform is often inversely related to crime. That puts reformers in a difficult position. In August 2020 the city council in Austin, Texas, voted to trim its annual policing budget by one-third. Its most recent budget reversed that entirely. There is now a referendum in that city to institute a minimum staffing requirement for policing—exactly the kind that Minneapolis is currently trying to undo. Other Democrat-led cities, like Atlanta and New York, have had to reverse earlier pronouncements on reduced police funding in the face of increased crime. If Minneapolis votes differently, it would buck an emerging trend.■

1581,"JOHNNY MILLER, a photographer, began taking drone footage of South African cities in 2016. Shots from Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg depict adjoining neighbourhoods—but different worlds. On one side of a photograph might be a verdant suburb spattered with azure swimming pools; on the other a slum with tightly packed shacks.
Economic research into South African inequality has produced a less granular picture. Reports from the World Bank and other bodies draw on benchmark measures of income inequality, such as the Gini coefficient, to conclude that South Africa is one of the world’s most unequal countries. But they often say little about wealth, the role of government policy or, crucially, what has happened to the gap between blacks and whites since the end of apartheid in 1994.

Two recent papers from the academics Aroop Chatterjee, Léo Czajka and Amory Gethin fill some of these holes. In doing so they offer perhaps the most detailed picture of the haves and have-nots in South Africa in the democratic era. The research is crucial to understanding the profound discontent felt by many South Africans.
In their latest paper the economists combine household surveys, tax data and national accounts to track incomes from 1993 to 2019. They start by noting that, before taxes, the share of income going to the top 10% of earners grew from 57% to 66%—levels higher than in any other comparable country. The average income of the top 1% increased by 50%, while that of the poorest half fell by more than 30% after inflation. Even after taxes and transfers are included, the share of income going to the top 1% is roughly the same as it was at the end of apartheid—nearly one-fifth.
Since 1994 the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has raised taxes and introduced welfare grants for pensioners and children. It has expanded public health care and education, which researchers count as “in-kind” income for the beneficiaries. On paper these transfers largely make up for the loss in pre-tax incomes for the poorest half of South Africans.
Yet it would be wrong to think that social policies have pushed back the tide of inequality. For a start, the authors note that regressive consumption taxes such as VAT mean the poorest have high effective tax rates. The child-support grant is not enough to buy nutritious food. Unemployment benefits are paltry and patchy; hence the growing campaign by NGOs for a universal basic-income grant. The “income”, as defined by the researchers, that the poor receive from public services is not the same as a pay cheque. And given the poor quality of schools and hospitals, it may be valued less by South Africans than by the authors of the study.
One seemingly positive trend identified by the economists is the narrowing of the underlying racial income gap. In the 1990s whites earned about seven times more than blacks. By the end of the 2010s they made about four times more.
But this narrowing is “mostly attributable to the emergence of a new Black elite”, notes the paper. Once in government the ANC introduced affirmative-action laws, which have helped increase the share of well-paid jobs held by blacks, especially in the public sector, where trade unions have won above-inflation pay rises. Another policy, called “black economic empowerment” has steered business towards black-owned firms and enriched a small number of black investors.

Partly as a result of policies like these, the share of blacks in the top 10% of earners has risen sharply (see chart 1), though it is still less than their share of the overall population (81%). Poorer blacks have done less well. While the gross income of the top 10% of black earners has tripled, that of the bottom 50% has fallen (see chart 2). When the researchers looked only at the ratio of white earnings to those of the bottom 90% of black earners, the racial gap had increased slightly since apartheid.

An earlier paper by the same authors found similar trends. It noted that concentration of wealth in South Africa is greater than in any other country for which there are comparable estimates. The 3,500 households making up the top 0.01% have more net wealth than the bottom 90% combined. The share of wealth held by the top 10% is roughly the same as at the end of apartheid; that owned by the top 1% and 0.01% has, if anything, risen.
Many of the inequalities of the present stem from the white-supremacist past, when blacks were systematically denied a good education and prevented from accruing wealth. Today whites on average are eight times richer than blacks—twice as large an overall gap as for income. Inheritance, notes Mr Gethin, helps old inequalities endure.
Taken together, the two papers underline not just the legacy of white rule, but also the ANC’s failure to help most black South Africans overcome it. Redistribution and elite empowerment are no substitute for growth and jobs. Unemployment, as work led by Murray Leibbrandt of the University of Cape Town has repeatedly found, is at the heart of South African inequality. South Africa’s GDP per person has been declining since 2015—a result of corruption and bad policies. In the second quarter of 2021 joblessness reached a record 34.4%.
On November 1st South Africa will hold local elections. For the first time, the ANC may win less than half of the vote in a nationwide contest. If that happens, it will be easy to point to the party’s dysfunction, or a surge in opposition turnout following civil unrest in July. Yet there are deeper forces at play. The party of Nelson Mandela promised “a better life for all”. So far it has delivered a much better life for a few. ■",2
1582,"CHINA HAS an anger-management problem, at least when dealing with small and mid-size Western democracies. The fate of Lithuania, a European Union member on the shores of the Baltic Sea, is a case in point.
The country is being punished for agreeing that Taiwan, a democratic island that China claims as its own territory, may open a “Taiwanese Representative Office” in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital. China calls that an affront to its sovereignty. It has summoned its ambassador, Shen Zhifei, home for consultations, and told Lithuania to recall its envoy, Diana Mickeviciene. In a covid-era twist, China informed Ms Mickeviciene of her fate as she returned to Beijing from a summer break. She has to complete three weeks of strict quarantine at her residence and, after emerging on August 31st, catch the next flight home. State media suggest that China may soon suspend direct rail-freight services to Lithuania, then sever other economic links with that country of 2.8m people (Lithuanian farmers should forget long-held dreams of selling milk to China, it is hinted). In a detail noted with dismay by foreign envoys in Beijing, Lithuania’s embassy has received a barrage of threatening calls, many targeting local Chinese staff.

China’s problem is not simply that it has a short fuse. It is not new for leaders in Beijing to downgrade relations with governments that cross their “red lines”. China routinely freezes trade talks and official visits whenever foreign leaders meet Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (Lithuania suffered this fate in 2013). Last year China curbed imports of coal and wine from Australia after that country’s government called for an international probe into covid-19’s origins. Often, China’s demands are arcane as well as aggressive. Lithuania may earn a partial reprieve if it permits only a “Taipei Representative Office” in Vilnius. China tolerates trade offices named after Taiwan’s capital, because those sound like local government outposts. Even the hair-trigger anger of the Chinese public—or at least its noisiest elements—is wearily familiar. Each week, it seems, online nationalists demand a new domestic boycott of a business, or the cancellation of a foreign or local celebrity accused of hurting Chinese pride. Threats directed at Chinese deemed “race traitors” are alarmingly common.
Rather, Chinese irascibility may prove more problematic than before because China’s ambitions are changing. The country no longer inhabits a world of bilateral ties dominated by trade, of the sort that allowed it to play one country off against another. It hopes to create new international networks and groupings that share similar views about what constitutes good governance, in which China plays the central role. That brings new forms of scrutiny when it loses its temper.
About a decade ago, lots of foreign countries saw China as a dazzling, potentially transformative economic partner. Lithuania was no exception. In competition with Estonia and Latvia, its Baltic neighbours, it pitched its largest airport as a hub for Chinese flights, and its main seaport, Klaipeda, as an entry-point for Chinese ships. More recently, it sought to be a European gateway for Chinese financial technologies. In 2012 Lithuania joined 15 other central and eastern European countries, nine of them EU members, in a Chinese-led grouping. This came to be known as the “16 plus one” initiative, holding annual summits with China’s prime minister and spawning countless committees to work on co-operation. At first, many in eastern Europe chafed when the group was called a threat to the EU’s unity by the continent’s rich Westerners. Easterners particularly resented being chided by Germany, given that country’s exceptional access to Chinese leaders and markets.
Disappointment followed. Chinese investments in central and eastern Europe proved paltry, and the lion’s share went to Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Serbia. Trade increased, but mostly because of imports from China. Today, China is still only Lithuania’s 12th-largest trade partner. As dreams of an economic bonanza faded, some members of the 16 plus one (which swelled to 17 after Greece joined in 2019) began comparing notes about the bloc’s political aims and lack of transparency. Like-minded embassies discovered that Chinese officials and party bodies were making direct contacts with regions, cities and institutions in their home countries, bypassing national capitals. In February six members—Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia—sent only ministers to a virtual summit of the 17 plus one, though President Xi Jinping was in the chair.
China’s brand of performative patriotism goes global
Further complicating China’s image, its nationalist fervour is increasingly on display far from home. In August 2019 Lithuania accused China’s embassy in Vilnius of rallying Chinese citizens to disrupt a protest in support of Hong Kong’s democrats (Chinese diplomats were photographed handing out banners). A few months later Chinese-speaking visitors proudly filmed themselves vandalising signs of support for Hong Kong planted on the Hill of Crosses, a shrine to national independence dating to Lithuania’s occupation by Nazi Germany and then by the Soviet Union. The videos went viral, appalling Lithuanians. In April this year expansion of Klaipeda’s outer harbour was put on hold for at least a decade. Senior officials had earlier called China’s attempts to invest in the port a national-security risk. In May Lithuania’s foreign minister announced his country’s withdrawal from the 17 plus one, calling it divisive and less efficient than a unified EU.
State media accuse Lithuania of foolishly provoking China in order to curry favour with America, as if smaller countries lack any will of their own. The mood of gloom and wariness among many European embassies in Beijing is obvious to all. But domestic political imperatives require outsize displays of anger, whenever China feels disrespected. That is a clumsy way to manage foreigners. To China, however, being defied is worse. ■",2
1583,"FOR MANY Lebanese, the scenes in Beirut on October 14th harked back to their country’s darkest days. Gunmen crouched behind cars and fired wildly at apartment blocks or rushed out from cover to launch rocket-propelled grenades. Frantic parents searched for safe routes to collect children from school. Residents cowered in hallways and bathrooms. The guns fell silent after a few hours, but the streets were left carpeted with broken glass, the buildings pockmarked with bullet holes.
At least seven people were killed and dozens injured in the worst violence in Lebanon’s capital since 2008. It centred on a rally organised by the two main Shia parties, Hizbullah and Amal, to protest against the investigation into last year’s catastrophic explosion at Beirut’s port. Soon after the rally began, snipers fired into its midst from a nearby building. Hizbullah and Amal, which are both militias as well as political parties, blamed this “ambush” on the Lebanese Forces, a Christian party led by Samir Geagea, a warlord-turned-politician. His party denies it was involved (there is no evidence yet to prove it was).

Ostensibly the protest was about the “politicisation” of the probe. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hizbullah, says the lead investigator is biased. His allies mumble darkly about an American-backed conspiracy. This is mostly nonsense. The investigator, Tarek al-Bitar, is a judge with a clean reputation. He has won support from families of the 218 people killed in the explosion. Pressed for evidence of a foreign conspiracy, supporters of Hizbullah and Amal offer little beyond the fact that some American congressmen have praised Mr Bitar.
It would be more accurate to call this a protest against the investigation itself: a rally for impunity, of which Lebanon has a long history. An amnesty law passed in 1991 meant that almost no one was held accountable for atrocities during the 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Since then politicians, security officials and intellectuals have been assassinated, with few consequences for their killers.
Mr Bitar, by most accounts, takes his job seriously. He has summoned high-ranking officials, including a former prime minister and cabinet members. On October 12th he issued an arrest warrant for Ali Hassan Khalil, a former finance minister from Amal, after the latter failed to turn up for questioning. Hours later a court ordered Mr Bitar to halt his work pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed by Mr Khalil and a colleague.
The investigator’s opponents have ample reason to want him gone. The explosion was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had arrived at the port in 2013 and was stored improperly. Many senior officials were aware of the stuff but did nothing to make it safe. Amal is known to wield influence at the notoriously corrupt port. Some Lebanese believe Hizbullah wanted to use the ammonium nitrate for bomb-making, either at home or in neighbouring Syria (a claim that is so far unproven). Both parties are members of the ruling coalition and see a serious investigation as a threat to the political order.
They have already removed one judge. Mr Bitar’s predecessor was dismissed in February, in part because his own house was damaged in the blast. This supposedly made him too biased to oversee the work—an absurd standard that would disqualify about one in seven Beirutis (more than 85,000 homes were damaged).
For the civil-war generation, the fighting on October 14th carried grim echoes of their childhoods. Even the location, Tayouneh, was resonant: a former front line between Christian and Shia neighbourhoods, near the site of a massacre in 1975 that is widely considered the war’s starting point. For most of Lebanon’s political factions, however, a renewed war would be a suicide mission. Hizbullah is by far the country’s strongest force, better-equipped than even the army. None of its rivals has the muscle to challenge it, nor do they enjoy the level of foreign support they did decades ago.
If war seems unlikely, though, so does stability. Lebanon defaulted on its foreign-currency debt in March 2020 and has since slipped into an economic crisis that the World Bank ranks as one of the worst anywhere since the mid-1800s. The Lebanese pound, long pegged at 1,500 to the dollar, now trades at around 21,000; annual inflation exceeds 100%. Earlier this month the national electricity grid went offline for a day when its two main power plants ran out of fuel. There has been no progress on restructuring debt, a financial-rescue plan or an agreement with the IMF.
This endless crisis affects everyone—including the impoverished, demoralised security forces. The interior minister said in a television interview this month that more than 240 police officers had walked off the job. The army does not release statistics, but desertions there are thought to number in the thousands. Other soldiers have side jobs to feed their families, since conscripts now earn less than the equivalent of $60 a month (compared with $800 before the currency collapsed).
For decades, Lebanon’s leaders have framed justice and peace as opposing choices, where one is only possible without the other. The campaign against Mr Bitar, and the deadly violence that followed, underscores that they have in fact provided neither: a state too corrupt to prosecute its criminals, and too dysfunctional to protect its citizens.",2
1584,"Germany is becoming a hub for migrants attempting to reach Britain, it emerged last night.
Asylum seekers are massing in the country as a new staging post for Channel crossings masterminded by people-smuggling gangs.
Organised crime groups are also using German sites to store dinghies and other small boats used to attempt crossings, sources said.
Six out of ten migrants arrive in France only on the day they attempt their crossing, travelling there through Belgium and the Netherlands.
A UK government source described Germany as 'the established hub for criminal trafficking gangs' in Europe. 
It is also a key location in the criminals' supply chains, where boats, life jackets and other equipment is sourced for Channel crossings, they added.
This week Home Secretary Priti Patel attacked the EU's open borders policies for allowing migrants free access across the Continent, and called on Brussels to act. 
UK officials are increasingly dissatisfied with the French government's response to the crisis. 
During the last major Channel surge – which saw the 'Jungle' camp spring up at Calais in 2015 – France sent 3,500 of its tough Compagnies Republicaines de Securite officers to the area.
By comparison, the UK's latest £54million handout to Emmanuel Macron's government has seen just a couple of hundred reservist gendarmes deployed. 
British officials believe the shortfall has left the French struggling to deal with the massive numbers pushed through by gangs.
However, the French president yesterday took aim at the UK over the crisis.
He said: 'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation. We need to further strengthen collaboration.'
The number of migrants to have crossed this month has now surpassed 4,000.
It means 23,761 people have now arrived on UK shores this year with more expected yesterday as many braved the poor conditions. ",-2
1585,"THE APPLE will surely fall, even if ever so slowly. When Tim Cook took the helm from Steve Jobs, the firm’s co-founder, a decade ago, even the most boosterish of Apple fanboys worried that the company was destined to decline. Without Apple’s original Willie Wonka, the digital chocolate factory was about to be run by an automaton who made his career organising global supply chains and scrutinising spreadsheets. How could someone with so little dazzle inspire Apple employees to continue creating “insanely great” products, in Jobs’s famous formulation?
It turned out Mr Cook could. As he celebrated his tenth anniversary as Apple’s boss on August 24th, no one made a peep. And for good reason. He has staged what is arguably the greatest succession success in tech, an industry littered with managers who failed in the effort to follow in the founders’ footsteps. In fact, in pure financial terms, he has been a far more successful chief executive than the late Jobs, who succumbed to pancreatic cancer six weeks after stepping down.

No chief executive in history has created as much overall shareholder value as Mr Cook (see chart 1). When he took over from Jobs the company had a market value of $349bn. Today it is worth $2.5trn (see chart 2), more than any other listed firm ever. Under his aegis annual sales surged from $108bn in 2011 to $274bn last year. Net profit more than doubled, to $57bn, overtaking Saudi Aramco’s oil-fuelled earnings and turning Apple into the world’s most profitable company. Less widely noticed, during his tenure the “Apple economy”—its own annual revenue plus everything other companies make on one of its platforms—has grown sevenfold, to more than $1trn.

Given such achievements, Mr Cook could have retired amid gushing tributes around now (and with a spot in the billionaire club). Instead, he is likely to stick around at least until 2025, when his current stock grant will fully vest. This in turn raises the question of how long he can keep Apple on its stratospheric trajectory. The short answer is that it will be much harder than in his first decade. Many of the global tailwinds that have lifted Apple to such dizzying heights are now reversing.

For a longer answer it helps to understand what Mr Cook got so right. Besides being an exceptional manager, he proved adept at harnessing the forces that have powered the tech industry—and with it global economy—in the 2010s.
The first of these was the mobile-led digitisation of life. To satisfy the world’s voracious appetite for mobile computing, he kept pushing for constant improvement of the iPhone. Whereas the iPhone 4s, announced shortly after he became chief executive, was still essentially a souped-up mobile phone, the iPhone 13, expected to be launched in September, will be a hand-sized supercomputer with a processor nearly 50 times faster. Even Apple’s Watch and AirPods, the main new products since he took over, can be seen as extensions of the mighty iPhone. More than a billion of Apple’s smartphones are now in use globally, one for every seven Earthlings.
Another force which Mr Cook has deftly harnessed is globalisation, in particular the rise of China. Even before he took over from Jobs, he was instrumental in outsourcing assembly of Apple’s devices to the country. Its biggest contract manufacturer, Foxconn, now employs about 1m people there. Most of them assemble iGadgets. On top of that, untold numbers work for suppliers of other components. And besides using China as a factory, Mr Cook was early to see its potential as a market—now Apple’s biggest after America and Europe, generating 19% of revenue and, possibly, a bigger share of profits.

Mr Cook’s third coup was understanding the importance of network effects—the economic mechanism in digital markets which makes big businesses even bigger. That is something that eluded even Jobs, who was ambivalent about the iPhone’s App Store. By contrast, Mr Cook doubled down on the digital “flywheel”: the App Store attracted more app makers, which attracted more users, which attracted even more developers and so on—until it became the world’s foremost digital marketplace by revenues. Today it hosts nearly 2m apps, which facilitated $643bn in billings and sales in 2020 for app developers, according to a study sponsored by Apple.
Mr Cook was also the first big-tech boss to signal, loudly and often, that companies of Apple’s size and reach must take some responsibility for their impact on the wider world. Under Jobs, a gadget’s looks were more important than how they were made. Today Lisa Jackson, a former head of America’s Environmental Protection Agency and now a vice-president directly reporting to Mr Cook, is involved in product development from the start. Apple has set itself the laudable goal of becoming carbon-neutral across all its products by 2030. And Mr Cook has called privacy “a fundamental human right” and, among other things, forced app makers to ask users whether they want to be tracked by advertisers.

Admittedly, being pro-privacy aligns with Apple’s business model, which unlike those of Facebook and Google does not make money by collecting data to sell targeted ads, and climate-cuddling plays well with the sensibilities of Apple’s mostly well-off users at little cost, given Apple’s relatively shallow carbon footprint. This has helped keep regulators off Apple’s back—and made it into the world’s most valuable brand, according to one estimate.
Cooking lessons
In other words, after ten years of Cookery Apple is a bigger and better version of itself, says Horace Dediu, a long-time Apple watcher. That, though, is not to say it is invulnerable. Three challenges stand out: growth, geopolitics and competition.
On the surface, growth looks healthy enough. To the surprise of those analysts who have for years predicted the iPhone’s decline, the device keeps raking in money. Global unit sales are down from a peak of 231m in 2015, but only a bit: Apple still sold 200m of them last year. But the market for smartphones will eventually mature. And even if this takes time, Apple will increasingly run up against a problem familiar to all large firms: the bigger they get, the harder it becomes to grow rapidly.
Mr Cook has been able to tap into other sources of revenue, notes Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a website that analyses all things Apple. The firm’s services business, including the App Store and Apple Music, has surged from $8bn in sales in 2011 to $65bn in the past four quarters (see chart 4). Though wearables like the Apple Watch and accessories such as the AirPods are a smaller business than the iPhone, they generate lots of revenue: nearly $9bn in three months to June. Last year AirPods ended up in more than 200m ears and Apple Watches on 34m wrists, respectively outselling all other high-end ear buds and all Swiss timepieces combined.

At some point, however, Apple will need another keystone innovation like the iPhone. Hence talk of “iGlasses”, which would add a digital layer to the physical reality perceived by the wearer, and even an “iCar”. Although the firm does not confirm this, it is an open secret that it has been working on both for years. Leaks suggest that augmented-reality glasses may finally be coming in the next year or two and Apple reportedly has plans to release a vehicle that is both electric and self-driving in 2024. But it is also widely known that things have not been going well and timelines have slipped in the past.
The car, which unlike the glasses is not a natural extension of Apple’s current consumer-tech line-up, would be difficult to pull off. Even without a petrol engine and a gearbox, a vehicle is much harder to manufacture than a smartphone. Apple’s automotive thinking appears to have gone back and forth between building its own self-driving cars from scratch or providing the necessary electronics and software to other carmakers.
Mr Cook’s second big challenge is geopolitics. Apple has so far escaped the mounting tensions between the West and China, where most of the firm’s products are assembled and many of them are sold. Mr Cook has made all sorts of concessions to the authorities in Beijing, from moving its Chinese users’ information to data centres in the country, where they can be accessed by local law enforcement, to taking down some apps in the Chinese version of its App Store. “We follow the law wherever we do business” is Mr Cook’s motto.
Now, though, the pugnacity with which the Chinese government has gone after its own technology giants must be making some in Apple’s futuristic headquarters in Cupertino, Silicon Valley, nervous. Though it has been beefing up manufacturing in other countries, particularly in India and Vietnam, Apple does not have an alternative to China for the bulk of its assembly. It is hard to see where else it might find one. Only China has a ready army of workers needed to quickly ramp up production of the latest iPhone.
Judging by Apple’s latest supplier list, the firm has even increased its reliance on Chinese companies. Of the top 200 suppliers, 51 were based in China, up from 42 in 2018. At the height of the trade war then-president Donald Trump waged with China in 2019, Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, estimated that in the worst-case scenario Chinese retaliation could reduce Apple’s profits by nearly 30%.
Apple’s jams
The fallout could be worse if Apple’s products and services were banned in China. As the Communist Party turns increasingly authoritarian and the West increasingly suspicious of China, Apple may become a target of Beijing’s wrath or the sort of nationalist-tinged boycotts that have hurt Western brands from the NBA to Zara.
And if Apple’s importance to China’s economy continues to offer a protective shield, this may anger governments and consumers in the West. According to human-rights groups, some of Apple’s suppliers are linked to forced-labour camps for Uyghurs, an oppressed Muslim minority, in Xinjiang. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, has called out Apple for hypocrisy for touting privacy protection at home while allowing the government in Beijing to access personal data in China. “At some point something will happen that becomes a loyalty test,” thinks Willy Shih of Harvard Business School.
Apple says that it has found no evidence of any forced labour in its supply chain. And Mr Zuckerberg himself could also be accused of being hypocritical, since Facebook is making billions from Chinese advertisers on its social networks. But even if those controversies end up being resolved in Apple’s favour, they are feeding into pushback against its behaviour at home: witness the recent brouhaha over its plans to scan private pictures on iPhones for child pornography.
Mr Zuckerberg’s China-related broadside also hints at Mr Cook’s third challenge: competition. Network effects are not the only thing benefiting firms like Apple. Another is the lack of real rivals. Some view Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft as a cartel whose members have tacitly agreed not to encroach on each other’s core businesses. Apple has never made an effort to be a social-media powerhouse and Facebook has not attempted to create an alternative app store. Instead of building its own search engine, Apple cut a deal with Google, making it the default search engine on the iPhone (and charging an estimated $8bn-12bn annually for the privilege, equivalent to 14-21% of Apple’s net profit in 2020).
Such cosiness is fraying. To sustain trillion-dollar valuations all the tech giants are searching for new sources of growth—and finding them on one another’s turf. Giving iPhone users more control over their data may be rooted in a genuine wish to protect their privacy, but it also keeps data out of Facebook’s hands, which could help Apple build its own advertising business. Apple is also rumoured to be working on its own search engine.
The rivalry is heating up in its principal hardware business, too. In America the iPhone remains dominant. Globally, however, iPhones account for one in seven smartphones sold, according to Canalys, a data provider. Earlier this year Xiaomi, a Chinese firm, overtook Apple as the world’s second-biggest smartphone-maker by volume.
Apple’s forays into newer markets face stiff competition. Its HomePod smart speakers came late and did not make much headway against Amazon’s and Google’s products. Apple’s mixed-reality glasses, should they indeed see the light of day, will have to duke it out against Facebook’s Oculus, Microsoft’s HoloLens and other fancy headgear. And an iCar would be taking on Teslas and a car park’s worth of offerings from established carmakers.
Regulators may also try to make digital markets more competitive. Apple is expected to win its trial against Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite”, a popular online video game, which accuses Apple of illegally protecting its App Store. A ruling should come later this year. Even if Apple prevails in American courts, however, trustbusters elsewhere may not let it off the hook as easily.
In July Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s deputy head and the EU’s trustbuster-in-chief, warned Apple that the bloc’s proposed Digital Markets Act will not allow it to hold up privacy and security as reasons to limit competition in the App Store, as Apple has argued in the Epic lawsuit. Loosening of the App Store’s rules and lower commissions (currently up to 30% on most app purchases) could make a serious dent in the company’s lucrative services business.
An executive of Mr Cook’s stature and experience may well be able to overcome these headwinds. Whether that will be Mr Cook himself is less clear. He is 60 and has said he will “probably” not stay on for another ten years. This raises the question of who might have the vision and the skills to succeed him.
One former executive has a radical proposal: Apple should stop being a pedlar of luxury goods. The firm’s “obscene” gross margins of more than 40% in the past quarter make it lazy, he argues. To maintain them, the firm squeezes developers and suppliers. Instead, it should use its power and cutting-edge technology to develop devices and services for the 3bn people on Earth who have yet to enjoy the benefits of the digital era.
Too many Cooks?
This could help solve Apple’s growth conundrum. But it is unlikely to fly with its margin-loving shareholders. The possible successor to Mr Cook mentioned most frequently, Jeff Williams, is a less radical departure from the status quo. Mr Williams is considered by many insiders to be “Tim Cook’s Tim Cook”: a doppelganger not just in looks (tall, lean and grizzled) but also in thinking and experience. He has been doing Mr Cook’s old job overseeing Apple’s supply chain and operations since 2010. Those skills have served the company remarkably well in the past decade. To keep thriving Apple’s next chief executive may need a different set of abilities. ■

1586,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Canada's Pembina Pipeline Corp is asking backers of two competing proposals for carbon capture hubs in the oil-producing province of Alberta to combine efforts with its own plan, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.
Pembina (PPL.TO) and TC Energy Corp (TRP.TO) said in June they were looking to develop a system to transport and sequester carbon. The Alberta government, which controls underground space for burying carbon, called for expressions of interest this autumn.
Carbon capture facilities are expected to be a key part of global efforts to contain emissions from fossil fuel production. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and aims to cut national greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030.
The Pembina-TC plan, called Alberta Carbon Grid, faces competition from at least two others - Oil Sands Pathways, pitched by the largest oil sands producers, and Polaris, a proposal by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).
Pembina has spoken with both groups about joining together and talks remain active, CEO Mick Dilger told Reuters.
""A single, large carbon capture program at scale is by far the most sensible way to do things,"" Dilger said. ""If everybody works together, we'll come up with a more cost-effective solution.""
Whether such cooperation happens remains to be seen, Dilger said.
Pembina and TC would need to convince Shell and the Pathways partnership of Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO), Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO), Imperial Oil (IMO.TO), Suncor Energy (SU.TO) and MEG Energy (MEG.TO), of a change in concept, he said.
Pembina and TC proposed a plan that would make use of spare pipelines that they own to reduce costs. The other proposals rely more on new infrastructure, Dilger said.
There is also the unknown of how Alberta will allocate space for sequestering carbon, Dilger said, adding that the provincial government is ""reassessing how that might be done.""
The rival companies and the Alberta government could not be reached for comment.
Pembina and TC have picked a reservoir at Fort Saskatchewan, an industrial hub near Edmonton, and not far from where Shell proposes its own carbon sequestration site. Pathways proposes a storage hub at Cold Lake in the oil sands.
Pembina and TC say their plan's first phase could operate by 2025.
""Normally we like to do things on our own because they're simpler,"" Dilger said. ""But carbon capture is something that the sector can and should do cooperatively, with government. We would love to come together.""",3
1587,"SUGA YOSHIHIDE, Japan’s prime minister, had been plotting for his re-election as late as September 2nd. The next day, he emerged from a meeting with the other leaders of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) looking crestfallen. With his approval ratings wallowing and his support inside the party hollowing, he declared that he would not run in the party’s leadership race after all. Mr Suga’s about-face has left the LDP—and Japan’s political future—in flux. The party will vote for a new president on September 29th. The winner will become prime minister and lead the LDP into lower-house elections that must be held by late November.
Four contenders stand out so far: Kishida Fumio, a former foreign minister, has good relationships within the party, but limited popular support. Kono Taro, a former foreign and defence minister and the current vaccine tsar, is social-media savvy, and, at 58, on the younger side by Japanese standards. Though popular with the public, his reputation as a maverick puts off many in the party. Takaichi Sanae, a former internal-affairs minister, has scant name recognition, but is a budding darling of the LDP’s right wing. Ishiba Shigeru, a former defence minister, may enter the fray as well. He too has sizeable public support but little among colleagues.

None of the four represents radical change in policy terms. All are staunch supporters of the alliance with America, and favour shoring up Japan’s own defences in the face of Chinese expansionism. None will move to reverse the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy or to impose fiscal austerity. There are subtle differences emerging over how exactly to handle relations with China, how loose to be with different forms of stimulus, how to shape Japan’s energy policy and how to manage the covid-19 pandemic. But the main faultlines are instead generational and presentational: between a predictable, old-style party man in Mr Kishida; the independent-minded, more charismatic Mr Kono; and a nationalist firebrand in Ms Takaichi.
In public opinion polls Mr Kono comes out on top. Yet the public does not decide LDP elections. The initial ballot combines the party’s 383 members of the Diet and another 383 votes that reflect the choices of the party’s 1.1m members. If no candidate wins a majority, as is often the case, the top two move to a run-off in which Diet members’ votes have far more weight. They tend to vote in blocs along factional lines, but this time around, younger MPs are chafing at the older faction bosses’ control.
The outcome of the race will depend on backroom wheeling and dealing and inter-factional horse-trading, but also on how worried the party’s leadership is about the looming Diet elections and on how much influence younger backbenchers, who prefer Mr Kono, can exert. For the party’s old guard, Mr Kishida may seem a safer bet. Ms Takaichi, a regular visitor to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, is attractive to those on the right. Mr Ishiba could upend the race further by entering himself or explicitly backing one of the others.
Before the eight-year premiership of Abe Shinzo, Mr Suga’s predecessor, Japan ran through six prime ministers in six years. There is a risk that Mr Suga’s resignation will precipitate a similar spell of turmoil. But it may also open the door to a new era. As Mr Suga’s abrupt resignation suggests, at this stage, uncertainty is the only certainty. ■",2
1588,"The zapad (“west”) military exercise of 1981 was the largest and grandest exercise ever conducted by the Soviet Union, mustering as many as 150,000 troops from across the ussr and its alliance of satellite states, the Warsaw Pact. Cold-war nostalgics may be pleased to learn that this year’s iteration, which began on September 10th, might be larger still. Zapad-21 could involve up to 200,000 troops from Russia, Belarus and several other countries, if Russia’s defence ministry is to be believed, outnumbering even the very largest NATO exercises of recent times. That reflects both the frostiness of Russia’s ties with the West, and the strengthening of those with Belarus. 
Whether Zapad-21 will in fact match the spectacle of 1981 is not entirely clear. In part, that is because Russia is caught between playing down the scale of its exercises, for diplomatic reasons, and embellishing them, to awe its enemies. The Vienna Document, a confidence-building measure agreed between Russia and the West in 1990, says that exercises with more than 13,000 troops must be reported and open to foreign observers. In recent years, Russia has simply insisted that what appear to be huge drills are in fact a series of distinct, smaller ones, and thus exempt.
The same chicanery is being used for Zapad-21. Belarus says that it will host 12,800 troops, conveniently short of the threshold. Russia has said that no more than 6,400 personnel will train on Russian soil. In the same breath, it repeated the figure of 200,000 troops. America has asked Russia to explain “the apparent discrepancy”, notes a spokesman for the State Department. The true figure is probably somewhere in between, though closer to the upper end. “Russian military leaders likely hope Western media will report exaggerated figures,” says Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian armed forces at CNA, a think-tank, “which help validate the scale and success of the exercise.” Although the exercise formally runs from September 10th to 16th, troops and equipment have been flooding into exercise areas for months and some may almost certainly stay behind afterwards, as they did after a big build-up of troops around Ukraine in the spring.

It is not only the size of Zapad-21 that worries the West, though. The exercise spans Russia and Belarus, with thousands of Russian troops in the latter (see map). And much as Zapad-81 occurred amid a political crisis in Poland, with growing protests against its then-communist government, the backdrop today is also turbulent. After losing an election in August 2020, Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s dictator, cracked down violently on protests—and moved steadily closer to the Kremlin. On September 9th in Moscow Mr Lukashenko met Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, for the sixth time in the past year, and declared himself ready for “even closer military, political or...economic integration”. Mr Putin noted that Russian loans to Belarus between September and the end of 2022 would exceed $600m.
Zapad-21 reflects this bonhomie. Its premise is that Western aggressors—the fictional states of Njaris (mostly Lithuania), Pomorie and the Polar Republic (both Poland)—foment “illegal armed bands, separatist and international terrorist organisations” inside Belarus, and ultimately invade it. Russia and Belarus launch a daring counter-offensive to liberate the country. All of that echoes long-standing Russian fears of Western-backed “colour revolutions” in former Soviet territories; the upheaval in Belarus lends the war games contemporary resonance.
The early signs from the exercise are that Russian troops will be much farther west, and thus closer to Belarus’s border with Poland, than during past Zapad exercises, notes Mr Kofman. Some manoeuvres will take place around Brest, right on that border and just 200km from Warsaw. As the exercise began, Russia also sent an air-defence system to Grodno, where it had established a joint air-defence centre with Belarus in the spring. Grodno is close to the point where Belarus, Poland and Lithuania meet. This Zapad will also be the first to include Belarus’s reserve forces. 
All of this has made Poland jittery. On September 6th Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, explained why the government wanted to extend a state of emergency declared on the country’s border with Belarus the previous week. It was largely in response to a surge in refugees, encouraged by Belarus to put pressure on Poland and other neighbouring countries, but the looming drills played a role too, suggested Mr Morawiecki. 

That Zapad-21 should provoke such a response may please the Kremlin. Although Russia’s military spending is dwarfed by America’s, and lags well behind China’s (see chart), its armed forces have undergone a dramatic transformation over the past 15 years. They have gone from a ragged and resource-starved post-Soviet outfit that performed poorly in a war against Georgia in 2008 to a leaner, nimbler and more lethal organisation with years of combat experience in Ukraine and Syria. The point of exercises like Zapad is not just to refine Russia’s readiness for a big war, and its ability to wage it alongside Belarus, but also to show off that progress to would-be opponents. Zapad-21 will include not just the traditional land, air and naval offensives—as far north as the Arctic—but also the Uran-9 ground combat robot and the largest-ever electronic warfare drills. 
The exercise is an opportunity for military diplomacy, too, underscoring that Russia may be a pariah in the West but has friends elsewhere. Several hundred troops from Armenia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are taking part, some borrowing Russian tanks. China is not attending, but held a large drill with Russia in its north-western Ningxia region last month. 
Belarus has become the closest friend of all. Mr Lukashenko used to be wary of allowing too domineering a Russian presence in his country, but has been forced to rely on Russia’s help to quell the democracy movement. In the past, it was Belarus that presented itself as a staunch protector of Russia’s western flank. Now, says Anna Maria Dyner of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, “we have a situation in which it's rather Russia that is trying to defend Belarus...the emphasis on who defends whom is different from 2017”, the year the last Zapad was held.
Useful as Mr Lukashenko’s insecurity has been to Mr Putin, however, it could become a liability. Russia, although keen on muscle-flexing, does not want to be dragged into a conflict. “For the first time, there is a real risk of unintended armed incidents on the Belarusian border,” warns Artyom Shraibman of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, a think-tank, “not because either side plans to attack the other, but because of expectations of mutual provocations, and tendencies to interpret each other’s actions in the most hostile light possible.” Mr Lukashenko is so twitchy, and so angry with his European neighbours, that it is not hard to imagine an accidental flare-up. ■",2
1589,"As the Biden administration drew up its ambitious climate-change targets, the International Energy Agency forecast that energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions will rebound in 2021 after a steep fall during the pandemic, and grow by 4.8%. That would represent an increase of 1.5 gigatonnes, the second-largest rise on record. With restrictions on travel still in place, emissions from oil are expected to remain below the levels of 2019, but emissions from coal will rise a bit, and reach an all-time high from natural gas. China’s emissions will increase by 6% over 2019, and India’s by 1.4%, but America’s will be 5.6% lower.

The league could have generated billions for the elite teams involved, but fans dismissed it for betraying the roots of the beautiful game and gave it the red card.",2
1590," (CNN)After more than 25 hours of deliberations, a 12-person jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse of all five charges he faced after fatally shooting two people and wounding a third during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last summer. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, were killed, and Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, was wounded. Rittenhouse was charged with five felonies: first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety.The two-week trial -- which captured America's attention and was in many ways emblematic of the divided nation -- featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including Rittenhouse himself, video clips from the night of the shootings and heated exchanges between the attorneys and the judge. And while the jury's decision drew harsh criticism from the victims' loved ones, legal experts say they were not surprised by the verdict. These were the factors experts said helped lead to Rittenhouse's acquittal. Rittenhouse's testimony was keyAmong the trial's most key moments was the testimony from Rittenhouse, who told the court he acted in self-defense when he shot Rosenbaum, who he said threatened him earlier, chased him, threw a bag at him and lunged for his gun. At one point, 18-year-old Rittenhouse broke down in tears while on the stand.""If I would have let Mr. Rosenbaum take my firearm from me, he would have used it and killed me with it and probably killed more people,"" he testified.Rittenhouse referred to the other people he shot at as part of a ""mob"" chasing him, telling the court Huber came at him, struck him with a skateboard, and grabbed his gun. Rittenhouse shot him once in the chest, killing him. Finally, he said he saw Grosskreutz lunge at him and point a pistol at his head, so Rittenhouse shot him, he testified. Defense attorney Mark Richards told reporters Friday in his mind, 'it wasn't a close call' whether to put Rittenhouse on the stand. ""We had a mock jury and we did two different juries, one with him testifying and one without him testifying. It was substantially better when he testified... and that sealed it,"" Richards said. ""If you don't put a client on the stand, you're going to lose, period.""His testimony was key for several reasons, according to legal experts. ""Number one, you humanize him... More important, number two, he explained his uses of force,"" CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. Rittenhouse's testimony gave jurors the ability to hear what he thought at the time and whether he believed he was in danger -- a claim the prosecution, ultimately failed to undermine, former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said.""They (prosecutors) pointed out some sort of minor inconsistencies and things he said on the night of, and said later, but nothing that undermines sort of the core defense argument, which was, he was attacked,"" Honig told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Friday. ""Every time he shot, he was attacked.""""The prosecution did not make enough of a dent in Kyle Rittenhouse,"" Honig added.State did not prove Rittenhouse provoked violenceWhat the trial came down to, according to civil rights attorney Charles F. Coleman Jr. were two competing narratives: one of Rittenhouse being a victim who was attacked, and one of being a vigilante who provoked the violence.""The jury bought the narrative of Kyle Rittenhouse being a victim, they thought that his self-defense claim was a lot stronger than the prosecution's provocation claim,"" he said. Wisconsin law allows the use of deadly force only if ""necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm."" And because Rittenhouse's attorneys claimed self-defense, state law meant the burden fell on prosecutors to disprove Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. And it was an uphill battle to climb from the start, because of the facts in this case, experts said.""(Prosecutors) weren't able to show that his response to each of these men, to each of these sets of threats was unreasonable,"" criminal defense attorney Sara Azari told CNN's Pamela Brown.""When the jury came back a couple days ago and watched the videos... frame by frame, they were looking to see whether Kyle did something to provoke the threat and whether his response to that threat was reasonable in terms of using deadly force and they agreed with the defense that it was,"" Azari added.In addition, testimony from the trial challenged many assumptions previously surrounding the case and even some testimony from the state's witnesses supported Rittenhouse's self-defense claim, said criminal defense attorney Bob Bianchi. Former Marine Jason Lackowski, who testified for the state, said Rosenbaum acted ""belligerently"" and asked to be shot but was not perceived as a serious threat. Richie McGinniss, a video editor with The Daily Caller news site, testified Rosenbaum had lunged for the front of Rittenhouse's rifle moments before he was shot. Grosskreutz, who was wounded, testified he pointed a pistol at Rittenhouse and later clarified to the prosecution during redirect questioning he never intentionally pointed his gun at Rittenhouse.""The prosecution ... has to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt to all 12 jurors. How do you do that when you saw no real provocation going on?"" Bianchi said. ""There wasn't a real trial lawyer ... that didn't sit here and say this is an amazingly good self-defense case.""Prosecutors also took misstepsThere were mistakes the state made as well, including overselling the case by trying to paint Rittenhouse as an active shooter, Honig, the former federal prosecutor, said.In his closing arguments earlier this week, Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said Rittenhouse behaved in a way no reasonable person would, provoked the incident, fired his gun recklessly, lied numerous times and as a result, the crowd had a right ""to try and stop an active shooter.""""Trying to brand Kyle Rittenhouse as an active shooter did not stand up and the defense came back and showed, here he is walking through the streets, he's not shooting indiscriminately, that's what an active shooter does, he's only shooting people who have attacked him first,"" Honig said. Rittenhouse's defense attorney also pointed to the prosecution's active shooter argument during his news conference, saying, ""justice is done when the truth is reached.""""A prosecutor is supposed to seek the truth,"" Richards added. In addition, trying to paint Rittenhouse as provocative because he brought an AR-15 firearm did not work because of the culture of guns in Wisconsin, which aren't necessarily always equated with criminal activity, legal experts told CNN.'You've got to remember you're in a jurisdiction where this is not an unusual thing,"" Bianchi said.Honig added the prosecution team made other mistakes, which led to heated exchanges with Judge Bruce Schroeder. The judge twice admonished Binger for his line of questioning -- once for implicating Rittenhouse's silence after his arrest (a right guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment) and later for touching on questions related to an incident the judge had ruled would not be permitted to come into evidence.""That is an absolute amateur move by the prosecutors,"" Honig said. Jury instructions were consequential, expert saysFinally, the jury instructions also helped lead to Rittenhouse's acquittal, CNN senior legal analyst Laura Coates said.Coates said the instructions said jurors had to look at the case through the eyes of then 17-year-old Rittenhouse, not in hindsight, and assess the reasonableness of his actions.""The jury instructions were really centered around that term 'reasonable.' Defining the word 'reasonable.' And the jury instructions required this jury to look through the lens and perspective of Kyle Rittenhouse. Not Monday morning quarterback, not the jurors, or the court of public opinion in hindsight,"" Coates said. ""What would he reasonably and what did he reasonably believe about the possibility of a lethal threat or harm and grave bodily harm?""That, in combination with having to disprove Rittenhouse's self-defense claim and show he provoked the violence during the chaotic night, meant the""deck was stacked against"" prosecutors, Coates said.""With all that combined, it's not surprising that an acquittal happened, but it came down really to that jury instruction about looking through the eyes of Kyle Rittenhouse,"" Coates said.

1591,"HE WAS HARDLY a capitalist icon. When Bob Marley died in 1981, at the tragically young age of 36, his final words were, apparently, “Money can’t buy life.” But on June 7th his estate, managed by several of his children, announced that money can buy some of the Rastafarian lifestyle—and that this year the Bob Marley museum in Kingston would become one of several “herb houses” in the capital where people can buy its brand of ganja for therapeutic use. The estate’s cannabis brand, Marley Natural, offers various herbs and vapes, including the reggae singer’s favourite strains of pot, “famously blessed with transcendent positivity”. The venture is backed by American investors.
For years Jamaicans have been getting up and standing up for their right to smoke ganja. But it was only six years ago that the island decriminalised the possession of small amounts of cannabis for recreational use and made growing five plants at home perfectly legal. Since 2015 it has also allowed medical, therapeutic, sacramental and scientific use. The law stipulates that any cannabis-related business must be half-owned by Jamaicans.

Large-scale cultivation for recreational use remains illegal, partly because the government is wary of stirring it up with the heart of America. “We didn’t want to be a pariah, so we had to tread carefully,” says Norman Dunn, a minister who chairs the Cannabis Industry Development Taskforce. The law is widely disregarded, however. Jamaica is the largest source of illegal marijuana in the Caribbean; some of that will go to the United States, too.
So the country finds itself in the odd situation of waging war on drugs while simultaneously trying to capitalise on tokes. In the first nine months of 2020 it seemed as if everywhere was war: Jamaican police burned 253 hectares of cannabis plants and seized 26 tonnes of cured marijuana. By contrast Nevada, where recreational use is legal, collected $188m in taxes from cannabis last year.
Red tape is another come-down. Until recently not a single commercial export licence had been granted to ship medical marijuana to European countries where it is legal. Some companies went to Colombia rather than jumping through endless hoops in Jamaica, claims Rory Liu, who got the country’s first processing licence.
The biggest blunder has been the failure to establish a way for local farmers to move away from the illegal industry. Licence fees can be up to $10,000. Then there is the extra cost of security guards and video cameras, says Triston Thompson, a cannabis consultant. Wealthy Jamaicans and foreigners can afford the start-up costs. But Jamaica’s edge comes from a reputation for the quality of plants lovingly reared by Rasta and Maroon growers. If they could more easily cultivate and process ganja legally, then a thriving Jamaican cannabis industry might become more than just a pipe-dream.■",2
1592,"OF ALL CHINA’S achievements in the past two decades, one of the most impressive is the rise of its technology industry. Alibaba hosts twice as much e-commerce activity as Amazon does. Tencent runs the world’s most popular super-app, with 1.2bn users. China’s tech revolution has also helped transform its long-run economic prospects at home, by allowing it to leap beyond manufacturing into new fields such as digital health care and artificial intelligence (AI). As well as propelling China’s prosperity, a dazzling tech industry could also be the foundation for a challenge to American supremacy.
That is why President Xi Jinping’s assault on his country’s $4trn tech industry is so startling. There have been over 50 regulatory actions against scores of firms for a dizzying array of alleged offences, from antitrust abuses to data violations. The threat of government bans and fines has weighed on share prices, costing investors around $1trn.

Mr Xi’s immediate goal may be to humble tycoons and give regulators more sway over unruly digital markets. But as we explain, the Communist Party’s deeper ambition is to redesign the industry according to its blueprint. China’s autocrats hope this will sharpen their country’s technological edge while boosting competition and benefiting consumers.
Geopolitics may be spurring them on, too. Restrictions on access to components made with American technology have persuaded China that it needs to be more self-reliant in critical areas like semiconductors. Such “hard tech” may benefit if the crackdown on social media, gaming firms and the like steers talented engineers and programmers its way. However the assault is also a giant gamble that may end up doing long-term damage to enterprise and economic growth.
Twenty years ago China hardly seemed on the threshold of a technological miracle. Silicon Valley dismissed pioneers such as Alibaba as copycats, until they leapt ahead of it in e-commerce and digital payments. Today 73 Chinese digital firms are worth over $10bn. Most have Western investors and foreign-educated executives. A dynamic venture-capital ecosystem keeps churning out new stars. Of China’s 160 “unicorns” (startups worth over $1bn), half are in fields such as AI, big data and robotics.

In contrast to Vladimir Putin’s war on Russia’s oligarchs in the 2000s, China’s crackdown is not about insiders fighting over the spoils. Indeed, it echoes concerns that motivate regulators and politicians in the West: that digital markets tend towards monopolies and that tech firms hoard data, abuse suppliers, exploit workers and undermine public morality.
Stronger policing was overdue. When China opened up, the party kept a stifling grip on finance, telecoms and energy but allowed tech to let rip. Its digital pioneers used this near absence of regulation to grow astonishingly fast. Didi, which provides transport, has more users than America has people.
However, the big digital platforms also exploited their freedom to trample smaller firms. They stop merchants from selling on more than one platform. They deny food-delivery drivers and other gig workers basic benefits. The party wants to put an end to such misconduct. It is an ambition that many investors support.
The question is how? China is about to become a policy laboratory in which an unaccountable state wrestles with the world’s biggest firms for control of the 21st century’s essential infrastructure. Some data, which the government says is a “factor of production”, like land or labour, may pass into public ownership. The state may enforce interoperability between platforms (so that, say, WeChat cannot continue to block rivals). Addictive algorithms may be more rigorously policed. All this would hurt profits, but might make markets work better.

But make no mistake, the crackdown on China’s unruly tech is also a demonstration of the party’s untrammelled power. In the past its priorities often fell victim to vested interests, including corrupt insiders, and it was constrained by its need to court foreign capital and create employment. Now the party feels emboldened, issuing new rules at a furious pace and enforcing them with fresh zeal. China’s regulatory immaturity is on full display. Just 50 or so people staff its main anti-monopoly agency but they can destroy business models at the stroke of a pen. Denied due process, companies must grin and bear it.
China’s leaders have spent decades successfully defying Western lectures on liberal economics. They may see their clampdown on the technology industry as a refinement of their policy of state capitalism—a blueprint for combining prosperity and control in order to keep China stable and the party in power. Indeed, as China’s population starts to decline, the party wants to raise productivity through state direction, including by automating factories and forming urban mega-clusters.
Yet the attempt to reshape Chinese tech could easily go wrong. It is likely to raise suspicion abroad, hampering the country’s ambitions to sell services and set global tech standards worldwide in the 21st century, as America did in the 20th. Any drag on growth would be felt far beyond China’s borders.
A bigger risk is that the crackdown will dull the entrepreneurial spirit within China. As the economy shifts from making things towards services, spontaneous risk-taking, backed by sophisticated capital markets, will become more important. Several of China’s leading tech tycoons have pulled back from their companies and public life. Wannabes will think twice before trying to emulate them, not least because the crackdown has jacked up the cost of capital.
Startup slowdown
China’s biggest tech firms now trade at an average discount of 26% per dollar of sales relative to American firms. Startups, such as the minnows taking ride-hailing business from Didi with mapping apps, have been nibbling at the government’s main targets. Far from being emboldened by the crackdown, they are likely to feel exposed. Economic development is largely about creative destruction. China’s autocratic leaders have shown that they can manage the destruction. Whether this tech tumult will also foster creativity remains much in doubt. ■",2
1593,"THE SETTING is dramatic. Visitors passing from the harsh midday sun to the dim interior are met with slogans. “We believe that every human is part of the collective conscience,” reads a message on the walls of the Syrian pavilion at the Dubai expo. Why the Syrian government has spent years dropping bombs on many of those humans is not explained.
The $7bn fair is the first “World Expo” in the Middle East. Like much else in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which wants to attract visitors to revive its economy, the expo strives to gloss over politics. Exhibitors are able to present Panglossian visions of themselves to investors and tourists.

Many of the pavilions, intentionally or not, capture something about a country’s character. America puts guests on a moving walkway for an earnest civics lesson. China greets them with a video from Xi Jinping. Visitors to the British one spend most of their time in an orderly queue.
For countries in the region, there is much to gloss over. Lebanon’s pavilion feels like a tourism ad, with large monitors showing glamour shots of the country. Such an exhibit would be impossible in Lebanon itself, where the power went out for 24 hours earlier this month. Some countries have yet to showcase anything. Libya’s is almost empty, with walls that smell of fresh paint and a television playing cartoons. Iraq missed the opening, too.
Egypt is a popular stop. There are a few nods to the past: hieroglyphs and a replica of King Tut’s coffin. Much of it, though, is given over to portraying Egypt as an economic powerhouse, an image at odds with its sluggish private firms. On a giant video screen, a woman in pharaonic garb talks about industrial zones being built along the Suez canal. If Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi is Egypt’s new pharaoh, a fish farm near Suez is apparently his Karnak temple.
No one acknowledges politics, not even occupied Palestine, which allows visitors to touch a piece of Jerusalem’s Dome of the Rock and smell soap made in Nablus. Instead, many countries want to do business. At Iran’s unfinished pavilion, where one door leads to a construction site, space is given over to a sort of bazaar, with companies hawking ceramic tiles and carpets.
Back at the Syrian stall there are booths for firms selling cables and olive oil, and one for Cham Holding, a conglomerate under American and European sanctions. Another space is lined with 1,500 wood panels that were posted to Syrians around the world with instructions to draw their hopes. Some are painted with the regime’s flag, or Bashar al-Assad’s face. Organisers insist they tried to reach a representative sample of the now-sprawling diaspora. Yet none seems to have sent wishes for a less brutal government or accountability for a war that killed hundreds of thousands of their fellow citizens. A neon sign nearby declares, “What you see isn’t all there is”—an apt slogan for the whole expo. ■",2
1594,"IN 1975 Adam Fergusson, a journalist on the Times, published a book called “When Money Dies”. A history of hyperinflation in Germany in the early 1920s, it was written with an eye to what was going on in the then-present day. Inflation in Britain was not at the prices-soaring-day-by-day levels seen in the Weimar Republic. But in 1975 it reached an unprecedented 24%—grim enough for Fergusson’s warning that the experience of inflation was “totally absorbing, demanding complete attention while it lasts” to hit home.
Rapid, continuous increases in prices arbitrarily take wealth away from savers and devalue people’s wages. It is not just the purchasing power of a unit of currency that is eroded; it is the trust in a reliable future on which contracts and capitalism depend. From the early 1970s to the 1980s more than 50% of Americans said “inflation or the high cost of living” was the single biggest problem facing the country.

But by the 1990s the beast seemed to be vanquished. Average rates dropped; so did the number of “inflation surprises” in which the rate spikes (see chart 1). When “The West Wing”, a television show, gave its fictional president a “secret plan to fight inflation” in 1999 it was as a joke, not a plot point. True to Mr Fergusson’s belief that the experience of living with inflation is “forgotten or ignorable when it has gone”, his book fell out of print.

It was republished to acclaim at the end of the 2000s, when post-financial-crisis stimulus packages increased government debt prodigiously, and “quantitative easing”, the process by which trillions of new dollars would be created, started to hit its stride. Many worried that the stage seemed set for prices to surge in a way which had not been seen for a generation.
They did not. Over the 1970s rich-world inflation averaged 10% a year. In the 2010s the rate stayed stubbornly below 2% a year. That is one of the reasons that the small but vocal band of economists and investors that is once again worried about excessive price rises is by and large being ignored. The agenda for a big conference on central banking to be held in February has copious space for financial instability, climate change and inequality but barely any for inflation—despite taking place in Germany, a country which, since Weimar, has all but fetishised sound money.
Indeed a modest rise in inflation, rather than giving central bankers the vapours, would have them sighing with relief. In recent years, and most dramatically during the worst of the crisis this spring, the threat of demand-sapping deflation loomed large, especially in the euro area and Japan. Some want central banks to aim for inflation higher than the 2% target that most of them use, and America’s Federal Reserve has already said that it wants to overshoot its 2% target in the recovery to make up for recent shortfalls. Recent experience suggests that may be hard: interest rates close to zero have left monetary policy hard-put to push inflation back up even to 2%.
Look behind you
But if it is easy to ignore the prophets of doom, it may not be wise. If 2020 has a lesson, it is that problems which many in the world had broadly stopped worrying about can rear up with sudden and terrible force. And those sounding the alarm today are right to point out that the circumstances of the covid pandemic do not offer a simple re-run of 2009’s false alarm.
Some of today’s inflationistas predict a possibly high but transitory spike in prices as consumer spending bounces back from the pandemic. On December 3rd Bill Dudley, who was until 2018 a vice-chairman of the Fed’s interest-rate-setting committee, warned Bloomberg readers that sharp price increases might be necessary “to balance demand with the available supply, which the pandemic has undoubtedly diminished.” The next day David Andolfatto, an economist at the St Louis Fed, warned Americans to “prepare themselves for a temporary burst of inflation.”
Others warn of more persistent inflationary pressure. Economists at Morgan Stanley, a bank, predict “a fundamental shift in inflation dynamics” in America, with inflation rising to the Fed’s 2% target by the second half of 2021 and going on to overshoot it. After a typical recession such a rebound takes three years or more. The most pessimistic group warns that complacent or distracted central bankers will allow such pressures to go unchecked, leading to a decade of stubbornly high inflation comparable to the 1970s.
Three main factors are deemed to be at play: the after-effects of the stimulus measures taken by governments to cope with the pandemic; demographic shifts; and changes in policymakers’ attitudes towards the economy.
Take the stimulus packages first. Monetarism, which was the dominant economic ideology over the period in the 1980s during which inflation was squeezed out of rich-world economies, sees the root cause of inflation as an excessive supply of money. On that basis the fact that nearly a fifth of all the dollars in existence have been created this year clearly looks perturbing. Central-bank balance sheets in America, Britain, Japan and the euro zone have risen by more than 20% of their combined GDP since the crisis began, mostly to buy government debt. This new money is paying for enormous stimulus programmes, including wage subsidies, furlough schemes and expanded welfare benefits that put money in pockets and purses.
This money creation differs from the burst seen after the financial crisis—the burst which, despite warnings, triggered no surge in inflation. That earlier burst began during a prolonged credit crunch. This meant that the new money created by central banks was making up for money that was not being created by bank lending.
This time it is not just “base money”— physical cash and electronic reserves the quantity of which is under central-bank control—which has soared. Measures of “broad money”, which includes households’ bank balances, have, too. Lending to the private sector has risen sharply as firms have borrowed cash to continue operations. After 2009 the broad-money supply rose slowly; today it is spiking (see chart 2).
The private sector will thus find itself flush with cash as vaccinated economies reopen. Households and firms may remain cautious, sitting on their accumulated savings. But amid the joy of reopening they may instead go on a spending spree, making up for all the time not spent in theatres, restaurants and bars during 2020. That would result in a lot of money chasing goods and services that might not be in ample supply, resulting in a period of inflation that would tail off as the purchasing power of the money involved fell, bringing things back towards the status quo.
From the Black Death on
Researchers from the Bank of England who looked at 800 years of (admittedly patchy) records have concluded that inflation does typically rise in the year after a pandemic begins. A recent paper by Robert Barro of Harvard University and colleagues finds that the influenza pandemic of 1918-20 “increased inflation rates at least temporarily”. By the time the effects of the covid-19 pandemic are fully on the wane more firms will have joined the ranks of those which have already gone under and many of the survivors will be struggling to run at full tilt. Thus people’s willingness to spend could easily rebound faster than their opportunities to do so. There is already some evidence of bottlenecks where supply is falling behind demand. The price of shipping an object from one country to another has jumped in recent weeks, while the price of iron ore has risen by more than 60% since the beginning of the year.
This is the risk of which Mr Dudley warns. In the aggregate, though, investors seem unconvinced. The inflation expectations which can be derived from prices in financial markets have recently picked up a little thanks to the good news on vaccines and the prospects for a rebound in the world economy. But they still suggest that investors think next year’s inflation is more likely to be below the 2% central banks target than above it (see chart 3). Lars Christensen, a Danish economist, points out that this means there is a “clash” between the two best-known economic theories associated with the Chicago school. Milton Friedman said sustained growth in the money supply leads to inflation; Eugene Fama argued that market prices fully reflect all available information. “If you believe that we are going to have inflation now...the efficient-markets hypothesis would have to be wrong,” Mr Christensen argues.

Most economists side with the markets and Mr Fama. In general they no longer think about inflation as 1980s monetarists did (indeed even Friedman, late in life, admitted that modern central banking might have severed the link between the money supply and prices). Following the “New Keynesian” framework of the 1990s they believe that the underlying driver of inflation is a combination of the public’s expectations of price rises, which are self-fulfilling, and the health of the labour market. Both currently point to low inflation.
Neither survey data nor the financial markets suggest that the public expects dramatic price rises. And most forecasts suggest it will take some time for employment to find its pre-pandemic level, even in the economies which bounce back most quickly. Goldman Sachs, a bank which has been especially bullish about the prospects for the American economy, does not expect the unemployment rate to fall below 4% until 2024. And America’s economy is expected to recover faster than most. Relatively high unemployment—in the jargon, an “output gap”—will give firms little incentive to increase people’s wages, and thus little need to raise prices. A “projected large output gap should push global core inflation 0.5% percentage points below its pre-crisis levels next year”, argue economists at JPMorgan Chase, another bank.
So even if there is a spending boom, there will be plenty of economic slack around to accommodate it. Some economists bridge the two views, predicting that the economy will get back to speed in fits and starts, some perhaps inflationary. But for most, high joblessness and contained inflation expectations make forecasting continued low inflation a no-brainer.
What, though, if the New Keynesian view is missing key parts of the story? In “The Great Demographic Reversal”, published last summer, Charles Goodhart, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary-policy committee, and Manoj Pradhan of Talking Heads Macro, a research firm, provide an alternative view of the past decades’ low inflation. It was not, they say, the result of a correct diagnosis of the problem leading, in the hands of independent central bankers, to appropriate monetary policy. Rather, it was driven by global demography.
In recent decades the integration of China, Europe’s formerly communist east and other emerging markets into the global trading system provided the world economy with millions of new workers. As bosses found it ever easier to get their labour done in Guangdong or Bratislava the bargaining power of rich-country workers fell, and price rises to cover increased wages became a thing of the past. This fits the finding that much more of the low inflation seen in recent decades has come from stable or falling prices for goods that can have their site of production shifted than has come from services which have to be delivered in situ.

Things are now about to change, the authors claim. As populations in the rich world and China age, the number of dependents per worker will soar, creating a labour shortage in care industries. True, Africa and India have plenty of youngsters. But rich-world politics may further increase the barriers to their migration. Workers in the rich world will thus acquire more bargaining power; wages will rise and prices will rise accordingly. As well as reigniting inflation, these demographic forces will make Western countries more equal, Mr Goodhart and Mr Pradhan argue: another seemingly inexorable trend reversed.
It might seem that the recent experience of Japan, the rich country that has aged the most, puts paid to this idea. Inflation there has long been lower than anywhere else, despite Herculean efforts on the part of the Bank of Japan. Mr Goodhart and Mr Pradhan counter this argument by saying that a “global escape valve” stopped inflationary pressures in Japan from achieving much. Rather than stagnate, investment moved overseas as Japanese manufacturing firms took advantage of plentiful global labour. Cheap imports kept goods inflation down and the offshoring of manufacturing jobs reduced workers’ bargaining power.
In fact, though, wage growth in Japan’s manufacturing industries has been comparatively strong. What is more, the authors concede that Japan’s ageing population has not had quite the effect on the dependency ratio that might be expected—because many more elderly people are now working. The same phenomenon could yet contain inflation elsewhere.

The third argument for fearing a return of inflation is political. It rests on the idea that governments and central banks are becoming more tolerant of inflation, and that they will become even more so as the extent of the pressure on government budgets becomes apparent.
Back in the 1970s presidents and prime ministers were happy to strong-arm central bankers into doing what they wanted. Inflation was tamed only after Paul Volcker proved the Fed’s commitment and independence by pushing America into recession to slow price rises. A new paper by Jonathon Hazell of Princeton University and colleagues argues that post-Volcker “shifts in beliefs about the long-run monetary regime” have proved more important than any other factor in conquering inflation. Their actions in recent decades have built up a firm expectation that central banks will respond to the prospect of inflation rising above its target with higher interest rates, regardless of what politicians and the public might want.
It is possible that these norms are weakening. In recent years there have already been greater attacks on the independence of central banks, such as President Donald Trump’s exhortations that interest rates should stay low. And during the pandemic the relationship between central banks and finance ministries has grown unusually close. After it ends, politicians will face the problem of the debts left behind. Where those debts are long-term, inflation would be a handy way to reduce their real value, easing the strain on budgets. Politicians may be more willing to entertain such an option for the reason identified by Mr Fergusson—that, after a long period of low inflation, people forget how awful it can be. A third of the people currently living in the rich world had not been born when average inflation last exceeded 5%.
Doubting the future
The Fed’s commitment to deliberately allow inflation to exceed 2% during the recovery is Exhibit A for this belief. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), emphasises her mandate is to “support the general economic policies” of the EU, as well as ensure stable prices. Central bankers everywhere now admit, if only under their breath, that as well as maintaining price stability they are also trying to keep governments’ long-term-borrowing costs low in order to facilitate fiscal stimulus. Should inflationary pressure start to rise while they are doing so, will they abandon that effort? Central banks which put up borrowing rates under the current circumstances would undoubtedly face opposition from the finance ministries that would pay the increased costs and suffer in subsequent elections. Inflationistas think that the politicians would win, as in many cases they constitutionally should. Central bankers’ independence is granted by elected politicians.
But this political argument, too, has its weaknesses. The ECB’s independence is protected by treaty, and even though it has become more willing to stimulate in recent years, it still exhibits a hawkish bias, tolerating inflation expectations that are well below target. Elderly people like to vote and tend to dislike inflation, argues Vitor Gaspar of the International Monetary Fund. That should limit any political pressure for higher inflation in ageing societies.
The doves and the markets currently have the better of the argument. But the case for reflation in the world economy is stronger than it was after the global financial crisis. A recovery from the pandemic that is untroubled by excessive inflation looks likely. But it is not guaranteed. ■",2
1595,"New York (CNN Business)The oil market has gone from booming to busting, much to the relief of inflation-weary American drivers ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.US crude tumbled to a fresh seven-week low on Friday, settling at $76.10 a barrel. The slide is good news for American drivers hurt by the seven-year high in gasoline prices — a crunch that has soured consumers' views on the US economy. ""We will definitely see some pricing relief on gasoline at the pump,"" Tom Kloza, president of the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN on Friday, adding that the relief will be ""feather-like as opposed to plunges.""After a relentless rise, the national average gas price has finally leveled off at $3.41 a gallon, according to AAA. That's roughly flat from a week ago.""It looks for now as though the 2021 peaks have been established,"" Kloza said.Lockdown jittersUnfortunately, one of the catalysts for Friday's tumble in the market is another ominous development on the Covid front: Austria announced plans Friday to impose a national lockdown, the first in Europe this fall, in a bid to reverse a spike in Covid-19 cases.The lockdown is raising fears in the oil market of tough new health restrictions elsewhere that will slow the economic comeback and eat into energy demand.""The demand signals today are overwhelmingly bearish,"" Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a note on Friday. ""The risk is real in Europe, especially if Austria's move to lockdown has a domino effect across the continent. If Germany follows suit, sub-$80 price levels may be here to stay.""Will China and America team up?Beyond the lockdown fears, oil markets remain jittery over the specter of the United States and China teaming up to intervene in the previously red-hot energy markets.Since crashing to negative-$40 a barrel in April 2020, US crude has climbed as much as $125 a barrel because supply simply hasn't kept up with demand. OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have only gradually increased production. US oil companies haven't been in a rush to add supply either.A coordinated release from two of the world's biggest energy consumers would have a bigger impact than if the Biden administration acted alone to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Officials in China put out a statement on Friday suggesting that a release of barrels from the country's emergency reserve is on the table.""The bureau is pushing forward with crude oil release-related work at the moment,"" authorities that oversee China's strategic oil reserves said in a statement to CNN.According to a readout published by the White House, US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed during their virtual summit this week the ""importance of taking measures to address global energy supplies.""A coordinated release by the United States and China could also be used as a bargaining tool to get OPEC+ to open up the taps, after months of refusing to do so.""There is firepower with a concerted effort,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.'Short-term fix'Still, this is not a long-term solution, as releasing barrels from emergency reserves doesn't solve the underlying supply-demand mismatch. And these emergency reserves hold a finite amount of oil — crude that is typically reserved for supply shocks, not surging demand amid an economic recovery.Releasing barrels today leaves the reserves with less of buffer for the next crisis, whether it's a hurricane, a conflict in the Middle East or another supply shock.Goldman Sachs reiterated in a new report to clients on Thursday that a coordinated release would ""only provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit.""The Wall Street bank argued this coordinated release is now ""fully priced in,"" meaning the impact to markets has already happened.""In fact, if such a release is confirmed and manages to keep oil prices depressed in the context of low trading activity into year-end, it would create clear upside risks to our 2022 price forecast,"" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote.In other words, at least some on Wall Street are already looking past this emergency intervention — before it even happens — and predicting higher prices ahead.",0
1596,"In its latest outlook the OECD forecast that the world economy will grow by 5.8% this year, a sharp upward revision from its previous estimate. The success of vaccine roll-outs in much of the rich world and the huge stimulus programme in the United States have helped improve global prospects. GDP per person has already returned to pre-pandemic levels in some countries, such as America and South Korea, but the OECD thinks that it will take another year for much of Europe to make up the difference, and another two to five years in Argentina, Mexico and South Africa. Real global output will still be $3trn less by the end of 2022 than it would have been without the crisis.
Brazil’s official statistics office said that the country’s economy returned to pre-pandemic size in the first quarter, when GDP grew by 1.2% over the previous quarter, a faster pace than many economists were expecting. India’s economy was also on the road to recovery in the first quarter, boosted by manufacturing and government spending, but that was before an escalation of covid-19 infections that plagued the country in April and May.

A study by the International Labour Organisation found that a further 108m workers and their families around the world are living on $3.20 or less a day relative to 2019, in purchasing power parity terms, returning working-poverty rates to those of 2015. The recovery will create a net 100m jobs this year, though total employment will still fall short of its pre-crisis level.
The euro zone’s annual rate of inflation leapt to 2% in May, passing the European Central Bank’s target of “below, but close to 2%”, for the first time in more than two years. In Germany it hit 2.4% (up from 1.6% at the start of the year). The ECB, along with the Federal Reserve, insists that surging prices are temporary and will eventually ease. Rising energy costs are a big factor driving inflationary pressures. Petrol (gas) prices reached a seven-year high in America ahead of the Memorial Day holiday.
There is little sign of those prices easing in the near future. This week Brent crude closed at over $70 a barrel for the first time in two years, after OPEC+ (which includes Russia) signalled that the demand for oil will increase later this year. The glut of oil that kept prices low before the pandemic has diminished enough to encourage OPEC to raise output.
Declining cases of covid-19 and the easing of restrictions made Americans more willing to travel over the Memorial Day weekend. Over 1.9m people were screened at America’s airports on both Friday and Monday, the busiest days. That was well up from more than 300,000 on each day last year, but down from 2.5m in 2019.
A cyber-attack on JBS, the world’s biggest meat-processor, halted its operations in America and Australia. It is the third big cyber-attack in recent weeks, following those on a pipeline in America and Ireland’s health-care system. Russian criminal gangs are thought to be behind all three.
A long journey ahead

Transport for London, the city’s public-transport authority, received its third emergency support package from the government since the start of the pandemic. The main reason for TfL’s woes is its shift away from subsidies in recent years towards a reliance on passenger income. That revenue was worth around £5bn ($7bn) before covid-19, but has since dwindled. The government’s funding conditions will lead to fare increases. But there is some light at the end of tunnel: passengers are returning, albeit hesitantly.
Britain began the long process of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, after the 11 countries that comprise the free-trade area agreed on its application. Japan in particular has thrown its support behind Britain’s request in order to give the pact more heft; America withdrew from a precursor agreement during the Trump administration.
A former banker with M.M. Warburg, one of Germany’s oldest private banks, was found guilty of aggravated tax evasion for his participation in the “cum-ex” scandal, where share transactions were conducted at high speed on or just before the day dividend payments were recorded, allowing the participants to claim duplicate tax rebates. The unnamed banker is in his 70s. His conviction will probably be the first of many; there are another 1,000 suspects.
Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, again put the independence of the country’s central bank in doubt with a renewed call for a cut in interest rates in July or August.

1597,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3
1598," (CNN Business)The global chip shortage is making it harder for shoppers to get their hands on some of the most sought after tech gadgets of the holiday season.In the six weeks leading up to Christmas, some of Apple's biggest new products -- including certain iPhone 13 models, some newer iPads and AirPods -- are experiencing delays well into December, depending on model type, colors and the shopper's location, according to analysts and online checks conducted by CNN Business. Last week, some Google Pixel 6 Pro devices were showing late January shipment dates for orders; by Monday, certain models were listed as out of stock on its website. Gaming consoles such as Xbox and PS5 are nearly impossible to find due to delays stemming from Covid-related production challenges and the large gap between supply and demand. The wait times for popular tech products are always changing, but the challenge for shoppers is clear. ""Right now, iPhone 13 and gaming consoles are seeing demand outstrip supply by roughly 20%, which is a telling [sign] for Black Friday and holiday shopping stress,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN Business. ""We have also seen the new AirPods 3 already on back order with shortages into Christmas [week].""The chip shortage, which also has had a major impact on the auto industry, also presents a massive challenge for tech products. For customers, it could require rethinking how early to shop and which specs and products they're willing to live without. For companies, it risks hurting revenue for the all-important holiday sales season and cutting into the sales momentum for some of their recently launched products. Take Apple (AAPL), which is known for having a sophisticated global supply chain to make its products. The iPhone 13, introduced in September, runs on Apple's own A15 Bionic chip, which drives some of its new flagship camera features and an improved battery life. But it also relies on other companies for chips that power certain features, such as displays, power management and USB connectivity. In late October, Apple said chip shortages and manufacturing disruptions tied to Covid-19 slashed $6 billion off its revenue last quarter. It's also reportedly reallocating some of the chips originally planned for iPads to the iPhone to help meet demand. But this means wait times for iPads could get longer.Tech companies such as Samsung (SSNLF) and Microsoft (MSFT) have cited supply chain constraints on recent earnings calls. Some chipmakers have warned that demand will outpace supply through at least 2022.""We are seeing shortages across the board but the premium devices -- which require more chips for power management solutions, micro-controls and certain features -- will be especially hard to find,"" said Gaurav Gupta, a vice president focusing on the semiconductor industry at market research firm Gartner. As of last week, for example, iPhone 13 and iPhone mini models were shipping at faster rates than their Pro counterparts. Apple and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Google, Nintendo and Sony also did not respond to requests for comment.Meanwhile, finding one of the newer gaming consoles -- such as NIntendo Switch OLED, PS5 and XBox Series -- is even harder. All these products are out of stock on their company websites. On Sony's website, shoppers can register ""for an opportunity to purchase"" a PS5 via a special invitation. Some retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy are offering access to ""restock events"" for paying members of their subscription clubs. Amazon, which hasn't been charging for early access to gaming consoles, lets shoppers sign up for text messages when they come back in stock -- before quickly selling out again.Filomena Iovino, research analyst at technology intelligence firm ABI Research, said shoppers may have better luck getting certain products depending on where they live.""Geographically, Apple knows its strongest markets for iPhone sales, and these will be the ones prioritized to receive new product shipments,"" Iovino said. ""This may result in a lack of availability, or delayed availability, in lower-tier markets, but should not impact price.""As a general rule, however, customers everywhere should be prepared to shop early and be flexible. ""If someone wants a tech gadget to give for the holidays, buy it now,"" Gupta added. ""Some items might ship in December; some might get extended to January, depending on the product. The more you customize it, the more difficult it will become to buy that gadget.""",0
1599,"A picture showing a grinning Prince Andrew was on display at Jeffery Epstein's notorious 'Pleasure Palace' where he was accused of molesting teenage girls.
The image, which sat next to a framed photograph of billionaire paedophile Epstein at his former Florida retreat in Palm Beach, shows a smiling Andrew apparently in military uniform in his younger years.
The Duke of York, 61, had previously denied making frequent visits to Epstein's Florida home, despite the former housekeeper Juan Alessi claiming Andrew spent 'weeks at a time' at the property when he was working there.
Sources warned the revelation of a picture being proudly displayed at Epstein's home was 'incredibly damaging' for the embattled royal.
One told the Sun: 'Epstein cultivated powerful friends and would show them off in pictures around all of his homes.
'This is incredibly damaging for Prince Andrew because it shows how highly Jeffrey prized his friendship with a senior member of the Royal Family. His picture was shown off in Jeffrey's home like a trophy.'
Sources indicated the scandal-hit royal faces further public scrutiny as news of the picture emerged.
The source continued: 'Andrew's reputation is hit every time something like this emerges - and he is already facing another year of further lurid headlines.'
In his 2019 Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew admitted he had visited Epstein's Florida home, but denied making repeated visits.
He explained: 'I definitely did not visit his Palm Beach house three or four times a year, absolutely not. In total, probably four times in total throughout the time that I knew him.
'In fact probably that was the place that...if you see what I mean, he was in the house more there than in other...in other places that I was at. But it was usually because I was going...I was going through and on somewhere else so it was a day, that was it.'  
Other newly released pictures showed the financier donning a kilt as he poses with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is pictured elsewhere riding a motorbike near Scotland's Skibo Castle. 
Friday marked the latest development in the Epstein saga, as the Duke of York faces a US lawsuit from Virginia Roberts Giuffre who claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew.
The Duke of York also faced a fresh headache this week when campaigners and experts warned his finances should be investigated by MPs and tax authorities.
Prince Andrew faced mounting scrutiny on Tuesday over whether he broke the Royal Family’s conduct rules by accepting a £1.5million off-shore payment from Tory donor and long-term friend David Rowland.
The Queen’s scandal-hit second son received the payment days before he paid off a loan from the financier’s own Luxembourg bank.
Buckingham Palace conduct rules state that royals should ‘never accept gifts of money, or money equivalent, in connection with an official engagement or duty’.
The Duke of York has previously been accused of attending naked pool parties and receiving massages by Epstein's former butler Juan Alessi, 70.  
Alessi, who started working for Epstein in 1991, has previously been interviewed by the FBI, police and victims' lawyers and said the Prince stayed for 'weeks at a time' in a sworn statement to Palm Beach police in 2005.  
Prince Andrew has consistently denied all sexual allegations made against him.  
Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges that alleged he abused women and girls under the age 18 at the Florida estate and his Manhattan mansion in the early 2000s. 
The waterfront property became the epicentre where he groomed and sexually assaulted underage girls and women as part of a sprawling sex trafficking scheme, prosecutors said.
The house was where the crimes that would eventually lead to his downfall were first reported in 2005.
Epstein had been recruiting underage girls for 'massages' from Palm Beach high school and one eventually confessed to her mother what was going on, who then went to the police.
The girls would be hired to massage Epstein in their underwear or totally naked. Often the massages progressed to sexual touching as Epstein allegedly used vibrators on the girls and masturbated.
He paid them hundreds of dollars at a time with another $200 going to other schoolgirls who recruited them to go to mansion on Palm Beach's El Brillo Way.
Dozens of victims were underprivileged middle and high school girls recruited in and around Palm Beach County between 1998 and 2006.
Earlier this year, demolition crews ripped down the notorious Palm Beach mansion where the financier sexually assaulted young girls. 
The property, which had stood since 1952 and was bought by Epstein in 1990 for around £2million, included a main house, a pool cabana building and another staff house - all of which were demolished.  
Developer Todd Michael Glaser purchased the sprawling Palm Beach estate for $18.5million (£13.7m) and he sighed 'finally' as the first bulldozers began raising the house of horrors to the ground on April 18.
Glaser, who has previously said it would be personally satisfying to tear down the mansion due to its horrific history, said he plans to replace it with a 14,000-square-foot 'Art Moderne home'.",-2
1600,"THE ROMANS perfected concrete, and their legacy still stands in the form of the magnificent roof of the Pantheon, the world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome. Since it was completed in around 125AD by the Emperor Hadrian, an awful lot more concrete has been poured—some 30bn tonnes every year, at the moment, to put up buildings, roads, bridges, dams and other structures. The grey stuff has become the most widely used construction material on the planet, and demand is growing.
This is bad news for global warming. The problem is that concrete’s crucial ingredient, cement, which is mixed with sand, gravel and water to make the stuff, is responsible for a huge amount of greenhouse-gas emissions. Taking in its various stages of production, the 5bn tonnes of cement produced each year account for 8% of the world’s anthropogenic CO2 emissions. If the cement industry were a country it would be the third-largest emitter in the world, after China and America.

So far, concrete has few practical alternatives. The development of cross-laminated, “engineered”, timber—which, being produced from wood, can be a renewable resource—is gaining interest, even for some high-rise buildings. But compared with concrete, engineered timber remains, for now, a novelty. Concrete’s biggest users, especially China, which makes more than half of the world’s cement, are not about to stop employing it. Hence cleaning up the industry might seem a hopeless task. But it isn’t, for technologies are being developed to make concrete greener. Green enough, perhaps, for it to go from adding CO2 to the atmosphere, to subtracting it.

The place to start is where emissions are greatest. Cement production begins with the quarrying of limestone, the main component of which is calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This is mixed with clay and passed through a rotating kiln at more than 1,400ºC in a process called calcination. The heat drives off the carbon and part of the oxygen, which combine to form CO2. The remaining lumps, called clinker, are made of molecular complexes of calcium oxide and silica, known collectively as calcium silicates. The clinker is then cooled and milled into cement. More than half the emissions involved in cement-making are a consequence of calcination, and most of the rest result from burning coal and other fossil fuels to power the process (see chart). All told, nearly one tonne of CO2 is released for every tonne of fresh cement.
Hot stuff
The inevitability of calcination’s creation of CO2 makes capturing the gas before it can enter the atmosphere, and storing it away, the most effective approach to decarbonise the cement industry, according to a study by Paul Fennell of Imperial College, London, and his colleagues, published earlier this year in Joule. The captured CO2 could be held underground or used by other industries—for instance to make synthetic fuel (see box overleaf). But it might also be injected back into concrete at the point when it is being mixed with water to cure it. Water promotes chemical reactions that cause cement to harden. CO2 has a similar effect and, in the process, gets locked up as calcium carbonate.
In fact, reversing calcination in this way makes concrete stronger than if water alone is used. So, not only is some of the original emission thus dealt with, less cement is needed for a given job, lowering overall emissions still further. McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons reverse calcination could, at present, sequester up to 5% of cement’s emissions. As the technology improves it expects that might rise to 30%.
Several companies are starting down this route. CarbonCure, a Canadian firm, has fitted equipment which injects CO2 into ready-mixed concrete to more than 400 plants around the world. Its system has been used to construct buildings that include a new campus in Arlington, Virginia, for Amazon, an online retailer (and also a shareholder in CarbonCure), and an assembly plant for electric vehicles, for General Motors, in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
At present the CO2 used by CarbonCure has been captured by industrial-gas companies. But firms are developing equipment intended to collect the gas directly from cement kilns. And Calix, based in Sydney, Australia, is working on an electrically powered system which heats the limestone indirectly, from the outside of the kiln rather than the inside. That enables pure CO2 to be captured without having to clean up combustion gases from fuel burnt inside the kiln—so, if the electricity itself came from green sources, the resulting cement would be completely green.
A pilot plant using this technology has run successfully as part of a European Union research project on a site in Belgium operated by Heidelberg Cement, a German firm that is one of the world’s biggest cement-makers. A larger demonstration plant is due to open in 2023, in Hanover, to help scale up the technology.
Energising rubbish
Another approach—less green, but still better than using fossil fuels—is to substitute some of the coal burnt in kilns with municipal and industrial waste. Several firms are already doing this. Cemex, a Mexican building-materials giant, for example, makes a kiln fuel called Climafuel out of municipal waste that has been denuded of its recyclable substances. This is rich, in the form of plant material (“biomass”), in carbon that has recently been in the atmosphere, and is simply returning there, rather than having been dug up as fossil fuel. Up to 60% of the coal used by some of Cemex’s British cement plants has been replaced with Climafuel.
Companies are also looking at ways to substitute some of the cement in concrete with other materials. Many add fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, or crushed slag from the blast furnaces used to make iron. But neither of these approaches is sustainable in the long run. As Peter Harrop, boss of IDTechEx, a firm of analysts in Cambridge, England, and the co-author of a new report on the future of concrete and cement, observes, coal use is dwindling and steel production aspires to move to newer, cleaner technologies.
For Dr Harrop, an important part of the answer is to “tech-up” concrete in ways which mean that less of it will be needed to do particular jobs. This means adding things like synthetic and natural fibres—or even graphene, a substance stronger than steel that consists of single-layer sheets of carbon atoms. Only small amounts are needed to produce beneficial results.
Graphene and other reinforcement will lead to new, ultra-high-performance concretes, which Dr Harrop thinks will be particularly suitable for 3D printing. This builds up precise layers of material under robotic control, and greatly reduces waste. “Using much less cement is a very important part of the answer,” he adds, especially as cement production looks otherwise set to double over the next 20 years.
Additives can also make concrete last longer and reduce the need for maintenance. At the University of Michigan, Victor Li and his colleagues use synthetic and natural fibres, along with CO2 injection, to produce a bendable concrete they call Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC). The internal structure of this material was inspired by nacre, a flexible material commonly called “mother of pearl” that coats the insides of the shells of molluscs such as abalone and oysters.
Adding such flexibility to concrete lets bridges and roads cope more easily with heavy traffic, and improves the earthquake resistance of tall buildings. ECC develops only tiny surface cracks when it ages. Dr Li says it is thus better at keeping water out and preventing corrosion of reinforcing steel bars inside. Such corrosion can cause reinforced-concrete structures to crumble within a few years of their construction—sometimes resulting in their collapse.
To zero and beyond
Substitution of materials could go still further. Solidia, a firm in New Jersey, makes cement containing calcium silicates with a higher ratio of silica to calcium oxide than the standard “Portland” variety. This has two consequences. One is that Solidia’s process requires less heat (and therefore less fossil fuel) than conventional calcination, and so releases less CO2 in the first place. The other is that, when mixed into concrete, Solidia’s silica-rich silicates can be cured more rapidly than regular cement by using captured CO2 instead of water. Solidia is working on applications for its cement with one of its investors, LafargeHolcim, a Swiss building-supplies giant.
Taking all these developments into account, how green could concrete get? Dr Fennell says it would be reasonably easy to reduce the industry’s CO2 emissions to around 80% of present levels per tonne of concrete produced by better energy use and the modification of materials. But companies could really pull the stops out if they moved to kilns largely or entirely powered by biomass, such as wood. The carbon in this would, until recently, have been CO2 in the air. If, after being turned back into that gas by being burned in the kiln, it was stored away and not released, the consequence, as new trees grew to replace those consumed, would be a net flow of carbon out of the atmosphere.
This sort of system, called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), is one way climate modellers imagine providing the “negative emissions” needed for net-zero or net-negative emissions targets. BECCS-based electricity generation is often talked of, but BECCS might actually be better suited to cement-making—because in a carbon-conscious world the CO2 capturing equipment will already be there, dealing with results of calcination. And if that happened, one of the pariahs of global warming might thus redeem itself by helping alleviate the damage being done to the planet, and so leave behind a legacy as impressive in its way as that of the Romans. ■

1601,"A FORMER FRENCH president, Nicolas Sarkozy, summed it up best: tough nuclear diplomacy with Iran, he said in 2007, was the best way to avoid the catastrophic choice between “an Iranian bomb or the bombing of Iran”. To escape this dilemma President Joe Biden has been trying to revive the nuclear agreement with Iran that Barack Obama negotiated in 2015 and Donald Trump tore up three years later.
But Iran is not making it easy. It refused to speak directly to American officials in the six rounds of talks in Vienna that ended in June (it negotiated instead with European, Russian and Chinese intermediaries). It has not resumed formal negotiations since, citing the need for personnel changes after the election as president in June of Ebrahim Raisi, a hardliner. Talks could resume in November, Iran says.

Iran is spinning up a growing stock of 60% enriched uranium, which is a hair’s breadth away from bomb-grade stuff. The acceleration has been helped by Iran’s deployment of more, and more sophisticated, centrifuges to purify the fissile material. Other alarming developments include the conversion of enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium metal—for which the most likely use is in bombs—and the hampering of inspections by the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency.
All told, Iran’s “breakout time”—the time it would need to make one bomb’s-worth of highly enriched uranium—has shrunk to about a month, calculates David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security, a think-tank. American officials put it at “a few months”. Either way, it is much shorter than the year or more that the world enjoyed when the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was in force. (Putting a nuclear warhead on a missile would take perhaps another two years.)
Among Iran-watchers in Washington, there is a sense of foreboding about an approaching showdown. “The runway is getting shorter,” says Antony Blinken, the secretary of state. On October 13th he warned that America “is prepared to turn to other options” to prevent an Iranian bomb—without saying what these might be.
Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is blunter: “Iran’s nuclear programme has hit a watershed moment. And so has our tolerance,” he told the UN General Assembly last month. Israel makes little secret of its covert campaign to assassinate Iran’s nuclear scientists and sabotage its facilities. “Operations to destroy Iranian capabilities will continue—in various arenas and at any time,” said Israel’s military chief, Aviv Kochavi. Iran is the main subject of a flurry of diplomatic meetings, including one between Mr Blinken, Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, and his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed.
The looming crisis was predictable from the day Mr Trump withdrew from the JCPOA, calling it “the worst deal ever”. The deal had placed limits on the Iranian nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of many, but not all, international economic sanctions. Mr Trump’s new barrage of sanctions was intended to exert “maximum pressure”. But it failed to compel Iran to accept more stringent terms. Nor did it halt the country’s development of ballistic missiles, or its support for client militias around the Middle East.
Mr Biden campaigned on a promise to restore the JCPOA. In office, he retained most of Mr Trump’s sanctions in the hope of preserving America’s bargaining power. But as the nuclear programme accelerates, it is Iran that is now exerting “maximum pressure” on Mr Biden, argues Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank.
In Iran’s view, America has proven itself untrustworthy, as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has long warned. The economic benefits of the JCPOA were short-lived. And Iran thinks it has withstood the worst economic pressure that America can apply. Sanctions, compounded by covid-19 and oil prices that until recently were low, have hurt a lot. The economy contracted by 6% in 2018 and 7% in 2019. The rial has lost 85% of its value since 2017 and annual inflation recently surged to 45%.
But now the economy is improving. The IMF estimated in April that it would grow by 3% this year, and that was before the recent spike in oil prices. China has become the biggest buyer of Iran’s oil, and is incorporating it into its Belt and Road infrastructure scheme. Russia is talking of integrating Iran into a Eurasian trade group.
Regionally, too, Iran has become more powerful. It has helped to save Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and defended its friends in Iraq from the jihadists of Islamic State. To the south, its Houthi allies in Yemen have forced a Saudi-led military coalition to seek a way out of the war. In Afghanistan, the Americans have been chased away by the Taliban. Even America’s allies in the Gulf have started trying to patch up relations with the theocracy.
Iran claims it seeks to build only a nuclear-power industry. But it seems determined at least to develop the wherewithal to make nuclear bombs at short notice. The JCPOA was hardly a permanent solution to the problem. It allowed Iran to continue enrichment and to experiment with more-sophisticated centrifuges, but under tight limits. “Sunset clauses” would remove most of these restrictions after eight, ten and 15 years (a tightened inspection regime would go on indefinitely). These compromises provoked intense opposition by the Republicans and parts of the Democratic Party, whipped up by Mr Bennett’s predecessor, Binyamin Netanyahu.
The Biden administration at first sought an agreement that would be “longer and stronger” than the original. Iran, arguing that America had to atone for reneging on the JCPOA, has also demanded better terms, not least that America should move first by lifting all Trump-era sanctions.
Such a more-for-more deal seems beyond reach. The likeliest option is what Mr Blinken calls “a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA”. But that is losing its appeal, too. Even if stocks of highly enriched uranium are shipped out of Iran and centrifuges are dismantled, Iran has acquired valuable know-how that cannot be unlearnt. Mr Albright thinks the JCPOA can no longer restore the one-year breakout time. Moreover, the sunset clauses mean that Iran would be allowed to expand its enrichment programme in 2025.
Although the Biden administration does not intend to submit any agreement with Iran for congressional approval (just as the Obama administration skirted Congress with the JCPOA), hawkish congressmen are trying to find ways to oblige it to do so. Mr Biden will be hoping that some opponents, having seen the dangerous consequences of an unconstrained Iran, will support a deal. Under Mr Bennett, Israel has acquiesced to the talks for now; some Israeli officials see merit in the JCPOA. But some are privately expressing dismay about the apparent lack of an American Plan B, including military options. One idea floated by Israel is a strategy of “death by a thousand cuts”—conducting many small military and diplomatic actions, short of open air strikes.
Jim Risch, a Republican senator, warns Mr Biden that a revived JCPOA is bound to be repudiated by a future Republican president. His answer? Tighten the economic noose and prepare for the worst. “If the Iranians get close to getting nuclear weapons, this administration needs to think: what are they going to do when they get the call from the Israelis?” ■",2
1602,"IN 1995 AUSTRALIA’S Northern Territory enacted the world’s first law explicitly allowing assisted dying. It said that terminally ill, mentally competent adults who wanted to die could ask a doctor for help, using lethal drugs. The law sparked outrage. Within months the federal government had overturned it. Yet today five of Australia’s six states have assisted-dying laws.
The Economist first made the case for assisted dying in 2015. We argued that freedom should include the right to choose the manner and timing of one’s own death, while also cautioning that the practice should be carefully monitored and regulated to avoid abuses. Since then, it has become more widely available. Assisted dying is now legal in one form or another in a dozen countries, and the trend seems likely to continue. Last week New Zealand enacted a euthanasia law for the terminally ill after 65% of voters backed it in a referendum. The same week Portugal’s parliament passed a broader law. Assisted dying is still illegal in Britain, but the House of Lords is debating a bill to allow it.

The number of people who die this way is increasing, though still small. In the Netherlands it rose from roughly 1,800 in 2003 to nearly 7,000 in 2020, or 4% of all deaths. As more countries liberalise, the global total will rise further.
Many people object to assisted dying on religious grounds: some faiths deem suicide a sin. Others worry that safeguards will prove insufficient, or that legalisation is a slippery slope. Critics have long predicted that families exhausted by the demands of caring for sick, elderly relatives will place undue pressure on them to end their lives, or that cash-strapped states will encourage the most expensive terminally ill patients to hurry up and die.
Yet such horrors do not seem to have come to pass. In places with the longest experience of assisted dying, charities that represent the elderly or disabled have not reported any abuse. It is conceivable that some has taken place unobserved, but scrutiny has been intense and in most countries permission to help someone die is revoked if there is even a hint of coercion. Fears that the poor and marginalised might be hastened to their ends have also proved to be unfounded. In America, the Netherlands and Switzerland the overwhelming majority of those who choose an assisted death are educated and middle-class.
Far from being too lax, the rules have often been too restrictive. The Australian state of Victoria, for example, bars doctors from mentioning assisting dying to their patients. The aim is to avoid coercion, but the consequence is that many sufferers do not know that it is an option. In some jurisdictions only those with less than six months to live are allowed help to die. Thus, patients can be terminally ill and in intense pain, but unless a doctor estimates that the end is very near, they cannot end their own suffering. In some cases the diagnosis comes too late. In Victoria in the first six months of 2021 no cases were withdrawn because the patient decided not to proceed, but in 90 cases the patient died before receiving relief. Some countries, such as Spain and Colombia, have liberal laws in theory, but in practice health authorities are reluctant to let anyone make use of them. Last week in Spain a desperate 83-year-old threw herself out of a window after her repeated requests for euthanasia were refused.
Canada offers a better model, because it provides more leeway for individuals to make their own choices. Anyone whose suffering is unbearable can choose an assisted death. They do not have to be terminally ill. And, uniquely, the question of what constitutes “unbearable” suffering is for the patients themselves to decide, so long as they are of sound mind. There is an assessment period of 90 days for those whose deaths are not “reasonably foreseeable”, to allow them to explore all other alternatives. In many cases, simply having the option of an assisted death gives people a sense of comfort and control. In Oregon a third of those people who receive the prescribed lethal medication ultimately choose not to take it.
Even as more societies accept the principle of assisted dying, hard questions remain. Some people worry that its availability may prompt health services to skimp on palliative care. But that is not ordained. Canada’s assisted-dying bill was explicitly linked to increased funding for palliative and long-term care.
If assisted dying becomes common, will old people who require round-the-clock care feel more social pressure to choose death? Many already worry that they are a burden on their children or carers. Some may feel additional guilt if continuing to live is seen as an individual choice, rather than the blind workings of fate. This is a genuine concern. But the possibility that some may agonise over whether to die should not trump the certainty that others will suffer unendurable pain if their freedom to choose is denied.
The trickiest questions arise when an individual’s capacity to make an informed choice is in doubt. Some people with mental disorders have suicidal thoughts that come and go. For them, the bar should be very high. Doctors must be sure they can distinguish between a temporary mental-health crisis and a sustained, considered wish to die. If in doubt, they should offer treatment aimed at helping the patient to live.
Free to choose, to the end
Dementia poses the hardest problem of all. Someone diagnosed with the condition may make a living will, asking for an assisted death when it becomes severe. But they may change their mind. Such a document should never be used to kill someone against their wishes, and if those wishes are unknowable, they should be left to live. Assisted dying should be only for those who can make an informed decision at the time they take the drugs.
No rules in this area are perfect. All should be subject to revision in the light of new evidence about how they work in practice, or to take account of medical advances. But the overall principle—that individuals are entitled to choose how they end their lives—is, we believe, a sound one. The evidence from countries that allow assisted dying is that abuses remain largely hypothetical, whereas the benefits are real and substantial. It relieves suffering, and restores a measure of dignity to people at the end of their lives. ■
Correction (November 12th 2021): An earlier version of this article stated that there is a cooling off period of ten days for patients who choose to have an assisted death in Canada. This is incorrect. There is an assessment period of 90 days for those whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable. Sorry.",2
1603,"The leaders of the G7 countries headed to the Cornish resort of Carbis Bay for a summit, their first in two years and the first for Joe Biden as America’s president. Ahead of the summit G7 finance ministers met in London, where they proposed the biggest shake-up of corporate tax since the 1920s, backing a minimum global rate of at least 15% and a clampdown on companies that park profits in tax havens. But the proposals will need the support of other countries and will be a hard sell in China and India, among other places.

Democrats had to rethink their plan to pass comprehensive legislation on electoral reform, known as the For the People Act, when Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator from West Virginia, said he would not support it because it lacked Republican support. Mr Manchin also definitively ruled out backing any attempt to weaken the filibuster, another headache for the Democrats in a Senate that is split 50-50.
America’s border agency intercepted 180,034 illegal migrants in May, a new 21-year high.

With just 50.2%, a lead of 70,000 out of 17.5m votes cast, he has a weak mandate and will preside over a bitterly divided country. His conservative opponent, Keiko Fujimori, claimed there had been fraud, although there is little evidence of this.

A court in Moscow ruled that two organisations connected to Alexei Navalny, a jailed opposition leader in Russia, were “extremist”, and thus should be shut down and their members barred from standing in elections. The move, which follows a change in the law that came into effect just five days earlier, is clearly aimed at preventing supporters of Mr Navalny from running in parliamentary elections expected in September. The hearing was held behind closed doors.

1604,"THE GRAND HOTEL on Vienna’s Ringstrasse, the city’s elegant main boulevard, is a felicitous spot for nuclear diplomacy. It is not just the opulent surroundings or the unlimited coffee. The hotel was also the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the world’s nuclear watchdog, for 22 years until 1979. Yet the diplomats who have gathered there for six rounds of talks since April, most recently on June 20th, have had little luck so far. And time may be running short.

America and Iran—indirectly, via Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union—are discussing how to revive the multinational nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), that was signed in 2015 and abandoned by President Donald Trump three years later. In response to American sanctions, Iran has breached the deal’s provisions by testing advanced centrifuges and accumulating enriched uranium, among other forbidden steps. The IAEA estimated in May that Iran had produced over 3,000kg of uranium enriched up to 5% purity (see chart), enough for several bombs if enriched further. Over 70kg is now also enriched to over 20%, which is most of the way to weapons-grade.

Over the past year America, under President Joe Biden, and Iran have each said that they are willing to return to the terms of the original deal if the other does so, too. “We think almost all the agreement documents are ready,” said Iran’s deputy foreign minister after the latest round. There is “a new level of optimism”, enthused the EU’s envoy to the UN on June 30th. Russia’s foreign ministry reckons that a deal may be done by July 14th, the JCPOA’s sixth anniversary. Yet reinstating the original terms is not as easy as it sounds, since circumstances have changed so much in six years.
It does not help that Iran is in the midst of a political transition. Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline nationalist, is due to replace Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist, as Iran’s president on August 3rd. Mr Raisi and his allies are more hostile to America and the West than the current government is. That does not mean a deal is impossible—it was, after all, another hardline president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who began the talks that eventually led to the JCPOA. But Mr Raisi’s election does complicate things.
Mr Rouhani’s government has “very little incentive” to devote its last month in office to frantic diplomacy, says Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi of the Royal United Services Institute, a British think-tank. Any political rewards would be distant, since the next election—for Iran’s parliament—is not due for three years. Nor is there any guarantee that the new government will fully implement any deal it inherits, says Dr Tabrizi.
Iran’s domestic politics are not the only hurdle in the way of an agreement. “We still have serious differences that have not been bridged,” warned a senior American official speaking anonymously to reporters last month. “Whether it’s the nuclear steps that Iran needs to take to come back into compliance, the sanctions relief that the US will be offering, or the sequence of steps that both sides would be taking.”
Both sides now accept that they could return to the deal in a series of concurrent steps rather than waiting for the other to do everything first. But Iran has said it wants America to remove all sanctions imposed by Mr Trump. America retorts that it will only lift those covered by the JCPOA. In March the Biden administration imposed new sanctions on two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is those sorts of sanctions, “economically inconsequential but highly politically sensitive”, that are most challenging, says Henry Rome of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy. They include America’s labelling of the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group, and sanctions against Mr Raisi himself.
On June 30th Majid Takht Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, said that the country wanted “assurances that...the US will not, once again, withdraw from the JCPOA”. American officials say it would be impossible to provide such certainty, not least because the JCPOA could not be turned into a binding treaty without support from two-thirds of the Senate. Republicans, who make up half the assembly, bitterly oppose the deal. In any case, Mr Trump also showed that a president could walk away from long-standing treaties.
Western countries have their own complaints. They argue that although Iran has portrayed its breaches of the deal as remedial and reversible, it has also gained valuable knowledge by, among other things, operating advanced centrifuges and manufacturing uranium metal (the solid form used in reactors or bombs, as opposed to the gaseous compound used during enrichment). The JCPOA was supposed to defer such activity to later years, thus slowing Iran’s nuclear progress. America now wants Iran to agree to follow-on talks that would not only extend the deal’s provisions but also cover issues such as Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for militant groups in the region. Mr Raisi says those things are “non-negotiable”.
The impasse is especially dangerous because Iran is determined to build up its leverage, not only by steadily expanding its nuclear activity, thus shrinking the time it would take to build a bomb, but also by threatening to make its programme less transparent. In February Iran repudiated several of the JCPOA’s tough inspection provisions, such as the installation of cameras at nuclear sites, but promptly agreed to a “temporary technical understanding” with the IAEA to preserve some access.
Those stop-gap measures were renewed twice but expired on June 24th, days after the latest talks in Vienna ended. Iran’s government has yet to decide whether to extend them—and hints that it may delete the data on cameras. The intention may be to make America sweat, but it certainly erodes trust. On July 1st Reuters, a news agency, reported that Iran had restricted the IAEA’s access to Natanz, its main enrichment site, following suspected Israeli sabotage there in April.
For all the positive talk emanating from Vienna, there is also anxiety about how high the stakes are becoming. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy, says renewing the Iran-IAEA understanding would ”avoid uncertainties which can have unjustifiable long-lasting negative effects”. Mark Fitzpatrick, a retired American diplomat, is blunter: “Iran is playing with fire.” ■

1605,"OXFORD NANOPORE’S MinION is a tiny but powerful device. When a hotel worker in Sydney tested positive for covid-19 in March last year, the portable DNA sequencer traced the infection to a flight attendant for an American airline, avoiding a general lockdown. The success of biotech firms—another celebrity is BioNTech, of Covid-19 vaccine fame—is sucking capital into life sciences. When such companies expand, they do so not with offices or shops but by means of white-walled, shiny-surfaced scientific laboratories.
Commercial-property investors have long banked on offices, retail and industrial buildings. Less conventional assets like mobile-phone towers were the preserve of specialists. Now the big guns of real estate are competing over them too. Thus laboratory space has become commercial real-estate’s hottest property, along with other facilities that power the digital economy. Data centres and infrastructure that connect smartphones are booming.

The investors’ motivation is clear. The pandemic convulsed commercial-property prices globally. American retailers closed nearly 15,000 shops in 2020. By mid-October, with people attached to remote work, offices were only a third full. The risk profile of some conventional property assets has deteriorated sharply.
In contrast, demand for assets like labs and data centres has never been stronger—a trend visible before the coronavirus began to spread. As rent collections for shops and restaurants plummeted last year, data traffic from virtual meetings and online shopping exploded. Companies that use the underlying data centres and mobile towers are demanding more of them. These digital-economy winners look as safe as houses.

The shift is reflected in the changing make-up of America’s ten largest real-estate investment trusts (REITS). A decade ago the most valuable such vehicle was Simon Property Group, the country’s biggest mall owner. Today it is American Tower, a fast-expanding owner of tens of thousands of phone masts around the world. Five of the top ten REITS currently manage either data centres or mobile towers.
The loudest buzz currently surrounds life-sciences and lab space. Investors are flooding the health-care sector with capital. Drug makers, medical-equipment manufacturers and other life-sciences firms have raised a record $103bn in venture capital so far this year, up from $63bn in 2019, according to JLL, a property consultancy. A generous slice of capital is going into property. JLL estimates that up to $87bn is now being directed towards life-sciences real estate worldwide. That is equivalent to a third of all global spending on commercial property in the second quarter of this year.
Landmark deals are cropping up frequently. In October GIC, Singapore’s sovereign-wealth fund, purchased a 40% stake in Oxford Science Park from Magdalen College, part of Oxford University; the deal valued the park at ten times its worth just five years ago. Blackstone, a private-equity firm, recently doubled its ownership of life-sciences floorspace in Britain, investing over $1bn in two new sites. Shares of life-science REITS are booming.
By now, lab space is growing hard to come by. In Boston, where much of it in America is held, less than 5% of labs were available in the third quarter.In the Golden Triangle, as the area between London, Oxford and Cambridge is known, premises have run out. The Harwell life-sciences campus near Oxford will add 1.5m square feet over the next seven years to meet demand—equivalent to three-quarters of all the office space London’s financial district will add this year. Chris Walters, director at JLL, estimates unmet demand for lab space in and around Cambridge at 1m square feet—equivalent to nearly a quarter of retail space on London’s Oxford Street.
Where markets are tight, participants will seek to expand supply. In the case of sci-tech property that is harder than it sounds. Constructing new phone towers means navigating strict planning laws and NIMBYS. New data centres need land with access to cheap electricity and high-speed internet. Life-sciences firms like to cluster around top universities and academic medical centres that provide the chemists, microbiologists and other experts that populate their labs. One fix is finding secondary locations. Cities like Los Angeles, which is fairly near the San Francisco Bay Area, and Pittsburgh, home to Carnegie Mellon, a university known for prowess in artificial intelligence, are attracting startups awash with capital. In Britain, life-sciences hubs are springing up in the north, where pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca and GSK have manufacturing sites.
Another remedy is converting existing offices and industrial space. Boston Properties, one of America’s largest office REITS, says it can convert 5m square feet of conventional sites and buildings into laboratories. It is no easy process, for labs are complex spaces governed by biosafety rules. They need four times the amount of air that offices do. Waiting lists in London for “wet” labs, facilities in which dangerous chemicals and other hazardous substances can be handled, are lengthening.But property investors are game to try. In New York conversions could almost double the city’s lab space for rent, according to Newmark, a real-estate advisory firm.
Even empty shops are being repurposed. Savills, a British property firm, reckons London has at least 1.8m square feet of retail property that could be refashioned into laboratories.Shops’ high ceilings mean plenty of room for high-performance ventilation, and service lifts for moving dangerous materials. It will doubtless take years for supply to catch up with demand. But as the locus of work and commerce moves, real-estate investors are shifting with it.■

1606,"Bordeaux, France (CNN)Dealing with the first wave was like a sprint, the second will be more like a marathon.That's how Dr. Olivier Joannes-Boyau, head of the intensive care unit at University Hospital in the southwestern city of Bordeaux, describes the resurgence of Covid-19 in France. After young French people took advantage of the lifting of lockdown and summer months to socialize freely, Covid-19 hospitalizations have risen in large cities like Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille on the Mediterranean coast. French hospitals are now preparing for the long slog.The last time University Hospital dealt with a rise in Covid-19 cases, it put aside all other emergency procedures to deal the crisis. This time, it is trying to keep the rest of its services going too. Just like the wider country, it is adapting to a virus that looks like it is here to stay.Hospital staff are more experienced than they were when the coronavirus first swept through France, and Bordeaux University Hospital is now armed with steroids to reduce Covid-19 symptoms and improved ventilators, both of which can reduce intubation rates.But juggling the swelling number of Covid-19 patients alongside those with other conditions will be difficult, says Dr. Catherine Fleureau, the hospital's director. ""It's also going to be harder than last time, because this wave, I think, will grow progressively and then last over time.""Earlier this year, the first coronavirus wave spiked fast, but was cut short by a strict nationwide lockdown. In total more than 31,000 people died from the disease in France, out of over 433,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Now, the number of new cases is rising fast. A record was set over the weekend with more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. The number of clusters has been rising steadily and, most worryingly, nationwide, the number of people in intensive care has risen 25% in the past week. That number is still 10 times lower than they it was in the spring but it is a worrying trend; like in the spring it will be about how fast the numbers move upwards.The French government is determined to avoid a second general lockdown that could cripple its economy, so is tasking local authorities with responsibility for reducing the virus's spread.In response, Bordeaux and Marseille have tightened their Covid-19 regulations, extending the places where masks must be worn, limiting the size of public gatherings and hardening enforcement. More checks are to be carried out to ensure that Covid-19 regulations are being respected.In Bordeaux, the plan announced by regional officials includes a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in public parks, along the river banks and on beaches. In cafes and restaurants clients will no longer be able to eat and drink while standing up. In both cities regional officials lowered the number of people allowed to gather for large events to 1,000 from 5,000 previously, resulting in the cancellation of sporting fixtures.And just since the start of the school year, 81 schools and 2,100 classes have had to close due to Covid cases. Minister for Education Jean-Michel Blanquer also said Wednesday 1,200 new infections among students had been recorded, compared to last week. The success of these measures will dictate the number of patients that ultimately reach doctors like Dr. Joannes-Boyau. ""The major problem will be to keep the wave, really low,"" he says. ""Because if this wave grows a lot, we will face a large number of patients with Covid-19 that will come and we will not able to treat them.""It's too early to judge whether local restrictions can keep the coming wave manageable, but his intensive care unit is already nearing capacity, with 33 of the 35 available ICU beds occupied on Wednesday. As Joannes-Boyau says, it takes about three weeks for any change in the state of a population's health to be measurable. Now the city is braced to see if it has the endurance to last the marathon.An earlier version of this story incorrectly understated the number of ICU beds that were occupied in Bordeaux on Wednesday.

He finds Latin and Greek texts a source of “wisdom, joy and consolation” and is dismayed by the idea that his degree course, taken by generations of grandees, might slacken its language requirements. He was among the students who objected last year when some faculty members floated the idea of dropping the compulsory study, in the original, of Homer and Virgil. The proposal was part of a discussion on how to make classics more accessible to students who did not attend high-powered schools.
Mr Badhe is no traditionalist, nor insensitive to the charge that classics come with colonial baggage. Rather, he brings a fresh perspective. As a Briton of Indian origin, his special interest is in the melding of Greek, Indian and Buddhist culture 2,300 years ago after Alexander the Great swept through what is now Afghanistan. To the sculptors and poets who engaged in that Indo-Greek fusion, the modern idea of classics being a colonial imposition would seem, Mr Badhe says, “highly bizarre”.

All this is part of a controversy that first surfaced in America. Dan-El Padilla Peralta, a black professor at Princeton University, is the best-known advocate of the view that classics as a discipline is incorrigibly tainted by racism and elitism. On British campuses, radically minded students have challenged professors to rethink the curriculum to make it more accessible, as well as free of racist and colonial overtones.
An elitist strain to the classics tradition is not hard to find. British Victorians loved the passages in Thucydides, the father of Greek history, that celebrate the role of Athens as a benign imperial power, spreading civilisation. But that is not the whole story. On British campuses in the 20th century, the most influential classicists included Eric Dodds, an Irish socialist, and Moses Finley, an American who fled his homeland as a suspected communist.
And elitism need not be the discipline’s future. From October the Institute of Classical Studies, a professional body, will be led by Katherine Harloe, a black woman with a chair at Reading University and a declared interest in exposing the distortion of classics for ideological purposes. Her expertise is in the romantic, patronising way ancient Greece was seen in 18th-century Germany. In a recent broadcast, she said that the attitudes of the British public, not just those of professors, need to change. When an educational animation portrayed a Roman family in Britain as dark-skinned, it drew protests on social media from people unaware of the archaeological evidence that Roman settlers were of many races.
In July the Cambridge classics faculty issued an elaborate plan to counter racism and elitism. It pledged to increase the share of ethnic-minority undergraduates, which was 14% in 2017-19 compared with 23% for the whole university. Selectors will be helped to “understand the impact of their decisions” on diversity. There was even a vow to modify a display of plaster-cast statues to make plain that the ancient figures depicted were not all white.
Still, the statistics suggest that if British classics have a diversity problem, it is at least as much to do with social and educational class as ethnicity. Latin, Greek and ancient history are concentrated in fee-paying and academically selective state schools. Elsewhere, they barely feature. In 2019, 1,121 English pupils took Latin at A-level, the exam which opens university doors. Only 12% of those went to non-selective schools; a scandalously low share, according to Classics For All, a voluntary group that promotes the subject for non-privileged youngsters, and has helped over 1,000 schools.
Spreading the classics to all classes and races is noble work, says Sahil Thapa, a sparky 19-year-old who co-edits a student law journal at Oxford University. His parents, who moved from Kathmandu to Essex, were puzzled when he opted for Latin A-level; he explained that ancient orators like Cicero would help his studies, which include Roman law, and stimulate his own rhetorical skills. Classics in Britain shows no sign of dying out, but the people who study it, and the reasons for their choice, would amaze Victorian imperialists. ■",2
1608,"GERMANY’S ELECTION on September 26th will herald a new era. Angela Merkel, chancellor for 16 years, is stepping down. Who will succeed her is uncertain. Parliamentary elections employ a mix of proportional representation (with a 5% threshold for parties to make it in to the Bundestag) and single-district constituencies. The traditional big parties, Mrs Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democrats along with their Bavarian counterparts (CDU/CSU) and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), are winning fewer votes, and coalitions often bridge the right-left divide. That makes it hard to predict the next government even if polls are accurate, which often they are not.
The Economist has developed a model that aggregates polls and other predictive data, runs thousands of simulated elections and assesses the most probable results and the chances of various coalitions to form a majority. Our model shows that three combinations, each with a popular nickname based on its party colours, have a plausible chance of winning more than half the seats in the Bundestag. These are a “Jamaica” coalition of the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP); a “traffic-light” combination of the Greens, the FDP and the SPD; and, the least likely, “black-green” coalition of the CDU/CSU and the Greens.

Our results demonstrate just how uncertain the election remains. Voters are not only unsure who will win; many are also unsure what the parties really stand for. The campaign has been dispiritingly superficial, avoiding serious policy debate and focusing instead on the peccadillos and gaffes of party leaders. At a critical moment in their history, German citizens are not being given a clear choice of direction. The parties need to do better.
Strategically, their caution is understandable. None of the big parties’ candidates is well-liked. The CDU/CSU’s Armin Laschet secured his party's backing for the chancellery by positioning himself as the blandest contender, and the campaign has confirmed his reputation for dithering. Annalena Baerbock, the Green candidate, had a brief burst of approval after her nomination in April, but handled a plagiarism scandal poorly and has since grown timid. The least unpopular, Olaf Scholz, the SPD candidate and current finance minister, rates more highly among voters than his party does. But that is largely because the SPD has fallen so far, after spending eight years as junior partner in a grand coalition with Mrs Merkel.
Yet on a host of issues, Germany’s parties should be making it crystal clear where they stand. The floods in July drove home the urgency of stronger policies to curb climate change, an area where Germany—with its huge motor industry and humming coal-fired power plants—faces big challenges. Germany will find it hard to sustain its chummy economic relationship with China, which the rest of the West has come to see as a strategic competitor. Relations with Russia vacillate between the firmness Mrs Merkel displayed after the invasion of Crimea and the conciliatory Ostpolitik she has pursued on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany’s assent to the European Union’s covid-19 recovery plan masks deep divisions over collective European spending and debt.
On all of these issues, the parties have real differences. The Greens want a state-led transition to net-zero carbon emissions, a tougher stance towards China and Russia and greater European unity. The CDU/CSU want to give business time to adjust to a low-carbon economy and balance foreign-policy independence from China with economic co-operation. The SPD want to redistribute more income and avoid foreign spats.
Voters are hearing precious little about these differences. The danger is that the coalition that emerges as Germany’s next government will have no mandate for the vital policy decisions it needs to take. Keeping mum does not even seem to be popular: two new polls that came out this week showed perfectly dismal results for the diffident Mr Laschet and his CDU/CSU. German party leaders may think that, by not calling attention to their positions on divisive issues, they are playing it safe. But that strategy is not safe at all, today or in the long run.

The army will be deployed to help local police, who have struggled to contain violent attacks by indigenous groups seeking to reclaim ancestral lands. A demonstrator died during a protest led by indigenous groups in Santiago. Chile is in the process of drafting a new constitution, which may decentralise power and expand indigenous rights. A far-right presidential candidate campaigning on a law-and-order platform is polling well in a tight race ahead of the election on November 21st, in which Mr Piñera cannot stand.
In Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, at least five American families connected to the United States embassy appear to have been afflicted with the Havana syndrome. The mystery illness, which causes ringing in the ears, fatigue and dizziness, first surfaced in Cuba in 2016.

Vaccination, then vacation
The American government said it would open up land and ferry crossings at its borders with Canada and Mexico in November, but only to travellers who are vaccinated against covid-19. From January this will also apply to truckers and students from Canada and Mexico, who had been exempted from the ban on crossings.
Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, banned employers, including private ones, from requiring their workers to be vaccinated against covid-19. That sets up a clash with the federal government, which is ordering large employers to do the opposite.
Poland set itself on a collision course with the rest of the European Union, after the country’s constitutional court ruled that some of the EU’s most important rules, including Article 1 of its main treaty, are incompatible with Poland’s constitution. The EU seems sure to retaliate, perhaps by freezing the covid-19 recovery funds it was due to send to Poland.
Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, resigned. It had become clear that his coalition partners, the Greens, would bring down his government if he stayed on, because of a scandal swirling around him involving payments for favourable press coverage. Mr Kurz denies wrongdoing.

“Many thousands of deaths” could have been avoided in Britain in the early stages of the covid-19 outbreak, according to a parliamentary report. It criticised the government’s initial approach as “fatalism …seeking to manage, but not suppress, infection”. Britain subsequently suffered an egregiously high death rate.
Several Asian countries announced plans to loosen pandemic-related border controls. Thailand and Singapore will start allowing fully vaccinated visitors from low-risk countries to enter without quarantine, Malaysia said it would allow its citizens to travel abroad again, and India will restart issuing tourist visas for all passengers. Sydney ended 107 days of lockdown.
The G20 held a meeting to discuss the economic situation in Afghanistan. The EU promised €700m ($810m) in emergency aid, in addition to the €300m it has already pledged. The leaders agreed to co-ordinate efforts with the Taliban, but stopped short of recognising the government. American officials met representatives from the Taliban in Qatar for their first talks since the jihadists seized power.

1610,"SINCE A WAVE of anti-French protests broke out last year across parts of the Sahel, few leaders in the region have wanted to appear to be too chummy with the former colonial power, or for that matter any of the Western countries which have sent troops to help fight jihadists. Mohamed Bazoum, who was sworn in as president of Niger in April in its first democratic transfer of power, is less standoffish. He not only welcomes the French military presence in his country, but thinks other Western powers should be doing far more to help roll back the insurgent groups that have overrun parts of Mali and are causing havoc in Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria.
“We are not satisfied with the international community as a whole in its way of fighting terrorism in this area,” Mr Bazoum (pictured) tells The Economist. “Against the same adversary, Daesh [Islamic State], in Iraq we saw a great international coalition. But today, we are not seeing the same mobilisation through the UN, in particular.” The region has enough troops, and these are being trained and advised by French and allied forces. But it lacks air power and the money to pay its men, which the UN could provide, he says.

Niger, which is ranked as the world’s poorest country across a range of measures by the UN Development Programme, is caught between two jihadist insurgencies. Along its western borders with Mali and Burkina Faso it faces groups such as the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), which is linked to al-Qaeda. The number of attacks mounted by these and allied groups will increase by a third this year, predicts the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies, part of America’s Department of Defence.
On current trends the conflict will lead to more than 2,400 deaths in the Sahel this year. In Niger’s east, meanwhile, the government is battling the jihadists of Boko Haram who attack across the border from safe areas in Nigeria or from the marshes of Lake Chad. Roughly 500,000 people are living in camps in Niger because of violence in the country or its neighbours.
Mr Bazoum’s response has been to host the headquarters of a French-led counter-terrorism operation, known as the Takuba Task Force, which will include commandos from nine European countries and will focus on training and advising local forces. This is meant to become the leading Western effort in the Sahel as France winds down its own counter-terrorism force, Operation Barkhane, which currently has about 5,000 troops deployed in the Sahel and has its headquarters in Chad. Yet improving Niger’s security will depend on whether its neighbours restore stability. “If Malian territory is at the mercy of terrorist groups, as is the case today...our situation will remain difficult,” he says.
Within Niger Mr Bazoum is not just relying on force. He hopes to deal with the discontent that leads some to join the insurgents. To win people over he is trying to provide services such as clinics, clean water and schools in remote villages, and to attract investment by curbing corruption. Investments in infrastructure and solar energy are aimed at boosting growth and output, particularly on farms. Mr Bazoum is also aiming to slow the world’s fastest rate of population growth by building boarding schools for girls, with the aim of keeping them in education until they are 18 years old. Currently, many leave school at 13 and are married within a year. By 18 many will already have two babies, he says, contributing to a “crazy” fertility rate of almost seven births per woman.
Improving governance and education will take time. Yet if Niger is left unaided, time may not be on its side. ■",2
1611," (CNN)Streaming services continue to roll out expensive series based on presold concepts, but those big swings can produce big misses, with two prime examples this weekend: ""Cowboy Bebop,"" Netflix's live-action spin on a popular anime show; and ""The Wheel of Time,"" Amazon's poor-man's version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (before its actual one) based on popular fantasy books.Both shows fall flat, for different reasons. ""Cowboy Bebop"" seeks to replicate the style and tone of the violent animated series, a space western that features a trio of bounty hunters (or ""cowboys""). They're played by John Cho (under a tousled mop of hair), Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, hunting a bizarre array of targets, firing off playful banter and weapons in near-equal measure.While much of the action is episodic, the season is connected by a larger plot involving the villainous Vicious (Alex Hassell), from the Cho character's past, and the alluring woman (Elina Satine) that came between them -- a thread that feels so familiar as to become a bit of a snooze.Introduced in Japan in 1998 and in the US via Adult Swim three years later, the series demonstrates once again that it's not easy to approximate the tone of a cartoon in a live-action format, even one that's adult in its content. (Netflix is also streaming the original show to maximize the bangs -- and there are a lot of them -- for its bucks.)All told, the new series is big, loud and lavishly produced, with a music-infused sensibility that works in its favor, or at least should.Yet somehow, the producers have managed to make a show that appears to have provoked skepticism among the original's devotees -- who speak of it with the kind of reverence once reserved for ""Citizen Kane"" -- without effectively inviting newcomers into the party.Whatever the cause, the chemistry feels off. And while the action sequences are stylishly choreographed, ""Cowboy Bebop"" finally bangs out a pretty dull tune. At least ""Bebop"" doesn't aspire to being much more than fun, while ""The Wheel of Time"" -- adapted from Robert Jordan's books -- has a more epic scope that adds to the sense of dramatic inertia.Rosamund Pike provides a degree of star power -- or at least the most recognizable face -- as the mysterious Moiraine, who comes to a small village where she enlists five young men and women on a quest to thwart the return of ""the dark one,"" with one member of the quintet, still unknown, representing the prophesied savior of their world.The dark one's slavering minions, naturally, are in hot pursuit, but the characters simply don't possess enough pop to draw in those who don't come immersed in the mythology, and the special effects are uneven. What emerges thus feels like another fantasy-based soap opera, populated by fantastic creatures and stiff dialogue filled with ominous warnings like ""The dark one is coming for your friends.""Put the blame on ""Game of Thrones,"" which prompted every streamer to take a hard look at fantasy concepts with literary underpinnings to tap into that genre. As noted, Amazon's really big bet is an upcoming series based on ""The Lord of the Rings,"" which only feeds the sense that this represents a once-over-lightly version of it.While there have been successes, the streaming world has also absorbed expensive failures as it tests these waters, with ""Cursed"" and ""Jupiter's Legacy"" among Netflix's recent one-season wonders.On the plus side, it's nice to see streamers taking chances on material that requires such ambition. Nevertheless, there's not much to ""Cowboy Bebop"" that would merit saddling up for an encore, or anything about ""The Wheel of Time"" to provoke enthusiasm about the prospect of it marching on.""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""The Wheel of Time"" premiere Nov. 19 on Netflix and Amazon, respectively.",0
1612,"EUROPE’S BUREAUCRATS are not usually shy about prescribing how exactly to prepare and present food. Yet there is one ultra-sensitive matter they prefer not to touch: whether Jews and Muslims should be allowed to slaughter animals as their faith usually requires, with just a swipe of a super-sharp knife that causes blood to cascade from the veins. American bodies that promote religious freedom have called the legal mess disgraceful; animal-rights activists and secular-minded organisations agree, for exactly opposite reasons.
A mess there is. Most EU members allow a religious exception to the general rule that animals should be stunned before slaughter. But Denmark, Sweden and Slovenia do not. Finland says that slaughter and stunning can be simultaneous. The Dutch decree that the animal must not be sentient for more than 40 seconds after its throat being cut. In fractious Belgium, the Dutch- and French-speaking regions ban non-stun slaughter. Administratively separate Brussels, where many ethnic Moroccans live, has no such ban. This has prompted lawsuits by Jewish and Muslim groups; the latest has just been rejected by Belgium’s constitutional court. Two Muslim bodies may take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights.

Jewish groups were also disappointed when, on October 5th, the European Commission laid out a strategy against anti-Semitism. While proposing ways to foster Jewish life and promote Holocaust remembrance, it ducked how to guarantee time-honoured Jewish customs, says Pinchas Goldschmidt of the Conference of European Rabbis. By refusing to spell out a right to kosher slaughter, Europe’s institutions are sending an unfriendly message to Jews already fretting over their safety, says the rabbi. “This has more to do with two-legged animals than four-legged animals,” he says. Bans on religious slaughter have a dark history in Europe: they were imposed in Switzerland in the 1890s to stop Jews immigrating and in Germany in the 1930s to make them leave.
In Britain, where halal food is big business, the authorities are prevaricating. Religiously slaughtered meat should at least be clearly labelled so that the non-religious, as well as the devout, can follow their consciences, says Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society.",2
1613,"PROSTHETIC LIMBS have been around for a long time. The oldest known, a piece of wood carved and painted to replace the lost toe of an Egyptian noblewoman, dates back more than 3,000 years. But prosthetics which behave like the real thing as well as looking like it are still very much a work in progress. And a group at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in China, have just come up with what looks to be a significant advance—an affordable prosthetic hand that not only responds like a real one to signals from the wearer’s brain, but is also able to signal back to the brain what it is touching and doing.
Gu Guoying and his colleagues describe their invention in Nature Biomedical Engineering. Its fingers are made of rigid tubes connected by soft joints. These are similarly connected to a 3D-printed plastic palm. The whole is covered with a flexible elastomer layer to mimic skin and is attached to the user’s residual limb via a customised plastic socket. In contrast to current models, which are electrically powered, Dr Gu’s hand is powered pneumatically by a pump held in a waist bag, with the connecting air lines running under the user’s clothes alongside communication cables. This reduces its weight below 300 grams—half that of some current models, and less, indeed, than the weight of a real hand—though the waist bag adds a further 444 grams.

The hand uses similar signal-processing algorithms to other prosthetics on the market. The big advance is that it does not require invasive surgery or electronic implants into the residual limb to communicate with the user’s brain. Sensors on the skin record electrical activity from the remaining arm muscles. In an intact arm, this activity would tell those muscles how to operate the hand. Instead, they are interpreted by pattern-recognition software that sends appropriate commands to the pump to move the artificial hand in the same way. Meanwhile, other signals travel in the opposite direction from sensors in the hand’s fingertips to nerves in the arm, whence they are relayed to the brain and provide a sensation of touch. The upshot is something which responds like a hand and feels like one to the user.

Dr Gu and his colleagues compared the efficacy of their invention with that of existing models using tests borrowed from research into strokes and spinal-cord injuries. These included writing, grasping and lifting objects, lifting food to the mouth, and stacking draughtsmen. Normally, they found, it worked better—particularly for delicate tasks like handling fragile objects, petting a cat and shaking hands.
The other advantage of Dr Gu’s invention is that it is cheap. The components it is made from cost about $500. Existing models may sell for $10,000 or more. If it, or something similar, goes into production, that will permit the transformation of many more of the lives of the 5m people who have lost a hand, or were born without one, than is possible at the moment.

1614,"BERLIN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The German government on Wednesday cut its growth forecast for this year to 2.6% but raised its estimate for next year to 4.1% as supply bottlenecks for semiconductors and rising energy costs delay the recovery in Europe's largest economy.
Confirming an earlier Reuters report, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the economy remained robust despite the COVID-19 pandemic, but supply chain woes in manufacturing and a surge in energy prices were complicating the recovery.
""In view of the current supply bottlenecks and high energy prices worldwide, the hoped-for final spurt will not happen this year,"" Altmaier said.
""In 2022, the economy will gain momentum significantly.""
The delayed recovery means that the German economy won't reach its pre-crisis level this year, but likely at the beginning of 2022.
The revised government forecast for gross domestic product growth compares with an April prediction for the economy to grow by 3.5% in 2021 and by 3.6% in 2022.  read more 
Altmaier said automobile manufacturers are currently not able to build hundreds of thousands of cars due to a lack of semiconductors and other electronic components.
To ease the supply problems, the government is ready to support the construction of local semiconductor factories with several billion euros, Altmaier said, adding that he was hopeful this would mobilize even higher investments by companies soon.
The widespread bottlenecks in production, coupled with unusually high demand, are leading to price increases, with the government expecting inflation to surge to 3% this year.
But the government is sticking to its assessment that most of the price increases will be temporary. Berlin sees consumer price inflation easing to 2.2% in 2022 and to 1.7% in 2023. Last year, national consumer price inflation stood at 0.5%.
Altmaier said he saw a chance that the price rally on energy markets would end soon, adding that he did not expect any supply problems on gas markets during the winter months.",3
1615,"THE MEGAPHONE has been taken away. On January 8th Twitter, a social network, announced that it was “permanently suspending” President Donald Trump's account. Viewed in isolation, the two tweets that led to the ban were, by Mr Trump’s standards, fairly innocuous. But Twitter said it had taken its decision in the wake of the riot at America’s Congress on January 6th, in which five people died as legislators’ offices were ransacked by a crowd of Mr Trump's supporters after Mr Trump had encouraged them to march on the Capitol. It said that continuing to give Mr Trump access risked allowing him to incite further violence.
Other social networks have taken a similarly tough line. Facebook has said that Mr Trump's account will be banned for “at least” the remainder of his term in office, which is due to expire on January 20th. Snapchat, a smaller social network, has likewise blocked the president's access. Besides defenestrating Mr Trump, Twitter also banned the accounts of Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell, two of the president’s dwindling circle of allies. And it promised to do the same for accounts dedicated to QAnon, a nutty but resilient conspiracy theory that holds that America is run by a cabal of Satanic paedophiles.

The suspensions mark the most drastic actions that social-media firms have yet taken to enforce their rules on what can and cannot be said on their platforms. Both Twitter and Facebook had said previously that politicians would be held to lower standards than ordinary users, on the grounds that their utterances—even the sort of inflammatory or false ones of which Mr Trump was fond—were of wide interest. More recently, they had taken to labelling or blocking a greater number of untrue or potentially harmful posts. Twitter, for example, had pushed back on some of Mr Trump’s wilder claims about the election by appending notices to some of his tweets, saying that their contents were disputed. But the outright bans prove that tech-company bosses such as Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg feel there are limits to such indulgences.
Reaction has been split. Mr Trump’s opponents, as well as many academics who study online media, welcomed the decision; some called it overdue. After his personal account was banned, Mr Trump used the official account of the American presidency to accuse Twitter of attempting to silence him, and of giving a platform to some of the “most vicious people in the world”. (Twitter later deleted those tweets, though it did not ban the account). Some prominent politicians from the Republican party, which Mr Trump leads, condemned the decision. “Speech should be free whether you agree or not,” said Ben Carson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. “We aren’t in China.” Even Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader, weighed in (on Twitter) to oppose the ban, saying it set a precedent that “will be exploited by the enemies of freedom of speech around the world”.
Nor was it just social-media companies cracking down. Apple and Google act as gatekeepers to virtually every smartphone on the planet. In the wake of the riots both have banned Parler, a Twitter alternative popular with American right-wingers, from their app stores. Both firms said that some of the rioters had used the app to plan. Amazon quickly followed suit, kicking Parler off its web-hosting service, effectively removing it from the internet and causing an exodus of users to Telegram, a messaging service. Whether Parler's disappearance is permanent will depend on its ability to find a new host willing to stomach its reputation.
Disentangling principles from expediency is tricky. Like almost everything else in modern America, tech firms have been sucked into the country’s all-consuming culture wars. Republicans accuse social networks of censoring conservatives; the Democrats of allowing lies and threats to proliferate unchecked. Both have threatened regulatory crackdowns. Having lost the election, and with the Democrats due to take control of both the presidency and of Congress, Mr Trump is a lame duck. He is made lamer by the fall-out from the Capitol Hill debacle, with even close allies scrambling to distance themselves from him. The political cost of banning him is therefore lower than it has ever been.
All the same, it is hard to avoid the sense that the social-media firms have reached a point of no return. Disquiet about their power and reach is not confined to political partisans. Britain, Australia, Singapore, Brazil and the EU have passed, or are mooting, new rules designed to regulate social media. The banning of the world’s most powerful politician will raise the temperature even further. The firms’ in-house enforcement policies—which are spotty and inconsistently applied—will come under even more intense scrutiny.
So far, most analysis has focused on the implications for American politics. But the fallout from the decision could cause just as many headaches elsewhere. Critics of Twitter’s decision lost little time pointing out that the firm is apparently happy to continue to host Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader. Amid a wave of extra-judicial killings, Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, likes to boast about how many alleged ""drug dealers” he has personally slain. Facebook has been one of Mr Duterte’s most important political tools.
One early flashpoint could be India, where Facebook is embroiled in the struggle between the left-wing Congress party and the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Both sides accuse the firm of favouring the other. Indian culture wars can be even more lethal than the American sort: anti-Muslim riots in Delhi last year that killed more than 50 people. Shortly after Twitter announced Mr Trump’s ban, Tejasvi Surya, the president of the BJP's youth wing, tweeted that “if they can do this to POTUS, they can do this to anyone”, and suggested that the sooner India passed new rules regulating tech firms, “[the] better for our democracy”.
Editor’s note: (January 11th 2021): This story was updated after Amazon Web Services stopped hosting Parler.

1616,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",3
1617,"“WE ARE A community company committed to maximum global impact. Our mission is to elevate the world’s consciousness.” The opening lines of WeWork’s prospectus for its planned initial public offering in 2019 seem to confirm the worst about mission statements. People sit in a room earnestly discussing the differences between their purpose, their vision and their mission. There are whiteboards and bottles of kombucha. Nonsense ensues.
But even guff has meaning. For investors in young companies in particular, the mission statement sends useful signals. It articulates what a firm does and gives clues to where its priorities lie. Such information matters all the more when founders exercise outsized voting power. The WeWork prospectus helped elevate the consciousness of investors that the property company had lost its marbles. WeWork ended up scrapping both its listing and its boss.

To see why mission statements deserve more than an eye-roll, look first at entities that lack them. Of the 58 prospectuses filed with America’s Securities and Exchange Commission in the first two weeks of this month, more than a third were for special purpose acquisition companies. SPACs are a type of shell company whose goal is to raise money for an unspecified future deal. They are purposelessness incarnate.
“We have not identified any potential business combination target, and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target,” runs a typical SPAC filing blurb. Investors have been warned: their money could end up pretty much anywhere.
Mission statements contain multitudes in comparison. They can tell you which stakeholders matter most to a firm. A tiny handful of the non-SPACs to have filed this month say their objective is shareholder returns (call it a Milton statement). Most couch their goals in terms of meeting customer needs.
Lulu’s Fashion Lounge says that its vision is to be the most beloved women’s brand for affordable luxury fashion. AirSculpt Technologies, a “body-contouring” firm, aims to produce the best results for its patients. This may be the age of purpose, but giving people what they want, whether they are looking for clothes or a “Brazilian butt-lift procedure”, is mission enough for many entrepreneurs.
The mission statement can also tell investors something about how technologically sophisticated a company is. Among this month’s filers there is a marked lack of flannel from GlobalFoundries, a big semiconductor firm. But for simpler products and services, it is not enough to describe what an enterprise does. “We aim to help the customers in our communities live a good life by inspiring moments that create lasting memories,” burbles Solo Brands, whose biggest seller is a stainless-steel fire pit.
Similarly, you may have been under the impression that Krispy Kreme, which returned to public markets earlier in the summer, sells doughnuts. Wrong. “As an affordable indulgence enjoyed across cultures, races, and income levels, we believe that Krispy Kreme has the potential to deliver joyful experiences across the world.” That’s not icing on your face, it’s euphoria.
A mission statement also illuminates crispness of thinking. Of the firms to have filed this month, NerdWallet, a firm that provides reviews and comparisons of financial products, deserves most plaudits. “Our mission is to provide clarity for all of life’s financial decisions,” runs the prospectus. That is ambitious without being absurd, informative without being constraining.
Others are woollier. The prospectus for Rivian, an electric-vehicle manufacturer, says that it wants “to keep the world adventurous forever”. Prospective investors are told that “the part of us that seeks to explore the world is also the secret to making sure it remains a world worth exploring.” Yet the company’s near-term revenues depend on a big order from Amazon for its electric delivery van. The part of us that plans never to leave the house again may be the secret to Rivian thriving.
As for WeWork, it is back and chastened. Its public debut, via a merger with a SPAC called BowX, was due on October 21st. In a proxy statement issued by BowX in September, WeWork says it was founded in 2010 with a vision “to create environments where people and companies come together and do their best work”. No mission creep this time.

1618,"Former President Trump congratulated Kyle Rittenhouse on Friday, after the teenager was found not guilty of murder in the fatal shooting of two men in racial justice protests.
The verdict divided America. As the left denounced the outcome as a miscarriage of justice, the right said Rittenhouse never should have been put on trial.
'Congratulations to Kyle Rittenhouse for being found INNOCENT of all charges,' said Trump in an emailed statement.
'It’s called being found NOT GUILTY—And by the way, if that’s not self defense, nothing is!'
A fundraising appeal followed.
'This trial was nothing more than a WITCH HUNT from the Radical Left,' said an email to supporters, directing them to donate to the online WinRed platform. 
'They want to PUNISH law-abiding citizens, including a CHILD, like Kyle Rittenhouse, for doing nothing more than following the LAW.'
Jurors found Rittenhouse, 18, not guilty on all charges: two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety in protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
The outcome triggered anger among many Democrats. 
House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerold Nadler said: 'This heartbreaking verdict is a miscarriage of justice and sets a dangerous precedent which justifies federal review by [the Department of Justice].
'Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest.'
Rittenhouse cannot be tried again for the same alleged crime, and DOJ does not have the authority to prosecute state crimes – although it does probe law enforcement for bias or misconduct.  
President Joe Biden said Friday that he stands by the jury that found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty – as Republicans renewed demands that he apologize for comparing the Kenosha shooter to white supremacists in the wake of the verdict.
'I stand by with the jury as the jury system has concluded. The jury system works and you have to abide by it,' Biden told reporters Friday afternoon as he returned to the White House from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had a physical.
He said he 'just heard a moment ago' about the verdict, and says he 'didn't watch the trial', which featured dramatic clashes between the prosecution and defense lawyers and testimony by the accused teen in an event that got gavel-to-gavel cable news coverage.  
Biden also issued a statement saying he and other Americans were 'angry and concerned' by the verdict. 
Republican lawmakers and other officials are demanding that Biden apologize to Rittenhouse for comparing Rittenhouse to white supremacists following the Wisconsin jury's not-guilty verdict. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), in a statement immediately after the verdict.
'While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken,' Biden said in the official White House statement.
'I ran on a promise to bring Americans together, because I believe that what unites us is far greater than what divides us. I know that we’re not going to heal our country’s wounds overnight, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under the law.'
He also referenced fears of potential violence in Kenosha after the acquittal.
'I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law. Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy. The White House and Federal authorities have been in contact with Governor [Tony] Evers’s office to prepare for any outcome in this case, and I have spoken with the Governor this afternoon and offered support and any assistance needed to ensure public safety.'
Vice President Kamala Harris made brief remarks to reporters on the verdict, saying it 'really speaks for itself. As many of you know, I've spent a majority of my career working to make the criminal justice system more equitable. And, clearly, there's a lot more work to do,' the former prosecutor said.
Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson championed the verdict. 'I believe justice has been served in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial. I hope everyone can accept the verdict, remain peaceful, and let the community of Kenosha heal and rebuild,' he tweeted. 
Last September while running as a presidential candidate, Biden  sent out a tweet condemning Donald Trump for refusing to call anti-BLM protesters white supremacists. It showed the march in Charlottesville as well an image of Rittenhouse's face in Kenosha.
'There’s no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night,' Biden said.
Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel released a statement saying before 'he knew the facts, Biden prejudged the Rittenhouse case. He smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case. What Biden did was dangerous and inflammatory. Biden needs to apologize and ACT NOW before the left uses his lies to fuel violence.'
Lawmakers on both sides of the issue took to Twitter express their relief or anger.
The Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement saying: 'It is unconscionable our justice system would allow an armed vigilante — who traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz — to go free.  
Said Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.): 'I’d like to have faith in our criminal justice system, but the immediate question that comes to mind with this news is “Would he have been acquitted if he were black?' 
Wrote Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-La.): 'I hope this young man realizes that he was given a chance at life - one that we all know might not have been afforded to him if he had been Black - and dedicates himself to repairing the deep rifts in our community and in our country that he created.' 
New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted: 'This is a dark day for our justice system. As a lawyer, I respect jury verdicts. But this is yet another reminder that our system needs to be uprooted and reformed.' 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was informed of the jury's not guilty verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial during the White House press briefing – and promised reporters President Biden would weigh in with a statement.
She was asked about it just seconds after the 12-person jury found Rittenhouse not guilty on all counts of intentional homicide, attempted intentional homicide, or reckless endangerment for shooting and killing two men and injuring another amid protests in Kenosha in August 2020.
'It obviously just happened while I was out here, so let me talk to the president,' Psaki responded, talk to our team, and we will get you a statement as soon as we can,' she said. 
She was asked about Judge Bruce Schroeder decision not to have the term 'victims' used to describe the people that Rittenhouse shot and killed or injured. 'I'm not going to give an assessment of this from here,' she said. 'Let us get you a statement as soon as we can.'
Before the verdict, she said the administration has been 'in close touch with officials on the ground through law enforcement channels to ensure we are supporting any efforts toward peaceful protests. That's certainly what we will continue to encourage as anyone looks to have their voice heard regardless of the outcome.'
 Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all counts Friday afternoon.  
The jury reached a verdict in the Kenosha shooter trial on Friday after four days of deliberation.  
Rittenhouse, 18, was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and other counts for killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz on August 25, 2020. 
Demonstrators have been gathered outside the Kenosha Courthouse all week, as Wisconsin governor Tony Evers called in 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard to counter the expected protests.
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that has threatened to derail proceedings more than once. 
Two of the six original charges were dismissed before they ever went to the jury when Judge Schroeder tossed first a curfew violation count and then the one charge that seemed all but a slam-dunk for the prosecution: possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.
The gun charge was dismissed on the grounds that the state failed to satisfy the entire statute which, in Wisconsin, requires not only that the person be under 18 but that the rifle be short-barreled – Rittenhouse's AR-15 was not.",-2
1619,"THE E-COMMERCE company that retailers talk about most these days is neither Amazon, the American juggernaut, nor Alibaba, China’s biggest. It is Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese firm that started in 2015 as an online food supplier, but whose success has driven its market value above $200bn. Last year it was China’s fastest-growing internet stock, rising by 330%.  
PDD attracts attention for two reasons. One is its business model. David Liu, vice-president of strategy, explains that it has ridden the rise of smartphone penetration in China to create an e-commerce experience in which people club together to buy products from robot vacuum-cleaners to bananas. During the pandemic this has expanded into a fast-growing business across thousands of towns and villages, in which PDD’s users gather to bid for shipments of local farm produce at bargain prices. Some term this “community group-buy”. Mr Liu calls it “interactive commerce”. It is one of the hottest parts of the Chinese internet.   

The second is the way PDD has shattered the myth of an impregnable fortress surrounding the titans of online shopping. Until a few years ago, China’s e-commerce market seemed a two-way contest between Alibaba and JD.com, a rival platform. No longer. Elinor Leung of CLSA, a brokerage, expects PDD’s share of online retail in China to overtake that of JD in 2021. She expects the number of users to surpass Alibaba. And although PDD shells out huge subsidies to entice customers from poorer parts of China to its app, she thinks it may turn profitable this year.
Remarkably, it has done this less by displacing its bigger rivals than by tapping parts of the market they have been unable to reach. Although online sales of groceries have rocketed during the pandemic, less than a tenth of the 8.1trn yuan ($1.25trn) farm-produce market is bought and sold digitally. “We are continuing to grow the pie,” says Mr Liu. That lesson applies elsewhere too. However sewn up a market looks, there is opportunity for upstarts because e-commerce is at an early stage of development. 

The issue of competition in China has convulsed share prices because of the actions of antitrust authorities. In November 2020 the State Administration for Market Regulation published draft guidelines for platform companies aimed at maintaining orderly competition. In December enforcement of the 2008 antitrust law was strengthened, leading to new investigations and fines. These have included scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions, community group-buy schemes, price-discounting and discrimination against competitors. Ms Leung wrote in January that the chance of a forced break-up of Chinese internet platforms is remote, because of its impact on industry, the economy and consumers. But she expects more regulation, especially over customer data.

Robin Zhu of Bernstein says the crackdown means tech platforms may have to restrain aggressive sales practices such as selling goods at huge discounts. That may reduce growth, but jobs and innovation plus their support for consumer spending argue in their favour. Alibaba seems the biggest target, but PDD has also drawn fire. Alibaba is flying “closest to the sun”, Mr Zhu suggests, partly because of heat on its sister company, Ant Group. But he says up to a fifth of China’s retail sales flow through its doors. Chinese regulators stress their support for the platform economy, he notes, so a crackdown is unlikely to be devastating. 
The rampant competition in China’s retail market suggests no platform, however large, can expect fully to dominate it. Alongside PDD, Alibaba, JD and Meituan, a food-delivery firm, all target China’s lower-tier cities with community group-buy and other schemes. Alibaba’s Taobao Live platform has led the growth of live-streaming and video, in which influencers sell branded goods at huge discounts. But the explosive live-streaming market has attracted vigorous competitors, such as Douyin, sister to TikTok, a global social-media app. WeChat, part of a super-app owned by Alibaba’s rival Tencent, allows brands to sell on its site, and gives customers instant access to digital payments. Everyone is jostling for a share of online advertising. This is especially true in live-streaming, where it is easy to measure the bang for an advertiser’s buck through real-time data, says Michael Jais of Launchmetrics, a fashion-and-beauty analytics company. 
In Europe and America, by contrast, the view is that the game has been won by Amazon. The gap between Amazon’s e-commerce market share in America and that of Walmart, the next in line, is far bigger than Alibaba’s lead over the number two in China. Though Bernstein’s Mark Shmulik reckons Amazon earns little profit on its core retail business, its fast-growing cloud and online-advertising arms generate huge margins that it can plough back into retail expansion. It had $42bn of cash on its balance-sheet at the end of 2020. Marc-André Kamel of Bain, a consultancy, says Amazon may spend $100bn more on information technology over the next five years than each of the world’s top ten traditional retailers. It will also continue to invest heavily in logistics, putting more pressure on the likes of UPS and FedEx. 
Like Alibaba in China, Amazon has drawn regulatory heat. In October 2020 a congressional committee in America said it was looking at overhauling antitrust laws to counter the power of the big tech platforms. It drew attention to the dominance that Amazon has over third-party sellers on its marketplace, and its practice of selling its own goods in competition with them. In November the European Commission accused Amazon of violating competition laws by using non-public data from third-party sellers to benefit its own retail business.
Amazon says none of this is true. Although it stands tall online in America, by total sales Walmart is larger. Amazon dominates categories like books, but in groceries it is one of many. Trustbusters may have their eye on how it sells products on its website to compete with those sold by third parties, but this is little different from big retailers selling own-label products. Amazon also has political capital. Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley says the jobs it provides, its support for small and medium-sized firms, and its technological prowess may all work in its favour.
The recent decision by Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, to hand the chief executive job to Andy Jassy will not end the regulatory fire. But if the pressure rises, it could spin out Amazon Web Services, the world’s biggest cloud-computing company. As in China, as long as the pie is growing, new challengers may emerge. Some will come from big tech. Many online retailers pay Facebook and Google for their products to be found via search. Online advertising remains the strongest part of their businesses, but Facebook and Google are adding sales channels. Facebook has 160m small firms on its site. In 2020 it let them set up a single online store on its app and on Instagram, its sister platform. Last year Google scrapped commissions for retailers selling directly from its site.

Another source of competition will come from changes in online shopping. Smartphones may overtake personal computers in America and Europe for e-commerce. That will boost the popularity of “social commerce”, or commerce via social media and video. TikTok, a medium for promoting brand awareness, may let its most popular celebrities market products on its site, according to the Financial Times. The battle will extend to logistics and payment services. In America Amazon delivers more of its own parcels than the US Postal Service. But rivals like Walmart are developing subscription services like Amazon Prime that offer free delivery and other perks. 
Tax is another threat. In both East and West, tax authorities have their eye on the digital giants. In 2020 Amazon saw a big increase in its tax liability, yet the administration of Joe Biden is considering imposing higher taxes on America’s most profitable companies. European governments are levying digital-services taxes on tech firms in an effort to force them to pay more where their consumers are located. Some have drawn attention to the low business rates that e-commerce platforms pay on out-of-town warehouses, compared with those of retailers on the high street. Even China plans to raise taxes on its biggest tech firms. 
Ultimately, higher taxes, greater regulatory scrutiny and rising competition may make profits in e-commerce harder to come by. But even if they end up regulated like utilities, few will shed a tear. The e-commerce giants have had a fabulous run so far. ■",2
1620,"THE DEPARTURE of Lucy, on October 16th, if all goes well, is not the only forthcoming mission with asteroids as its destination. On November 24th DART should follow. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, though, has a more practical purpose than Lucy. It will assess the feasibility of changing an asteroid’s path, should one be discovered that threatens to collide with Earth.
DART, a probe weighing 600kg, is intended to crash, in September 2022, into Dimorphos, a tiny asteroid in orbit around a larger one, Didymos, at a velocity of 6.2km per second. The intention is to alter the speed of Dimorphos’s orbit by about half a millimetre a second, thus shortening its orbital period, now 11.9 hours, by about ten minutes.

Didymos is 780 metres across. According to the project’s lead investigator, Andrew Cheng of Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, if an object that size hit Earth it could devastate half a continent, causing firestorms and a subsequent cooling of the climate that might last for years. But even something the size of Dimorphos, only 160 metres across, would do a lot of damage. Its impact would create an explosion equivalent to 400-600 megatonnes of TNT. By comparison, the Tunguska bolide that exploded over Siberia in 1908, flattening more than 2,000km2 of forest, released something like 20 megatonnes. And recently published evidence suggests that an explosion of similar size to Tunguska destroyed Tall el-Hammam, a city in the Jordan valley, in about 1650BC.
There are, moreover, a lot of unknown asteroids out there. NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observation Programme, intended to discover 90% of asteroids larger than 140 metres across that have orbits near Earth’s, is reckoned to have so far found less than half of them. None yet located is seen as a threat. But if such a threat were identified, the question would be whether anything could be done about it.
If collision with Earth was imminent, the answer is probably “no”. But if it were years or decades away, a nudge of the sort DART will give Dimorphos could change a space rock’s path enough for it to miss Earth after all—even a tiny alteration in such a body’s orbit will grow over time.
Dimorphos’s behaviour after DART hits it will thus be the subject of intense scrutiny. The impact itself will be monitored by LICIACube (Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids). This is a small craft, built by Italy’s space agency, which will be launched along with DART and separate from it shortly before impact. After that, Didymos and Dimorphos will be tracked by ground-based telescopes. Then, in 2024, the European Space Agency will launch a follow-up craft called Hera that will arrive at the double asteroid in 2026, for a more detailed inspection. All these data will then be crunched to find out just how feasible an asteroid-deflection mission would be.
With luck, no such mission will ever be needed. But if one is, DART may prove to be the most important space probe ever to have flown.",2
1621,"PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN has every reason to be angry. He has tried to poison Alexei Navalny, Russia’s opposition leader. He has locked him up in one of Russia’s harshest penal colonies. He has outlawed his anti-corruption foundation. He has chased his comrades out of the country and barred his allies from standing in elections. And yet, after all this, Mr Navalny and his movement are still featuring at the heart of the elections to Russia’s Duma (its parliament) on September 19th.
On the surface, the political field is entirely Mr Putin’s. The only parties allowed to run, including the Communists and Yabloko, an innocuous liberal outfit, have been sanitised by the Kremlin. With the media muzzled and repression and censorship the main tools of campaigning, the Kremlin-backed United Russia’s win is a given. Yet under the surface a drama is unfolding, as the Kremlin frantically fights Mr Navalny’s effort to awaken and co-ordinate voters.

The Kremlin has been hoping that most Russians, assuming the election is a foregone conclusion, will take no interest in it. If they stay at home, United Russia should win hands down, since a solid bloc of state workers, pensioners and members of the armed forces will be cajoled into voting for it. If the turnout is low, the need for blatant rigging would be avoided, along with the risk of mass protests.
At the same time, the Kremlin is urging people, especially in Moscow where United Russia is particularly weak, to vote online, making it easier for the authorities to snoop on them and to control the process. It even appears to have hacked into the database of an online liberal media organisation, sending its readers a message telling them to boycott the elections.
Yet Mr Navalny’s campaign to stir up and consolidate a protest vote, from his prison cell, is hurting Mr Putin. Pollsters give United Russia less than 30% of the vote. The Kremlin is particularly rattled by Mr Navalny’s call for people to follow his strategy of “smart voting”. Half the Duma seats are allocated by party list, so the opposition leader is calling on his supporters to vote for any parliamentary party other than United Russia, to knock them back.
The other half of the seats are first-past-the-post, so here the smart-voting team, using its own polling data and analysis, has endorsed the likeliest candidate to beat the United Russia one, regardless of their views. Its main aim is to deprive United Russia of a big majority, and so weaken its control over electoral commissions across Russia. That would allow more leeway to the opposition in places where it is relatively strong, such as Khabarovsk, in the far east. Smart voting has worked in various local elections, including in Moscow in 2019, when United Russia did poorly.
Russia’s internet censor has duly blocked the smart-voting website and ordered Google and Yandex, Russia’s main search engine, to block the combination of two words—smart voting—in its searches. Yandex has obeyed but Google has not, incurring a fine. The Kremlin has accused it of “interfering in Russia’s elections”.
Anticipating such blockages, the Navalny team has created a smart-voting app. The internet censor has ordered tech giants, including Apple, to remove it from their stores. It has even ordered VPN and website-security providers to prevent downloads, apparently to little avail.
Journalists are being arrested for reposting mentions of smart voting in their social-media accounts. Human-rights lawyers are being targeted. Popular bloggers are being threatened with house arrest for breaking covid-related rules which almost nobody follows. There is Soviet-style intimidation offline, too. Hundreds of people across Russia have reported visits by plain-clothes police asking questions about Mr Navalny and warning of dire consequences if they support him.
Kirill Rogov, a political analyst, says that smart voting has, in effect, become a political party. “It’s not the name or registration that defines a party, but its ability to consolidate voters and influence the outcome of the elections,” he says. The Kremlin’s power has rested on two pillars: its monopoly of information and the threat of repression. But the spread of fast mobile internet has changed Russian politics. The Liberal Mission Foundation, a think-tank based in Moscow, reckons that the share of people who get their news online has shot up from 18% to 45% in the past five years. Hence 70% of Russians know about Mr Navalny. His YouTube channel has about as big an audience as the news on a large state-run TV channel. Whatever the result of the election, the war over the internet is only going to get nastier.■",2
1622,"WINTER 2025 could, with luck, be normal. Health-care systems will come under strain, as always, from the spread of respiratory diseases that land people in hospital. Influenza will afflict the elderly. Respiratory syncytial virus will make some children gravely ill. And a newish seasonal disease will belong in the mix: covid-19. It will overwhelmingly sicken the old, even more than flu. But, outside hospitals, life will continue largely uninterrupted.
The world has experienced pandemics before. In the cholera outbreak of the 1830s nearly 3% of Parisians died from the disease in a single month. At the end of the 19th century around 1m people may have died from Russian flu, which some think was caused by a coronavirus. The Spanish flu that struck in 1918 killed around 50m in just a couple of years.

Covid-19 joins that list. The pandemic has probably killed 10m-19m people, with a central estimate of 16.3m, according to The Economist’s excess-death model. Covid is far from the deadliest disease humanity has faced. Many of those infected do not even know they have it. But it is new and it is everywhere. When it emerged the entire world was susceptible to it. That immunological naivety, combined with the nature of the virus itself, explains the speed of its spread and the awfulness of its impact.
But in the end, all pandemics burn out. Eventually, sufficient numbers of people develop immunity so viruses can no longer find new hosts at the rate they need to sustain their growth. And yet only one human disease, smallpox, has ever been completely eradicated. Others, such as influenza, measles and cholera, slowly became endemic, part of the landscape of disease around the world, checked but not eliminated by vaccines and medical treatments.
In that respect, covid is no different (see chart 1). What is novel about this pandemic is the speed at which science—in the form of both vaccines and treatments—is accelerating the disease’s journey to endemicity. The question now is how quickly it will become endemic and what the world will look like as it does.

Most governments accept that eradicating covid is impossible. The last large country in the world still pursuing a “zero covid” strategy is China. Yet eradication became impossible soon after the disease appeared, argues Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist at the World Health Organisation, because too many countries failed to fight the virus as strongly as possible.
The extreme transmissibility of the Delta variant has rendered that goal even more obviously futile. Endlessly repeated lockdowns and severe quarantines are the only alternative. All societies find these intolerable. Ultimately that will be true even for China. Instead every country will have to work out how to live with the disease.
Endemicity means that a virus circulates at a steady rate. Infections sometimes rise or fall but transmission is generally constant, stable and predictable. The disease does not overwhelm nor does it disappear. Infections reach an equilibrium where the proportion of the population becoming susceptible is in balance with the likelihood of transmission. Vaccination can push that equilibrium point lower.
Humans have done exactly this to polio and measles, two devastating diseases which were endemic throughout the world in the 20th century but which have now been eliminated from much of the planet. The overwhelming incentive for the vaccination campaigns was that both viruses harmed and killed children, who are born with naive immune systems. Covid is unlikely to follow the same path, not only because it causes relatively little harm to youngsters, but also because vaccinated people can still contract the disease and pass it on, although cases are usually mild.
Contrast that endemicity with that of the common cold, which can be caused by any of around 200 viruses. Most children who contract it do not get seriously ill. Most adults, even older ones, who contract it do so with some immunity from the string of colds they endure over the course of their life, and so are able to fight it off. And so colds persist as endemic diseases at a relatively high level of infection.
Influenza is different yet again. It is one of the most dangerous endemic diseases, killing 290,000-650,000 people every year, most of them elderly. Vaccines exist, and are widely given every year to protect vulnerable people. But there is no prospect of wiping it out, in part because vaccination drives are not comprehensive, and in part because the virus itself mutates faster than vaccines can consistently keep up with.
The harm from endemic covid may eventually fall somewhere between that of influenza and the other common coronaviruses. Trevor Bedford, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle, has calculated that Delta reproduces twice as fast as H3N2, one of the most common flu strains. He also notes that, to date, SARS-CoV-2 has also evolved about five times faster than the flu virus (although that rate will slow as the disease becomes endemic and hence less prevalent). Dr Bedford believes that the burden of SARS-CoV-2 will come to resemble that of influenza in the next few years. Individual infections will be no greater threat, but covid’s higher transmissibility will mean more cases and more deaths. America alone could, by his estimates, see 50,000-100,000 deaths a year from covid. Flu kills about 12,000-52,000 people in America every year, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
Others think that instead covid will look more like the other common coronaviruses that circulate widely yet barely trouble health-care systems or society. David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, notes that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to that of the common coronaviruses than it is to that of the common influenzas. Unlike flu, its outbreaks are not driven by children. And whereas flu vaccines prevent at best 40-60% of infections bad enough to merit a visit to the doctor, and need to be tweaked every season in light of new variants, the jabs for covid are much better at preventing serious illness and death and thus far have required no updates. All this may mean that endemic SARS-CoV-2 will end up more like the other endemic coronaviruses than flu. Jabs may still be needed periodically for the most vulnerable but Dr Heymann thinks that even in bad covid seasons deaths may not get anywhere as high as those from influenza (using current flu vaccines).
Regardless of where endemic covid ends up, the world is not yet there. Hospitalisations and deaths are soaring in eastern Europe where vaccination campaigns have been poor. Large swathes of the populations of New Zealand and Australia, which have had low infection rates as a result of stringent lockdowns and slow vaccination roll-outs, are still immunologically naive. Countless people have yet to be reached by either virus or vaccine. When the virus arrives in parts of the world without immunity, the result will be spikes in disease and death.
Not yet out of the woods
In the medium term even highly vaccinated places will see flare ups. Britain, which ditched its precautions earlier than most other European countries, shows that covid can bear down on hospitals even in places with the benefit of high levels of vaccination (see chart 2). In September covid patients occupied 25-35% of its intensive-care beds. They tend to stay there for two to three weeks, leaving less room for post-operative care patients, who need a bed for only a couple of days. Roughly four in ten of those hospitalised with covid in Britain are unvaccinated. But the divide between vaccinated and unvaccinated is starker when it comes to death. Covid is now a leading cause of death among unvaccinated Britons. In the first half of 2021 just 1% of all deaths in fully vaccinated people in Britain were because of covid. Among the unvaccinated, the disease caused 37% of deaths.

Globally, these waves of infection will be dampened by the collective immunity that runs through and around the remaining pockets of the immunologically naive. Over time, these spikes will become ever rarer. And the world will stumble towards endemicity. What endemicity looks like and the speed with which countries get there will depend on three things: what proportion of a given population are immune to the virus and the quality and durability of that immunity; how the disease can be treated; and how the virus evolves.
Immunity is hard to measure. The immune system is complex and poorly understood. Both the quantity and quality of the antibodies it produces matter. “Up to six months after vaccination, the immune system is still in the process of optimising and perfecting its response,” says Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at the Washington University School of Medicine in Missouri. “Antibodies induced in the first two or three months are being slowly replaced by much better antibodies in terms of binding affinity to the spike. That’s hard to see. Quantitatively there are fewer antibodies but qualitatively things are improving.”
Nor are antibody levels a definitive marker of protection. “People get covid with very high antibody levels. It’s not that there is an obvious cut-off where you can say ‘This high, you are protected’,” says Sarah Walker, an epidemiologist at Oxford University. But at a population level, a high prevalence of neutralising antibodies—which prevent a pathogen from infecting the body—means fewer infections.
Even without great insight into people’s individual or collective immunological state, the broader picture is clear. As the virus has spread through populations, the immune systems of those who survive have been training themselves on its shape, preparing antibodies to fight off future infection. The protection vaccines afford against infection wanes in the months after people receive them, but the training they give the immune system to prevent serious disease and death stays strong.
Vaccines have offered about a third of humanity a shortcut to endemicity, bypassing sections of the path that would otherwise have been far more deadly. Some 3.8bn people have had at least one shot, and 2.8bn are fully vaccinated. Add them to those who have survived infection and it looks as if over half the world’s population boasts some degree of immunity to covid.
Vaccines greatly reduce the risk of severe illness and death. They have saved hundreds of thousands of lives and let many health-care systems keep operating. Covid is the first pandemic for which the cyclical tussle between viral spread and evolution and developing immunity has been short-circuited so fast and on such a scale.
But the overwhelming majority of those who have acquired immunity in this less risky manner reside in wealthier countries. In poor places the majority have and will continue to do so via infection. The rate of vaccination, which surged through the first half of the year to reach some 43m doses administered per day in late June, had dropped to 30m doses per day by the end of September, although much of this decline is because of slowing vaccination in China. It is remarkable that humans have been able to administer vaccines faster than the virus is able to spread between people, but this now looks as though it is a phenomenon confined only to rich places.
At present, the world’s collective level of immunity to covid is nowhere near that for other endemic respiratory diseases. That is because all humans are exposed to older endemic diseases repeatedly through their lives, particularly as children. Every exposure offers a new chance to train the immune system. Dr Ellebedy says it will take decades for humanity to reach a comparable level of immunity to covid. The coming years, then, will be characterised by a slow process of cyclical decline that runs in tandem with a broadening and deepening of immunity through infection.
To everything there is a season
Eventually, once immunity is widespread enough, cases of covid will fall into a seasonal pattern similar to other endemic respiratory diseases that have been circulating for a much longer time. Rachel Baker of Princeton University, who studies how viruses respond to environmental conditions, says that she expects within five or six years the patterns of covid infections will become seasonal, like those of other endemic coronaviruses, rather than being driven by immunological naivety.
The fact that covid will almost certainly become a disease that humanity can live with is thanks not only to vaccines but also to the rapidly advancing treatments. Remdesivir, an antiviral, can reduce hospital admissions by 87% in high-risk patients if it is given in the first stage of covid. But it needs to be administered intravenously in a hospital setting. Antibody therapies, another kind of drug, are highly effective but are usually given in the same way.
AstraZeneca’s antibody drug, AZD7442, which is under regulatory review in America, solves some of these problems because it can be in injected in places like doctors’ surgeries. It will probably be expensive so will not be used widely. But it offers a quick shot of covid-fighting antibodies so will provide extra protection to those at risk even after vaccination such as the immunocompromised. A hit of antibodies will also be useful as prophylaxis both for those at high risk of catching the virus (such as health workers) and those likely to become very ill (those with underlying conditions such as cancer or diabetes or the elderly residents of care homes).
Cheaper oral antiviral drugs which will further reduce the burden that covid places on humans, and on the hospitals that treat them, are also on the way. Most promising is molnupiravir, made by Merck and Ridgeback, both drugmakers. Taken within five days of symptoms’ onset it reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by about 50% in patients with mild or moderate covid.
Merck expects to supply 10m courses of the drug by the end of 2021. Pricing will be tiered, and so it will be affordable across the planet. Results from trials of similar drugs from Pfizer, Roche and Atea Pharmaceuticals could add to the antiviral arsenal.
Antivirals such as molnupiravir do not cure covid-19. But they make it much less dangerous. One worry, however, is that the virus will evolve to resist a single line of antiviral therapy. Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Oxford University, warns of the need to consider using combinations of antivirals from the outset. HIV antiviral drugs showed that resistance to single therapies arises quickly.

These drugs will make covid easier to live with but governments and public-health authorities will still need to ensure that any outbreaks do not overwhelm health-care systems. Each winter the circulation of influenza will add to the challenge. It may make sense to once again take steps to reduce the transmission of the disease. In the rich world very few occasions should require going into the office with a respiratory complaint, especially in winter. Annual boosters and flu shots will help keep vulnerable people out of hospital.
Over all this hangs the inevitability of the coronavirus’s continued evolution, and the question of its impact. Any new variant that emerges is overwhelmingly likely to do so based on Delta, which has displaced virtually all the rest. If a new variant emerges which outcompetes Delta, it will eventually spread everywhere. The Beta variant, which is now being driven towards extinction, was better at defeating immunity than Delta is, but less good at spreading, and so receded.
A new variant that combined their traits would be a disaster. “Delta Plus”, a subvariant that has so far not taken off, has picked up mutations of the sort which characterised Beta, but no evidence suggests yet that this is leading to its wider spread or vaccine evasion. But the possibility of a Delta variant with Beta characteristics, as well as the need to keep people out of hospital, will always be a reason for limiting the spread of the disease. “We’re ill-equipped to predict the timeline,” says Daniel Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, since coronavirus evolution is by its nature unpredictable.
No matter what mutations SARS-CoV-2 picks up in future, endemic covid will not exist in a vacuum. Viruses compete with each other. A study carried out by Public Health England on data gathered between January and April 2020 found that people already infected with influenza were 58% less likely to test positive for covid later—probably because the two viruses were jockeying for dominance within the human body. For a few vulnerable people, though, it was possible to get infected with both at the same time. For them the risk of death was almost double that of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone.
Even as endemicity sets in, the world still has a long way to go. It is not using all the tools—vaccines in the arms of all the vulnerable, masks and ventilation—to get there as fast and safely as possible. Covid will eventually become endemic. But it will throw up many challenges in the months and years ahead. The road to the new normal could yet be very bumpy.
Correction (October 22, 2021): A previous version of this piece stated that 80-90% of those hospitalised with covid in Britain are unvaccinated. In fact, about four in ten are unjabbed.

1623,"TO GET A sense of how policymakers used to think about unemployment, consider the Jackson Hole meeting, a jamboree for central bankers, in August 1994. One speaker, Alan Blinder, felt it necessary to remind his colleagues that “In my view, central banks...do indeed have a role in reducing unemployment,” not just in reducing inflation. Many in the audience thought that he was a bold radical. “I was called an outlier, and some worse words,” says Mr Blinder, who at the time was vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve. The sky-high inflation of the 1970s was still fresh in the minds of many participants. Like Paul Volcker, the Fed’s chairman in 1979-87, they believed that conquering inflation was their sole true calling, no matter the collateral damage. 
Today Mr Blinder’s views on unemployment would seem mundanely mainstream. The pandemic has helped to contribute to an intellectual revolution in macroeconomics. Policymakers of both left and right have come to recognise the enormous redistributive power of a booming economy—one that generates both plentiful jobs and healthy wage growth—for low-income and minority groups. A “lesson from the recovery from the great recession [of 2007-09]”, argue Jay Shambaugh, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, and Michael Strain, a conservative reformer, in a new paper, “is that low-wage workers and low-income households are relatively more sensitive to the business cycle”. Increasingly, policymakers believe they can do a lot more to push the economy to the top of that cycle. And they are more willing than they were to live with the trade-offs this entails.

There were signs of a change even before the covid-19 pandemic arrived. By 2015 most governments were losing their enthusiasm for the fiscal austerity that had marked the period after the financial crisis. Many came to realise the damage that years of budget-cutting had done. Others noted that the cost of borrowing had plunged, making fiscal stimulus less expensive. Analysis by UBS quantifies this change. Public spending was a net drag on the global economy in every year from 2010 to 2014. It began stimulating the economy in 2015, and that effect was worth as much as 1% of global income by 2019. 
Some of this extra spending was directed at reducing inequality. For decades governments had chipped away at the liberality of welfare states in order to boost incentives to work. But in the years before the pandemic there were signs that the “replacement rate” of unemployment benefits, which measures them as a share of in-work incomes, was rising.
This pro-poor shift was not just about cash. Some jurisdictions have legislated to give more employment rights to “gig” workers. In February Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that Uber’s drivers were not independent contractors and so were entitled to various in-work benefits, including the minimum wage. Others have cracked down on rule-breaking by employers, such as unfairly depriving workers of pay. Australia has strengthened labour-market enforcement, issuing more notices to errant employers and recovering more unpaid wages. Governments have also bumped up the minimum wage. Its value in the average rich country, relative to average earnings, rose from 35% in 2000 to 41% in 2019, seemingly without the adverse effects on employment that some economists earlier feared. 
The big bank rethink
Central banks were also changing. In the face of persistently low inflation, members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee repeatedly revised down their estimates of the rate of unemployment that was consistent with a 2% inflation target, from 5.5% in 2012 to 4.1% by 2020. In 2019 the Fed launched a wholesale review of its monetary-policy framework.
The pandemic has helped galvanise these efforts. In its new framework, announced last year, the Federal Reserve has switched to “average inflation targeting”. As part of this the Fed now emphasises the goal of maximising employment, implying that inflation could temporarily overshoot its 2% target if that helps more Americans to stay in or join the workforce. Returning to maximum employment “will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private sector,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, argued in February.
The Fed is by no means the only central bank that is now placing greater emphasis on employment. In 2019 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which pioneered the single-minded focus on inflation in the 1980s, switched to a “dual mandate”, promising to seek to maximise employment as well. In September 2020, Wakatabe Masazumi, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, said that “Personally, I feel there is room to consider the idea, voiced by some people, that monetary policy should focus more on job and income conditions.” Today it is hard to imagine the Bank of England pre-emptively raising interest rates so as to forestall a rise in inflation above 2%, as it did in 2017-18. Instead, the bank is more likely to wait until inflation consistently exceeds its target.
None of these changes means that central bankers no longer care about inflation, the traditional concern of bankers and investors. But their heightened concern with employment means that they are implicitly placing more emphasis on the interests of the poor. As one former senior central banker says, somewhat impishly, “Central bankers still do represent the capitalist classes—but less than before.”
Fiscal policy is also being rethought. Across the rich world the response to the covid-19 pandemic has been massive and sustained fiscal support for economies. And it is notable that this time, unlike after the global financial crisis, almost all governments are delaying moves to reduce fiscal stimulus so as to rein in gaping budget deficits and rising public debts. As ever Europe, scarred by the euro crisis, has been more reluctant to accept huge budget deficits, but even there efforts to trim borrowing have been more careful and slower than in the past.
Finally, the pandemic is reshaping welfare policy. Few doubt that trillions of extra spending to protect households’ incomes during lockdowns did a lot of good. In the first months of the pandemic America’s poverty rate declined, even as economic activity collapsed. In-work benefits such as the earned-income tax credit were protected. Such policies have proved popular with voters. 
A quiet revolution is now under way. Data from the International Labour Organisation suggest that countries have continued to introduce new social-protection programmes long after the acute phase of the first covid-19 lockdowns had passed. Britain may turn a temporary boost of £1,000 ($1,400) a year to its main welfare benefit into a permanent one. President Joe Biden is making child tax credits dramatically more generous, a provision which is expected to cut child poverty in half. Many European countries are keen to wind down their job-protection schemes as fast as possible; paying somebody not to work for a year or more may ultimately not be in anyone’s interest. Australia’s ended last month. Yet there seems little doubt that politicians will dust such ideas off whenever the next crisis hits.
Taken together such changes show that policymakers are more focused on the plight of workers than they once were. Yet making labour markets work better will still require governments, employers and workers to think more creatively. ■

1624,"IN THE EARLY months of the pandemic it was common to hear that Africa had been spared the worst of covid-19. Experts pointed to low official rates of illness or death and speculated about whether they were a result of youthful demography, Africa’s experience of dealing with infectious diseases such as Ebola and HIV, or something else entirely, perhaps underlying immunity. The premise was shaky, however. Most African countries test tiny numbers of people. Only a few keep good track of deaths. One that does, South Africa, has suffered one of the world’s highest levels of excess mortality during the pandemic. The sanguine view also neglected how, even if Africa’s waves really were less deadly than elsewhere, there might also be more of them because of low vaccination rates.
Today there is little sign of the continent being spared. As of June 28th the seven-day rolling average of confirmed cases in South Africa was 267 per million people, more than five times the global average, and rising steeply. Almost a quarter of tests are positive, suggesting that many cases are going undetected. “The latest surge threatens to be Africa’s worst yet,” says Matshidiso Moeti, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Africa. Cases are rising especially quickly in 12 countries, she says, though “health systems are already pushed to breaking point” in many more. In Namibia, Uganda and Zambia, among other places, oxygen is running out and hospital beds are full. The WHO calculates that, within weeks, the Africa-wide caseload of the third wave will surpass the peak of the second, which in turn was higher than the peak of the first.

Dr Moeti highlights two reasons for the strength of the latest wave. The first is public fatigue. In rich countries covid-19 was seen as a once-in-a-lifetime event to be endured until vaccines arrived; in many African ones it is another burden among many, with no sign of relief. Governments have been slower to impose lockdowns this time around. They have no money to pay people to stay at home, fear the effects on commerce and note the lack of public clamour for restrictions. ""The third wave has come with a severity that most countries were not prepared for,” adds John Nkengasong, the director of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a continent-wide public-health body.

The second is the arrival of new variants. Not every African country can sequence virus genomes. But more than half have reported the Alpha variant first detected in Britain and the Beta variant initially spotted in South Africa. Nearly a quarter have reported the Delta variant linked to India’s catastrophic second wave.
Those countries include Congo and Uganda. Neither has many confirmed cases of the virus. Congo, a country of 87m people, has recorded 40,000, fewer than Glasgow, a Scottish city of 630,000 people. But, in an indication of covid-19’s true spread, 32 of the country’s 600-odd MPs have died from the disease. In Uganda more than 200 MPs and parliamentary staff have tested positive in the past few weeks. This is part of a broader trend. As of February, Africa accounted for 17 of the 24 government ministers or heads of state who are reported to have died from covid-19, noted a paper in the British Medical Journal.
South Africa is at the centre of the continent’s third wave. On June 27th President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a partial lockdown, warning that cases would surpass previous peaks. Gauteng, the province that is home to Johannesburg and about a quarter of South Africans, accounts for more than half of recent cases. The week to June 26th saw more excess deaths in Johannesburg than at any time since records began in 1997. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Ambulances drive around looking for beds. In the absence of a government plan, doctors use WhatsApp groups to find out if other hospitals have space. Even the best private hospitals are wrestling with grim decisions about who gets a spot in intensive-care units—in other words, with who lives and who dies. “It’s real ‘Who gets the parachute?’ stuff,” says a doctor.
South Africa is also dealing with public fatigue, a battered economy and new variants. Delta is “rapidly displacing” the Beta variant, says Mr Ramaphosa. But the government has added to the carnage. There is no permanent health minister, following the suspension of Zweli Mkhize, who is accused of steering a contract to a firm run by associates (he denies the allegations). A large public hospital in Johannesburg is closed because the provincial government was slow to repair it after a fire in April. Mr Ramaphosa’s televised “family meetings” initially won plaudits. But his appearances are increasingly tone-deaf. The latest restrictions, which include another ban on alcohol sales, came late in the day.
Inoculation would have lessened the impact of the third wave. But just over 1% of Africans have been fully vaccinated. Of the nearly 3bn doses administered globally, fewer than 2% are in Africa.
Hesitancy remains a problem. Tanzania has yet to start jabbing arms because its late president, John Magufuli, denied the usefulness of vaccines. South Africa rejected a shipment of AstraZeneca doses on the grounds that data suggested it would not stop mild infection, an argument criticised by scientists who said it would probably reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death. In Gauteng those who can are seeking other options. Diplomatic missions are organising their own vaccines. Expatriates are flying home to get jabbed.
But the main reason for low vaccination rates is simple: a lack of supply. Dr Nkengasong notes that African countries have placed enough orders to meet Africa CDC’s target of getting 60% of the continent vaccinated by the end of 2022. The problem has been turning orders into deliveries.
An announcement made on June 30th should help. The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, and the American, French and German governments, said they would provide €600m in financing to help Aspen Pharmacare, a South African firm, manufacture vaccines. The deal could help produce as many as 250m single-shot Johnson  Johnson doses for the continent this year, including 30m for South Africa. Such volumes raise the prospect that a fourth wave could be less deadly than the third. ■

1625,"THE HUMAN brain may be the most complex object on Earth. It contains 85bn nerve cells and trillions of interconnections. As these cells process information, people experience consciousness and thought. The brain is made even more mysterious by the fact it is scrutable only when alive. To truly understand brains means examining them while they are functioning inside the body.
Few humans in their right mind would volunteer to plug today’s instruments and sensors into their living brains. Doing so often involves having someone drill into your skull, with the risk of infection or brain damage. And so neuroscientists seeking to understand human brains turn to humanity’s nearest animal relatives, primates.

This is controversial. Monkeys’ usefulness as a model for human neurology also raises the stakes of conducting experiments upon them: the better their brains serve as analogues for human ones, the more it follows that they probably suffer analogously, too. Animal-rights activists rightly point out that monkeys cannot consent to such treatment. It is unlikely they would acquiesce were they able to do so.
The controversy has had an uneven impact round the world. In Europe and America, under pressure from animal-rights groups, the amount of neuroscience research carried out on monkeys is flat or declining. Both places have or are considering laws requiring an end to their use. But as we explain this week, neuroscience research on monkeys is booming in China and Japan.
America and Europe should narrow this gap. Allowing China to forge ahead in brain science without mounting a comparable programme of research would be strategically foolish. A Chinese neuroscience laboratory in Shanghai has already attracted one of Germany’s leading researchers and his laboratory. As he and his colleagues work out new ways to gain access to and manipulate the brain, China will be the first to enjoy the fruits of that effort. To avoid depending on China for access to such knowledge, America and Europe need to take action now.
More knowledge of the brain is not always a force for good. Given the Chinese state’s official policy of military-civil fusion, there is probably little that can be done to stop the Chinese Communist Party obtaining the capability to build neuro-weapons on the basis of its brain-research programmes, should they bear fruit. But liberal societies should at least keep track of what is possible, and how it works, through research programmes under their own control.
And were laboratories in China and Japan to come up with treatments for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s as a result of their studies of monkeys’ brains, it would be near impossible for Western countries to refuse to buy them to treat their citizens. Leaving others to do the dirty work of generating knowledge using means you consider to be unethical, while at the same time encouraging it by adding to demand is not taking the moral high ground. It is hypocrisy. Better for Western countries to carry out the necessary but troubling research themselves, working to the standards they deem necessary.
Taking responsibility for the suffering they cause starts with maintaining America’s and Europe’s high-quality primate research. Keeping up with China’s expansion also makes sense. Neuroscientists should be braver in publicly defending their work. Governments must protect their ability to carry out legal research.
Some experiments on monkeys can be avoided by using computer simulations or by growing brain cells in Petri dishes. But the brain is so poorly understood at present that probing living ones will remain essential for some time. A radical alternative to the use of monkeys in neuroscience would be to rely instead on consenting humans. After all, people already join biomedical studies and they readily don non-invasive brain-scanning hardware.
Grey areas
Getting sensors inside the skull, next to human neurons, is still difficult. However, the tools used to probe brains are becoming smaller and less invasive. One day they may resemble an injectable, connected silicon dust more than an implantable electronic device. Such instruments would make the prospect of gaining informed consent from human subjects less daunting. But to get to that point, humans will have to rely on monkeys for some time. People do not yet understand their brains well enough to study themselves safely. ■",2
1626,"STARING GLUMLY at his paddy field in the depths of rural Sri Lanka, B. R. Weeraratne sighs. The regular incursions of greedy elephants have been bad enough. But the government’s outright ban on agrochemicals will, he fears, slash his yields of nadu and samba, two of the most popular varieties of rice. Though the 56-year-old likes the idea of organic farming in principle, he thinks “the soil, the plants and the farmers all need time to learn it.” It should be phased in. Otherwise farmers like him may be flung into destitution.
But Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka’s president, is adamant. The former army officer was elected in 2019 largely on his reputation for ruthless dynamism. In 2009, as secretary of defence under his brother Mahinda, then the president, he brutally ended a long civil war against Tamil rebels. As urban-development secretary he “beautified” cities by kicking thousands of people out of slums. As president he has taken a military approach to tackling covid-19 by bringing in the army alongside medical staff. More than 70% of over-11s have been double-jabbed.

Mr Rajapaksa’s military approach to turning Sri Lanka into the world’s first fully organic producer of food overnight looks less encouraging. For sure, his manifesto (“Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”) did promise a revolution in fertiliser use. But it was to have taken ten years. So it was a shock to Mr Weeraratne when a total ban was announced earlier this year. No more agrochemical imports are to be allowed after stocks run out. The Planters’ Association predicts a drop in tea production and export revenue by around 25% in the next six months and thereafter by nearly a half. Sri Lanka is the world’s fourth-largest grower of tea, exporting $1.24bn of the stuff last year, or 1.5% of GDP.
More than 90% of Sri Lanka’s farmers use chemical fertiliser and 85% of them expect crop losses in the coming season, according to Verité Research, a local think-tank; nearly two-thirds broadly back Mr Rajapaksa’s policy but 80% of those say they need at least a year to adjust.
Meanwhile people still need to eat. Inflation is hovering near 6% and food prices are up more than 11%. Rising global commodity prices, declining foreign reserves and ceilings on domestic retail prices have been causing shortages of essentials such as sugar and milk powder. On August 31st the president declared a state of emergency and appointed an army officer to regulate the market, among other things by confiscating stockpiles.
As foodstuffs began to run out, on September 29th he lifted the ceiling on the price of rice, which promptly jumped 17-32%, depending on the variety. Price controls on milk powder, sugar, wheat flour and domestic cooking gas were lifted on October 8th. The government has also, at last, allowed some more imports. Yet its preferred solution for shrinking a trade deficit that has grown to 42% of GDP has been to curb imports, such as fertiliser.
Foreign reserves, at just $2.6bn or enough for six weeks of imports, are shrinking. Between now and July the government must pay $7bn to service its foreign debts. With short-term liabilities so far outweighing reserves, notes Deshal de Mel, an economist at Verité, and Sri Lanka’s credit rating cut to junk by the main agencies, borrowing in global capital markets is all but impossible. Basil Rajapaksa, the finance minister (another brother of the president), admits the situation is bleak. Covid, he says, has contributed to a loss of $8.6bn in revenue. Earnings from tourism, usually $3bn-4bn a year, have collapsed. Remittances from Sri Lankans abroad have fallen 35% compared with a year ago.
Most independent economists reckon that an IMF-backed restructuring programme is the least bad way out. But the government would find it hard to accept conditions that undermine the country’s much-vaunted sovereignty—and above all would squeeze voters such as Mr Weeraratne, who are already disenchanted. Like the country’s crops, the Rajapaksas are, to put it mildly, in need of a pick-me-up.■",2
1627,"KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, Greece’s prime minister, cast it as a love story. “History…wants us together,” he told Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, in Paris on September 28th. “So does geography.” He serenaded Mr Macron with tales of Ionian seafarers landing in Marseilles and the French Philhellenes who backed Greece’s war of independence. Mr Macron said that Greece was “a civilisation that has inspired us and enabled us to be ourselves”. Then the two leaders consummated their courtship with what they are calling a “strategic” defence pact.
The Franco-Greek relationship has been forged in rivalry with Turkey, which last year squared off with Greek warships around Cyprus, and with French ones off Libya. An anti-Turkey bloc, including France, Greece, Israel, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, has gradually taken shape. Mr Mitsotakis, eager to secure French support and bolster his own armed forces, had already agreed to buy 18 Rafale warplanes from France in January, at a cost of €2.5bn ($2.9bn), and six more in September. Now he will also buy three new French frigates, with the option of one more.

That is a boon for Greece’s navy, which has just 13 ageing frigates against Turkey’s newer fleet of 16. It is also a well-timed consolation prize for Naval Group, the majority-state-owned French arms firm which Australia turfed out of a lucrative submarine contract on September 15th as part of its AUKUS pact with America and Britain. Naval Group is building the new frigates in Brittany; Greece is supposed to take delivery of its first in 2025.
Yet both sides were keen to show that this was no mere arms contract. “It strengthens…our strategic autonomy and our European sovereignty,” said Mr Macron. Mr Mitsotakis agreed that it was “the first bold step towards European strategic autonomy”. Mr Macron has long been fond of such language—often irritating his eastern European allies, who see it as antagonistic to America—but it has a particular resonance after AUKUS. French officials have portrayed the Anglophone pact as a demonstration of American unreliability and a wake-up call for Europeans to collaborate more on defence matters.
To that end, the new agreement also includes a striking element that is absent from AUKUS: a mutual defence clause. France and Greece are already obliged to support each other in the event of an attack, through Article Five of NATO’s charter and the more obscure Article 42:7 of the EU’s Lisbon treaty. Notably, Mr Mitsotakis said that the partnership now “goes beyond” those obligations. The decision to formalise a separate, bilateral alliance suggests that both Mr Macron and Mr Mitsotakis are concerned that, should a serious crisis erupt in the Mediterranean, Turkey might stymie NATO from the inside.
The idea of a mutual-defence clause that is beefier than Article Five—which obliges an ally only to take “such action as it deems necessary”— is not unprecedented. France did the same thing with Germany in the Aachen treaty of 2019. The Anglo-French Lancaster House treaty of 2010 also implies far-reaching nuclear guarantees.
But such bilateral deals are bad news for NATO, says Wess Mitchell, an American former state department official who co-chaired a reflection group for the alliance last year. The new pact “will be viewed in NATO and especially by eastern members of the alliance as implicitly undermining Article Five,” he says. Others, like Poland, may be encouraged to seek their own ad hoc guarantees from America.
Moreover, despite the rhetoric of European sovereignty and autonomy, the ever-closer alignment of France and Greece reflects the EU’s divisions more than its cohesion; it does not, after all, involve the rest of the EU. In recent years both countries have grown frustrated with the bloc’s reluctance to put more pressure on Turkey. Germany, in particular, with its large Turkish diaspora and trade links, has been eager to water down such measures.
Germany is also selling advanced diesel-electric submarines to Turkey’s navy. So later this decade, a very European contest will play out in the Mediterranean: France’s finest frigates tracking Germany’s best submarines. ■",2
1628,"ON NOVEMBER 15th, at around seven in the morning Greenwich Mean Time, the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) was warned that there was some debris coming their way and that they ought to get into the two spacecraft that are currently moored there. That way, if anything went wrong, the four Americans, one Russian and one German currently crewing the ISS under the command of another Russian, Colonel Anton Shkaplerov, could make a quick getaway.
The source of this new debris was, at the time, unspecified. Now it is known to have been the remains of a Soviet-era spy satellite (known as Kosmos-1408) which had been used as the target in a test of a Russian anti-satellite weapon (ASAT).

According to America’s State Department this “reckless” act turned the two-tonne space hulk, which was orbiting at an altitude of about 500km, into more than 1,500 pieces of orbital debris trackable by radar (which may be down to a few centimetres in diameter) as well as many more smaller fragments. The cloud of shrapnel will, over time, spread out around the Earth. It will take a while for the orbits of all the hypersonic flotsam to be determined accurately enough to allow the ISS, China’s space station Tiangong, or anything else in low-Earth orbit to take evasive action.
There is no doubt that America is telling the truth. LeoLabs, a Silicon Valley startup which tracks satellites and space debris, confirmed that the satellite had been broken up. Russia had filed a warning that there would be a rocket launch from Plesetsk early that morning, and an anti-satellite weapon called Nudol has previously been tested from the same place (though not against a real target). Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at Harvard who keeps a database of satellites, tweeted a diagram showing that the time announced for the launch corresponded to a time when Kosmos-1408 would be in range of the missile.
Russia did not immediately confirm its responsibility. But its ASAT shot can be seen as fitting into a pattern of provocative actions over past weeks, most seriously a large build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border.
Experts condemned the action for further increasing the risks which space debris poses to the fast-growing number of satellites in vulnerable low-Earth orbits. The only event to have created more such fragments this century was a Chinese ASAT test carried out in 2007; it was responsible for about 3,000 of the 10,000 pieces of debris that America keeps an eye on for threats to the ISS. “That’s been our nemesis for an extended period of time,” Bill Gerstenmaier, once the head of NASA’s human spaceflight programme and now an executive at SpaceX, which ferries astronauts to the ISS, said at an industry event in Las Vegas. “It looks like now we have another one of these. This is not what we need to do.” America’s Space Command said the debris would pose a “significant risk” to the ISS, other human space missions and satellites for years, if not decades.
An Indian ASAT test in 2019 created considerably less debris, much of it too low to be a threat, but sparked further condemnation and renewed calls for such tests to be outlawed. Indeed, it is arguable that they already are: the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 requires countries to consult with each other before doing anything which might lead to “potentially harmful interference” with the activities of other countries. The space liability convention of 1972 could also apply to damage caused by the debris. But negotiations for a specific ban have yet to gain traction.
Even if it does not lead to a ban, though, this provocation will surely have international fallout. America, Canada, the European Space Agency and Japan—Russia’s partners in the ISS—cannot fail to respond. Meanwhile, on the station itself, the direct risks are not, for the moment, reckoned to be as bad as initially feared. Although some of the station remains sealed off, the astronauts and cosmonauts are back at work. What they all feel about the actions of their commander’s motherland has not yet been revealed.

1629,"IT WAS DIFFICULT to tell the smells apart. For months the town of Agareb, near Tunisia’s coast, had reeked of rubbish because of an overflowing landfill. In September the authorities closed the site, which residents were calling a danger to public health. But this month, after trash had piled up in the streets, it was reopened. Protesters cried foul and on November 10th clashed with security forces. Along with the stench of tear-gas and garbage, a new smell filled the air: burning tyres.
One person was killed and a police station was ransacked. It was the worst violence in Tunisia since President Kais Saied suspended parliament and grabbed power in July. Critics called his actions a coup. But many in Agareb applauded him. The town of 40,000 has long been neglected. Its poor residents have grown disillusioned with the country’s decade-old democracy. They say they voted overwhelmingly for Mr Saied in 2019, hoping he would clean up corruption. If he had to act like an authoritarian to do it, so be it.

That was how most of them felt in July. Now they have changed their minds. The people of Agareb are calling Mr Saied a dictator. For it was he who overruled the local authorities and reopened the landfill, in part to provide relief for nearby Sfax. Tunisia’s second city and industrial powerhouse had been suffering under even bigger mountains of uncollected garbage.
Residents of Agareb say the landfill, opened in 2008, was meant to be in use for only five years. A judge ordered it closed in 2019, to no avail. Now it is not only overflowing, but full of dangerous industrial and medical waste, including amputated body parts and fetuses, say activists. They claim the dump has spread disease including respiratory ailments and cancer.
Tunisia collects around 2.5m tonnes of waste every year. Little of it is recycled. Much of it ends up in one of 13 official landfills without being properly treated. A lot of it just piles up in the streets. Even in Tunis, the capital, less than two-thirds of the waste is collected, says the World Bank. In Sfax province the local government refused to collect rubbish after the Agareb landfill was closed.
Collecting trash can be profitable. But the big contracts offered to waste-management companies have been controversial. Elyes Fakhfakh resigned last year as prime minister after he was accused of concealing a conflict of interest in awarding such deals (he denies wrongdoing). His opponents also have links to businessmen with fingers in the waste-management pie.
Last summer an Italian company sent nearly 300 containers of “plastic trash” to Tunisia. A Tunisian firm had agreed to recycle it for a fee. But the trash was mostly household waste, of the sort now piling up on Tunisian streets. The deal violated international treaties, as well as Tunisian law. Twenty-six people, including a former environment minister, were arrested.
The waste-management scandal typifies Tunisia’s corruption and mismanagement, with the burden falling mostly on the poor. It was hoped that Mr Saied’s government would do better. But cleaning up Tunisia is proving to be as hard as ever. Many of the country’s landfills are in poorer areas like Agareb. Any of such places could be the next to erupt. ■",2
1630,"London (CNN)Here in the UK, a deep-seated debate on privacy is taking place after the Guardian newspaper announced it was taking legal action over the media's exclusion from a hearing on Prince Philip's will earlier this year.A version of this story appeared in the November 19 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here. In September, Andrew McFarlane, president of the High Court's Family Division, ruled that Philip's will would be sealed for 90 years. Among the few present was a lawyer representing the duke's estate from law firm Farrer & Co, the Queen's private solicitors, and the attorney general, the government's chief legal adviser. The media weren't told of the hearing or permitted to attend, with the public interest represented by the attorney general.A Guardian News & Media spokesperson told CNN in an emailed statement that the High Court's decision to ban the media from the court hearing without informing outlets or allowing them to make representations ""is a clear threat to the principles of open justice.""""It is also concerning that the court appears to believe that only the attorney general can speak to the public interest,"" the spokesperson continued. ""We are seeking permission to argue that the behaviour of the high court in this instance constitutes a failure of open justice and that the case should be reheard.""According to British law, if a person prepares a will prior to their death, it becomes a public document after being admitted to probate, and anyone can obtain a copy from the Probate Registry for a fee.  However, anyone can ask the court to ""seal"" a will and keep it private, according to Geoff Kertesz and Judith Swinhoe-Standen from UK law firm Stewarts. ""The court must be persuaded that it would be 'undesirable or otherwise inappropriate' to make the will public,"" they told CNN. ""Historically, the courts have approved such applications only for senior members of the royal family. It is unclear under what, if any, other circumstances the court might agree to keep a will private.""One recent senior royal whose will was made public was Diana, Princess of Wales, who gave up her HRH title when she divorced Prince Charles.Judge McFarlane said in his ruling that ""it has become the convention that, following the death of a senior member of the Royal Family, an application to seal their will is made"" and that ""it appears that such applications have always been heard in private and have invariably been granted.""He said it was understood that the first member of the royal family whose will was sealed was Prince Francis of Teck, the younger brother of King George V's wife Queen Mary, who died in 1910.Legal and royal expert Michael L. Nash told CNN: ""It was Queen Mary who used these unusual royal powers and prerogatives never used before.""Francis died suddenly at the age of 40, following a botched medical examination of his nose, according to Nash, who also authored ""Royal Wills in Britain from 1509 to 2008."" He said the prince was a ""reckless gambler"" but also an ""extremely lovable character,"" who bequeathed treasured family jewels to his mistress in a draft version of his will.Nash, who has seen a copy of the draft will that surfaced in archives in Northern Ireland, said the prince was constantly in financial trouble, and upon his death ""Queen Mary knew that the creditors, once they saw the will, would descend and everything that Frank died possessed of would have to be sold in order to satisfy these massive debts.""He continued, ""And she was absolutely mortified that the public would be able to know about the state that her brother had got himself into.""Nash also pointed out that the family has faced legal challenges to the secrecy of royal wills before, the most recent of which was considered by the court in 2007. He highlighted an application by Robert Andrew Brown, who claimed to be the illegitimate child of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret. Brown sought to open Margaret's will, as well as that of the Queen Mother, but the claim was dismissed as a fantasy, Nash said. Privacy has become the debate of the modern era for the British monarchy, with the question of how much privacy a family member deserves routinely emerging. Critics often say royals use their positions and privilege to secure exemptions and evade scandal, while also noting that the Windsors are funded by taxpayers.In his judgment, McFarlane said he was the custodian of a safe holding more than 30 envelopes, each of which supposedly contains the secret will of a dead royal. The most recent additions were made in 2002 with those of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.  McFarlane also touched upon why privacy was afforded for royal wills, saying: ""The answer to the question 'why should there be an exception for senior members of the Royal Family?' is, in my view, clear: it is necessary to enhance the protection afforded to the private lives of this unique group of individuals, in order to protect the dignity and standing of the public role of the Sovereign and other close members of Her family.""Lawyers Kertesz and Swinhoe-Standen said there was a notable difference in the handling of the Duke of Edinburgh's wills and those of royals before him.""All previously sealed royal wills are to be kept private indefinitely, but Prince Philip's will is different in that its privacy is time-restricted to 90 years,"" the pair said. ""After 90 years, certain officials may inspect it, and they may then invite the court to rule on whether the will should be made public at that point, or kept private for a further period.""Nash described the time limit as an ""important advance,"" as the previous position meant wills were concealed in perpetuity. ""That gave serious misgivings to historians, lawyers, researchers -- everybody that had a valid reason for reading the will,"" he added.""I can see in future cases that 90 years tumbling down to, say, 50 years or even less. So that there is at least some possibility of people living now being able to read (a will) at some time in the future during their lifetime.""HAVE YOUR SAYSo, what do you think: Should or shouldn't the public be allowed to read a royal will, and why?It's certainly an interesting one to ponder.

1631,"CALL IT “Zoom face-envy”. Because of the rise of video-conferencing during the pandemic, legions now spend hours staring at their own faces and, inevitably, comparing them with those of others. Poor lighting and the skewed angles of laptop cameras are rarely flattering. Nor is “lockdown face”, brought on by stress, or a dearth of sunlight and exercise. For Kim, a 57-year-old actress in New York City, Zoom seemed to add ten pounds and a “crepey” look to her skin. After seeing “way too much” of that, she got a facelift last summer. She is delighted with the result. Similarly, Michèle Le Tournelle, a 62-year-old retiree near Nantes in France, said the “horrible” confinement turned into “a revelation”: it spurred her to undergo a slimming procedure and a facelift with which she has been “very, very, very” pleased.
Many cosmetic surgeons had expected the pandemic to hammer business. Instead the industry is enjoying a Zoom-boom. The American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery reckons that the pandemic has led to a 10% increase in cosmetic surgery countrywide. In France, despite limits on elective procedures during the pandemic, cosmetic surgeries are up by nearly 20%, estimates the French Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. For Ashton Collins, the boss of Save Face, a firm in Cardiff that refers people seeking minimally invasive cosmetic treatments to the 852 (and counting) practitioners it has accredited across Britain, business is “through the roof”. In Italy, Pier Andrea Cicogna of Studio Cicogna, a plastic-surgery clinic in Treviso, says his revenue has risen by nearly a third despite more than three months of closure.

Every day can be Christmas
Apart from face-envy, other forces are at play. In the age of teleworking, patients can recover inconspicuously at home as bruises and swelling fade. It helps that professionals, the biggest clients for pricey cosmetic surgery, are more likely to work from home than many others. In normal times finagling time off work is a big hurdle (which is why Christmas breaks have traditionally been the high season for cosmetic surgery). Recuperation is made easier by the widespread use of face-masks, which neatly hide away the signs of surgery to the nose, chin, cheeks and jawline, as well as the “resurfacing” of facial skin and lip-plumping.
Money not spent on clothes, evenings out and travel has financed much of this. Gains in the stockmarket have also helped, says Alan Matarasso, whose clinic in New York is “being stretched” by requests for surgery. Intriguingly, Dr Matarasso, a former president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, thinks a more ethereal force is also at work: by casting light on “the fragility of life”, the pandemic is imbuing people with greater desire to squeeze more out of whatever time they have left.
Covid-19 has highlighted our helplessness, concurs Richie Chan, the head of cosmetic surgery at an OT Healthcare clinic in Hong Kong, which has enjoyed a roughly 15% rise in procedures; as a result people have become keener to exert control over their bodies through elective surgery. Pierfrancesco Cirillo, head of the Italian Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery in Rome, points to previous increases around the world in minimally invasive procedures following the 9/11 attacks (about 6%) and the global financial crisis (10%). The pandemic, he says, has coincided with a record rise in cosmetic surgery of about 12% in Italy.
Surgeons marvel at another recent change: before the pandemic, one in ten of Studio Cicogna’s surgery patients were men. Now it’s one in five. Most operations are for eyelids, noses and “love handles” liposuction. For minimally invasive skin rejuvenation, the proportion of male clients has risen from roughly one in eight to nearly half. In Britain men now account for about 40% of skin rejuvenations, says Save Face.
Zoom gloom
By highlighting her defects when she made calls for her PR job, Zoom had become demoralising, recalls a 47-year-old single mum in Milan: “I felt uglier.” Being stuck at home without occasion to dress up didn’t help. “I really needed to do something to feel better,” she says. Eyelid surgery wiped “ten years off my face”, she reports; the operation was “psychologically therapeutic”.
Such satisfaction is common, but it is not universal. Some psychologists fear that the boom in beauty treatments is encouraging an obsessive-compulsive disorder sometimes called dysmorphia. Sufferers obsess over an imagined or exaggerated body flaw. This can be magnified by a morose mood and a lack of normal social interaction—not to mention more time spent comparing oneself to others. As a result, Dr Cirillo says, cosmetic surgeons must work harder to turn down those with a pathologically confused self-image.
A less acute but more common problem is that a growing share of those asking for surgery seek an unattainable appearance. Dr Cirillo worries about the emergence of a “sort of supermarket” for aesthetic surgery in which less-principled surgeons accept patients with unhealthy or unrealistic aspirations. As they cash in, surgeons would be wise to avoid would-be patients who show up with photos of an envied celebrity. Success is more likely with those who, less ambitiously, present pictures of their younger selves.",2
1632,"LIFE FOR women who sell sex in Manhattan may be a little easier these days. In April the district attorney’s office said it would stop prosecuting those who offered or agreed to engage in a sex act for payment. Buyers of sex, though, can still be charged with “patronising a prostitute in the third degree”.
The language sounds archaic because the law is. Whereas many rich countries have decriminalised the buying or selling of sex (or both), prostitution remains illegal across America, apart from in a few counties in Nevada. But the change in Manhattan—and similar moves in other New York boroughs and Baltimore—is part of a growing movement to reform the criminal-justice system’s treatment of such transactions. A handful of states have introduced bills that would partially or fully legalise them.

This reflects a growing belief that prosecuting prostitutes is cruel and counterproductive. Criminal records can make it hard to find housing and alternative employment. The mere threat of them can prevent some from seeking health care.
What is the best way to reform? There are two broad approaches: allowing the selling of sex but retaining penalties for buying it, in the hope this will lower demand (this is known as the Nordic model, after a law passed in Sweden in 1999); and decriminalising both sides of the transaction, in the hope that it will result in better working conditions.
In America, where polarisation on many social issues is growing, divisions between the proponents of these different approaches can be stark. This is especially apparent in New York, where two bills have been introduced in the state legislature. In September Kathy Hochul, the governor, said she was considering decriminalisation. She did not say whether she favoured the Stop Violence in the Sex Trades Act, a full decriminalisation bill, or the Sex Trade Survivors Justice and Equality Act, which would punish only buyers.
Proponents of full decriminalisation argue that bringing sex work into the light makes it easier for prostitutes to get access to health services and report violence to the police. They often cite the example of New Zealand, which fully decriminalised in 2003. Four years later a study found that most prostitutes still did not report violence, but a majority said police attitudes towards them had improved. Barbara Brents, a sociology professor at the University of Nevada, says that although the state’s tightly regulated brothels take a big slice of sex workers’ earnings, some women choose to work in them because they feel safer. (Even so, most prostitutes in Nevada work outside the legal brothels.)
Cecilia Gentili, a former sex worker and trans woman who helped found Decrim NY, which was involved in drawing up the Stop Violence bill, says she never considered telling police when she was forced to sell sex, for fear of being arrested. Sex work, she believes, should be regarded much like any other employment. Laws aimed at reducing demand are “patronising”, she says, promoting the idea that “women are not able to make decisions”.
Whether such activists speak for most sex workers is impossible to know, because there have been no large-scale surveys of sex workers in America. Yet strong anecdotal evidence suggests selling sex is different from other forms of manual labour in important ways. Drug addiction and homelessness often lead people into sex work and keep them in it. Many prostitutes have sold sex since they were minors; other forms of employment are not connected with abuse in this way.
Nor are they typically connected with trafficking. Some people in organisations that work with prostitutes say the spectre of sex trafficking—defined by the federal government as a commercial sex act “induced by force, fraud, or coercion” or in which the seller is under 18—is a distraction from other problems. Reliable data are hard to come by, so no one really knows how prevalent trafficking is. But it is almost certainly underreported.
Proponents of full decriminalisation say it would make it easier to prosecute traffickers. But champions of the Nordic model say breaking the law acts as a deterrent to some would-be buyers, so full decriminalisation boosts demand, creating opportunities for exploitation on the supply side. Since most women with alternatives choose not to sell sex, less fortunate ones fill the gap. Some will be trafficked.
The New Zealand study found that the number of sex workers there had not increased after decriminalisation. But an analysis of data from 150 countries in 2013 found that legalising prostitution led to its expansion and increased trafficking. Alexi Meyers, a former assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, says prosecutions against sex-work “promoters” can lead to the prosecution of traffickers; full decriminalisation could prevent that happening.
Nordic or nothing?
In states that are mulling decriminalisation, decisions are likely to come down to practical factors such as this. Another consideration is how changes in one state will play out in a country where sex work mostly remains illegal (and in conservative states any reform is a distant prospect). If New York became the first to fully decriminalise, it could well attract sex tourists in large numbers.
In June, when Maine’s governor vetoed a bill decriminalising sex work, she expressed concerns about becoming the first state to do so (she also worried, she said, that it would push up demand). Though the rejected legislation was for the Nordic-style approach, this may emerge as the most palatable and practical way for America to begin to reform its sex-work laws. ■",2
1633,"AS TRENDSETTERS GO, Luo Fuxing was an implausible one. A school drop-out, Mr Luo spent his days catching fish and herding goats in a village in southern Guangdong province. Eating pork was a once-weekly treat. At the age of 14, he left home to earn a wage in the province’s sweatshops. He hated the tedium of the work. He read that American criminals had tattoos of spiders’ webs inked onto their elbows to show time spent behind bars. Mr Luo got one too, because “the factory was just a bigger prison.”
He quit for a job in a hair salon. Inspired by Japanese manga and punk fashion, he dyed his hair and styled it into dramatic, gravity-defying spikes. Dark lipstick and eyeliner completed the look. He posted selfies to QQ, a messaging service—and soon hundreds of thousands of factory-town youth were copying his style. Mr Luo called its adopters the shamate, from a Chinese rendering of “smart”. It was “a wild-growing art form among workers”, he says. The trend, which peaked around a decade ago, helped newly arrived migrants from the countryside to bond. They met in parks, roller-skating rinks and online groups, where they shared not just sartorial cues but gripes about migrant life, from low pay and poor conditions to divorcing parents.

China has developed a distinct working-class culture in recent years, of which shamate fashion is only the most garish example. In mainstream media assembly-line workers are commonly shown in serried ranks and drab uniforms, with no hint as to how they spend their time outside factory walls. The stereotype is that workers who migrate to boomtowns and big cities—as 300m have done over the past four decades—are there only to earn a living. They are still commonly referred to as “migrant workers”, on the assumption that they are outsiders who will return to their rural hometowns. Many once did. But today’s working-class youth have no interest in going back to the land; many have lived in the city from a young age. They want to put down roots. Although marginalised in mass culture, workers are expressing themselves, in forms as varied as poetry and short videos shared online.
The government tends to portray migrant workers as patriotic and self-sacrificing. A museum dedicated to them in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, lauds their contribution to China’s economic ascent. Exhibits extol the Communist Party’s efforts to improve workers’ livelihoods and applaud their diligence. A sign at the entry reads: “Guangdong lets migrant workers create proud glories and legends again and again!” The hardship of factory work is glossed over, as are common injustices such as withheld wages.
Elsewhere, workers are often treated as country bumpkins. A “migrant-workers” version of the annual Spring Festival Gala, a big television show broadcast on the eve of the lunar new year, airs on a channel about agricultural news. Workers who began to stage their own unofficial gala some years ago were condescendingly described by state news outlets as offering “a little song, a little dance and a lot of passion”.
Small wonder that a coruscating memoir by Fan Yusu, a domestic worker living in Beijing, was a national sensation when it was published online in 2017. Ms Fan is now the editor-in-chief of New Workers’ Literature, an unofficial bimonthly journal of working-class writing, launched in 2019. One genre winning admiration from the literati is called dagong shige or “labour poetry”. Its most famous practitioner was Xu Lizhi, who worked on an assembly line for Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm that makes most of Apple’s iPhones. Before he committed suicide in 2014, at the age of 24, he had written almost 200 poems about the drudgery of factory work. Among the best known is “I Swallowed An Iron Moon”:
I swallowed an iron moon 
they called it a screw 
I swallowed industrial wastewater and unemployment forms 
bent over machines, our youth died young 
I swallowed labour, I swallowed poverty 
swallowed pedestrian bridges, swallowed this rusted-out life 
I can’t swallow any more 
everything I’ve swallowed roils up in my throat 
I spread across my country 
a poem of shame

Many workers’ poems refer to homesickness, alienation, injuries and powerlessness. A few deliberately evoke beauty, in jarring contrast to their bleak surroundings. In “Sundress”, Wu Xia—a rare female worker-poet, hired by a textile factory at the age of 14—writes of her love for the “unknown girl” with the means to buy the garment she sews. She also thus lays bare the elusive promise of social mobility that drives so many to the assembly line: Ms Wu, now 40 and a published poet, still works at a clothing factory.
The packing area is flooded with light 
the iron I’m holding 
collects all the warmth of my hands 
I want to press the straps flat 
so they won’t dig into your shoulders when you wear it 
and then press up from the waist 
a lovely waist 
where someone can lay a fine hand 
and on the tree-shaded lane 
caress a quiet kind of love...

Some literature is defiant, including towards government policies that make it extremely hard for factory-workers born in rural areas to make use of schools and hospitals in the cities. In “Who Can Forbid My Love”, Ms Wu writes of her adoptive city of Shenzhen: “This kind of love seeps into the pores, skin, cells, blood, bone / Even though there’s no residence permit with my name on it.” Chen Nianxi, a worker in a private mine, speaks of fellow miners who, employed by state-run firms, toil less yet earn more while he must blast “the rocks layer by layer / to put my life back together”. (English translations of these and other poems were published in 2016 in “Iron Moon”, an anthology of labour poetry.)
Such writing is tolerated by the government partly because journals like New Workers’ Literature are written for limited circulation and may not be sold in bookshops. Many poets publish online where, to avoid censorship, they steer clear of “unfiltered representations of the horrors” inside unregistered workshops known as “black factories”, notes Maghiel van Crevel of Leiden University. Some poems are proud or patriotic; many of those who write are motivated by a desire to earn respect. In the visitors’ book at the museum in Guangzhou, a visiting labourer has written: “Migrant workers, working souls, we’re the finest of them all.”
Yet workers’ writing is not fundamentally about political resistance, says Mr van Crevel, who studies labour poetry. Few blue-collar youths today feel they belong to a cohesive working class. That is partly because officials and state media avoid using the word “class”, or jieji, owing to its antagonistic overtones. (“Social stratum”, or jieceng, is preferred.) Many young workers call themselves dagong ren, a word for labourer that connotes temporary and low-status work. Its most extreme display is a subculture in Shenzhen whose members style themselves “Sanhe gods”. These young migrant workers hang around the city’s Sanhe job market to find day work, often as builders or delivery drivers. They reject the grind of the factory; their slogan is: “Work for a day, party for three.” Some even sell their national-identity cards.
Becoming a shamate was also a form of rebellion against the monotony of factory life. In a Chinese documentary released in 2019, “We Were Smart”, 70 former and current shamate shared their views on what it meant to be one. Their exuberant hairstyles turned heads. “People paid attention. It wasn’t positive attention. But they saw you. And the point was to be seen,” says one interviewee. Many felt they were part of a select group, and that cutting their hair would have meant going back to being “just another unknown line worker”. For some, the punk identity became more important than earning a better wage at a big factory, where they would have been forced to cut their hair. For men and women alike, it was a way of seeming tougher in a disorienting new city where many were cheated: “We felt we weren’t safe out there. That we were too honest, and were afraid of being messed with.” The hair, tattoos and clan mentality all helped.

As the fashion spread, its adherents began to be ridiculed by prim, middle-class netizens. A sustained online attack against shamate around 2010 led thousands to lop off their hair and drop out of the group. Police began to round up anyone with the telltale style, to check their papers; anyone without a temporary residence permit would be detained.
Shamate fans still congregate in parts of Guangdong. But the fashion has lost its edge as factory youth have found a new way to express themselves: video-sharing apps. Lorry drivers, construction workers and farmers have built followings and sometimes found stardom—not despite being blue-collar workers, but because of it. In manufacturing hubs, where phones are often banned inside factories, assembly-line workers document their lives outside them. Widely used hashtags include #FactoryLife and #LiftTheBucket. The last refers, often ironically, to quitting a job in search of a better one, with nothing but a bucket of belongings.
Through the videos, workers cheer each other on. They trade information: which factory has higher wages or fairer bosses, say. That is especially useful in a “hostile environment where there is no trade union to tell them about working benefits”, says Aidan Chau of China Labour Bulletin, an NGO in Hong Kong. Some speak of injuries or sexual harassment. Others parody the trendy life of urban middle-class youth. “Their aspiration to live in a city and become an urban citizen grows, even as they realise it is implausible—even impossible,” says Mr Chau.
Whether expressed in poems or through video-sharing apps, a sense of disillusionment seems to be growing. There was once pride in being a worker, says Mr Luo. “Now it’s embarrassing to say you’re one.” Young people working in factories see short videos as an escape: a way to kill time, but also to be part of a wider world beyond their gritty boomtowns. Yet even online, they struggle to gain acceptance. Zhang Yurong is among a handful who have built a wide following by recording life as a worker at Foxconn. Some comments on her videos say factory workers are “people abandoned by society”. That angered her, she says, not because it was wrong but because it was right.
A fellow worker-poet and friend of Xu wrote in tribute after his death: “Another screw comes loose / Another migrant-worker brother jumps / You die in place of me / And I keep writing in place of you.” ■",2
1634,"NASA and the U.S. government are looking for proposals on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon with the goal of having energy on the moon that's not reliant on the sun by the end of the decade.
NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory formally put out a request for proposals from the public on Friday for a fission surface power system. 
In a collaboration between NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab, the two agencies are specifically looking to establish a source of power that does not rely on the sun or solar power for missions on the moon.
'Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,' Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. 
Should the lunar nuclear reactors be a success in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next stop would be Mars, according to the world's leading space agency.
NASA states that such fission surface power could likely provide long-term power for human lunar colonies, regardless of environmental conditions. 
'I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,' Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement.  
The reactor itself would be built on earth before being sent to the moon.
For those who wish to send a proposal, NASA says submitted plans for the fission surface power system will need to include a uranium-fueled reactor core, a thermal management system to keep the reactor at the proper temperature, a system to convert the nuclear power into usable energy, and a distribution system that provides no less than 40 kilowatts of electric power. 
Said power system proposals will need to supply continuous power for 10 years in the lunar environment.
The reactor must also be capable of turning itself on and off without human oversight, that it can operate from a lunar lander deck, and that it is mobile enough to be transported from the lander to a different lunar site for operation if necessary. 
Successful proposals for the reactor must weigh no more than 13,200 pounds, and be able to fit inside a 12-foot diameter cylinder that's 18 feet long when launched from earth to the moon. 
The deadline for proposal requests for an initial system design must be submitted by February 19, the outlet reports.  
This is not the first collaborative project between NASA and the Idaho National Laboratory, with the lab most recently helping build a radioisotope power system for the space agency's Mar's rover Perseverance, which converts heat that's generated from the decay or plutonium-238 into electrical power.
The rover landed on the Martian surface back in February and has remained active on the red planet ever since.  
The Energy Department has also recently been looking for private businesses to collaborate with on various nuclear power plans, most notably a new generation of smaller power plants ranging from small modular rectors to small mobile reactors that can quickly be set up in the field and be removed when no longer needed. ",-2
1635,"WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. delegation will meet with senior Taliban representatives in Doha on Saturday and Sunday in their first face-to-face meeting at a senior level since Washington pulled its troops from Afghanistan and the hardline group took over the country, two senior administration officials told Reuters.
The high-level U.S. delegation will include officials from the State Department, USAID and the U.S. intelligence community, will press the Taliban to ensure continued safe passage for U.S. citizens and others out of Afghanistan and to release kidnapped U.S. citizen Mark Frerichs, the officials said.
Another top priority will be to hold the Taliban to its commitment that it will not allow Afghanistan to again become a hotbed for al Qaeda or other extremists while pressing the group to improve access for humanitarian aid as the country faces the prospect of a ""really severe and probably impossible to prevent"" economic contraction, U.S. officials said.
U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, who has for years spearheaded U.S. dialogue with the Taliban and been a key figure in peace talks with the group, will not be part of the delegation.
The U.S. team will include the State Department's Deputy Special Representative Tom West as well as top USAID humanitarian official Sarah Charles. On The Taliban side, cabinet officials will be attending, officials said.
""This meeting is a continuation of the pragmatic engagements with the Taliban that we've had ongoing on matters of vital national interest,"" said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
""This meeting is not about granting recognition or conferring legitimacy. We remain clear that any legitimacy must be earned through the Taliban's own actions. They need to establish a sustained track record,"" the official said.
The United States' two decades-long occupation of Afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift in August which saw more than 124,000 civilians including Americans, Afghans and others being evacuated as the Taliban took over. But thousands of other U.S.-allied Afghans at risk of Taliban persecution were left behind.
Washington and other Western countries are grappling with difficult choices as a severe humanitarian crisis looms large over Afghanistan. They are trying to formulate how to engage with the Taliban without granting it the legitimacy it seeks while ensuring humanitarian aid flows into the country.
Many Afghans have started selling their possessions to pay for ever-scarcer food.
The departure of U.S.-led forces and many international donors robbed the country of grants that financed 75% of public spending, according to the World Bank.
While there was an improvement for humanitarian actors get access to some areas that they haven't been in a decade, problems still persisted, the U.S. official said, adding that the U.S. delegation would press Taliban to improve.
""Right now, we are facing some real access issues....There are a lot of challenges in ensuring that female aid workers are provided unimpeded access to all areas,"" the official said and added that Washington needed to see an improvement by the Taliban on this front ""if we are to contemplate even more robust humanitarian assistance.""
PRESSURE ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS
While the Taliban has promised to be more inclusive than when it led the country from 1996 to 2001, the United States has repeatedly said it will judge the new Taliban government based on its deeds not its words.
The Taliban drew from its inner high echelons to fill top posts in Afghanistan's new provisional government announced last month, including an associate of the Islamist militant group's founder as premier and a wanted man on a U.S. terrorism list as interior minister. There were no outsiders and no women in the cabinet.
The European Union foreign policy chief said on Sunday its behavior up to now was ""not very encouraging.""
""We will certainly press the Taliban to respect the rights of all Afghans including women and girls and to form an inclusive government with broad support,"" the U.S. official said.
He added that there were discrepancies between the Taliban's promises of continued safe passage and implementation.
""As a practical matter, their implementation of their commitments have been uneven. It is true that sometimes we receive assurances from certain levels but then follow through on those assurances has truly been uneven,"" the official said.
The United States has directly facilitated the departure of 105 U.S. citizens and 95 lawful permanent residents out of Afghanistan since Aug. 31, when U.S. withdrawal was completed, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday.
He declined to provide a precise figure for those remaining, but said the agency was in contact with ""dozens of Americans in Afghanistan who wish to leave"" but that the number was dynamic and constantly changing.",3
1636,"A FEW MONTHS ago Kim Beom-su looked like the face of responsible capitalism in South Korea. In March the billionaire founder of Kakao, which runs the country’s most successful messaging app and a slew of other digital services, promised to give away half his wealth for charitable causes, the second Korean tycoon to make that pledge. Now he is making headlines for some less salubrious reasons. Antitrust officials have reportedly set their sights on his private holding company for allegedly failing to report properly on its shareholders and affiliates.
The apparent move against Kakao’s founder is the latest salvo in an ongoing battle. Like their counterparts in America and China, South Korea’s technology giants have come under scrutiny. Officials worry that as firms such as Naver, which began life as a search engine, and Kakao have expanded into anything from ride-hailing to personal finance, they have picked up the bad habits of the chaebol. These sprawling conglomerates were instrumental in making South Korea rich and continue to dominate its economy. But they are notorious for murky governance structures, oligopolistic business practices and close ties with the political elite.

Over the past few weeks politicians have ramped up the rhetoric. “Kakao has turned from a symbol of growth and innovation into a symbol of old greed,” Song Young-gil, a leader of the ruling Minjoo party, told the National Assembly this month. “We will find a way to stop its rapid expansion and help it coexist with small-business owners,” he warned.
The same day regulators ruled that some financial services offered by Kakao and Naver violated consumer-protection laws because the platforms were not registered as intermediaries. The two companies will now be required to abide by brokerage regulations. Spooked investors dumped Kakao and Naver shares, shaving a tenth, or $11bn, off their combined stockmarket value.
Korean trustbusters, for their part, are investigating allegations that Kakao’s taxi-hailing service favours its own pricier cabs. They want e-commerce platforms to draw up proper contracts with third-party sellers, and specify what commissions they earn. In August Coupang, the country’s biggest e-commerce firm, was fined 3.3bn won ($2.8m) for pressing suppliers to lower prices. South Korea’s largely unregulated crypto-exchanges will have to register as legal trading platforms.
The techlash is not limited to domestic tech darlings. On September 14th regulators fined Google $177m for not allowing versions of its Android operating system to be installed on locally made smartphones. And last month South Korea became the first country to oblige Apple and Google to accept alternative payments systems in their app stores.
App developers like Epic Games, which suffered a courtroom defeat against Apple in America on September 10th, welcomed the move. The maker of “Fortnite” invoked the South Korean law to try to get its app reinstated on Apple’s app store, from which it had been booted for breaching rules that barred such in-app payments. Apple has refused.
Lim Jung-wook, a venture capitalist, applauds the government’s instincts to protect consumers and small suppliers. But he reckons stricter rules will do little to curb the tech companies’ power in the long run. “These firms’ services are too convenient for them not to keep growing.”
Nonetheless, faced with sinking stock prices, the Korean firms have begun to respond. On September 14th Kakao announced a new 300bn-won fund to help small suppliers and promised to scrap new services such as flower delivery that compete with mom-and-pop businesses. Mr Kim promised that the company would “throw away” its old growth model and replace it with one that fostered “social responsibility”.
Coupang has chosen a more combative approach. It insists that its platform has made it easier for small firms to get their products to consumers. And it is appealing against the antitrust fine, claiming that the penalty serves to protect chaebol such as LG, which brought the complaint. ■

1637,"IF YOU ARE going to run a gambling operation, it helps to have luck on your side. Months after Peter Jackson was appointed boss of Flutter Entertainment in 2018, America’s Supreme Court overturned a federal law outlawing most sports betting. For a firm running established bookmakers such as Betfair and Paddy Power, that opened the door to a wagering El Dorado. Two years later Flutter’s $12bn splurge on PokerStars, an online-tournament franchise, looked dear—until a pandemic left millions at home in possession of stimulus cheques and lots of spare time. If the house always wins, Mr Jackson comes a close second.
Betting used to be the preserve of mob bosses and back-alley card sharps. Now it is an increasingly regulated $500bn business where ever more bets are placed on mobile phones. Executives at firms like Flutter use workaday metrics—conversion rates, cost of customer acquisition, employee engagement—familiar to managers at Amazon or McDonald’s. True, a certain brand of investor still treats gambling as irredeemably “sinful”, to be lumped in the same bucket as purveyors of booze, cigarettes and missiles. That hasn’t stopped Flutter, the largest global gaming company, from securing a berth in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index in London, backed by a market capitalisation of £25bn ($35bn). That lofty figure depends on Mr Jackson’s winning streak continuing.

It may well do. Online gambling is a rare global industry that has been dominated by European firms. Governments in Europe have usually preferred to regulate and tax what they presume would be happening anyway. Operators of bricks-and-mortar betting shops fused into groups that could better afford the investments needed to develop websites and apps. Aside from Flutter, which merged Paddy Power, Betfair and others into an Irish holding company, there is Entain, a FTSE rival, which rolled up Ladbrokes, Coral and Bwin, originally from Austria. As online casinos and poker took off, further acquisitions were made to cross-sell roulette spins to football punters.
In America the legal betting that existed before 2018 was limited and local. Most of it involved casinos and resorts; sports betting was all but banned outside Nevada. This meant that as states liberalised offering wagers on sports—as nearly half of them have now done—most of these potential American rivals lacked the expertise to calculate and serve up online the shifting odds on which New York Yankee will hit the next home run. This is precisely the sort of thing European bookies have been doing for years.
To take advantage of this “massive land grab” for sports betting, Mr Jackson did what any good gambler does: he took a calculated risk. He prepared to enter the American market before the Supreme Court decision. Within weeks of the rule change Flutter pounced on FanDuel, a “fantasy league” website where armchair quarterbacks speculated (mostly for glory, not cash) on outcomes of sporting contests. Snapping it up before rivals realised its value gave Flutter a database of loudmouths who proved keen to put money behind their bluster as soon as states started allowing it.
Forecasts of American gambling revenues are now rising as fast as Schumpeter’s losses on poker night. By 2025 analysts predict that bookmakers serving American sports fans could pocket $10bn-15bn a year in gross gaming revenue, the money they earn after paying out successful wagers. Though covid-19 briefly interrupted most sports, it nudged more potential players to online leisure, which included bingo as well as Netflix. Cash-strapped American states desperate for tax dollars to finance pandemic relief and other goals began to legalise betting on sports faster than expected. A few permitted online poker and casino games, which had also been illegal in most places. That might bring in another $5bn a year to the best brands.
Hence the land grab. Flutter argues that gaming enjoys the same network effects as other digital markets such as social media or ride-hailing. Bettors want to punt where others are betting. Early entrants can spread the cost of brands and technology across more users, further raising barriers to entry. American sports betting may indeed be a winner-takes-most market. The share of the big three operators (FanDuel; BetMGM, part-owned by Entain; and DraftKings, another “fantasy” site turned bookie) has gone from less than a third in 2018 to three-quarters now. FanDuel itself controls nearly half the market. Unmoved by heavy losses as it splurges on luring new customers, analysts value the operation at $18bn.
Ante climax
For the bet to keep paying out, Mr Jackson will have to avoid a few dud numbers. The exuberance in America contrasts with a tougher outlook elsewhere. British regulators are expected to introduce new restrictions to curb problem gambling. Germany has imposed new rules that will crimp operators’ profits. That should give pause to those who think American law is predestined for further relaxation: what the regulator giveth the regulator can take away. Few doubt that money will be made in American sports betting, so new competitors are bound to emerge seeking a share of the pot. American sports leagues are all-powerful, and have already sought a levy on wagers. Broadcasters have lots of leverage; Flutter is engaged in a legal tussle with Fox, Rupert Murdoch’s empire, which used to own a slice of PokerStars’ parent company and has an option to buy nearly a fifth of FanDuel.
The risk for Flutter is that too much of a good thing ends up generating a backlash. The company has spent $291 to acquire each American customer, mostly on ads and subsidised first bets. If Flutter is to turn a profit, punters must lose at least that much on average. For that to happen, they may need to wager a few thousand dollars. Flutter, like all other listed gaming firms, emphasises it is in the market of providing a bit of light entertainment, not minting gambling addicts. If the bookies are too successful, that argument may begin to sound even more hollow. ■

1638,"SOME NEW inmates in Hong Kong’s prisons have reading wishlists that reflect interests beyond such common behind-bars topics as self-improvement and how to exercise in small spaces. Their requests include dystopian novels about totalitarianism, such as George Orwell’s “1984” and “Brave New World” by Aldous Huxley, or books about struggles against authoritarian rule, including Vaclav Havel’s “The Power of the Powerless” and “How To Feed A Dictator” by Witold Szablowski.
Such bookworms belong to a new breed of prisoner: the dissident. Before the pro-democracy demonstrations that roiled Hong Kong for much of 2019, few people were incarcerated for taking part in political protests. But the authorities have got tougher. More than 10,000 people have been arrested in connection with the unrest. Court proceedings have begun against a quarter of them. The government is building a megacourt to process a backlog of cases, including some involving a national-security law that was imposed in Hong Kong last year. Hundreds of people are now serving prison sentences or being held on remand for alleged offences related to the protests. Many Hong Kongers know someone in jail who has been accused of such crimes.

Conditions are better than in the mainland’s jails, where political prisoners are allowed little, if any, contact with the outside world and are often treated brutally. In Hong Kong, volunteers collect books and organise letter-writing campaigns for detainees. Online guides provide advice to correspondents about what not to write: avoid slogans from the protests and any references to violence or sexually explicit material. Instead, write about trivial news, tell jokes, describe movie plots and draw sketches, suggests one manual. A bookseller recently ran an eight-part workshop. Participants wrote letters to inmates and read prison literature by Nelson Mandela, Havel and activists from Hong Kong. Joshua Wong (pictured, entering prison), one of the best-known faces of the pro-democracy movement, has written that he is grateful for “every word and every sentence” mailed to him.
Sympathy for political detainees is widespread in Hong Kong. During a heatwave in May, a petition for the provision of cold water and more showers to those incarcerated garnered over 140,000 signatures. A cottage industry has emerged to help them in other ways. Some Hong Kongers transcribe popular YouTube videos for inmates, who cannot access the internet. Other pen-pals copy and paste posts from LIHKG, an online forum that attracts democracy enthusiasts, in order to create a physical newspaper for inmates. “As an avid user of LIHKG, these forum-post printouts are my Bible,” says a detainee quoted by a prisoner-rights group.
Well-known pro-democracy inmates pass the time by exercising, writing letters, helping fellow inmates with their appeals and publishing articles in local newspapers. Chow Hang Tung, a jailed barrister and human-rights activist, accepted her boyfriend’s proposal of marriage, which was sent to her by letter. It was later published in Ming Pao, one of Hong Kong’s leading newspapers. These young Hong Kongers are “learning to seek freedom in an environment where they have lost their freedom”, writes Chan Kin-man, an academic who served 16 months in jail for his role in the Umbrella Movement of 2014.
Imprisoned activists are scattered throughout the city’s jails to prevent them from communicating with each other. But officials still worry about their influence. In September an elite squad was used to quell a protest by 18 prisoners angered at the treatment of other inmates, including Tiffany Yuen, a district councillor who is on remand under the national-security law. They had been accused of acquiring a prohibited number of chocolates and hair clips. Bizarrely, officials feared they might give them to other inmates to win support for Ms Yuen. “This is how groups begin, like terrorist groups recruiting followers,” said Woo Ying-ming, the head of Hong Kong’s prisons. Even behind bars, officials keep Ms Yuen’s type under close watch. ■",2
1639,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3
1640,"HYDROGEN HAS been controversial ever since the tragedy of the Hindenburg, an airship filled with it that went down in flames in 1937. Boosters say that the gas is a low-carbon miracle which can power cars and homes. The hydrogen economy, they hope, will redraw the energy map. Sceptics note that several hydrogen investment drives since the 1970s have ended in tears as the gas’s shortcomings were exposed. As we explain, the reality lies in between. Hydrogen technologies could eliminate perhaps a tenth of today’s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. That is a sliver—but, considering the scale of the energy transition, a crucial and lucrative one.
Hydrogen is not a primary source of energy like oil or coal. It is best thought of as an energy carrier, akin to electricity, and as a means of storage, like a battery. It has to be manufactured. Low-carbon energy sources such as renewables and nuclear power can be used to separate water (H2O) into its constituents of oxygen and hydrogen. This is inefficient and expensive, but costs are falling. Hydrogen can also be made from dirty fossil fuels but this emits a lot of pollution unless it is coupled with technologies that capture carbon and sequester it. Hydrogen is flammable and bulky compared with many fuels. The implacable laws of thermodynamics mean that converting primary energy into hydrogen and then hydrogen into usable power leads to waste.

All this explains the gas’s tricky history. The oil shocks of the 1970s led to research into hydrogen technologies but they never went far. In the 1980s the Soviet Union even flew a hydrogen-powered passenger jet—the maiden flight lasted just 21 minutes.
Today climate change is causing another wave of enthusiasm. More than 350 big projects are under way and cumulative investment could reach $500bn by 2030. Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons that annual sales of hydrogen could be worth $600bn by 2050. That is up from $150bn of sales today, which come mainly from industrial processes, including making fertilisers. India will soon stage auctions for hydrogen and Chile is holding tenders for its production on public lands. Over a dozen countries including Britain, France, Germany, Japan and South Korea have national hydrogen plans.

Amid the excitement, it is worth being clear about what hydrogen can and cannot do. Japanese and South Korean firms are keen to sell cars using hydrogen fuel cells, but battery cars are roughly twice as energy efficient. Some European countries hope to pipe hydrogen into homes, but heat pumps are more effective and some pipes cannot handle the gas safely. Some big energy firms and petrostates want to use natural gas to make hydrogen without capturing the associated carbon effectively, but that does not eliminate emissions.

Instead, hydrogen can help in niche markets, involving complex chemical processes and high temperatures that are hard to achieve with electricity. Steel firms, spewing roughly 8% of global emissions, rely on coking coal and blast furnaces that wind power cannot replace but which hydrogen can, using a process known as direct reduction. Hybrit, a Swedish consortium, sold the world’s first green steel made this way in August.
Another niche is commercial transport, particularly for journeys beyond the scope of batteries. Hydrogen lorries can beat battery-powered rivals with faster refuelling, more room for cargo and a longer range. Cummins, an American company, is betting on them. Fuels derived from hydrogen may also be useful in aviation and shipping. Alstom, a French firm, is running hydrogen-powered locomotives on European tracks.
Last, hydrogen can be used as a material to store and transport energy in bulk. Renewable grids struggle when the wind dies or it is dark. Batteries can help, but if renewable power is converted to hydrogen, it can be stored cheaply for long periods and converted to electricity on demand. A power plant in Utah plans to store the gas in caverns to supply California. Sunny and windy places that lack transmission links can export clean energy as hydrogen. Australia, Chile and Morocco hope to “ship sunshine” to the world.
With so much money piling into hydrogen the list of uses for it may expand. Much of the work is up to the private sector but governments can do their bit. One task is to crack down on greenwashing: hydrogen made from dirty fuels without high-quality carbon capture will not help the climate. New rules are needed to measure and disclose the life-cycle emissions arising from producing hydrogen and, given that it will be traded across borders, these need international agreement.
Rainmakers move in
Government should also encourage hubs where different hydrogen users cluster, minimising the need to duplicate infrastructure. These are already emerging in Humberside in Britain and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Hydrogen has its limitations, but it can play a vital role in bringing about cleaner energy. ■

1641,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. To see them visit our hub
IN 1969 JULIUS LESTER published a book about the black-power movement called, “Look Out, Whitey! Black Power’s Gon’ Get Your Mama!” Since then, approaches to managing friction between different racial groups have become less confrontational and more professional. For many American institutions this takes the form of diversity training.
Like most city forces, the Minneapolis police department puts its officers through diversity training. Tanya Gladney, an ex-cop who has trained officers in nearby St Paul, says such training became standard in police departments 15 or 20 years ago. It has not stopped forces from shooting unarmed citizens, a disproportionate share of them black men. The curriculum has been tweaked and extended to incorporate the latest research into “unconscious bias”. Since then, in Minneapolis alone, Jamar Clark was shot dead by a white officer while pinned on the pavement in 2015; Philando Castile was shot dead by a Latino officer while inside his own car in 2016; and Justine Damond, an Australian woman who called the police about a possible assault, was shot dead by the Somali-American officer who arrived to investigate in 2017.

Diversity training for police officers has been updated again. The latest curriculum was developed in New Orleans, home to a police department that became notorious after Hurricane Katrina for its violence. The training, which is called EPIC (Ethical Policing is Courageous), emphasises the responsibility of officers who stand by while colleagues use excessive force. What started in New Orleans has been rolled out across the country with the help of Georgetown University, under the brand name ABLE (Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement). Focusing on a violent cop’s silent buddies, says Ms Gladney, aims to change “what we mean by a bad apple”. Perhaps it will work. Yet in constantly tweaking their diversity training in the hope of finding something that does, police departments struggle with a higher-stakes version of a problem confronting many American institutions.

When an organisation faces internal claims of racism, or decides to change hiring or promotion in response to external prods, the impulse is strong to show that this is a priority. Over the past year, many more bodies have offered or mandated training, backed up with reinforcement sessions. Lots have hired chief diversity officers. Russell Reynolds, a headhunter, estimated before George Floyd’s death that half of Fortune 500 companies had such a post, and says demand has since leapt. But average tenure in such positions is short, at about three years. And the people who take on these jobs often feel that they are being asked to do something impossible.
That sense of impotence is reflected in academic studies. Frank Dobbin, of Harvard, and Alexandra Kalev, of Tel Aviv University, who reviewed studies of the effectiveness of diversity training, found that by making staff think more about racial attitudes, companies may actually reinforce negative stereotypes. Diversity training can also be divisive. White employees respond better to messages that are race-neutral, something Martin Luther King understood when he talked about judging people “not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character”. For many non-whites, that approach is off-putting and suggests a desire to skirt around the problem, which is why, despite its masterly inoffensiveness, this King quote has often been controversial.
It is a fair bet that in 2021 most Americans do not wish to indulge in racist stereotyping. There are powerful internal motives (people like to believe they are acting justly) and external ones (negative consequences for careers) to avoid doing so. And yet it happens all the time. Jennifer Eberhardt, a black social psychologist at Stanford, tells of boarding a plane with her (black) son when he was five. On spotting the only black adult male on the aircraft, Ms Eberhardt’s son said “that man looks like Daddy!” And then he added, “I hope he doesn’t rob the plane!” As Ms Eberhardt talked to her son about negative stereotypes, her academic work on bias and her unpaid labour as a parent briefly merged.
So-called unconscious bias may show up in people who think they are committed opponents of racism. It is controversial because some see it as an excuse (it was my unconscious that did it, not myself) while others see it as a sin that must be confessed before redemption is possible. Yet an awareness of implicit bias is useful in helping people to reflect about how they think, even if training them to be aware of it does not eliminate racism, whether in police departments or in Wall Street banks.
Conscious unconscious
Some evidence comes from policing. In the shooter test, subjects are shown images of people in a short space of time. Some are armed and some not. Some are black and some not. The person taking the test has to judge in a split-second whether the use of force would be justified. Katherine Spencer, Amanda Charbonneau and Jack Glaser, of the University of California, Berkeley, summarise their findings. “People do not want to shoot unarmed suspects at all, let alone in a racially discriminatory way, and most would be particularly motivated to avoid exhibiting this kind of discrimination. Nevertheless, most do.”
A cocktail of ancestral bias, media stories and a hangover after the crime wave from the 1960s to the 1990s, all mixed in unknown proportions, may account for this. But bias is malleable, meaning it can be reduced. Ms Eberhardt’s research suggests that slowing people down, giving them time to think what they are doing, can help. That fits with the shooter-test finding that people are more likely to exhibit stronger shooter bias if they have first been set a hard set of anagrams to solve and so are tired of thinking. Ms Eberhardt has worked with Nextdoor.com, a social network that had an epidemic of users reporting sightings of suspicious-looking black men, who on closer inspection turned out to be just black men. Getting users to slow down and be more specific about what they saw reduced the problem. She has also worked with Oakland’s police department, which found that when officers first had to explain why they were stopping people in the street, they stopped far fewer black men.
Mr Dobbin and Ms Kalev have recommendations for what works instead. It includes recruitment programmes to identify talented women and minorities, mentoring programmes, diversity task-forces and anything that puts “existing higher-ups in touch with people from different race/ethnic/gender groups who hope to move up”. Such initiatives nominally help minorities. But their real beneficiaries may be managers. Someone whose closest encounters with black males involve watching American football on TV may have different mental shortcuts to someone whose African-American colleague helps him untangle his budget.
When those suspicious of each other are brought together, hostile feelings can fade. That can lessen the sense of outrage at whatever divided them in the first place. But it may also dilute the impulse usually required to make further progress. Sociologists who study interactions between groups talk of “the paradox of harmony”. As a commitment to diversity has become core to capitalist America, activists and academics who work on race find that they too are struggling with the paradox of harmony.■

1642,"Despite his current travails, no one can take away from Prince Andrew his heroic role as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands war.
And I hear the Queen’s second son plans to use his military career as a way to return to public life.
Next year is the 40th anniversary of the conflict in the South Atlantic, which claimed 255 British military lives, and the Duke of York will attend commemorative events in the summer.
‘The Duke is determined to take part in the Falklands commemorations,’ a source tells me. ‘The Falklands was a key moment in his life and he wants to honour his fallen comrades. He hopes this could help pave the way for a return to public life.’
Today is the second anniversary of Andrew’s withdrawal from royal duties, after the overwhelmingly negative reaction to his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis about his ill-advised friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke on three occasions when she was 17.
However, earlier this month, a U.S. judge set a date in January for Andrew’s bid to have his accuser’s allegations thrown out.
He has repeatedly and vehemently denied the claims.
My source tells me: ‘The Duke expects that the court action in New York will have been dealt with long before the Falklands events.’
A spokesman for one of the organisations Andrew is still involved with, the Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel Trust, tells me he will be welcome to attend. ‘We have a big commemorative service on June 12. It’s all about those who were lost, the veterans no matter who they were, those who were lucky enough to come home.’
A royal source is keen to make clear that Andrew would be attending events as a veteran, saying: ‘No invitation has been received for the Duke to attend events in an official capacity.’ Andrew’s spokesman declines to comment.
Has Kate given her catwalk career the boot?
She's had one of the most successful careers in fashion, spanning three decades, but could Kate Moss finally be strutting away from the runway for good?
I ask because this week, the 47- year-old supermodel closed down the long-standing business through which she’s channelled her catwalk earnings, Skate.
Newly filed documents reveal that the company, which she set up in 2008, has officially ceased trading.
At one point it had about £5million in assets. Her spokesman declines to comment but friends say she’s now focusing on the business she established in 2016 to manage the careers of fellow mannequins, the Kate Moss Agency.
‘I want people who can sing, dance and act,’ she explained at the time of the launch. ‘I want to create stars.’
The move comes after a removals lorry was spotted for two days in a row outside Moss’s house in North London, suggesting the reformed hedonist was quitting city life.
Moss also has a cottage in the Cotswolds, where she spent most of her time during the pandemic with daughter Lila, 19, and boyfriend Count Nikolai von Bismarck, 34. 
As the new boss of the landed gentry’s union, Mark Tufnell should be accustomed to sitting astride a horse as he hunts.
In a startling confession, Tufnell, who owns an estate in the Cotswolds, has, however, admitted he’s scared of all things equine.
And his fear prevented his becoming a vet.
‘I found I was terrified of horses — couldn’t go near them,’ the new president of the Country Landowners’ Association admits.
Let’s hope his members don’t gallop away...
Chelsea chocolate war set to end in sweet revenge for Chantal... 
Who knew that chocolate could leave such a bitter taste? Word reaches me of an unseemly feud in the genteel world of expensive treats.
At next week’s Chelsea Physic Garden Christmas fair, one stall will be manned by Chantal Coady, co-chair of the Academy of Chocolate, who will be officially launching her company, The Chocolate Detective.
Just across the lawn, West London’s well-heeled shoppers will find Rococo, the firm Coady founded and spent 37 years turning into a luxury brand adored by the Queen and Hollywood stars.
However, this stall will be operated by Rupert Morley, a Comic Relief trustee, now its sole owner.
Coady abruptly departed the company she loved so dearly in 2019. Morley invested in the company in 2017 when Rococo had five shops and had been valued at £10million.
To Coady’s dismay, she was gradually edged out of the business until it suddenly went into administration in 2019. Morley snapped up Rococo weeks later.
‘Losing Rococo has been utter hell for Chantal,’ a friend tells me. ‘She was wiped out financially and emotionally.
'It has been desperately sad, but she is fighting back and starting from scratch again.’
Morley declines to comment, but I hope this war can have a sweet ending.",-2
1643,"EVERY SPRING, the Qingming festival brings families together for displays of respect and sorrow at the burial sites of their deceased relatives. Some travel a long way to reunite over the three-day holiday, which ended on April 5th. Among them this year were the Zhaos of Leyun, a village in the lush Daba mountains of Sichuan province in the south-west. For migrant parents like them, there are living relationships that cause quiet grief, too. When their daughter, Lin, was just one month old the couple left her with her grandmother to allow them to return to their factory jobs on the coast. That was six years ago. Since then, Lin has spent only about 30 days with her parents. To her, this holiday’s get-together was with virtual strangers.
There are about 31m people in China like Lin—children who have been left behind in their home towns or villages, usually in the care of relatives, while both of their parents work elsewhere. The largest wave of internal migration in history—involving about 300m people who have moved to cities over the past four decades—has battered many other families, too. In 2015 Unicef, the UN agency for children, estimated that more than one in three children in China, or close to 100m, had experienced the prolonged absence of at least one parent. In nine out of ten cases, the main reason was migration.

Another important cause has been China’s rigid system of household registration, known as hukou. Someone without hukou in the city where he or she lives is frequently denied access to local government-funded services, such as health care and schooling. Migrants therefore often have little choice but to leave children behind in their registered place of residence. Across China, many lives are racked by the pain this causes. At first Lin pined for her parents, says the girl’s 57-year-old grandmother, a bean farmer. Then her pleas grew fainter, until one day they stopped. Now Lin refuses to speak to her parents when they ring home. She shrinks from their attempts to hug her during their rare, fleeting visits back to Leyun.
In recent years concern has grown in China about the plight of such children. State media have reported on their sufferings, including the torment of those abandoned with no one to look after them (in 2010 there were at least 2m without carers). About six years ago huge public debate was triggered by two such stories. One involved four siblings in the south who killed themselves with pesticide. They had been left behind with no guardian. The second was about another two left-behind siblings in the same region. They were murdered by two relatives who had been raping one of the children, a disabled 15-year-old girl.
In February 2016 the government responded to the outcry by publishing guidelines for the protection of left-behind children. These called for their numbers to be reduced “significantly” by 2020. They advised local authorities to monitor guardianship arrangements—it is illegal to let minors live alone. They also urged hospitals and schools to do a better job of reporting cases of suspected harm. In 2017 a new rule required village officials to register all left-behind children. Another, in May 2020, made failure to report neglect or abuse a possible crime. According to official figures, in 2018 local governments paired 76,000 unsupervised children with guardians, and helped the return to school of 160,000 left-behind children who had dropped out. Since 2017 the central government has kept a database of left-behind and vulnerable children, based on the records supplied by villages.
Officials have focused their attention on a subset of those affected. The guidelines in 2016 count as left-behind only those who are under 16 and have two parents working elsewhere. That year the government said there were just 9m children who could be classified as left-behind according to this definition. By 2018 the tally had fallen to under 7m. But children who have been separated from only one parent are often harmed, too. And it can matter which parent has left them. A Chinese study published in 2017 found that school drop-out rates were lower among rural children living with only a mother rather than only a father (rates were highest when both parents were away). In 2019 a paper in Frontiers in Psychology, a peer-reviewed journal, concluded that the presence of at least one parent at home, especially a mother, lessened the risk that a left-behind child would self-harm as a teen.

Rural parents often believe their presence is most vital when a child starts school. So they are more inclined to work elsewhere before their children reach that age, says Lu Shuang of the University of Hong Kong. More than a quarter of children in China under the age of two are cared for by people who are not their mothers, reports Unicef. The Chinese study of 2017 found that, as a proportion of all left-behind children, the number of under-fives had grown from 30% in 2000 to 40% in 2015. Many are never breastfed, depriving them of lifelong health benefits. That was so for Lin.
As they grow older, children face other traumas. Since 2015 surveys by On the Road to School, an NGO based in Beijing, have revealed consistently high levels of depression among left-behind children. In 2019 nine in ten of them said they had suffered from emotional abuse, and six in ten reported physical harm. Close to one in three had been sexually abused.
Such abuse often goes undetected. “The separation from parents means that children do not have the impulse to open up to them,” says Wan Miaoyan, a lawyer in Chengdu who has worked on cases related to such crime. She recalls one in which relatives discovered what had happened only when they came across a letter that the victim had written to herself. In it she described being raped by a teacher. A child therapist says current systems of support rely on people from the same village who may themselves be abusers, rather than on professional outsiders.
Those systems are thinly stretched. Provinces with high numbers of left-behind children—Sichuan, a populous one, tops the ranking—tend to be among the poorest, with scant resources to devote to the task of protecting the vulnerable. But local governments are making an effort. Keep the Children Company, an official scheme in Sichuan, has involved setting up “children’s homes” (a space in the village where they can play, read books and receive help with their homework), and appointing “mothers” to whom children can turn for emotional support. The central government has helped. Since 2010 it has trained people in 660,000 villages as “child-welfare directors”, that is, to perform social work. It has also allowed the use of poverty-alleviation funds for spending on children’s welfare.
In 2015 Lin’s village of Leyun was among the first to introduce a Keep the Children Company project. Liu Chunhua, an energetic kindergarten teacher, was chosen to lead it. In Chengdu, the provincial capital, she learnt how to broach sex and mental health with the village’s 20 children. Her efforts have paid off. A shy teen in Leyun was bewildered when she got her first period. A friend, also puzzled, prodded her to speak to “Mama Liu”. The teacher explained to the girl what was happening to her body and taught her how to wear pads. Village elders often gossip unkindly about the parents of left-behind children. Ms Liu has put a stop to that. She knows the harm it can do. Villagers had once taunted her own left-behind daughter with the false notion that Ms Liu only came back to see her eldest son. Her daughter became so dejected that Ms Liu quit her factory job and moved back to the village.

But keeping tabs on children is getting harder. Most villages once had a school, where teachers could check that students were not hurt, sick or distressed. In the past two decades, however, over 360,000 underused village schools have been closed to save money. Leyun’s hangs on by a thread. A decade ago it had 70 pupils. Now it has only two, in the youngest year-groups. Other children go to a school in Pujia, a town an hour’s walk down the mountain. They usually return to the village at weekends. Lin attends a kindergarten there. Asked if she gets good marks, Lin says she is slapped on the hand fewer times than her classmates.
One glimmer of hope is that growing numbers of migrants are able to find jobs closer to their native villages, as factories move inland. Some parents from Leyun are settling with their children in nearby towns. And the covid-19 pandemic is a cause of unexpected joy for some: it has forced many migrant workers to return to their original homes. Half of Leyun’s youngsters are currently living with both of their parents. That is “unheard of”, says Ms Liu, the teacher.
Many of these parents were also once left-behind children. But rural conditions have improved immensely since those days. Zhu Yidan, a 25-year-old volunteer teacher who grew up as a left-behind child in Sichuan, says that when she was growing up people had to walk cross-country to reach villages. Now there are paved roads and children have enough food, clothing and toys. Parents can video-chat with them daily and buy presents for them online.
But a new problem is emerging. Increasing numbers of children are being left in urban areas by one or both parents who move away for work. There were about 28m such children in 2015, nearly three times as many as in 2000. Those who follow their parents from village to city have better diets and mental health than those who remain in the countryside, studies show. But those who are subsequently left behind in cities suffer higher rates of violence than those who stay in villages. Ms Wan, the lawyer, says there is “a debt owed by this country to its left-behind children”. The account is far from settled. ■",2
1644,"UNTIL A FEW weeks ago only political junkies knew who Peter Marki-Zay was. That changed with his unexpected victory on October 17th in the run-off of the first-ever primary for the Hungarian opposition. The 49-year-old mayor of Hodmezovasarhely, a smallish and almost unpronounceable town in south-eastern Hungary, was elected by supporters of six parties as their candidate to try to replace Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, at parliamentary elections next April.
“We won the battle, but we need to win the war,” said Mr Marki-Zay, a conservative Catholic not affiliated with any party, at a rally in Budapest. Several politicians stood next to him, as did several relatives (he is a father of seven). Notably absent was his rival, Klara Dobrev, a vice-president of the European Parliament. Ms Dobrev merely acknowledged her defeat and pledged to support Mr Marki-Zay in his quest to remove Mr Orban from power.

Ms Dobrev won the first round of the primaries last month and Mr Marki-Zay had come third after Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of Budapest. Yet (after some hesitation) Mr Karacsony withdrew in Mr Marki-Zay’s favour. Both reckoned that Ms Dobrev could not beat Mr Orban, mainly because she is married to Ferenc Gyurcsany, a wildly unpopular former prime minister who faced riots in 2006 after revelations that he had repeatedly lied about the state of the economy.
Now comes the harder part. The six opposition parties that range from leftist and liberal parties such as Momentum and Democratic Coalition to Jobbik, a former far-right party that has become more moderate in recent years, need to maintain their united front. As well as electing a common candidate for prime minister they have picked one unified candidate for each of Hungary’s 106 constituencies. But even before the run-off they had started bickering. The small-town mayor accused Ms Dobrev of blackmailing politicians into voting for her. Ms Dobrev accused Mr Marki-Zay of methods reminiscent of Mr Orban and Donald Trump.
The opposition still needs to do a lot to win a majority, especially in smaller cities, says Robert Laszlo of Political Capital, a research outfit in Budapest. Forging a single joint list for the 93 proportionally elected seats will be the main source of conflict, he predicts; but he also worries about a fight for dominance between the allied parties. Moreover, Fidesz, the party of Mr Orban, will do whatever it can to drive wedges between the allies.
Mr Orban, who controls a two-thirds majority in parliament, will use every tool in his box to defeat his rival. He would have preferred to fight Mr Karacsony or Ms Dobrev, as the claim that the opposition is a puppet of Mr Gyurcsany will not be effective against a rural, conservative mayor. He will probably attack Mr Marki-Zay’s hectic manner, his unpredictability and his penchant for long speeches. He will no doubt label him an “American agent”, since he once worked for a car-parts firm in America, and that is all the evidence a conspiracy-monger like Mr Orban needs.
The prime minister is diligently wooing voters with their own money. He promises to send $2bn on a tax refund for families early next year. Pensioners will get a special bung in November and two weeks of extra state-pension payments in January. The minimum wage will rise.
Mr Orban’s friends control most media outlets. He can also count on the support of the various oligarchs who became rich on his watch. Yet despite all the prime minister’s advantages, polls put his challenger neck-and-neck with him. If the opposition alliance wins, Mr Marki-Zay has promised to mend fences with the European Union. He wants Hungary to join the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which can investigate the theft of EU funds—a huge problem in Hungary. He also wants to prepare his country to adopt the euro.
Mr Marki-Zay has already surprised observers twice, first by winning the mayor’s office in a town previously loyal to Fidesz, and then by prevailing in the primary. A third upset—beating the man who made Hungary a byword for demagoguery—will be harder still. But it is not impossible. ■",2
1645,"LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The standard setter for global trade finance flows has proposed a new set of rules to define sustainability in the trade finance arena, worth some $5 trillion a year, an executive told Reuters.
While governments and business sectors move quickly to set guidelines for some types of sustainable finance, there are no standards for trade finance. Those rules would apply to a third of global trade.
Agreeing on a common rulebook could help direct more trade flows toward efforts that reduce climate-warming emissions and that also meet the United Nations' development goals, said Andrew Wilson, policy director at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
While others have begun to set definitions for parts of the sustainable finance industry, such as green bonds, ""none of those frameworks can be easily or reliably applied to the financing of trade,"" Wilson said on the sidelines of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.
A framework for trade finance is considered more complicated as more parties are involved and entire supply chains need to be monitored, he said.
Banks and companies are assessing the sustainability of their trade deals in different ways that can be hard to reconcile.
On Wednesday, the ICC released a position paper that it expects to be formalised as guidelines in 2022. The paper was produced with the Boston Consulting Group based on input from more than 200 companies and banks including HSBC (HSBA.L), Santander (SAN.MC) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE).
More input would be sought, including with civil society and governments, before the framework is finalised to ensure support and consistency between the banks in how they classify transactions.
If the framework is considered workable, the ICC would look to develop sectoral standards for specific types of transactions, Wilson said.
While the ICC rules are not compulsory, the group is a recognised standard-setter, Wilson said, noting that its decisions are often referred to in court decisions.
He said he expected the framework to be under consultation until the second quarter of 2022, when a more detailed framework would be delivered. Final rules would then come in the third quarter.",3
1646,"IT LOOKED LIKE the fall of Saigon in 1975 on fast-forward: an American-backed army melting away, enemy fighters strolling into the presidential palace, desperate crowds mobbing the airport. But the similarities between Afghanistan and South Vietnam were not only superficial. Both states, built to please their American sponsors, had been hollowed out by one of the oldest diseases of governance: corruption.
In Afghanistan, “from your birth certificate to your death certificate and whatever comes in between, somehow you have to bribe,” says Ahmad Shah Katawazai, a former Afghan diplomat. Officials and police routinely demand baksheesh (a “tip”). As the Taliban advanced, the pay-off required for a passport rose to thousands of dollars.

Worse, a government job is itself a valuable commodity. As Sarah Chayes, an expert on corruption, discovered while running an NGO in Afghanistan, officials often buy their posts and must extort kickbacks to recoup their investment. Mr Katawazai says it can cost $100,000 to become a district police chief. Officials’ main goal becomes extorting revenue to distribute to their families and patronage networks.
Afghanistan was partly run by such networks, even before 2001. But America strengthened them by paying off warlords, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). In 2009 ISAF, the coalition of NATO-led forces in the country, set up an anti-corruption unit called Shafafiyat (“transparency” in Pashto), with modest results. The government’s anti-corruption prosecutor mainly pursued political enemies. By the end the country was so corrupt that governors cut deals with jihadists. The army’s numbers were inflated by “ghost soldiers”, absentees listed on the payroll so that commanders could pocket their salaries.
Americans may remember the term “ghost soldiers” from the war in Vietnam, where corrupt senior officers used the same system. One South Vietnamese colonel used to order aimless artillery barrages in order to hawk the spent shell casings as scrap metal. As in Afghanistan, police and soldiers profited from the heroin trade. A report in 1978 on the fall of South Vietnam by RAND, a security think-tank, said South Vietnamese themselves believed that corruption was “largely responsible for the ultimate collapse”.
Why then, when it invaded Afghanistan decades later, did America fail to take corruption seriously? One answer is that political thinkers are only now doing so. Scholars such as Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist, see corruption as a throwback to pre-modern governments where power is based on personal ties rather than institutions. In this way South Vietnam and Afghanistan resemble mafias or the feudal states of medieval Europe. States like these lack the cohesion needed to beat a disciplined insurgency such as the Vietnamese communists or the Taliban.
Another problem, says Mark Pyman of CurbingCorruption, a watchdog, is that corruption is too knotty a problem for military officers focused on their nine-month rotations. For their part, aid agencies too often judge success by how much money they disburse. In both South Vietnam and Afghanistan a vast influx of American dollars caused a surge in inflation, wiping out public-sector salaries. (Afghanistan, with a GDP of about $20bn per year in 2020, received $145bn in American aid in 2001-21. Inflation averaged 17.5% in 2003-8.) Public servants had to demand kickbacks to support themselves.
Hence anti-corruption experts recommend that aid should be frugal and focused on achievements. That is easier said than done. If America does not learn that dollars cannot build a real government, it will end up creating more fake ones. ■",2
1647,"GABON, A SMALL, family-run petrostate in west Africa, may seem a rather odd campaigner against global warming. Once Africa’s fifth-largest oil exporter, it profited from the world pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Now, however, it hopes to benefit by helping the world to avoid overheating—and by encouraging rich countries to pay African ones to keep their forests standing. Its advocacy got a boost on November 2nd when the leaders of more than 100 countries pledged at the COP26 summit to end deforestation by 2030. To help that happen, rich countries promised to stump up billions of dollars.
At least 85% of Gabon, which lies on the equator at the edge of the Gulf of Guinea, is covered in steaming jungle. It is one of six countries that form the massive forest of the Congo basin—the world’s second-biggest tropical rainforest, after the Amazon—which sucks in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and turns it into leaves and branches. (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the two Congos and Equatorial Guinea are the other five.) Gabon is not the largest of this group of carbon sinks, but its president, Ali Bongo, is the most eager to offer to protect his country’s forests in exchange for cash from rich countries.

Gabon’s argument is simple. Large rainforests such as those in the Congo basin provide a service to the world by sucking millions of tonnes of carbon from the air. Since performing this service provides no income, there has been little incentive for poor countries to protect their forests when they could instead profit by chopping them down for timber or clearing them for farming.

The potential benefits are large. “The stock of carbon in the Congo basin adds up to six years of total global emissions,” says Lee White, Gabon’s environment minister, adding that Gabon alone absorbs the equivalent of one-third of France’s carbon emissions each year. Although Gabon emits only around 25m tonnes of carbon a year, it sequesters about 140m tonnes, he reckons. Yet the six countries in the Congo basin used to suck far more carbon from the air than they do now. The Democratic Republic of Congo, which has the largest expanse of jungle of the six, is losing 500,000 hectares of it a year through deforestation. It will need some incentive to stop the chop. And countries such as Gabon, which have been protecting their forests, should be rewarded for having done so, argues Mr White.
The consequences of not doing so go beyond emissions. Mr White says the forests cause rain to fall across the Ethiopian highlands, the Nile valley and the southern rim of the Sahel. If these places dry up, waves of hungry people may spread across Africa, making the continent more prone to turmoil. Many will also head to Europe.
The deal struck at COP included a pledge by 12 countries to provide $12bn in public funding to protect and restore forests. The countries, which include America, Germany, Japan and Britain, hope that will also open the taps to private funding. Quite how this money will be spent is not yet clear. But several ideas are gaining ground.
Eats, shoots and LEAFs
One is to pay countries that can show they have reduced emissions by preserving forests. The LEAF Coalition, a partnership of governments and big firms that stands for Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance, has raised $1bn for this purpose. Another is that countries or companies may sell “green bonds” to finance climate-related projects. Investors keen to look green may pay a premium for these, allowing issuers to borrow at concessionary rates. “If you stop deforestation, you should be compensated for forgoing other forms of economic development,” says Andrew Mitchell, a climate scientist who founded the Natural Capital Finance Alliance. “Forests should be worth more alive than dead.”
It is not just governments that could raise money using green bonds, but also private firms such as the African Conservation Development Group, a Mauritius-registered company led by a South African, Alan Bernstein, that wants to mix virtue with profit, and help finance its efforts by selling $300m worth of green bonds to companies wishing to offset their own carbon emissions. It has bought a huge concession at Grande Mayumba, on Gabon’s south-west coast, investing $200m in sugar, rubber, fishing, forestry, cattle-ranching, and—for the very rich—eco-tourism.
Mr Mitchell is confident that African green bonds will eventually take off. But for the moment markets are still wary of buying any sort of African bond, let alone newfangled green ones. One worry is politics, as Gabon’s example illustrates. If investors are to pay more for green bonds financing forests, they would have to be certain that the carbon absorbed within the trees would be contained there for many years. Many may wonder what might happen if, for example, Mr Bongo’s regime in Gabon were to fall?
The question is far from academic. The Bongo family has run Gabon as a patronage-ridden fief for 54 years; no one pretends it is a democracy. At its most recent election, in 2016, it was obvious that the main challenger, Jean Ping, had actually won. Moreover, Mr Bongo suffered a serious stroke three years ago and may not be well enough to run again. Should he die, it is unclear if his Eton-educated, half-French son Noureddin, not yet 30, would seek to replace him, presumably using the regime’s usual tricks.
Without the backing of Mr Bongo, it may not be certain that Mr White would be able to continue to protect the forest. As it is, his position is somewhat improbable. A 56-year-old white Briton, he is an expert on biodiversity, gorillas and forest elephants. For nearly ten years he ran Gabon’s national parks, until two years ago, when an illegal-logging scandal was exposed over the illicit export of kevazingo, a reddish hardwood. In the fallout the president fired his vice-president and environment minister, and replaced the latter with Mr White.
He has won widespread admiration for promoting tree-hugging and animal-coddling in Gabon, thereby bolstering Mr Bongo’s claim to be Africa’s green champion. But his policy is far from popular with the many villagers whose crops are routinely trampled by unruly elephants. A standard cry among Gabonese tired of the ruling family runs, “Ali Bongo prefers elephants and trees to people.” It is a sentiment the leaders at the COP will need to get to grips with, if their plans to protect Africa’s forests are to come to fruition. ■

1648,"WHEN, IN 1998, President Bill Clinton fired cruise missiles at terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan, a reporter asked the secretary of defence if there wasn’t a “striking resemblance” to the plot of “Wag the Dog”, a film in which a White House consultant confects a faraway war to distract from a presidential sex scandal. Popular culture and sex scandals loomed large in American society during the 1990s; foreign affairs did not. Abroad was where the impediments to Ross and Rachel’s predestined coupledom came from in “Friends”.
Those who still paid attention to America’s role in the world lacked a definition for it. Having become the world’s only superpower, America had very little idea how to use that power—if, indeed, it should use it that much at all.

September 11th 2001 brought this era of distraction and aimlessness to an end. The horror of that day unified the country, all but erasing memories of President George W. Bush’s divisive victory over Al Gore the year before. It also created, for Americans, the prospect of global solidarity. “The world has changed in a way that we are all vulnerable,” said Joe Biden, the chairman of the Senate foreign-relations committee, the following day.
  
America’s mission, he went on, was obvious: to take the lead in “a struggle between civilisation and barbarity”. A few weeks later, at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr Biden imagined how that new purpose—and specifically a new common cause with Russia which the struggle would make not just possible but necessary—“could shape this half-century as the cold war shaped the last”.
A big claim. The strategy of containing the Soviet Union, first articulated by George Kennan, a diplomat, in 1947, governed America’s conduct in the world from then until the Soviet Union’s dissolution. It provided nine successive presidential administrations with a compass and a rallying point, producing not just a series of capital-d doctrines (preceded by names like Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Carter), but also a national highway system, a science boom and a common cause—as well as witch-hunts for communists and the folly of Vietnam. It led to a green revolution in developing-country agriculture and put a man on the Moon.
It also justified hard trade-offs in foreign policy. It gave presidents a rationale, however thin, for alliances with despots. It argued for patience in building democratic institutions in South Korea and Taiwan like those established in West Germany and Japan. In 1972 it prompted the boldest stroke in late-20th-century American diplomacy: the opening to China.
When the Berlin Wall fell, America’s accumulated economic, technological, cultural and military power lost its counterweight. After Iraqi troops swept into Kuwait the following year the world soon got a glimpse of what this “unipolar” era might look like. The spectacularly one-sided Gulf war of 1991 provided the first large-scale demonstration of America’s might in decades. Stealth, precision-guided munitions and long-range cruise missiles developed during the cold war found new application beyond it.
The institutions, mindset and, in the form of the first George Bush, leadership demonstrated in that war were also products of the world gone by—and less adaptable to new forms of conflict. Cold-war concerns about coalition-building and the sanctity of state borders worked reasonably well when it came to liberating Kuwait. The lessons of the previous 40 years were far less helpful when it came to shoring up weak states, such as Somalia, or quelling intra-state conflict, as in Rwanda or Bosnia, or fighting transnational threats such as terrorism. And by leaving Saddam Hussein in power the war also implied, unsatisfyingly to some, that while borders mattered to America, tyranny did not.
The lack of a settled idea about what, if anything, the lone hyperpower should do about such problems made foreign policy in the 1990s “like being set loose on the ocean and there wasn’t really any charted course”, as Madeleine Albright, Mr Clinton’s secretary of state, later put it. The task of coming up with a guiding principle for America’s role as overarching as containment became known in the White House as the “Kennan sweepstakes”; aides consulted Mr Kennan himself. But to no real avail. As Joe Biden said in 1998—the same year the Clinton administration had launched its first, derided missile strikes against al-Qaeda—there was “no consensus on the US role in the world”.
When Mr Biden delivered his talk at the Council on Foreign Relations in October 2001 American forces had just invaded Afghanistan in order to accomplish what those missile strikes had not. A new consensus had crystallised, and Mr Biden imagined it being backed by the rest of the world. Vladimir Putin, he said, was a strategic thinker who was taking on reactionaries because he saw “he must cast his lot with the West”. America and China now shared interests in fighting terrorism and maintaining peace in Central Asia. Even Iran might warm to the Americans. It was, after all, helping in Afghanistan.


Twenty years on, the world is not the one Mr Biden hoped for. The framework George W. Bush’s administration adopted for its post-9/11 mission in the world, the global war on terror, certainly put an end to the foreign-policy establishment’s worries about the role of their hyperpower and how fully to use its force. Containing the Soviet Union had kept a lid on America, too, forcing it to acknowledge complex geopolitical interests, accept lesser evils to fend off greater ones and cautiously avoid pushing its nuclear adversary too far. Now America could be uncontained.
But for all the deaths that followed, Afghanistan sits today in the hands from which it was being taken when Mr Biden was giving his speech. The calamitous invasion of Iraq has left behind a country divided and under the sway of an Iran that has not warmed to America one little bit. And the effort expended in the war on terror has undermined America’s ability to face the challenge from China on which Mr Biden needs, and would prefer, to focus. It is a challenge which comes, as the cold war’s did, from a rival great power offering a fundamentally different political settlement and seeking global influence.
With the time long past for imagining China and Russia standing shoulder-to-shoulder with America, Mr Biden now wants to constrain them by reaffirming what his administration, in an incantatory manner, calls the rules-based international order. But having bent and broken those rules for 20 years, America has strained their credibility, as well as its own.
Fighting a furtive, transnational enemy made respect for sovereignty a luxury America no longer chose to afford. To deny terrorists any haven, it could not permit weak states to suppurate. Norms were abnegated, allegiance all: either you were with America, Mr Bush said, or you were with the terrorists. Helpful tyrants were tolerated. America’s neglect of (under Mr Bush and his successor, Barack Obama) and contempt for (under Donald Trump) international institutions like the UN has left them ill equipped to help.
Fools rush in
As the Bush administration began rallying support for war in Iraq, Mr Kennan, then aged 98, warned against the new strategy. Even a sole superpower could not “confront all the painful and dangerous situations that exist in this world”. It was, he said, “beyond our capabilities”. He accused Democrats of going along with Mr Bush out of timidity.
Mr Biden could have been one of those he had in mind. In a speech given in 2002, during the Senate’s debate over the Iraq-war authorisation, he emphasised the importance of UN support for an invasion; he spoke of the danger of any country arrogating to itself the right to wage war to prevent a possible, eventual threat; and he warned of the “sin of Vietnam”, of “the failure of two presidents to level with the American people of what the costs would be”. And then he voted for the war.
So did all other leading Democrats with aspirations to be president. Voicing doubt was left to those whose aspirations were yet to come—such as Mr Obama—and to those whose aspirations had already passed by. Mr Gore, the only nationally elected politician to have served in Vietnam, had supported the first Gulf war in 1991, unlike Mr Biden and most other Democratic senators. In 2002 he strongly criticised the rush to return.
In 2005 Mr Bush’s second inaugural address gave perhaps the loftiest description of what had become known as the Bush Doctrine, calling for the kind of unilateral, preventive action Mr Biden said he opposed but had, in practice, voted for. “We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands,” Mr Bush declared. “The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world…America’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.”
This was not true, and the way the war was prosecuted made that painfully clear. Various strategically placed and well-disposed tyrants were untroubled by the war against terror. Mr Bush, unlike his father, felt no need to secure the blessing of the global assembly which the United States had helped found in order to maintain peace and security. America had been imprisoning people at Guantánamo Bay, beyond the jurisdiction of federal courts, since January 2002. There and elsewhere, America and its fellow travellers tortured people it had captured. In Washington they sought to justify that practice.
The next two presidents tried and failed to escape the dynamic of the war on terror. Mr Obama spoke a language of liberal internationalism as grand as Mr Bush’s. “The people of the world want change,” he said in his first speech to the UN General Assembly, in 2009. “They will not long tolerate those who are on the wrong side of history.” But he did not share Mr Bush’s appetite for unilateral intervention. He tried to summon other countries to achieve priorities he insisted were not just America’s, arguing—as his vice-president, Mr Biden, had in 2001—that more than at any time in history, national interests aligned. But most other countries persisted in not viewing their interests as identical with America’s. Mr Obama’s commitment to multilateralism and international rules remained at best ambivalent. The 540 drone strikes with which he prosecuted the war on terror over his eight years in office killed thousands, hundreds of whom were in no way targets.
Mr Trump also failed to end the wars that began after 9/11. But he stripped off the idealistic wrapper and tossed it aside. With his zest for puncturing pieties, Mr Trump confirmed many people’s suspicions that America’s professed ideals were camouflage for the exercise of power in the pursuit of self-interest, painting a dark picture of America’s history. “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?” he asked in 2017 while defending Mr Putin in an interview on Fox News.
Angels fear to tread
Now Mr Biden has presided over a lurch for the exit in Afghanistan and is ending combat operations in Iraq. American defeat, dissension and bumbling have played into Chinese claims that it is time for someone else to shape the international system. For China, the withdrawal “is just one more bit of evidence for the proposition that the United States is a power in decline,” says Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University.
America—and Mr Biden—have been here before. On April 23rd 1975, when the fall of Saigon was just a week away, Mr Biden rose in the Senate chamber to address America’s history in Asia and its standing in the world. Just 32, brimming with ambition and self-assurance, Mr Biden instructed his colleagues about a pattern in American foreign policy that he saw reaching back to Commodore Matthew Perry’s arrival in Tokyo Bay in the mid-19th century. “It seems that, in respect to Asia, our foreign policy has been one of magnificent obsessions and lost causes,” he declared.
And yet, though Mr Biden had long opposed “the shambles that is Vietnam” (and felt, in a phrase that today has a shameful added resonance, that “the United States has no obligation to evacuate one, or 100,001, South Vietnamese”), he also rejected any suggestion that defeat heralded twilight for America. “In my judgment, there is occurring no ‘fading of America’, as some commentators are trying to call it—no time for pretentious talk of ‘watersheds’ and ‘tides of history’ running against us as a nation,” he said. “As I read the news dispatches, the need is not to reassure other nations that we are not withdrawing into a shell. The need is that we should have more confidence in ourselves.”


  
Mr. Biden’s confidence in his own judgment, and in America, turned out to be well placed. In the coming years other foreign-policy disasters awaited—in Iran (repeatedly), in Central America, in Lebanon. But so did victory in the cold war.
Whether such confidence would be so well placed today is less clear; certainly today’s Mr Biden has yet to voice that confidence so full-throatedly. Then America could count on allies in NATO and beyond that were committed to the pursuit of shared objectives. Despite the disillusionment of the 1970s, relative to today America’s major public and private institutions generally retained the broad, bipartisan trust of the public, notes Henry Brady, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. That allowed thoroughgoing reforms in the executive branch, the intelligence agencies, the campaign-finance system and the armed forces, reforms that sustained the struggle through the cold war and strengthened democracy at home.
“It was a yeasty time, intellectually,” says Gary Hart, who joined the Senate as a leader of the reform-minded post-Watergate class of 1974. “There were a lot of corridor conversations, particularly among Democrats. Everything was up for debate and resolution.” Now, he adds, “I just don’t sense any systemic reform efforts going on anywhere.”
The sloppy punctuation with which Mr Biden has ended the wars of 9/11 may not signal the “fading of America” in which he disbelieved almost half a century ago. But it does mark the end, for now, of a faded idea, about the imperative of spreading America’s ideals throughout the world. America’s confidence in its own model is shaken. From the vantage of an America where citizens have assaulted their capitol, it can be hard to recall the upwelling of unity on September 11th 2001—a day when legislators of both parties gathered on the steps of the same building and, impromptu, sang “God Bless America”. Conflicted over whether its national story is a source of pride or shame, America is struggling to articulate its ideals, with conviction, to itself, let alone to others. A hardened president leads a tired nation.
It may be that a less righteous yet still influential America will prove a force for patient and durable, rather than destabilising, change. After what Mr Biden’s aides call a decades-long national “detour”, the contest with China may allow the assertion of strength and purpose abroad to redound to the nation’s advantage at home.
Competitors, after all, can help. Mr Kennan thought Americans were lucky to have the Soviet Union around. Their very survival, he wrote in 1947, depended on “pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear”. Whatever history may have intended, it proved him more right than wrong about the effects of the cold war. It did give America national purpose. As Mr Gore put it when accepting the Supreme Court decision which delivered the presidency to Mr Bush in 2000, “This is America and we put country before party.”
The war on terror has had no such ennobling or unifying results. Not only has America failed to strengthen an international order that conforms to its values. America’s own public institutions and many of its private ones—whether from confusion, exhaustion, fear or partisan political assault—are also emerging weaker from this 20-year experiment in power projection. One measure is the fact that an act of political grace, of deference to an American ideal, like that of Mr Gore now seems all but unthinkable. The message he saw his concession sending to “our fellow members of the world community”—that the strength of American democracy is shown most clearly through the difficulties it can overcome—may still be true. But the 21 years since have not provided much support for it. ■",2
1649,"WHEN INTERNATIONAL news organisations revealed that at least ten governments had used Pegasus, a powerful software tool created by Israel’s NSO Group, to hack into the smartphones of thousands of people around the world, including politicians, human-rights activists and journalists, the Israeli government shrugged. A humdrum official statement insisted that all Israeli cyber-exports were regulated by the government in “adherence to international arrangements”. Export licences were granted “exclusively to governmental entities, for lawful use, and only for the purpose of preventing and investigating crime and counter-terrorism”.
Israeli defence exporters privately expressed ridicule. “Arms companies can’t keep track of every rifle and bullet they sell to legitimate customers,” said one. “Why should we have higher expectations when it comes to software?...Israeli spying is a sexy subject and these reports are the price for doing business.”

In any case, the Pegasus customer list correlates neatly with many of the governments courted by Israel’s former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who lost his job in June. These include like-minded populists such as the rulers of Brazil, Hungary and India, along with Sunni Arab regimes with whom Israel recently established diplomatic relations: Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, a fellow enemy of Iran, is listed, too. “Deals on cyber-surveillance are the kind of sweetener you can throw into a diplomatic package with a foreign leader,” says a former NSO consultant.
Israel’s new government, too, has close ties to the cyber-industry. The prime minister, Naftali Bennett, made a fortune as a founder of an online-banking security company and is a cyber-defence aficionado. His interior minister and right-hand woman, Ayeled Shaked, is a former tech executive with friends at NSO; she supported awarding the firm government contracts. The new defence minister, Benny Gantz, chaired a company that specialised in data-mining for policing and counter-terror purposes. The head of that (now defunct) company, Ram Ben Barak, a former Mossad bigwig, currently chairs the foreign-affairs and defence committee, which monitors cyber-exports. A hearing on the NSO affair is scheduled, but only in a secretive subcommittee behind closed doors.
Israel’s Defence Export Control Law of 2007 requires companies to undergo a rigorous licensing process. It was passed after America, Israel’s chief patron, complained about Israel selling arms to China. But defence officials and human-rights campaigners admit that once a licence has been obtained, the Israeli government prefers not to know how the tools are used.
Some firms have set up in-house ethics committees, fearing that otherwise they might become tainted, making it harder to do business in the West. “The more progressive-minded workforce coming to the fore in America’s tech giants could treat Israel as a pariah, object to having research centres in Israel and collaborating with Israeli companies,” says a veteran dealmaker. Stung by the Pegasus revelations, investors in Novalpina Capital, a private-equity firm that owns NSO, are thinking of liquidating the fund. But Israel’s rulers, old and new, have fewer qualms. ■
Correction (August 6th 2021): This article originally stated that none of Israel’s ministers publicly commented on the reports about NSO Group. In fact, the diaspora affairs minister did comment, saying firms such as NSO Group are causing direct harm to Israel’s diplomatic interests. Sorry.",2
1650,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",3
1651,"EVERY LARGE business has a boss and minions, who do most of the work. What comes between the corner office and the shop floor is a matter of managerial preference. Some firms’ organisational charts are towering mille-feuilles, with staff piled into rigid hierarchies stuffed with assorted supervisors. More fashionable of late has been the pancake organigram: fewer layers of workers reporting to a smaller cadre of chieftains. As appealing as such “flat” organisations might seem, the thinning of managerial ranks comes at great cost.
Vice-presidents, area supervisors and other department heads were once the corporate machine’s central cogs. Now such middle managers are derided as pound-shop CEOs, there largely to organise and attend pointless meetings. A few modish startups bill themselves as having no administrative tiers at all, leaving independent employees flitting between tasks as they see fit. Such holacracy, as it is dubbed, clearly won’t do for a Unilever or Goldman Sachs. But even big firms now ritually boast about “delayering” their ranks.

Flat organisations are meant to reflect the modern workplace. Businesses in generations past used to be steeply hierarchical to mimic the armed forces, remembered by bosses of yesteryear as a place where missions were accomplished. Starting off at the bottom of a pyramid, perhaps six or seven rungs below the top brass, wasn’t so bad if you intended to progress at the same firm for your entire career. Millennials and later Gen-Z recruits had other ideas. Reporting to an overbearing boss crimped their ability to make an immediate mark.
Several factors contributed to the “flattening” trend. Businesses discovered that having lots of mini-barons could lead to stultifying silos. New ways of working—starting with modern technology—mean that executives can manage more subordinates, including some far away. Add enough direct reports to each supervisor, and the number of rungs between the chief executive and the graduate trainee shrinks accordingly.
Proponents of flat organisations say they give each employee added responsibility: bosses with dozens of flunkeys can hardly be expected to micromanage them. Uncluttered organigrams make companies more agile, enable faster decision-making and trim costs to boot. Business titans like Elon Musk of Tesla, a car firm, have painted delayering as a way of improving communication and shedding corporate deadweight.
Clearly there are limits to how far one can go. Not every Tesla factory hand is going to seek their annual appraisal from Mr Musk. In fact any amount of delayering hacks away at what it means for an employee to be part of a company. The key corollary—indeed the enabling factor—of flat organisations is for each employee to have less boss. That will sound appealing to some workers.
Such bosslessness, however, is a false Utopia. Companies that went furthest in scrapping management tiers discovered that getting rid of a formal pecking order resulted in informal hierarchies taking hold instead. A leadership vacuum risks being filled by petty tyranny. It is inevitable when large groups of people spend time together, in the office or elsewhere, that someone ends up in charge (and often lots of people end up in charge of different little tasks). That can be layers of managers put in place formally according to their competence and track record. Or, if everyone is on paper holacratically equal, it might be whoever talks loudest at meetings.
Fewer tiers mean fewer people with day-to-day experience of corralling employees. Yet managing others is not an ancillary task which companies do to reach other aims. It is the precondition for any of their aims to be reached. Sometimes skimping on the degree to which each human resource is supervised doesn’t matter much. But there inevitably comes a time—for the employee or the company—when it matters a great deal. Having lots of organisational tiers means that those in charge of managing lots of people have had experience managing fewer people before.
Covid-19 has already upended many individuals’ working lives. Gone are the days of sitting every day in the same office as your co-workers. Plenty will be adapting to the new managerial normal for a while yet. That makes keeping employees in the loop and engaged more important than ever. Layers of bosses provide structure. For all the joy of belittling them, middle managers are part of the solution.

1652,"ANNA KUZMINYKH, a 27-year-old film director, is also a member of Pussy Riot, a punk-rock-and-performance-art group that has been protesting against Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian government for the better part of a decade. In July, along with four other members of the group, she was arrested (twice) for “disobeying police orders”.
After 30 days in jail, Ms Kuzminykh was released this month. Then the real trouble began. As she recounts, “My phone started ringing off the hook, 50 numbers at once were calling me.” The messages were littered with threats like “Slut, we will kill you and your whole family.”

Ms Kuzminykh’s ordeal is not by any means unusual. Russian women with non-traditional views are increasingly being harassed by reactionary groups, whose targets include feminists, gay activists, women who work in the porn industry and those who dare to have romantic partners who are not ethnic Russians.
One group that has been organising such bullying campaigns is Male State, which describes its ideology as “national patriarchy”. It was founded by Vladislav Pozdnyakov, a bodybuilder, in 2016. In 2018 he was convicted on a charge of inciting hatred of women; his group had harassed many of them individually. A year later Mr Pozdnyakov fled to Poland.
Exile, however, has not stopped him from revving up his angry male fans. Male State says it opposes Russia’s current leaders for being too pro-women. It has around 83,000 followers on its Telegram channel. Its members search for people—usually women—who express feminist or gay-friendly views on social media, or are part of the porn business, and then use online tools to track them down.
When they succeed, they get nasty. Many victims are sent photos of their homes or their relatives. The threat is not hard to discern. Ms Kuzminykh says the tipping point for her was when someone sent her a photo of her little sister over WhatsApp, a social-media service.
Many activists suspect that Male State has ties to the Russian authorities, especially the police. Members of Socfemalternativa, a leftist group, were harassed by Male State and became the subject of a report prepared by the Interior Ministry on feminists who attend protest rallies. The report included photos, addresses, social-media accounts and other private information. Much of this had appeared earlier in Telegram channels run by Male State. “It’s not just that they know my address or my apartment number—they even know the floor I am living on,” says Ms Kuzminykh.
Some victims have changed cities; at least a dozen have fled Russia. Among those who stay, many fear to go outside; some have become suicidal. Ms Kuzminykh is planning to leave Russia. She wonders if a western European country, or America, might recognise her as a political refugee. She doubts that Russian cops will protect her. On the contrary, she fears they may be helping her tormentors. ■",2
1653,"ON AUGUST 6TH the Cuban council of state approved a long-awaited law authorising the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises. The announcement came less than a month after thousands of Cubans took to the streets calling for freedom and an end to the Communist dictatorship. After a brutal crackdown, around 380 protesters are now in prison awaiting trial on charges such as “delinquency”.
The announcement could be designed partly to distract attention from the state’s suppression of dissent. On an island with the fourth-highest official covid-19 infection rate in the world it will be tricky for people to forget that there was enough petrol to power motorcycles, trucks and buses filled with boinas negras (a special-forces unit of the Cuban military) who were sent out to rough up the protesters in July, but not enough for ambulances or incinerators to cremate the dead.

Nonetheless, it is a welcome reform. It is part of what the government calls the “ perfeccionamiento”, or perfection, of socialism. Everyone else recognises it as allowing a bit of free enterprise to compensate for socialism’s failures. In February Cuba’s council of ministers increased the number of trades open to cuentapropistas, or self-employed people. Some 124 sectors are reserved for the state, but everything else is open to entrepreneurs. Even with the recent changes, the legal status of cuentapropistas is ill-defined. Applying for the necessary permits is a slog that can take ages. The rules are designed to keep cuentapropistas small (and therefore no threat to state-owned firms). They can only hire relatives or other self-employed subcontractors. They cannot incorporate, so there is no legal difference between their personal capital and their business capital—if the business goes bust, so do they.
Despite these shackles, enterprising Cubans have flocked to start their own micro-businesses. Since 2010 the share of the workforce who are self-employed has soared from 3% to 13%, or more than 600,000 people. Just over a third are women; a third are under 30. They are concentrated in the largest cities, and are most likely to work as taxi-drivers or run restaurants and food kiosks.
The new law, which still needs to be published in Cuba’s official gazette, is expected to allow small and even medium-sized private businesses to incorporate. This could mean that private firms will be allowed to hire staff (rather than just nephews or independent contractors). It could also mean that multiple investors will be able to put money into a private firm with limited liability. That would make Cuba much more attractive to foreign investors. Incorporation would also make paying taxes simpler and borrowing less daunting. But not all industries will be treated equally. Architects, journalists, lawyers, vets, translators and interpreters, among others, are not allowed to work in the private sector, or to incorporate.
Cuba’s state firms are pampered, inefficient and the main reason why the island is so short of basic goods. This, in turn, is one reason why Cubans have been protesting. Last year GDP shrank by 11%. New official statistics show that imports and exports of goods have been declining since 2018, well before the pandemic scuppered tourism and starved Cuba of hard currency. Hoping to boost morale, the government has distributed some food, donated from Mexico and elsewhere, in the areas where the largest protests occurred.
Oniel Díaz of Auge, a consultancy, has called for reforms to unleash the private sector since 2017. He is excited by the new law, but cautious too. Opening a business is likely to continue to be much slower than elsewhere in the world. “At the end of the day, this is still Cuba.”■",2
1654,"LAW AND JUSTICE (PiS), the party that rules Poland, dislikes critics. Soon after coming to power in 2015, it took control of TVP, the public television broadcaster, and purged its management. Since then, Poland has slipped from 18th place in a World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, a non-profit group, to 64th, its lowest-ever ranking. Now PiS has turned its attention to TVN, a television station owned by Discovery, an American media giant. A bill limiting foreign ownership of media companies adopted on August 11th by the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament, could force Discovery to sell. Liberals fear that Poland’s independent media are in jeopardy.
“The Polish media should be Polish,” says Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the ruling party’s chairman and the country’s de facto leader. “Repolonisation” has become a buzzword in all sorts of industries. In March PKN Orlen, a state-owned oil refiner, bought Polska Press, the country’s leading newspaper publisher, from its German owner. Senior editors were subsequently replaced.

Law and Justice’s latest target is TVN24, a news channel. Unlike TVP, it is critical of the government. It is also influential: its evening news was the most-watched news programme in Poland in the first half of 2021, with an audience share of almost 22%, just ahead of TVP’s rival offering.
The amendment to the broadcasting law proposes to bar entities from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) from owning more than a 49% stake in any Polish media firm. The party is defending “Polish interests”, says Marek Suski, the Law and Justice MP behind the proposed amendment. Critics warn that it is aimed at TVN24, whose licence expires in September and has not yet been renewed. If the amendment is adopted, Discovery may have to divest the channel.
The “ TVN law” could spell trouble for the ruling party, though. American officials, who have leapt to TVN’s defence in the past, are concerned. “Unfettered press is crucial for democracy,” tweeted Bix Aliu, America’s chargé d’affaires in Warsaw, in response to the draft legislation. It also added to the tensions that brought down the ruling coalition this week. Jaroslaw Gowin, a deputy prime minister and leader of Agreement, a pro-business party that was one of Law and Justice’s two junior coalition partners, was ejected from the government on August 10th. He had wanted an amendment to the media law that would allow ownership by companies in the OECD, a group of rich countries including America. He also opposed government-backed tax reforms.
The media-nobbling law must still pass the Senate, where Law and Justice lacks a majority. With the next parliamentary elections due in 2023, the party continues to lead in the polls, ahead of the centrist opposition. It has shrugged off criticism, including from the European Commission, which also complains about its subversion of the judiciary. Making Discovery sell TVN will harm relations with America. But Mr Kaczynski clearly values control over Polish media more. ■",2
1655," (CNN)Steve Bannon's relationship with former President Donald Trump has landed him in the dock, charged with criminal contempt of Congress.  Doubling down on his Trump-emulating defiance, Bannon has retained the ex-president's former lawyer, David Schoen -- perhaps most famous for taking part in the defense in the second impeachment when seven members of Trump's own party voted to convict him.  Schoen is making the rounds offering Bannon's public defense: He was just following the advice of his (prior) lawyer, who told him to respect Trump's claims of executive privilege. But Schoen's arguments are no better now than they were during Trump's impeachment trial. It's worth taking the time to debunk them. First, Trump is no longer the president, and he doesn't get to invoke executive privilege to shield himself and his cronies from accountability. As Judge Tonya Chutkan held last week in denying Trump's attempt to block the National Archives from releasing January 6 documents: Presidents aren't kings -- and Trump isn't even the president.  The ex-president's invocation of the privilege is not a sufficient basis to take the law into your own hands and simply refuse to show up, as Bannon did. Trump helped Bannon evade accountability once, pardoning him after he was arrested for wire fraud. Not this time.   Trump's attempt at invoking the privilege is especially weak here because he wasn't acting as chief executive when he planned and implemented his effort to overturn the election. He was acting as a defeated candidate, and there is no candidate privilege.  Second, there's no such thing as podcaster privilege. Even if Trump could invoke the privilege, it wouldn't protect Bannon -- he was a podcast host, not a White House advisor, on January 6. Bannon's whisperings with other conspirators also aren't Oval Office advice to the president. Third, Bannon can't hide behind his lawyer any more than he can hide behind Trump. Schoen claims that Bannon was merely acting on the advice of his lawyer, who told him to honor Trump's privilege invocation. But the majority of federal courts hold that reliance on a lawyer's advice isn't a defense to criminal contempt. The Godfather's Vito Corleone didn't get to break the law with impunity because Tom Hagen told him it was OK.  Fourth, even if good faith reliance on a lawyer's advice were a defense, it wouldn't help Bannon. A person who wants to invoke a legitimate privilege in good faith doesn't simply ignore a subpoena. He responds on time, and he negotiates. He turns over all relevant documents that aren't covered by the privilege, and produces a privilege log indicating which documents he isn't turning over and why. He doesn't simply skip out on a scheduled deposition. He shows up, answers when he can, and invokes the privilege on a question-by-question basis.  Even with an executive privilege claim, the committee could plausibly pose questions that bear no connection to Trump, such as communications Bannon had with others outside the administration who were in a pre-insurrection ""war room"" at the Willard Hotel in DC.  Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department lawyer who apparently collaborated with Trump in trying to overturn the election results, also sought to invoke the privilege -- but he at least showed up at his deposition to do it.  Bannon didn't, and he didn't negotiate either. He appears not to have even tried to act in good faith. It looks like he holds Congress in abundant contempt. Now it's officially mutual.  Fifth, and finally, with no facts or law on his side, Schoen has resorted to claiming that Congress and the DOJ are just being unfair to his client. That's not going to cut it as a defense -- try winning a selective prosecution defense -- but it's also wrong on the facts.  Bannon's own words have been even more damaging than his lawyer's. When he surrendered himself to the FBI on Monday, Bannon brazenly outlined his intent, ""I don't want anybody to take their eye off the ball...We're taking down the Biden regime.""  Willfulness -- an informed and deliberate refusal to comply -- is required to prove criminal contempt. Look for the tape of those words to be played at trial to show bad intent.  Judge Carl Nichols may be a Trump appointee, but it's hard to conceive that he would look kindly on Bannon's brazenness. Proof of that is his scathing decision against Trump's allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, rejecting their effort to get Dominion Voting Systems' libel case against them thrown out. It's true that criminal contempt prosecutions are rare. They should be. They're a big deal. But Bannon's flagrant contempt of Congress cries out for consequences. And our republic needs them.  We are still looking for answers about what happened on January 6 and how to stop the ongoing attack waged by Bannon and his co-conspirators on the very idea of a democratic government. ",0
1656,"ON THE OUTSKIRTS of Vientiane, the capital of Laos, workers for China Railway No. 2 Engineering Group recently welded the last two 500m lengths of “seamless rail” for the China-Laos Railway, a flagship project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Chinese state media celebrate the railroad, set to open in December, as a feat of modern engineering. It is also a marvel of modern book-keeping, amassing $3.6bn in debt off the government’s balance-sheet but for which the Laotian state may still end up on the hook. That financing and other “hidden debt” to China amounts to a third of the country’s GDP, which could become a problem: Laos already has sovereign debts equivalent to about 60% of GDP on its books, half of it owed to China.
Hidden debts bedevil many of China’s development projects abroad, including lots in Asia, which are financed in such complex ways, and arranged among so many different entities, that even Chinese financial authorities have had trouble keeping track. On September 29th AidData, a research unit at William  Mary, a university in America, released a data set that attempted to put a dollar figure on China’s lending to projects overseas, including off-the-books debt that is not reported to the World Bank. AidData tallied 13,427 projects for which China had provided about $800bn in lending over an 18-year period starting in 2000. That includes $385bn in what AidData calls “hidden” debt. It counted 44 countries that owe the equivalent of at least 10% of their GDP to China.

Getting a grip on how much countries owe to China matters because many of these developing countries, struggling in the pandemic, are trying to renegotiate the terms of their sovereign debts not only with China but also with multilateral lenders and other countries. In 2020 the G20, which includes China, agreed to suspend debt-service payments temporarily for as many as 73 countries to give them a chance to restructure their debts. But many of China’s loans are arranged in ways that might not be covered by the agreement. As in the case of the China-Laos Railway, loans can be agreed between state-owned enterprises and joint-venture companies without being formally guaranteed by the government (Laos separately has a sovereign obligation of about $480m connected to the rail project). In some cases, governments may not even know the full extent of loans for which they may one day find themselves responsible.
The pace of China’s BRI lending has slowed considerably in recent years (the AidData research covers loans through to 2017). But there is little indication that China plans to change the way it works with debtor countries. Many of China’s BRI loans are agreed with poor countries at commercial interest rates and often include collateral obligations (such as proceeds from the sale of natural resources), neither of which is true of conventional development financing. China typically deals with unpaid debts by extending the terms of a loan rather than taking a haircut on the principal—“kicking the can down the road”, as Scott Morris of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington, puts it. Sometimes the Chinese side takes a big equity stake in projects where debtors have fallen behind on payments. A decision in 2017 to assume control of a port in Sri Lanka led to charges of “debt-trap diplomacy”.
In debt-ridden Laos, a Chinese state-owned company has already assumed control of another piece of infrastructure, part of the electric grid. But Matt Mingey of Rhodium Group, a research firm, says the railway is an example of how a Chinese infrastructure loan can be not so much a “hidden” liability as a complicated one. The joint venture that owes China $3.6bn is already majority-owned by three Chinese state-owned firms, making the project akin to a Chinese one that happens to be in a foreign country. If the railway proves to be a financial flop, it may be China on the hook, not Laos. The “hidden debt”, then, would be one that China owes to itself. That should be simple enough to resolve.■

1657,"THE TALIBAN prevent girls from going to secondary school in Afghanistan. Yet the country’s ambassador to America is a woman. That is not because the group has decided that women’s rights are a good thing after all. It is just that they cannot replace her. No country yet recognises the Islamic Emirate established by the Taliban. Afghanistan’s embassies still represent the old government, which fell in August.
In capitals across the world, they fly the old black-red-and-green tricolour. They stamp documents with the old emblem. There have been some changes, however. The embassy in Athens has taken down photos of Ashraf Ghani, the deposed president. Diplomats may remain loyal to their old government, but not to their old leader. They look to Amrullah Saleh, the former vice-president who has vowed to continue fighting.

Unsurprisingly, the embassies get no money from the Taliban-run government. Instead, they rely on fees for consular services. That hardly covers the bills, even in countries with big Afghan populations in need of paperwork. Embassies have had to lay off staff. Few of those who remain are being paid. To save money, embassies are extending old passports rather than printing new ones. “We have to cut down on everything,” says Khaled Zekriya, the ambassador to Italy. That includes water and electricity.
When the Taliban last held power, from 1996 to 2001, they asked to represent the country at the UN. The committee charged with making a recommendation diplomatically deferred a decision, and the previous government, run by rival guerrillas, kept the seat throughout. Meanwhile, the Taliban ran an unofficial office in Queens, New York. The embassy in Washington continued to be run by their rivals too, until 1997 when the second-in-command swore allegiance to the Taliban and took over. After that, America “temporarily” suspended operations at the embassy.
The Taliban have again begun trying to represent Afghanistan on the international stage. A member of the new government tried to set up a video call with Afghan ambassadors but most declined, says Mr Zekriya. Last week the group requested Afghanistan’s seat at the UN. The committee in charge, which also has to decide who should represent Myanmar after the army took power in a coup in February, sidestepped the issue. For now most host countries are encouraging the embassies to stay open under the old government. They want Afghan migrants and refugees to have access to consular services. And they are in no rush to reward the Taliban by establishing diplomatic ties.
Some Afghan diplomats are hoping that the war against the Taliban is not yet over. Others are lining up new jobs in their host countries. Few want to return to a place ruled by pious thugs. Embassy staff are used to helping asylum-seekers with applications. Now many are preparing their own paperwork.",2
1658,"ON SUNDAY September 5th a couple of hundred protesters huddled beneath the Monument to the Constitution in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, holding hand-made signs. Most were in their mid-twenties. Taking turns to use a microphone they condemned Nayib Bukele, the 40-year-old president. Nearly all of them covered their faces, less for fear of catching covid-19 than of being identified by the police who took photographs of the event.
They were out on the streets to decry a ruling by the Supreme Court two days earlier that presidents can run for a second consecutive term. That allows Mr Bukele to stand in 2024, and appears to go against the constitution. Daniel, a 28-year-old graphic designer, attended the protest with his mother, holding a sign that read “Bukele Fascista”. He had voted for Mr Bukele, but now feels that “the constitution is being trampled upon.”

The ruling is the latest power grab by Mr Bukele. In February New Ideas, his party, won a supermajority in legislative elections. Since then he has taken over the judiciary. Five judges from the Supreme Court’s constitutional chamber were sacked in May and replaced by sympathisers; they were the ones who ruled that he could run again. On August 31st the Legislative Assembly passed a series of bills, including one that boots out all judges over the age of 60 or with 30 years of service under their belts. Mr Bukele can now replace them—up to a third of the judiciary.
But on the other side of the city from the protest, in Plaza Morazán in downtown San Salvador, few were bothered by Mr Bukele’s undemocratic tendencies or the intricacies of the judicial system. When Mr Bukele was mayor of the capital, from 2015 to 2018, he cleaned up the plaza and the downtown area, which used to be controlled by gangs. Dorian Martínez, a waiter in a café there, feels that the president has been “successful in most things”, and is different from previous politicians. He praises his ability to get a hospital built during the pandemic. “I would vote for him a second time,” he says. “Imagine what he could achieve.”
More of Mr Martínez’s compatriots seem to agree with him than with the protesters, who turned out in slightly larger numbers on September 7th. The president’s approval rating has hovered at around 90% since he took power in 2019, by far the highest of any leader in Latin America, and possibly the world.

Many Salvadoreans say that Mr Bukele has made their lives better. They point to new roads, food handouts and safer neighbourhoods. Some credit him with bringing down murder rates, which started to fall well before he took over (see chart). Though many suspect Mr Bukele’s government of negotiating with gang members (as previous governments also did), he denies this. On August 23rd El Faro, a digital newspaper, revealed that officials had secretly met imprisoned gang members over the past year, allegedly to keep crime low in exchange for better prison conditions.
Mr Bukele’s popularity is not the only thing that has given him cover for his astonishingly quick takeover of the state. Salvadoreans lack faith in democracy, thanks in large part to the corruption and poor governance of the two parties that had alternated in power since the end of the civil war in 1992. Mr Bukele promised to shake up that duopoly with New Ideas, which was registered as a party only in 2018.
It also helps that the president is a masterful self-publicist. The Supreme Court judgment happened just a few days before El Salvador became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender, alongside US dollars. The move is not terribly popular—in one survey over two-thirds did not want to be paid in crypto. But it has attracted headlines around the world (although the rollout was a shambles). Mr Bukele has been frantically tweeting about the cryptocurrency, of which the country has bought hundreds of tokens (spending around $30m). By contrast he stayed silent about the Supreme Court’s decision.
Meanwhile Mr Bukele’s control of the judicial system means that it would be impossible to mount a legal challenge, says Ruth López, a lawyer at Cristosal, a human-rights organisation in El Salvador, even if the rulings and sackings are illegal. The electoral authority has said it will abide by the court’s decision to allow the president to run for a second consecutive term, although one of its officials expressed surprise at the decision.
Uncle Sam’s quandary
The United States appears to be hamstrung in how it deals with the president of a country of just 6.5m people. President Joe Biden’s administration has condemned Mr Bukele; the American ambassador to El Salvador likened him to Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s late dictator. Officials in Washington may be able to exert some economic pressure, perhaps by pressing for conditions on an IMF loan worth $1bn that is in the works. The State Department stopped supporting the attorney-general’s office after the incumbent was ousted in May.
Yet the United States is battling a migrant crisis of Central Americans on its southern border. Over 2m Salvadoreans now live in the United States, up from 700,000 in 2000. Mr Biden’s team would rather not risk destabilising the country, causing more people to flee. On August 27th it donated equipment including eight helicopters to El Salvador’s armed forces, who are loyal to Mr Bukele.
Some may take comfort in a poll which showed Mr Bukele’s approval rating at 87%. Although still ridiculously high, that is the lowest it has been since he took office. But with the levers of power now under his control, and $30 of free bitcoin to any Salvadorean who signs up to the crypto service (the equivalent of about three days on minimum wages) the millennial caudillo can afford not to please everyone.■",2
1659,"TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is in talks to sell the Paris-based robotics business behind its Pepper android to Germany's United Robotics Group, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters, scaling back a business it once touted as a major growth driver.
The talks are ongoing and plans could change, said two sources familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as they are not permitted to speak to the media. It is not clear whether SoftBank will retain a stake in the business, nor how much the deal would be worth.
United Robotics Group, which is backed by German industrial robot maker Hahn, became the European master distributor for SoftBank's (9984.T) struggling Pepper and Nao robots in October.
United Robotics declined to comment. SoftBank has said it remains committed to the Pepper business.
Reuters reported in June that SoftBank had stopped production of Pepper and slashed jobs at its robotics business globally. Roughly half of 330 staff positions were cut in France, where operations date back to the 2012 acquisition of start-up Aldebaran, which custom-designed Pepper for SoftBank.
Additional staff have quit because of low morale, forcing SoftBank to advertise positions to fill core functions, according to the sources and a review of job postings.
United Robotics has offices in Germany and Austria, according to its website. Recently departed SoftBank staff in areas such as sales have been hired by the company, according to the sources.
SoftBank, which is riven by a culture divide between its European workforce and Japanese managers, has a dwindling stock of aging Pepper units and components approaching obsolescence, Reuters reported previously.
In addition to selling Pepper and Nao, a small humanoid robot, United Robotics also markets robots like Sawyer, an industrial robot that can operate alongside humans.
The restructuring comes as SoftBank focuses on selling third party hardware following the commercial failure of Pepper.
The conglomerate has created a parallel sales operation in Britain, reducing its reliance on the Paris-based business.
SoftBank engineers in France have been working on a secret project to design a serving robot called Plato, according to the sources and documents reviewed by Reuters.
However, managers in Japan have put off ordering the robot, the sources said. At the same time, SoftBank has struck deals to sell similar robots from outside firms, diminishing the commercial viability of its own product.",3
1660,"“RUSSIA IS ABOUT bears now, it’s not about bullies.” So joked Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, this week, speaking about the crisis in Europe’s natural-gas market. His country favours stability and lower prices over runaway prices, he insisted: “We would prefer to have here a bear market.”
Russia is responding to a view gaining currency in European capitals that Gazprom, the state-controlled energy goliath that is the continent’s biggest supplier, has been stoking the continent’s energy crisis by withholding exports of natural gas. European parliamentarians are demanding that Gazprom be investigated for not shipping more gas, allegedly as a ploy to secure final regulatory approval for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline designed to ship Russian gas to Germany.

The Cassandras get it half right. Europe is indeed mired in an energy crisis. The price of natural gas has skyrocketed of late across Europe. This has led to panic in Britain, where the government is now considering offering subsidies and other state support for steel, chemicals and other heavy energy users. On October 12th E.ON, a German energy firm, took the extraordinary step of suspending new gas-supply contracts for residential customers.
Worse yet, the continent looks headed for a bleak winter with a possibility of severe gas and power shortages. Matt Drinkwater of Argus Media, an industry publisher, observes that official forecasters are concerned that the La Niña weather phenomenon may produce an especially harsh winter not only in north-west Europe but also in north-east Asia and North America, which would spark further global competition for energy.
Europe’s stores of natural gas were well above the five-year average at the start of 2021, but a long winter combined with lower production in Norway and Britain (in part due to pandemic-related snags) means storage is now at worrying levels. Edward Morse of Citigroup, an American bank, predicts that if this winter is indeed a bitter one, those stores could run out.
Fuel switching was an option in the past, but that is difficult now. For example, green activism has stymied Europe’s nuclear development. James Huckstepp of S Global Platts Analytics, a research firm, notes that the region “can’t flip back to coal plants easily because some of them have been closed—and the rest made unattractive because of carbon policies.” And as recent painful episodes of low wind and depleted hydroelectric reserves across parts of Europe have made clear, renewable energy is not yet a reliable substitute for gas.
Using less gas will be difficult, at least in the short term. But is it possible for Europe to get hold of more gas? One way is to try to bully Russia into exporting more. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently praised Norway for helping with the gas crisis, but pointed an accusing finger at the Kremlin: “This does not seem to be the case in Russia.” But analysts reckon that the gas giant is actually exporting more gas to Europe this year than it did before the pandemic, and its big continental customers have recently confirmed that it is meeting its contractual obligations. There is little hard evidence that Russia is a big factor in Europe’s current gas crisis.
Another possible way to boost supply would be to increase imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship. Over the past two decades, Europe’s strategy of reducing reliance on Gazprom led to big investments in LNG, which now makes up some 20% of the continent’s gas (up from none a few decades ago). When the global gas market was well supplied a few years ago, Europe enjoyed low gas prices thanks to access to surplus cargoes. But the combination of stagnant investment in new production and a sudden spike in global gas demand linked to the global economic recovery has led to a mad scramble for LNG of late.

That has some in Europe pointing, with a bit more justification, to another foreign bogeyman. Mr Morse notes “a tendency among European officials to put the blame on China”. LNG imports have shot up in the Pacific region, with mainland imports soaring by 25% of late. Cargoes from America and the Middle East are spurning European ports, lured by the hefty price premium offered by Asian buyers. One advantage they have is explicit state support. In China, energy-security concerns have led officials to ensure adequate winter supplies “at all costs”.
The other advantage they have, explains Michael Stoppard of IHS Markit, a research firm, is that most Asian gas is still procured on long-term contracts linked to the oil price—a practice Europe abandoned as it liberalised gas markets. Since Asian buyers are hedged, they feel less pain than do European counterparts fully exposed to today’s astronomical prices. Mr Putin has, with some justification, ridiculed Europe’s embrace of “market-based” pricing for gas as the work of some “smart alecs” at the European Commission, and suggested that Gazprom stands ready to revive the old-fashioned type of oil-linked contract.
In the end, no foreign bogeyman offers a satisfying explanation for Europe’s gas crisis. There is another plausible, albeit controversial, explanation found closer to home: the continent’s headlong rush to decarbonise its energy system. Mr Morse argues that what Europe’s leaders are hiding from on the eve of the UN’s big climate summit next month in Scotland is the first crisis of the energy transition. As it shifts away from fossil and nuclear power and embraces renewables, the region has not properly dealt with the need for redundancy on the grid. America has such problems too, but he notes that it is self-sufficient in energy. Europe is far from it. ■

1661,"AFTER BARELY four tumultuous years of revolutionary government, Thomas Sankara was gunned down in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso’s capital, in 1987, during a coup. It was hatched by his erstwhile best friend, Blaise Compaoré, who has said that he did not order the killing, but who then ran the show until he in turn was turfed out after an uprising in 2014. Since 2015 this poor, arid country of 22m has wobbled along more or less democratically.
In the past few years, however, a wave of jihadist violence across the five countries of the Sahel (the others are Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger) has washed over Burkina Faso, too, giving everyone the jitters. So what is the point of the trial, which opened on October 11th in Ouagadougou, of 14 men accused of being involved in the killing of Mr Sankara and a dozen or so of his comrades all those years ago, seeing that the chief defendant, Mr Compaoré, is snug in exile next door, in Ivory Coast?

Another leading defendant, Hyacinthe Kafando, Mr Compaoré’s security chief, is also abroad. But Mr Compaoré’s right-hand man, General Gilbert Diendéré, sat dressed in camouflage among the other 12 accused in the packed courtroom, not far from the families of the victims of the coup, including Mariam Sankara, the late president’s widow. “We are expecting justice to be done,” she says. “It is unfortunate that all the accused are not here.”
Sankara, a self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist and admirer of Fidel Castro and Muammar Qaddafi, is still revered in left-wing circles across Africa for his firebrand populism and fierce hostility to the West. He was especially critical of France, his country’s former ruler. Aged 33 when he took power, he promptly changed the country’s name from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (The Land of Upright People). He expropriated feudal landholdings, promoted education and health care (with mass-vaccination programmes), opposed female genital mutilation and forced marriage, urged reforestation and rejected foreign aid (“He who feeds you, controls you”), rebuffing the IMF and railing against corruption and capitalism.
He also banned political opposition, muzzled the media, clobbered trade unions, terrified much of the country’s small, beleaguered middle class and summarily executed a clutch of figures tied to the previous regime. He set up Cuban-style “committees for the defence of the revolution” and “popular revolutionary tribunals” that sometimes chastised people for “laziness”. Pioneers of the Revolution, his youth movement, wore berets like Che Guevara. Many Africans liken Sankara to Che. Whether this is a compliment or an insult depends on one’s view of handsome, violent Marxists.
“He was dedicated to everything he did. He sacrificed everything to serve his people,” says Pierre Ouedraogo, an old friend who presides over a memorial in his name. “Most African intellectuals think first about themselves, but he thought about the people first,” he says. Sankara’s friends and fans in Ouagadougou hope the trial will expose the murky details of Mr Compaoré’s plot to oust him, punish the alleged assassins and so bring belated comfort to the families of those who were killed.
Less clear is whether details of France’s suspected involvement in Sankara’s demise will be revealed. Brian Peterson, a biographer of Sankara, doubts there will be a smoking gun implicating any foreign powers. “This will disappoint many people,” he says. If France were candid about what happened, the trial could help to redefine its relations with Burkina Faso “as a partner, not as imperialist overlord”. President Emmanuel Macron may not agree.
Some reckon the current president, Roch Kaboré, will try to use the trial to boost his own government’s popularity, which has been waning in part because of its failure to fend off the growing jihadist insurgency linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State. Thousands have perished and more than a million have been displaced. Moreover, Mr Compaoré still has a following in the country, especially in the army. So it is not certain that bringing him to book, even in absentia, will enhance national reconciliation, as the government claims.
The insurgency caused 335 civilian deaths in May, June, July and August, up from 80 in the previous four months. Both sides have committed atrocities. “The Sankara trial should not be made to bear the sole burden for tackling Burkina Faso’s long-held culture of impunity,” says Corinne Dufka of Human Rights Watch. ■",2
1662,"“AMERICA WAS defeated,” Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s spokesman, declared at Kabul airport on August 31st. Hours earlier the last American soldiers in Afghanistan had trudged onto a cargo plane and flown home, leaving their client state in ruins and their enemies in charge. Celebratory gunfire echoed around the city. But Mr Mujahid was circumspect in victory: “We want to have good relations with the US and the world.”
The US and the world, though, are playing it cool. On August 30th the UN Security Council issued a list of demands to the Taliban. The first was that they should combat terrorism: an implicit rebuke of their alliance with al-Qaeda, a terrorist group. Another was that they should respect human rights and form an “inclusive” government “with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women”. The third was a warning that the Taliban should allow free emigration; tens of thousands of Afghans eligible for resettlement abroad have been left behind.

The Taliban are eager to shed their old image as theocratic brutes. Yet they are not rushing to meet these conditions. On the same day that diplomats met in New York, Amin al-Haq, a former security chief for Osama bin Laden, returned triumphantly to his home in Nangarhar province, no longer afraid of American drones. The Taliban’s proposed cabinet is not just insular, but so dominated by southern Talibs that it has “enraged the easterners and northerners” in the movement, says Antonio Giustozzi of King’s College London.
The West’s hope is that a mix of carrot and stick can induce better behaviour. Aid to Afghanistan previously ran to $8.5bn a year, or 42% of GDP. Less than $800m of that, spent on humanitarian projects, is likely to survive. The World Bank and the IMF have suspended financing, and America has frozen $7bn in Afghan foreign reserves held in New York. At home, the Taliban can raise $3bn annually at best, says one expert. They will have smaller outgoings than the old regime—they will not need to bankroll such a bloated army—but they will still face a crunch, and an acute shortage of dollars. A weakening currency is already causing prices to rise.
On August 24th Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, boasted that the G7, a club of rich countries, had “huge leverage” over the Taliban. In fact, the two sides are co-dependent. Around 200 Americans and over 100 Britons remain in Afghanistan, along with large numbers of vulnerable Afghans. Getting them out requires not only the assent of the Taliban, who have said they want to discourage emigration, but also a functioning airport. Qatar, which hosts the Taliban’s political office in Doha, currently has a technical team at the airport, and, along with Turkey, is in talks with the Taliban to reopen and run it. Yet this cannot happen without the Taliban dropping their opposition to a foreign military presence.
There may also be pragmatic deals to be done on counter-terrorism. Though the Taliban remain close to al-Qaeda, they detest Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), a jihadist outfit which killed over 170 Afghans and 13 American troops on August 26th. During its evacuation from Kabul, America quietly slipped intelligence to the Taliban about ISKP, according to an American general, and the Taliban thwarted some attacks. It may be America that is soon in need of the intelligence; a drone strike targeting ISKP on August 29th is reported to have killed ten Afghan civilians. Yet co-operation with the Taliban would be awkward, if not legally tricky.
For the Taliban, the West is not the only purveyor of cash, recognition and co-operation. Qatari and Turkish involvement suggests that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, their rivals, cannot be far behind. Pakistani sources say that recognition of the Taliban is not yet on the cards, but they urge the West not to cut off the group entirely. One official acknowledges that recognition and aid should be conditional on behaviour, but insists that the group is not as autarkic as it once was: “They realise that to make a government and run a country, they need international support. It can’t be run like North Korea.”
Notably, China and Russia both abstained from the UN Security Council Resolution on August 30th. Behind the scenes, they argued it was unnecessary and diluted its language to ease pressure on the Taliban, says Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank headquartered in Brussels. Russia publicly criticised the scale of America’s evacuation, describing it as a “brain drain”.
China’s interests in Afghanistan—political stability and counter-terrorism, particularly against Uyghur militants—are not dissimilar to those of America, says Andrew Small of the German Marshall Fund, a think-tank in Washington. On August 28th Yue Xiaoyong, China’s envoy to Afghanistan, demanded that the Taliban make a “clean break with all terrorist organisations”. Yet his government is undoubtedly keener than the West to move ahead with diplomatic recognition. “We are pleased to see that all forces from different traditions, tribes, nationalities or political parties have come together,” said Mr Yue. (They have not).
Some sceptics have fallen in line. India, which views the Taliban as a proxy of Pakistan, sent a diplomat to meet Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the head of the Taliban’s political office, in Doha on August 31st—India’s first ever official meeting with the group. Officials from Britain and the Netherlands made the same trip.
Sir Nicholas Kay, a former British ambassador to Afghanistan, says he doubts that the Taliban have changed much at all, but he urges Britain to re-establish a diplomatic presence in Kabul, if not a full-blown embassy. “We test what they say by their actions, but engaging is very important,” he adds. “We ought to be a great deal more realistic and humble than we have been over the last 20 years about our ability to influence Kabul.”■",2
1663,"APOSTOLIS, A RETIRED Greek-Cypriot dentist aged 78, tours his former clinic in Varosha, now a derelict shell of a building, for the first time in nearly half a century. His friend Despo wipes away tears in front of her grandfather’s old shop, where she would park her bike after school. Varosha was once home to some 39,000 Greek-Cypriots and swarms of tourists. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton strolled on its beaches. Four young Swedes, later known as ABBA, gave one of their first concerts here. Now it is a ghost town, overgrown by bushes and trees. Opposite Apostolis’s clinic, painted over the façade of what was once a Greek high school, are a pair of flags, one Turkish, the other belonging to the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (TRNC), set up after the island was split by a Turkish invasion in 1974 into Greek and Turkish portions.
Fenced off since the invasion, when its Greek-Cypriot residents fled the advancing Turkish troops, Varosha was partially reopened earlier this year. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ordered the army to hand the town over to the TRNC. This has allowed visits by Greek-Cypriots living in the southern part of the island, in the Republic of Cyprus, which the outside world considers the legitimate government of the whole place. But it also bolsters the TRNC, which no country but Turkey recognises, and paves the way for the development of property still claimed by displaced Greeks. That, in turn, further complicates the Herculean task of reuniting the island. That was the point: Mr Erdogan and Ersin Tatar, the Turkish-Cypriot leader, have insisted for the past year that a united Cyprus is no longer possible. In New York in September Mr Tatar and Nicos Anastasiades, president of the Republic of Cyprus, seemed to agree that they had nothing to discuss.

Northern Cyprus, home to 450,000 people, has never stood on its own feet. Turkey stations tens of thousands of soldiers in the enclave, props up its economy, and is the main conduit for its foreign trade. Though Turkey has always meddled in the north’s affairs, it has never done so as much as now. “Ankara treats us like one of its districts,” says Ozdil Nami, a former TRNC foreign minister. A new low came last year, when officials and goons dispatched by Turkey endorsed Mr Tatar, an Erdogan loyalist, ahead of presidential elections and threatened his opponents, including Mustafa Akinci, the incumbent. Mr Tatar won the vote by a sliver. “Those people”, he says at his residence, referring to the politicians and journalists who accused Turkey of interfering in the elections, “are traitors.”
Echoing Mr Erdogan, Mr Tatar says he has no faith in a proposed federal model, which would bring north and south under one roof, and that the only way forward is to keep the island divided. Yet analysts and diplomats say a two-state solution is a pipedream. Not even Turkey’s closest allies would want to jeopardise relations with the EU, of which Cyprus is a member, by recognising the north.
The risk is that a botched campaign for sovereignty would put Northern Cyprus on a slippery slope to full annexation by Turkey. That is not an outcome Turkish-Cypriots want. The vast majority of them welcomed the Turkish invasion in 1974, which foiled an attempt by a Greek junta to unite the island with Greece. They feel close to Turkey. But they also have a separate identity. Many are alarmed by Turkey’s authoritarian turn. Settlers from Turkey, who began arriving after the invasion and are now about a third of the north’s population, are a lot keener on Mr Erdogan.
Greek-Cypriots are also alarmed. “If we don’t find a solution, we'll end up having a border with Turkey, which for us is a worst-case scenario,"" says a senior Cypriot official. But they also have themselves to blame for the stalemate. It was Mr Anastasiades and his team who reportedly got cold feet during the most recent reunification talks, in 2017. And it was Greek-Cypriot voters who rejected a settlement in a referendum back in 2004, on the eve of the country’s accession to the EU.
There is room for hope. A big offshore energy find could breathe new life into the talks, though it could also trigger a standoff between Turkey, Cyprus, Greece and the EU. Turkey’s push for a two-state solution could be a ploy intended to rattle the Greek-Cypriots. But facts on the ground will be hard to undo. “We might have reached a point where it’s no longer possible to put the island back together again,” says Fiona Mullen of Sapienta Economics, a consultancy in Nicosia, the capital. “Varosha may be the final nail in the coffin.” ■",2
1664,"BARBARA GOMES has almost completed her doctorate in biomedicine at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), one of the best in Brazil. Jobs are scarce and the best she has been able to find is a substitute teaching position at the university that pays around 4,000 reais ($760) a month. For her experiments on a protein associated with mad-cow disease, however, she needs reagents that that university cannot always afford and that cost more than her salary. As a result she, like many of her cohort, wants to leave Brazil. Her plan to move to France was scuppered by the pandemic, but when she finishes her doctorate, she will go: “If I want to work in science, I must leave the country.”
Brazilian emigration to OECD countries has been rising for years, but took off especially in 2017, growing by 24% from the previous year. Nearly 30% of all Brazilians living in OECD countries have a university education. In the past two years, applications by Brazilian skilled workers for permanent visas in the United States, the main destination for those leaving Brazil, rose by 30% to the highest level in at least ten years.

The exodus is mainly the result of economic instability left over from the recession of 2014-16. But it has been worsened by the populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, who sees academics as enemies. His guru, Olavo de Carvalho, has said that Brazil’s universities are hives of drugs, orgies and communist propaganda. The federal science-funding agency’s budget has dropped by nearly half since 2000, while the government is pouring money into sending members of the armed forces, often supporters of Mr Bolsonaro, to study abroad.
The UFRJ has enough money to keep its doors open only until September; after that it may have to close labs and restrict some classes to online. At least six professors who criticised the president’s actions during the pandemic, which has so far killed more than 540,000 Brazilians, were investigated by the government.
“Being in a country that has daily attacks on science is very discouraging,” says Ana Carneiro, a professor who studies the Brazilian diaspora at UNICAMP, a university in the state of São Paulo. But it is not new. During the dictatorship of 1964-85, for which Mr Bolsonaro is nostalgic, academics were among the thousands exiled. The military government had a slogan: “Brazil: love it or leave it.”
After starting to trim the bloated public-pension system in 2019, Mr Bolsonaro has abandoned attempts at the economic reforms required for a return to growth. The country was still struggling from the recession when the pandemic hit. With only 17% of Brazilians fully vaccinated, economic normality still seems distant. Despite a generous public financial-aid programme last year, poverty tripled. GDP in the first quarter exceeded expectations, but Brazil must still tackle unemployment at 14.7%, a record high. Half of all young people say they would leave if they could.
It is not long ago that Brazil offered young researchers fairer prospects. Between 2003 and 2016 successive governments led by the Workers’ Party, under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, set up 18 new universities (some from satellite campuses of existing institutions). In 2015 Brazil outpaced countries like Russia and Mexico in its spending on science, technology and innovation.
Yet even when Brazil was investing in education, there were snags. The Ciência Sem Fronteiras (“Science without Borders”) programme inaugurated in 2011 by Ms Rousseff, then president, sent almost 100,000 Brazilians to study in more than 30 countries over six years. But when they returned, there was no policy for what to do with them, says Ms Carneiro. When the programme was still running, a quarter of scholarship recipients said they intended to pursue a career outside Brazil.
By exporting scientists and their innovations, Brazil is losing the chance to build technological heft at home. More than a quarter of GDP still comes from agriculture. Cuts in scholarships that began under Ms Rousseff’s successor, Michel Temer, have deepened under Mr Bolsonaro. After Ms Rousseff’s disastrous stewardship of the economy led to recession, the newer government-funded universities saw their budgets slashed. The Federal University of Cariri in the state of Ceará, in the poor north-east, was founded in 2013, but has lost more than 80% of its government research grants in the past four years.
The foreign ministry recently set up a programme called Innovation Diplomacy to try to link Brazilians abroad with the mother country, in order to boost trade and investment back home. But its goals are ill-defined. And many of those planning to leave are likely to stay away until the situation in Brazil improves. “I wish I didn’t have to go,” says Ms Gomes. “But there’s nothing here for me.” ■",2
1665,"ROME, July 13 (Reuters) - Italy on Tuesday banned cruise liners from Venice lagoon to defend its ecosystem and heritage, moving to end years of hesitation and putting the demands of residents and culture bodies above those of the tourist industry.
The government decided to act after the United Nations culture organisation UNESCO threatened to put Italy on a blacklist for not banning liners from the World Heritage site, cabinet sources said.
The ban will take effect from Aug. 1, barring ships weighing more than 25,000 tonnes from the shallow Giudecca Canal that leads past Piazza San Marco, the city's most famous landmark.
""I am proud of a commitment that had been honoured,"" Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said in a tweet announcing the cabinet's approval of the decree, confirming a previous Reuters report.
The legislation, which is likely to affect the business of cruise companies such as Carnival Cruises (CCL.N), provides compensation for firms and workers involved, a culture ministry statement said.
Carnival cruises was not immediately available to comment.
Venice residents and the international community have been urging governments for years to ban large ships passing through the lagoon, polluting and threatening the stability of its buildings and fragile ecosystem.
Such concerns clash with the interests of port authorities and tourist operators who say the city needs the business offered by the cruise industry.
The 25,000-ton threshold will mean only small passenger ferries and goods vessels can use the Giudecca, excluding all cruise liners which typically weigh at least four times as much and can reach more than 200,000 tons.
Francesco Galietti, Italian director of the international cruise industry trade association CLIA, said the group welcomed an alternative route for cruise ships and he called the latest government move ""a major step forward"".
NO DOCKING POINT
Rome has passed legislation numerous times in the past to limit liners' access to one of the world's most famous tourist sites, but an alternative docking point is not yet ready.
Residents protested in June when the 92,000 tonne MSC Orchestra sailed through the lagoon en route for Croatia and Greece, attracting the attention of international media.  read more 
In April, Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government approved a decree to build a terminal outside the lagoon where passenger vessels over 40,000 tons and container ships can berth. The call for bids to build the terminal was published on June 29.
In the meantime, large boats were told to dock at the industrial port of Marghera, but this intermediate solution is not yet ready because Marghera lacks a suitable docking point for liners.
The government's decree appoints a special commissioner to fast-track the docking station at Marghera.
Alessandro Santi, who heads Federagenti, a national shipping lobby, said the government was taking no account of the industry with an approach that was ""regrettable and creates resentment"".
He accused Rome of listening to UNESCO and international culture lobbyists while ignoring local ""citizens and business people"".
""Limiting the passage of ships won't solve the difficulties of Venice as a city,"" he said.",3
1666,"THABANI NKOMONYE was last seen alive on May 8th. A few days later the body of the 25-year-old law student was found in a field near Manzini in Eswatini. The police say he died in a car crash. Friends and family say the police killed him.
Mr Nkomonye’s death has sparked protests across the country of 1.2m people. On June 29th, after demonstrations intensified, the government announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew and shut off the internet. Swazi journalists say that doctors have confirmed at least 50 deaths at the hands of security forces. The government says that 27 people have died and that its forces were defending themselves and private property against “rioters and foreign agents”.

In many ways the protests are like those elsewhere in Africa. “There are no jobs and opportunities for young people,” says Xolani Maseko, the president of the union of students. More than 46% of 15- to 24-year-olds are unemployed, the third-highest rate in the world. What distinguishes Eswatini is the protests’ target, King Mswati III, Africa’s last absolute monarch.
That he rules at all is a historical curiosity. Britain, the colonial power, left in 1968, perfunctorily bequeathing a Westminster-style system. Five years later the then king, Sobhuza II, revoked the constitution and declared “supreme power”. After Sobhuza died in 1982 elders of the ruling Dlamini clan picked as heir his 14-year-old illegitimate son, whom they hoped to control. The future King Mswati III was brought into the royal kraal, says a confidant, and told, “From now on you call your mother ‘Queen Mother’.” She had been a cleaner for one of Sobhuza’s 65 wives, according to a report published in 2013 by Freedom House, an American think-tank. The boy-king was sent to boarding school in England, returning to sit on the throne in 1986.
Though analysts speculate about how much the king himself calls the shots, the monarchy certainly operates unchecked. Mswati is immune from prosecution. Political parties are banned. Opposition activists are jailed. Journalists are intimidated; on July 4th reporters from New Frame, a South African publication, were taken to a police station and allegedly tortured with plastic bags over their heads. The king (pictured on next page) appoints the prime minister and other key office-holders.
Most Swazis are poor but the king’s fortune, which in 2014 Forbes magazine estimated was “at least” $50m, was sufficient to buy a fleet of Rolls-Royces. That does not include Tibiyo, a trust ostensibly held by the monarchy on behalf of the people, but which critics say benefits the royals. It controls tracts of land and, according to Freedom House, has stakes in sugar, manufacturing, property and other firms.
The king has defenders. “Every morning I’m grateful to wake up and see that the king is still on the throne,” says Andre le Roux, a fourth-generation (white) Swazi who runs a timber firm, Montigny, and the main business lobby. His worry is not the monarch, who he says ensures stability, but an “enterprise-throttling” civil service.
Neal Rijkenberg, the founder of Montigny, who was appointed finance minister in 2018, says the country is “surprisingly democratic”. For example, the king must get parliament to approve his budget and must use his own money to pay for posh cars, he argues. What about the 340m lilangeni ($24m) annual stipend? That pays for tourist-pleasing cultural events. And appointing a princess to the cabinet? “There are many children he hasn’t given jobs to.”
Mr Rijkenberg’s appointment, alongside others in a “cabinet of CEOs”, was perhaps a sign of the king’s fears. Manqoba Khumalo, the commerce minister, was poached from Coca-Cola. “It’s like when your mother asks you to do something, but times a thousand,” he says. The king is worried about youth unemployment, he adds. “He didn’t articulate it as a political threat but he probably sees it that way.”
Opponents argue that the king can never be a reformer. “He makes it impossible to run a state professionally, ethically and efficiently,” says Wandile Dludlu of the banned opposition party, PUDEMO. “There is no clear distinction between private and public resources.” Sibongile Mazibuko, another activist, argues that whereas the killing of George Floyd in America was “a white knee on a black neck, here it is a black knee on a black neck.”
“Because it is out of the spotlight, Eswatini gets away with a lot,” says a former diplomat. There are just eight missions in the country. After South Africa, on which Eswatini depends economically, the most important may be Taiwan. Mswati’s government is the last in Africa with which it has diplomatic relations. That has resulted in an upside-down situation in which Taiwan lavishes aid to maintain an autocratic status quo while accusing China of being on the side of pro-democracy activists.
The crackdown may quell protests for a while. But it seems that the king’s popularity is waning. In 2015, according to Afrobarometer, a pollster, 79% of Swazis said they trusted him. Earlier this year the share was 50%. Large majorities said they supported multi-party democracy and wanted to choose their leader, suggesting a preference for, at least, a constitutional monarchy. And the longer his regime silences Swazis, the more likely it is that they will decide they do not need a king at all.■

1667,"“RELIGION IS THE sigh of the oppressed creature…it is the opium of the people.” So wrote Karl Marx in 1844. The idea—not unique to Marx—was that by promising rewards in the next life, religion helps the poor bear their lot in this one.
A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Jana Berkessel of the University of Mannheim, in Germany, and her colleagues takes a statistical look at the claim. Ms Berkessel's curiosity was piqued by a counter-intuitive finding in development economics. Researchers know that low socioeconomic status correlates with poor mental health. The assumption was once that, as places became richer, this effect would weaken. Being poor in a rich country was presumed better than being poor in a poor one.

But that has turned out not to be true. Abundant evidence suggests the relationship between status and mental health is stronger, not weaker, in rich countries than in poor ones. Ms Berkessel, who studies the psychological effects of religion, noticed that economic development is also inversely correlated with religiosity—the richer a country, the more godless it tends to be. Perhaps that was driving the change?
To check, she and her colleagues analysed three surveys covering 3.3m people in 156 countries. This set of data reproduced the finding that economic development amplifies the link between mental health and status. It also supported the idea that religiosity could attenuate that effect. Among rich countries, for instance, those with higher levels of self-reported religious belief had a weaker relationship between status and mental health.
Other evidence buttresses the theory. One study covering 11 European countries, all rich, found the link between personal income and well-being was stronger in irreligious places than devout ones. After much statistical crunching, Ms Berkessel concluded that declining religiosity accounted for about half of the effect of growing wealth on the relationship between status and psychological well-being.
The upshot is that religion seems to protect people from at least some of the unpleasant effects of poverty. Exactly how is less clear. One hypothesis is that religious doctrine is directly protective. After all, many of the world’s biggest religions have a sceptical attitude to wealth. Alongside the well-known biblical verses about camels, needles and a rich person’s chance of entering the pearly gates, the researchers point out that the Bhagavad-Gita, a Hindu holy book, says “The demoniac person thinks: So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more.” Similar sentiments can be found in the Koran and in some Buddhist texts. If God teaches that the wealthy are spiritually corrupt, or will get their comeuppance on Judgment Day, then poverty may seem less of a burden.
But there are other possibilities. Ms Berkessel points out that organised religion offers a social-support network which might help attenuate the effects of low status, whether or not its members really believe everything their holy texts say about wealth. Her next research project, she says, will look at exactly this point.
In the meantime, if religion really does help relieve poverty’s burden, one question is what, if anything, to do with that knowledge. The world is, after all, getting steadily richer, meaning relative poverty’s sting will only get sharper. A cynic might recall another well-known quote about religion, this time from Seneca, a Roman philosopher. “Religion”, he wrote, “is regarded by the common people as true, the wise as false, and the rulers as useful.” ■",2
1668,"DEMOGRAPHY IS NOT quite destiny, but it certainly creates possibilities. A country with a large share of young adults will benefit from a demographic dividend if it can create jobs for them, as South Korea managed to in the 1980s and 1990s. Alternatively, it can become violent and unstable. The surge of military aggression in 19th-century Europe, the rise in homicide beginning in the 1960s and the Arab Spring a decade ago have all been blamed on youth bulges.

Now Britain has one, bucking the trend in the rich world. It is more subtle than those colossal demographic shifts, but is significant nonetheless. The number of 18-year-olds, which fell during the 2010s, has begun to rise sharply. Britain had 715,000 of them in 2020 and expects to have 893,000 in 2030—a 25% increase. It will take a decade for the number to begin to fall again (see chart).

A few other European countries, such as Ireland and Sweden, are going through similar gyrations. But Britain’s youth bulge is much more pronounced than the one in the EU as a whole (where the number of 18-year-olds will grow by a mere 2% between 2020 and 2030) or the one in America. It is product of historic demographic trends and immigration, and is likely to transform the country as it ages.
Britain’s post-war baby boom was odd. Although births jumped immediately after the war, the surge did not endure, as it did in America. Instead, the baby boom really got going in the second half of the 1950s. It peaked in 1964, when 876,000 babies were born. When that large cohort got around to having children, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was another baby boom, known as the “echo boom”. Many of the youngsters alive today are their children—an echo of the echo boom.
Economics and government policy increased the size of the bulge. Real wages rose from the mid-1990s until the financial crisis of 2008, persuading people they could afford to have children. So did immigration, points out David Coleman, a demographer at the University of Oxford. Britain opened its doors to eastern Europeans in 2004, earlier than most other European countries, and got lots of young workers who soon became parents. Between 1991 and 2011 the proportion of births in England and Wales to women born outside Britain doubled to 25%.
Schools have been the first to notice the bulge. There were more than 600,000 applications for secondary schools this year, 16% more than seven years ago. But because births declined after 2012, primary schools are quieter. The number of applicants is the lowest for seven years, meaning 92% of children this year got into their parents’ first-choice school. In east London, Tower Hamlets council is amalgamating primary schools, citing a “sudden fall” in applications.
Universities have been exposed to demographic fluctuations since 2015, when the government abolished caps on the number of students they were allowed to recruit. The youth bulge has just reached them. A combination of higher grades and a large cohort drove up applications from British 18-year-olds by 10% this year. That is nice for them and for the Unite Group, a student-housing firm with 74,000 beds in 173 buildings. Richard Smith, its chief executive, says that he has another 5,000 in the pipeline. But it worries the Treasury, which writes off many student loans.
As the swollen generation enters the workforce, businesses will benefit—beginning with the hospitality industry, which depends on young people. Bars, hotels and restaurants blame their present recruitment difficulties on Brexit, which has reduced the flow of immigrants from continental Europe, and on the indolence engendered by covid-19 lockdowns. But the decade-long decline in 18-year-olds has added to their difficulties. Hiring will soon become easier.
Over the longer term, the bulge of young adults will help support the welfare state. In 2020 Britain had 29 people aged 65 or over for every 100 people aged 15-64, which is almost exactly the same as the European average. The United Nations estimates that in 2050 the ratio in Britain will reach 43 per 100. That will cause difficulties, but Europe as a whole will be in a worse state, with 49 retirees for every 100 working-age people.
The impact on politics will be less pronounced, thinks Will Jennings, a political scientist at the University of Southampton. A rise in the number of young people should help the Labour Party, but only slightly, because the new voters will cluster in the cities and university towns where it is already strong. Besides, he says, it will act only as a “gentle brake” on the overall ageing of the electorate—a more powerful trend, which currently benefits the Conservatives.
Subtly, the bulge will also affect post-mortems on the earthquake that hit Britain in 2016. The big question about the country is how it will be affected by leaving the EU. The most satisfying answer will come not from looking at brief fluctuations in trade, investment and output but from comparing economies over many years. Anybody who attempts to do that must first answer a question, however. Should they control for Britain’s increasingly distinctive demography, and if so, how? ■",2
1669,"Britain's daily Covid cases rose by another 10 per cent today and deaths ticked upwards — but hospitalisations plunged 17 per cent.
Government dashboard data shows 44,242 positive tests were registered in the last 24 hours, a slight uptick from 40,375 last Friday.
Infections have trended upwards every day since November 11 except for one blip, with data suggesting cases are now rising in children following the return of schools from half-term.
Another 157 Covid deaths were also announced by health chiefs, in an eight per cent rise from the same time the previous week. Latest hospitalisation figures showed 827 admissions were recorded on November 15, which was down 17 per cent.
In a promising sign, the Government's scientific advisory group today said that it would take a much bigger rise in cases and rapid and sudden waning of the vaccines for Covid hospital admissions to rise to the level of previous peaks. But SPI-M, the modelling subgroup of SAGE, admitted that the epidemic was becoming increasingly harder to predict. 
It comes after the Office for National Statistics' weekly surveillance report suggested that England's Covid cases dipped by 10 per cent last week. 
The report, based on random swab tests done by thousands of Britons, estimated 824,900 people were infected on any day in the week ending November 13, the equivalent to one in 65 people. This was down slightly from 925,400 previously.
But in a warning sign that the downturn in infections has stalled, No10's top scientific advisers today claimed the R rate remained level between 0.8 and 1.0 last week.  
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He urged people to get their booster vaccines and warned of Europe's spiralling crisis, which saw Austria become the first country to impose another lockdown. 
Despite the growing concerns over the continent's outbreak, top experts are confident Britain won't be forced into cancelling Christmas again. One scientist behind a surveillance study showing cases were ticking upwards said he remained 'optimistic' that festivities could go ahead without any restrictions.
The ONS surveillance report relies on random swabbing of more than 100,000 Britons every week to estimate the prevalence of the virus across the country.
It is seen as the gold-standard method of tracking the country's outbreak by ministers because it is not affected by asymptomatic carriers.
Figures suggest Wales had the highest infection rate in the UK last week, with one in 55 people likely infected with the virus. It was followed by England and Northern Ireland, at one in 65, and Scotland, at one in 95.
Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 63.9 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus, one of the lowest uptakes of the jabs in western Europe. 
When cases were broken down by age groups, figures showed only 11 to 16-year-olds saw a drop in cases last week. Infections flatlined in all other groups.
Meanwhile, No10's top scientists estimated the R rate was still between 0.8 and 1.0, the same as the previous week.
But they said in London and the South East it could now be above the cut-off point and be as high as 1.1, which would mean an outbreak is growing. 
The R rate is a lagging indicator measuring how many infected people are passing the virus on. It reflects the situation on the ground up to three weeks ago, simply because of how it is calculated.
An R below one suggests that for every ten people who catch the virus, they are passing it on to fewer than ten others.
Two separate surveillance reports yesterday suggested Covid cases are now rising in younger age groups, too.
King's College London scientists, who track symptoms instead of tests, also estimated infections dipped 10 per cent overall last week, but they said cases appeared to be trending upwards among under-18s. 
There was still a drop in cases for over-75s, while they flatlined in all other age groups.
And the UK Health Security Agency weekly surveillance report, which is based on Government testing rates, estimated cases rose sharply in over-18s last week. 
It said cases also rose slightly among under-70s, but dipped in older age groups.
Britain's daily Covid cases also appear to be trending upwards, with rises in younger age groups and 50 to 65-year-olds appearing to drive the increase.
Professor Tim Spector, the eminent scientist who leads the King's College study, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' Christmas will be business as usual this year. 
He said: 'In terms of what it means for Christmas, I’m cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year. It’s becoming clear that children and the school holidays play a key role in the waves of infection. 
'I think it’s safe to say that we can expect to see another rise in the new year after the holidays.'
But he still called on all Britons to get fully vaccinated against the virus, as well as ensuring they have their booster doses. And he urged everyone to start using face masks in crowded spaces such as public transport.
This was a softening in his tone from last month when he joined a chorus of experts calling on ministers to switch to Plan B — bringing back hated face masks, social distancing and work from home guidance. 
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He told a Downing Street press conference: 'Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to — non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions — get the boosters.' 
Austria is the first Western nation to mandate vaccines, but it far from the first.
A handful of tinpot dictatorships, smaller nations, and at least one large democracy has already issued vaccine mandates. They are:
Indonesia: President Joko Widodo made jabs mandatory in February this year, with anyone who refuses facing a £250 fine - roughly two months' salary - and being disqualified from receiving state benefits
Tajikistan: From July this year, all adults over the age of 18 were required to get vaccinated by order of the country's Covid task-force. It did not specify a penalty for those who refuse
Turkmenistan: Though dictator Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has refused to acknowledge having a single case in the country, he never-the-less made vaccination mandatory for all over-18s starting in July. Punishments for refusal were not specified 
Micronesia: A small South Pacific island nation, it mandated in July that its adult population had to be inoculated against Covid
New Caledonia: A French dependency also located in the South Pacific, it ordered its entire adult population to get vaccinated starting in September 
It comes after Austria today made Covid vaccines compulsory for all residents and imposed a full nationwide lockdown.
Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that all 8.9million residents will need to have received both doses of the Covid vaccine or face 'penalties' by February 1. It is assumed under-12s are exempt from the requirement, as they are not currently being offered jabs in the country.
Lockdown measures in the country will see everyone barred from leaving their homes from Monday, with all non-essential shops closed along with most workplaces and schools.
Previously only unvaccinated residents had been barred from leaving their homes, or attending the workplace or schools.
Some 66 per cent of Austrians are vaccinated against the virus. This is just below the 67 per cent average for the EU, and the UK where 68 per cent are double-jabbed. 
It is not the first country to make vaccines compulsory. Indonesia required all adults to get jabbed back in February, followed by dictatorships Turkmenistan and Tajikistan in July. Dozens of other countries, including many western nations, require specific groups — such as healthcare workers — to be fully inoculated. 
Speaking today, Schallenberg said: 'For a long time there was consensus in this country that we do not want vaccinations to be compulsory.
'For a long time, maybe too long, it was assumed that it would be possible to achieve a high vaccination rate even without an obligation. Now we have to face reality.
'Whipped up by radical anti-vaxxers, by fake news, too many among us didn't get vaccinated. The results are overcrowded intensive care units and enormous suffering,' he added, accusing the un-jabbed of launching an 'attack on the health system.' 
Ireland, which imposed a night-time curfew on hospitality businesses this week, has today placed its hospitals on a 'war footing' with routine operations cancelled to make room for Covid patients amid a warning from the country's top doctor that intensive care medics face 'unthinkable' choices over who to give care to.
And Germany's incoming Chancellor Olaf Scholz said almost 30 million vaccines need to be administered before the end of the year to ward off the worst effects of the winter wave, which would require the country to more-than double the number of shots it currently gives each day.
He spoke a day after Germany put forward new rules that would restrict the movements of unvaccinated people in states where hospital admissions are high. 
The new three-tier system would require people to show evidence of a vaccination or previous infection to enter public buildings or businesses in states where hospitalisation rates go above 3 in 100,000 people, based on a seven-day average. At present, that will affect 9 of Germany's 16 states.
It comes as the NHS app is being updated to show proof of booster jabs in a move which could save Christmas travel plans for the elderly and vulnerable.
It will appear on the travel section of the Covid pass, allowing Britons to visit parts of Europe which now require evidence of a third dose.
While the new feature will initially be limited to travel, it could also make it easier for the UK Government to make the third jab compulsory in domestic circumstances. 
Boris Johnson warned on Monday that the concept of full vaccination would need to be adjusted – with a third jab becoming part of it.
Almost 14million Britons have had the booster but the goal is to administer 40million to people over the age of 40. Younger adults may also be offered the jabs in the near future.
A small but growing number of countries, including Switzerland, Croatia and Israel, are now requesting proof of boosters for arrivals vaccinated many months ago.
France has indicated that proof of a third jab will be required for over-65s to access most venues from December 15.
Austria had required proof of a booster but announced today it is going into a full nationwide lockdown from Monday. The move, which comes just days after the Government imposed a lockdown only for the unvaccinated, makes Austria the first Western European to retreat back into a draconian shutdown since the summer.
A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs.",-2
1670,"IN 1968 A GRAVE dating from about 1100 was uncovered near Hattula, in Finland. Little remained of the occupant’s skeleton, but the inhumation included two swords and a sheathed knife. Such grave goods would normally suggest said occupant was a man. The skeleton was, however, also adorned with brooches and woollen clothing of types more usually worn at the time by women. This led to speculation that the burial was actually of a powerful woman, possibly a local ruler in her own right rather than just the wife of a male monarch.
This would be noteworthy enough. But a re-examination of the remains, just published in the European Journal of Archaeology by Ulla Moilanen of the University of Turku and Elina Salmela of the University of Helsinki, suggests the truth may be yet more intriguing. Ms Moilanen and Dr Salmela suspect that the individual in question may have had outward characteristics of both a man and a woman.

In 1968 working out the sex of a skeleton in an ancient grave was tricky. After years of deterioration, the bones of men and women look pretty-much alike. But that was before the use of DNA became possible. So Ms Moilanen and Dr Salmela thought it worth trying again.
Most people have two sex chromosomes: XX in women and XY in men. Find DNA from a Y-chromosome in a skeleton and the chances are the body in question was male. And, looking at a fragment of femur brought to her by Ms Moilanen, who is the archaeologist in the collaboration, Dr Salmela, who is the geneticist, did indeed find such DNA. But not much of it. That led her to wonder about contamination, but also to consider whether the individual in the grave had had an extra X-chromosome that was swamping the signal from the Y.
Having an anomalous number of sex chromosomes is rare, but not vanishingly so. The particular combination XXY leads to what is known as Klinefelter’s syndrome. People with this karyotype are male, but may have small genitals and reduced body hair. Some also develop breasts, a female secondary sexual characteristic, during puberty.
To determine the occupant’s karyotype from the meagre amount of DNA available, Dr Salmela drew comparisons with living people. The grave yielded 8,329 sequenceable fragments, so she used a computer to draw samples of similar size from the genomes of living people with various karyotypes, including XXY, and also from mixtures of both sexes, to mimic contamination. She then compared these with the DNA from the grave and concluded it was 99.75% probable the individual concerned had indeed had Klinefelter’s syndrome.
While Dr Salmela was working all this out, Ms Moilanen and her team had another look at the grave. They confirmed that it was a high-status burial. For instance, they discovered traces of feathers below the spot where the skull had been, hinting that the deceased individual’s head had rested on a feather pillow. They also found evidence of fine furs, probably from foxes.
Clearly, this was a venerated human being, but what led to that veneration in a world then dominated by masculine values is a matter of speculation. Perhaps the person in question came from a family powerful enough for such things not to matter. But perhaps those who did not fit easily into sexual categories nevertheless had honoured roles in society. Across the Gulf of Bothnia in Sweden a near-contemporary grave found last century contained a man buried in women’s clothes and jewels, but otherwise with masculine grave goods. Stereotyping can work in many ways. And one is to accept, unthinkingly, modern stereotypes about the past. ■

1671,"LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The standard setter for global trade finance flows has proposed a new set of rules to define sustainability in the trade finance arena, worth some $5 trillion a year, an executive told Reuters.
While governments and business sectors move quickly to set guidelines for some types of sustainable finance, there are no standards for trade finance. Those rules would apply to a third of global trade.
Agreeing on a common rulebook could help direct more trade flows toward efforts that reduce climate-warming emissions and that also meet the United Nations' development goals, said Andrew Wilson, policy director at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
While others have begun to set definitions for parts of the sustainable finance industry, such as green bonds, ""none of those frameworks can be easily or reliably applied to the financing of trade,"" Wilson said on the sidelines of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.
A framework for trade finance is considered more complicated as more parties are involved and entire supply chains need to be monitored, he said.
Banks and companies are assessing the sustainability of their trade deals in different ways that can be hard to reconcile.
On Wednesday, the ICC released a position paper that it expects to be formalised as guidelines in 2022. The paper was produced with the Boston Consulting Group based on input from more than 200 companies and banks including HSBC (HSBA.L), Santander (SAN.MC) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE).
More input would be sought, including with civil society and governments, before the framework is finalised to ensure support and consistency between the banks in how they classify transactions.
If the framework is considered workable, the ICC would look to develop sectoral standards for specific types of transactions, Wilson said.
While the ICC rules are not compulsory, the group is a recognised standard-setter, Wilson said, noting that its decisions are often referred to in court decisions.
He said he expected the framework to be under consultation until the second quarter of 2022, when a more detailed framework would be delivered. Final rules would then come in the third quarter.",3
1672,"EARLIER THIS month wildfires tore through the drought-stricken American West. The largest of them, the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon, now takes up almost 395,000 hectares—more than the city of Los Angeles. The blaze is so big that it has created its own weather by sucking up smoke and air into “fire clouds”, which can trigger lightning and more fires. Some 2,250 firefighters are working in temperatures that have soared to 47°C (116°F) in order to contain it. America’s National Interagency Fire Centre estimates that 78 large fires are raging across 13 states.
Meanwhile, heavy rain caused severe floods in Europe and China. Flooding in the area where Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands meet appears to have been caused by a low-pressure region that sucked in moisture from lakes and wet soil across central Europe. It sat there for days, disgorging colossal quantities of rain. Reservoirs and sewer systems filled, and streams jumped their banks. At least 199 people have died and hundreds more are still missing. Henan, a province of central China, suffered its heaviest rainfall in a thousand years. Dozens of rivers burst their banks and streets flooded, causing transport disruptions in many cities. Tens of thousands of people were displaced.

The Tamarack Fire, discovered on July 4th, was ignited by a lightning strike. It has burned over 41,000 acres in Nevada.

1673,"WHEN SOTHEBY’S raised the gavel on the season’s biggest art auction on November 15th the sellers, Harry and Linda Macklowe, did not arrive as one to watch the proceedings from the discreet skybox above the auction floor, as those disposing of a collection often do. The couple can hardly stand to be in the same room together. Their divorce, after nearly six decades of marriage, was so contentious that in 2018 a judge ordered them to sell 65 of their magnificent 20th-century artworks and split the proceeds.
Death, debt and divorce are the auction market’s traditional catalysts. Sotheby’s won this particular deal by guaranteeing the Macklowes at least $600m from the sale. At the time it was agreed such a fulsome promise, the biggest ever offered to a client by an auction house, seemed to hark back to a bullish age before covid-19 roiled the art market. But Sotheby’s panache was well judged: the evening brought in $676m including fees, to which the proceeds of a second auction in May will be added. For beyond the Macklowe sale, the art market is changing, in three important ways.

It started even before the pandemic. The takeover of Sotheby’s by Patrick Drahi, a French telecoms and cable entrepreneur, for $3.7bn in the summer of 2019 looked with hindsight like an error when covid struck nine months later. Lockdowns shuttered auctioneers and galleries the world over. Art collectors quickly decided that 2020 was a bad time to sell. The best-connected auction houses moved swiftly into trying to broker private deals; the more entrepreneurial bolstered online sales with digital auctions.
Mr Drahi’s commercial nous has brought new meaning to the famous art-market quip that Sotheby’s are “auctioneers trying to be gentlemen”, in contrast to Christie’s, a firm of “gentlemen trying to be auctioneers”. The tycoon, who took on well over $1bn of debt to finance the deal, now has access to details of the 300,000 or so richest people in the world. The new Sotheby’s is bent on selling them not just art, but handbags and history too.
His timing may prove prescient. Contemporary art, which accounts for the single biggest share of the art market, saw a record-breaking $2.7bn change hands during the year to June, according to Artprice, which tracks sales. Both Sotheby’s and Christie’s say they expect their sales in 2021 to match the $4.8bn and $5.8bn they respectively made in 2019.
In part that is because both the main auction houses are expanding beyond their conventional offering of art, watches and wine—the market’s first big shift. In 2020 Christie’s sold a dinosaur fossil named Stan for $31.8m. Earlier this year Sotheby’s auctioned Kanye West’s Yeezy trainers for $1.8m. Both firms have jumped into crypto-art, selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to techies. All of these have brought in new buyers, especially from Asia, the fastest-growing market. Of the top 20 lots auctioned by Sotheby’s last year, Asian clients bid on ten and bought nine.
A second new development is that the two houses are wooing new customers by making buying at auction more fun. Last month Sotheby’s organised a weekend jamboree in Las Vegas for 40 clients. The main business was the auction of $100m-worth of artworks by Picasso. But in an effort to turn the affair into more of an experience, Sotheby’s also laid on wine-tasting, a session on how to game an auction and a talk by Jay Leno about vintage cars. At the party after the sale, the DJ was Picasso’s great-grandson.
Going, going, gone
The most far-reaching shift, though, may be the auction houses’ new cosy relationship with commercial galleries and private dealers. Historically these were their great rivals. Galleries know where the art is and what their clients might be prepared to sell, but lack the access to buyers who flock to auction houses. Now the two work more closely together, to find the right buyer for a piece and vice versa.
When a Düsseldorf gallerist recently wanted to sell a Gerhard Richter from the 1970s, an under-appreciated period, he turned to Sotheby’s. The private sale to one of its clients was at a far better price than he would have got at auction or selling to one of his own collectors, he says. In April 2020, a month after the pandemic hit, Rafael Valls, an dealer in Old Masters in London, was able to sell nearly 100 pictures in an online Sotheby’s auction; in a normal year the gallery would sell around 200.
In a move that highlights this rapprochement between auction houses and dealers, Sotheby’s recently hired Noah Horowitz, a director of the Art Basel art fair who is known to be particularly close to galleries. “Sotheby’s is tearing up the traditional playbook,” says a rival. The marriage is partly one of financial convenience: galleries lack the pools of capital big auction houses deploy to offer guarantees and thus lure potential sellers. Teaming up with dealers helps auctioneers find works to sell, which is almost as hard for them as identifying the next generation of buyers.
Sotheby’s and Christie’s hope their new approach will help both sides of the trade. When Christie’s sold its first piece of crypto-art earlier this year, its boss Guillaume Cerutti points out, almost all of the 33 bidders were new to the firm. A few days later one of those who had been outbid, a 31-year-old Chinese-American tech entrepreneur named Justin Sun, went on to buy a $20m Picasso—and, in the Macklowe sale, a Giacometti sculpture for $78m. ■

1674,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",3
1675,"IN THE REAL world a flywheel is a mechanical contraption that stores rotational energy. In Silicon Valley it has come to mean something else: a perpetual-motion business that not only runs forever but is self-reinforcing. Thanks to powerful network effects, the theory goes, a digital platform becomes more attractive as it draws in more users, which makes it even more attractive and so on. The end state is a venture that has gathered enough energy to self-levitate and throw off tons of cash.
The payout on one of the most richly funded bets of the past decade or so revolves around whether ride-sharing and delivery firms—which once were part of something known as the “sharing economy” but are better described as the “flywheel economy”—can actually ever live up to their heady promise. The outcome will matter to more than just venture capitalists who backed their growth. Whether these flywheels do gather unstoppable momentum is also of interest to regulators worried about technology’s propensity for winner-takes-all business models, not to mention paid-by-the-gig workers caught in its cogs.

Consider the results of Uber and DoorDash, the largest Western ride-sharing and delivery apps respectively. Optimists will have seen plenty to cheer them. On November 4th Uber proclaimed it was at last profitable, albeit only on the flattering metric of “adjusted EBITDA”. Strong third-quarter figures from DoorDash, which were released on November 9th, fuelled an already heady rally in its shares (the firm also announced the acquisition of Wolt, a Finnish food-delivery company, for $8bn).
But look deeper and evidence is mounting that business flywheels are not defying the laws of capitalism. The money that went into building them recalls the railway mania among other past speculative investment crazes. The nine firms that have gone public so far—Uber and its American rival Lyft; Didi, a Chinese ride-sharing app; and six delivery firms, from DoorDash and Delivery Hero, which is based in Berlin, to China’s Meituan and India’s Zomato—collectively raised more than $100bn. In most cases, the capital was intended to jumpstart those network effects and make market dominance a self-fulfilling prophecy. Seemingly bottomless pits of investors’ cash went to subsidising rides and deliveries to juice demand. This reached absurd points: a pizzeria could make money by ordering its own food for a discounted price on DoorDash (which then paid back the regular amount). To justify such profligacy, interested parties pointed to the huge “total addressable market”, another popular term in Silicon Valley. Bill Gurley of Benchmark, an early investor in Uber, argued in 2014 that the firm could vie for as much as $1.3trn in consumer spending if one saw it as an alternative to car ownership.
Measured against such visions, the flywheel economy has proven a dud. To be sure, the nine listed flywheel firms are still growing nicely—at 103% on average in their latest reporting period compared to the same period the previous year. This explains why they are collectively worth nearly $500bn. But self-levitating they are not. Nor are they profitable. Sales for the group amounted to $75bn over the past year and the operating loss to nearly $11.5bn.
As the firms have discovered, their businesses are less perpetual motion machines than real-world flywheels that inevitably lose energy to friction, says Jonathan Knee of Columbia Business School and the author of a book entitled “The Platform Delusion”. The network effects in fact have proved much weaker than expected. Many users switch between Uber and Lyft. Drivers also flit between them, or to delivery apps, depending on which model offers the best pay. This bargaining power from both sides means the system does not become self-reinforcing after all.
Technology, too, has turned out to be less beneficial than expected. Data collected by the firms help optimise their operations, but are not the decisive factor some had hoped for. Regulators keep pushing back. In London they have forced Uber to pay drivers minimum wages and pensions. In San Francisco they capped the fees DoorDash can charge restaurants for delivering their meals.
Uber’s tortuous path to stemming losses should temper investor optimism. It eked out a profit of $8m on revenues of $4.85bn. That excludes expenses that are unlikely to disappear, such as stock-based compensation. The company has crawled out of its sea of red ink mostly by slashing costs, shedding technology assets such as its autonomous-car unit, charging higher prices and increasing its “take rate”, the share of the fares it keeps. As a result, an Uber is now no cheaper—and often more expensive—than conventional cabs, plenty of which can be hailed via apps these days.
What is more, the company, which has a market capitalisation of $85bn, is now more of a delivery service than a ride-hailing app: Uber Eats generates more than half of sales. DoorDash’s own punchy valuation, of $65bn, rests on revenue that has grown more than fourfold since the last quarter of 2019, albeit during a time when people dined at home more often. But it also bakes in success in new markets that it has recently entered, including groceries and pet food.
Circular economy
Real business flywheels do exist. Software makers have managed to lock users in and thus generate gross margins typically above 70%. Venture capitalists are hoping against all hope to find new ones. They are already pouring money into the next generation of flywheel contenders: instant-delivery startups, which offer gratification in 30 minutes or less. Coupon-collecting consumers in cities such as New York now get at least a week’s worth of groceries for nothing from such services as Buyk, Fridge No More and Gopuff. Eventually, these firms’ champions promise, their economics will be far better than those of an Uber or a DoorDash. In the flywheel economy hope and hype spring eternal, at least as long as interest rates remain low and capital is essentially free.■

1676,"WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday will lift COVID-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international visitors starting Nov. 8, ending historic restrictions that had barred much of the world from entering the United States for as long as 21 months.
The unprecedented travel restrictions kept millions of visitors out of the United States from China, Canada, Mexico, India, Brazil, much of Europe and elsewhere; shrunk U.S. tourism; and hurt border community economies. They prevented many loved ones and foreign workers from reuniting with families.
Also read: U.S. will accept mixed doses of vaccines from international travelers
""Oh how I've missed Christmas in NY,"" Alexandros Koronakis, an executive with AT&T Inc in Brussels, wrote on Twitter.
U.S. allies had heavily lobbied the Biden administration to lift the rules. Many praised Friday's announcement, including Sweden's ambassador to the United States Karin Olofsdotter, who called it ""very welcoming news.""
White House spokesman Kevin Munoz confirmed the Nov. 8 date on Twitter, adding the policy ""is guided by public health, stringent, and consistent.""
Restrictions on non-U.S. citizens were first imposed on air travelers from China in January 2020 by then-President Donald Trump and then extended to dozens of other countries, without any clear metrics for how and when to lift them.
Curbs on non-essential travelers at land borders with Mexico and Canada have been in place since March 2020 to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
Reuters first reported Friday's announcement of the Nov. 8 starting date earlier in the day.
U.S. airline, hotel and cruise industry stocks rose on the news, including American Airlines (AAL.O), up 2.8%; Marriott International Inc (MAR.O), up 3.7%; and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), up 0.9%.
U.S. international air passenger traffic was down 43% in August and overall passenger air traffic was down 21% over pre-pandemic levels, the U.S. Transportation Department said Friday.
Airlines have seen an increase in international ticket sales in recent weeks after the White House announced plans to lift the restrictions, Nick Calio, chief executive of the Airlines for America industry trade group, said in a statement.
Calio said the ""full reopening of international travel is also critical to reviving economies around the globe, reinvigorating communities and supporting millions of jobs in the U.S. and abroad.""
The United States had lagged many other countries in lifting such restrictions.
In January, Trump issued an order to lift travel restrictions on people in Europe and Brazil. But the order was reversed by President Joe Biden before it took effect.
The Biden administration, which repeatedly has said it does endorse so-called ""vaccine passports,"" grappled for months over whether to mandate vaccinations as a condition of lifting country-specific restrictions, officials told Reuters.
On Tuesday, the White House announced it would lift restrictions at its land borders and ferry crossings with Canada and Mexico for fully vaccinated foreign nationals in early November. They are similar but not identical to requirements announced last month for international air travelers.
Unvaccinated visitors will still be barred from entering the United States from Canada or Mexico at land borders.
Canada on Aug. 9 began allowing fully vaccinated U.S. visitors for non-essential travel.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Reuters last week the United States will accept the use by international visitors of COVID-19 vaccines authorized by U.S. regulators or the World Health Organization.
The White House, which held a meeting late Thursday to finalize the Nov. 8 date, faces some remaining questions, including how and what exemptions the Biden administration will grant to the vaccine requirements. Children under 18, for example, are largely expected to be exempt from the requirements, an official said.
U.S. Travel Association Chief Executive Roger Dow said declines in international visits since the pandemic started resulted in more than $250 billion in lost income.
Dow said in a statement that the Nov. 8 date ""is critically important for planning - for airlines, for travel-supported businesses, and for millions of travelers worldwide who will now advance plans to visit the United States once again.""
The White House announced on Sept. 20 that the United States would lift restrictions on air travelers from 33 countries in early November. It did not specify the date at the time.
Starting Nov. 8, the United States will admit fully vaccinated foreign air travelers from the 26 so-called Schengen countries in Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Greece, as well as Britain, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil. The unprecedented U.S. restrictions have barred non-U.S. citizens who were in those countries within the past 14 days.
The United States has allowed foreign air travelers from more than 150 countries throughout the pandemic, a policy that critics said made little sense because some countries with high infection rates were not on the restricted list, while some on the list had the pandemic more under control.
The White House said last month it would apply vaccine requirements to foreign nationals traveling from all other countries.
Non-U.S. air travelers will need to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight, and will need to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. Foreign visitors crossing a land border will not need to show proof of a recent negative test.
The new rules do not require foreign visitors or Americans entering the country to go into quarantine.
Americans traveling overseas must still show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test, and unvaccinated Americans will face stricter testing requirements. They will also be subject to restrictions in countries they plan to visit, which may include quarantines.
The CDC plans to issue new rules soon on contact tracing for international air travelers.",3
1677,"THERE IS AN old joke that the key to success in life is sincerity. If you can fake that, the saying goes, then you have got it made. On reflection, however, the essential quality for surviving at work is not sincerity, but flexibility.
When Bartleby started his career in 1980, personal computers were the preserve of hobbyists and sending a letter required the passing of a handwritten draft to the typing pool. Phone calls came through the switchboard. Office life was so dependent on shuffling paper that staplers, paper clips and Tipp-Ex were essential. No one had a mobile phone so swift contact was impossible; this correspondent once sat for 45 minutes in a restaurant waiting for a guest who had been shown to another table and was miffed about his non-appearance.

Now office workers must grapple with a host of technologies. They need to know how to raise their hand (and mute themselves) on Zoom, track changes in a Google doc and make financial calculations on a spreadsheet. They must switch between applications, and back again, several times an hour. They must learn to use (or at least understand) new jargon even when it seems fatuous or irritating.
The need to adapt to change has not been confined to office work, of course. Those employed in manufacturing have had to cope with new techniques and new machines. Many of them have had to change sectors in order to find work. Manufacturing employment has fallen from 30.2% of the workforce in 1991 to 22.6% in 2019 across the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries. Retail workers have grappled with bar codes, automated checkouts, contactless payments and click-and-collect. But office workers have also had to adjust to one hugely significant change: a breakdown of the barriers between work and home life. The advent of email and the smartphone means that workers can be contacted at any time of the day or night. If the phone rings at 10pm, it’s probably not your mother, it’s your boss.
Employees have to adjust to many corporate cultures over the course of their careers. Only a minority of workers ever spend their working lives at a single organisation. The median job tenure for workers aged 25 and over in America is around five years and has changed little in recent decades. Public-sector workers stay longer in their jobs than those in the private sector, who last around four years. In a 40-year career, that implies the average private-sector employee might work for ten different firms. On top of that, globalisation has meant that workers have had to get used to dealing with foreign customers and suppliers, colleagues working across different time zones, and sometimes foreign owners.
Over the years, employees—particularly men—have had to adapt to new social norms. What used to be known as “laddish humour” is now rightly deemed to be demeaning to female colleagues. Boozy lunchtimes were once common, but are now frowned upon. Some middle-aged workers have been slow to accept this shift but employers have become steadily less tolerant of such behaviour.
During the pandemic, workers have had to show even more flexibility, keeping in touch with their colleagues and maintaining their productivity while juggling child care and the need to avoid infection. Not everyone has enjoyed it, but the ability to conquer the tyranny of the 9-to-5 routine is a very positive development. Monday mornings no longer seem quite such a dreadful prospect if they don’t involve a stressful commute.
It is actually a great tribute to modern workers that they have adjusted splendidly to all these changes. But it gets more difficult as you grow older. Attitudes harden; habits become ingrained. There are many things which Bartleby finds puzzling about modern life. Once, talking loudly on the street was a sign of madness; now people are happy to disclose intimate details of their personal lives while bellowing on their mobile phones. Electric scooters seem to offer all of the dangers of bicycling (and a lot more risk for pedestrians sharing the pavement) without any of the health benefits. And most perplexing of all is that a man with the character and record of Boris Johnson has become his country’s prime minister.
This puzzlement is a hint that this columnist is insufficiently flexible to cover the modern world and needs to retire. The danger is that one becomes a caricature of a grumpy old man and, like his fictional namesake, Bartleby would “prefer not to”. Many thanks for reading the column over the past three years.

1678,"WHEN IT COMES to tackling climate change, the British government lacks neither ambition nor self-regard. In 2019 it enacted a law committing itself to reaching net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. A medium-sized country that accounts for 1% of global emissions believes it can pull the rest of the world along at a UN climate conference next month in Glasgow. But is Britain serious about keeping its own promises? A flurry of government plans released this week suggest not.
The net-zero strategy contains many bold targets, which often come with caveats. By 2035 Britain will be powered entirely by green electricity, “subject to security of supply”. By the same year, every new home-heating system installed should be an efficient electric-heat pump or a hydrogen boiler, so long as the costs of such things fall to a reasonable level. Tree-planting will more than double in speed.

Wisely, the government recognises that there are many ways to reach net-zero emissions. Britain may move quickly away from fossil fuels and to electricity provided by wind turbines and new nuclear-power stations. Alternatively, it could rely on hydrogen, capturing the carbon released when it is created from natural gas. The government will spray money at lots of tech—hydrogen production, small nuclear reactors, devices that take carbon from the air—in the hope that some work cheaply.
“It’s more detailed and ambitious than anything you’ll find elsewhere in the world,” says Chris Stark, chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, an official watchdog. Inevitably, some government departments (such as business and transport) have bolder, more detailed plans than others (such as agriculture). But it is useful to know which are the laggards. Encouragingly, most political critics of the plans argued that the government should do more, not less.
Yet getting to net zero, or even close, is so difficult that Britain must do everything right. And there are two weak links in the chain that connects dreams to accomplishments. Unfortunately, these are the two strongest institutions in the government.
The first is the Treasury. The problem is not so much that it might have provided more money to speed the green transition, although that is true. A much-touted £450m ($620m) subsidy scheme for heat pumps may cover only 30,000 installations a year, for example. The larger problem is what Jill Rutter, a former Treasury official who now works at the Institute for Government, a think-tank, calls the department’s “wholly owned, proprietorial approach” to tax.
The Treasury sees its job as collecting money from the public and distributing it to other departments, to be spent (often unwisely, it fears) on their projects. It does not regard taxes as devices to help departments achieve their objectives. So the transport department must try to decarbonise the roads by subsidising electric cars and banning the sale of petrol- and diesel-powered ones. The more obvious (and economically efficient) route of taxing fuel more highly is out of the question.
The second weak link is the prime minister, Boris Johnson. This week he shilled for his government’s green plans with typical bonhomie. He cheerfully misquoted Gordon Gekko from the film “Wall Street”, likened himself to Moses and assured readers of the Sun newspaper that the “greenshirts of the boiler police” would not “kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet” and seize their gas-fired devices.

Political salesmanship and cheer are good things. The trouble with Mr Johnson is that he cannot bear to deliver bad news. The government’s net-zero strategy contains soothing words about working with the grain of consumer choice. There is, as the prime minister puts it, not “a hair shirt in sight”. But if Britain is to reach net zero, many noses must be put out of joint.
Especially noses belonging to people on whose votes Mr Johnson depends. The old have bigger carbon footprints than the young, largely because they tend to live alone or with one other person. Their consumption patterns will have to change. Yet the Conservative government relies on older voters (see charts). Nasty geographical patterns exacerbate the problem. Installing a heat pump costs around 7% of average net housing wealth across the Midlands and north of England, where the Conservatives won many new votes at the general election in 2019, but less than 3% in London, where the party has given up.
Mr Johnson could be bolder. A poll for The Economist by Ipsos MORI finds not only that 83% of Britons are concerned about climate change, but also that 51% believe the cost of tackling it will, in a year’s time, be larger than any savings from things like lower heating bills and cheaper petrol. Only 9% think the savings will be higher than the costs. People expect the trade-off to be more favourable in ten years’ time. Britons seem to be prepared for hair shirts. They just don’t want to wear them forever.■

1679,"“THE TALIBAN is not the North Vietnamese army,” declared President Joe Biden on July 8th, days after America abandoned Bagram air base, the hub of its war in Afghanistan for 20 years, without telling its Afghan commander. “They’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of the embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.” By August 15th Chinooks were rattling windows in Kabul, shuttling American diplomats from their hulking embassy. At the city’s airport, desperate Afghans swarmed the runway; some clung to the undercarriage of a C-17 transporter, falling to their deaths.

The chaos on the runway contrasted with the Taliban’s nearly bloodless capture of Kabul a day earlier. The Taliban now control more of Afghanistan than they did in 2001, when America swept them from power in response to the September 11th attacks (see map). At the presidential palace in Kabul, Taliban fighters in dusty sandals seemed surprised at their victory as they posed around the desk abandoned by Ashraf Ghani, the country’s president. “We have reached a victory that wasn’t expected,” admitted Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s deputy leader.
In the tense drama around the airport, the foes have treated each other warily. The Taliban have so far allowed America to run evacuation flights, but have forced back crowds trying to get onto them. With thousands of Americans left in Kabul the situation could grow more dangerous. The Taliban may grow impatient with thousands of American and British troops on Afghan soil, and angry at America’s decision to block access to foreign reserves.
America’s flight from Kabul, like its departure from Saigon in 1975, is a defining geopolitical moment: the world’s mightiest country has again been defeated by a weaker enemy. In both cases—then as a senator, now as president—Joe Biden advocated a rapid exit. And then as now, fierce critics of America predicted that such a chaotic abandonment would alarm allies and embolden adversaries. Neighbouring states and rich countries farther away can expect an unsettling new influx of refugees. Global jihadists, thousands of whom are thought to be sheltered by the Taliban, will see a divine hand in the way holy warriors have defeated two superpowers in Afghanistan—first the Soviet Union in 1989 and now America.


The consequences will be felt, above all, in Afghanistan itself. It is too early to say whether the Taliban’s triumph marks the final, or merely the latest, chapter in the country’s 42-year-old war—with more than 117,000 Afghans killed since 2001 (see chart 1). Afghanistan remains one of the world’s poorest countries. If Western aid is cut off, it stands to lose even the modest economic and social gains—such as the education of girls—of the past two decades (see chart 2). Much will depend on how the Taliban govern.

When they last ruled in Kabul, from 1996 to 2001, they plunged a country long ravaged by war into a theocratic tyranny. They halted female education and employment, banned most art and music, and massacred minorities. And they harboured militants of all stripes, notably al-Qaeda, which sought to export jihad around the world. The “emirate” was so repulsive that it was recognised only by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, a long-time sponsor of the Taliban.
This time around, the Taliban want to show a gentler face. On August 17th one of their officials appeared on Afghanistan's main television network to be interviewed by a female presenter—an unimaginable scene during the first Taliban era. The group has also applied a light touch in the capital. “We were expecting a lot more brutality,” says Obaidullah Baheer, a lecturer at the American University in Kabul. Instead, he was “pleasantly surprised at their discipline and respectfulness”. Mr Baheer notes that the Taliban’s vehicles do not honk at civilian cars, forcing them off the road, as Afghan military ones used to.
Keeping the lights on
The Taliban’s priority is to keep the existing state going. Lacking technocrats or managers, they have declared a general amnesty for all government officials, urging them to return to work. The health minister and the mayor of Kabul remain in their posts. Antonio Giustozzi of King’s College London notes that the Taliban have cut deals with Salahuddin Rabbani, a former foreign minister, and Hamid Karzai, the first president installed by America. They have recruited army specialists to operate captured equipment and are trying to woo military pilots.
The Taliban's strategy in rural provinces that they have held for some time may hold other clues. They often piggybacked on government services, allowing teachers and doctors to continue working as long as they abided by Taliban rules. “They are going to assume control of what already exists, at least in the short term, and I think they will try to go for stability, rather than a revolution of any sort,” says Ashley Jackson of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a think-tank in London.
As they take over the country, says Martine van Bijlert of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, a research group, the Taliban are debating how to strike the balance between what many of their fighters see as ideological purity, on the one hand, and the demand for education that exists even among many of the more conservative Afghans. Mustapha Ben Messaoud, the chief of field operations in Afghanistan for Unicef, says he is “cautiously optimistic”.

How long this pragmatism lasts is anyone’s guess. The news out of some newly captured areas is worrying. In Herat, where 60% of the students at the university were women, female students have been ordered back to their homes. Women at work have been told to give up their jobs to male relatives. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s spokesman, says that media outlets can remain open—as long as they do not “contradict Islamic values” or “broadcast anything that goes against our national interests”. That is hardly reassuring.
Nor will many Afghans be persuaded by the Taliban’s promise that there will be “no revenge on all those who are working with the Kabul administration or with the foreign forces”. After the Taliban took Spin Boldak, a town on the Pakistani border, dozens of government supporters were reportedly massacred. In Kandahar the Taliban kidnapped and murdered Nazar Mohammad, a popular comedian. Kabul is rife with reports that the Taliban are hunting former US army interpreters and Afghan commanders. One female judge in the city says she, and hundreds of her former colleagues, are terrified of reprisals. In Jalalabad on August 18th the Taliban reportedly killed several protesters waving the Afghan flag rather than the Taliban’s standard.
The hollow Afghan army
Even so, Taliban promises of “mercy” and safe passage for government soldiers who put down their arms goes some way to explaining how they swept away the Afghan army so easily. When the Soviet Union left Afghanistan in 1989, its client regime survived for three years before collapsing (in part because by then the Soviet Union itself had disappeared). The state built this time did not hold out long enough for America even to complete its departure. “We spent over a trillion dollars,” lamented Mr Biden on August 16th (see chart 3). “We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong…a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies.” Why did it all dissolve in days?

In 20 years of America’s presence, the Taliban had seized only one city, Kunduz, holding it for brief periods. Yet starting with Zaranj in the south-west on August 6th, they took one provincial capital after another, culminating in the seizure of Kabul on August 15th. They control virtually all the territory once held by the former Northern Alliance, an anti-Taliban amalgam that America relied on in 2001. Amrullah Saleh, Mr Ghani’s vice-president, has fled to the Panjshir valley, declared himself the caretaker president and called for “resistance”. But his cause looks forlorn.
The Taliban’s success owes much to Pakistan’s support, America’s distraction in Iraq, drug money and the corruption of Afghan elites. But the militants also had agility. In the last stage of the war, they often embodied Sun Tzu’s dictum that the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. “What just happened is probably one of the best conceived and planned guerrilla campaigns ever,” says Mike Martin, a former British army officer in Helmand province, now at King’s College London. “The Taliban went into every district and flipped all the local militias by doing deals along tribal lines.” In Herat, for instance, the head of the provincial council cut a deal with the local Taliban commander (both were members of the Alizai tribe). “Once those local forces had flipped,” says Mr Martin, “there wasn't enough weight on the government side, so the army had to surrender.”
That the Taliban could strike such deals reflected a deeper problem. America and its allies acted as the midwives of a highly centralised state, whose constitution in 2004 echoed the monarchy of the 1960s. Mr Ghani, a former official in the World Bank and co-author of a book called “Fixing Failed States”, wanted to build national institutions that would disenfranchise local power-brokers. That went down badly with important tribes and clans. “These tensions between Kabul and regional actors opened up vacuums the Taliban were able to exploit,” observes Ibraheem Bahiss of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. “They went from really limited appeal to virtually a national movement.”
The Afghan army that America built was large, well armed and equipped with air power. It was also utterly unsuited to the war at hand. The formal chain of command clashed with family and tribal loyalties, says Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank. The result was endemic corruption. “Equipment was going into the military, into big warehouses and then getting siphoned off all over the place,” he says.
Though the army was 352,000-strong on paper, the available force amounted to around 96,000 soldiers, according to CNA, a think-tank—not much larger than the Taliban’s 60,000 or so. American-supplied equipment was too complex to maintain, resulting in frequent breakdowns. That in turn confined much of the army to besieged bases. Many soldiers went unpaid and hungry, and casualties were high. A small cadre of Afghan special forces was left to do much of the fighting, but they were stretched thin.
America’s decision to leave was the coup de grâce. As a study of Vietnam by the RAND Corporation, published in 1978, noted, “the physical side of it—the withdrawal of troops, the loss of US airpower, declining aid—was no more disastrous than the concomitant psychological effects of no longer being regarded by the United States as worth saving.”

Gaining friends and seeking influence
Western countries are in a bind. Having failed calamitously, they now hope to exercise a “moderating influence” on the Taliban, as Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, put it, by using two levers: aid and diplomatic recognition of the new regime. Neither is likely to be effective. Iran and Russia, once hostile to the Taliban, are now friendlier to them; both relish America’s humiliation in Afghanistan. Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s presidential envoy to Afghanistan, all but applauded their victory: the Taliban, he said, are “much more able to reach agreements than the puppet government in Kabul.” Pakistan, whose spooks nurtured the Taliban from birth, was even keener. “In Afghanistan they have broken the chains of slavery,” gushed Imran Khan, the prime minister.
The biggest diplomatic prize for the Taliban, however, is China, which shares a border with Afghanistan through the slender Wakhan corridor. On July 28th, with the American withdrawal nearly complete, China made a show of hosting a delegation of Taliban leaders in Tianjin and called the group a “decisive military and political force”. Shortly after it proved so, Chinese diplomats welcomed the prospect of “friendly and co-operative relations”.
How the relations with neighbours actually turn out depends, in part, on the Taliban’s links with international jihadist groups. China, for instance, worries about the presence of militant Uyghurs, whom it sees as a threat to stability in Xinjiang, where Uyghurs form a majority and are the subject of intense repression.
Islamist extremism has long been a concern to Western countries, too, even if the threat has abated since 2001. “We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission, and that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11,” said Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, on August 15th. “And we have succeeded in that mission.” Al-Qaeda, the group which was responsible, is a shadow of its former self. But its ideology has spread far and wide; it has spawned the likes of Islamic State, an even more brutal group born in Iraq and Syria, as well as offshoots and lone-wolf terrorists.
Mr Mujahid has tried to assuage concerns that Afghanistan will again become a base for global terrorism, as it was on 9/11: “We want to reassure everyone, especially the United States, that Afghanistan won’t be used to attack anybody.” But last month a UN team which monitors jihadist groups reported that al-Qaeda remained present in no fewer than 15 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, primarily along the country’s eastern fringes. A local branch of Islamic State is also present in several places, with anywhere from several hundred to 10,000 members. Western intelligence agencies reckon that Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda’s leader since America’s killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, is in Afghanistan, though ailing. The Taliban’s release of thousands of prisoners, many of them hardened jihadists, from Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul compounds the problem.
American officials believe that they can keep the terrorists in check through a combination of watchful intelligence and targeted strikes. Mr Biden says that America has a robust “counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability”. Yet this capacity has been greatly weakened. America will soon lack a military or diplomatic presence on the ground. Afghanistan’s own spy agency, the National Directorate of Security, is unlikely to survive; if it does it is unlikely to co-operate with the West. American spooks will become more reliant on agents recruited mostly outside Afghanistan, and on signals intelligence.
Without an air base to operate from in Afghanistan, the country’s landlocked geography is another forbidding constraint. CIA drones once took off from next-door Pakistan but its relations with America are at rock-bottom. Missiles or warplanes could fly from bases in the Persian Gulf or an aircraft-carrier in the Arabian Sea, but they could not avoid passing over either Iran, an unlikely prospect, or Pakistan, with or without its permission.
Much as Mr Biden and his team reject comparisons to Vietnam, they are unavoidable. In both cases, civilian and military leaders misled Americans about a conflict with uncertain aims and unreliable partners, and on cultural terrain where they never found their footing. But there are many differences. The 2,452 American military deaths in Afghanistan are painful, but the war in Vietnam was far bloodier—with 25 times as many Americans killed—and more divisive. In other ways, the failure in Afghanistan is worse. The North Vietnamese army was a skilled and armoured force, notes Caitlin Talmadge of Georgetown University, perhaps twice the size of the Taliban and backed by a superpower. Yet the Taliban have taken a territory four times as large as South Vietnam.

A shock that rings around the world
Many historians have concluded that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and expanded support for proxies in Central America and Africa in part out of the belief that America had been weakened by Vietnam. China has already seized on the debacle in Afghanistan to celebrate America’s retreat, if not decline. The Global Times, a jingoistic tabloid run by China’s Communist Party, crowed on August 16th that the withdrawal was an “omen of Taiwan's future”. If America was unwilling to absorb several thousand casualties in Afghanistan, it suggested, a war over Taiwan “would mean unthinkable costs”. Andrew Yang, a former Taiwanese defence minister, agrees that the withdrawal from Afghanistan matters to Taiwan: “That is a lesson to learn…Taiwan should depend on its own self-defences instead of US support.”
In India, many officials are troubled by a victory for Pakistan’s proxy, and the prospect of energised jihadism. And having aligned the country more closely with America against China, they are taken aback by America’s apparent unreliability. “The US withdrawal…showed utter disregard of what it would unleash in its wake,” argues Nirupama Rao, formerly India’s most senior diplomat. “It has devalued the worth and credibility of American power in the region,” she says.
Europeans fume that America’s withdrawal was presented to them as a fait accompli. For one diplomat, it “confirms a long-term trend of US disengagement”. Europeans, he said, must “draw conclusions” about America’s reliability when it comes to crises in places like the Middle East and the Sahel. British officials are apoplectic, too. Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP and chairman of Parliament’s foreign-affairs committee, who served in Afghanistan as a soldier, said Britain should “set out a vision…for reinvigorating our European NATO partners to make sure we're not dependent on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader”.
Yet complaints about American reliability are an old pastime. Europeans grumbled about Barack Obama’s reluctance to intervene in Libya in 2011 and his cancellation of air strikes on Syria in 2013. Gulf states fretted over Mr Trump’s failure to punish Iran for its attack on Saudi oil facilities in 2019. Taiwan already has experience of betrayal by America, when it switched formal diplomatic recognition to communist China in 1979, yet lives with it.
If the manner of Mr Biden’s withdrawal demonstrates American capriciousness, it also shows its indispensability. Few allies have anywhere else to turn as Russia and China assert themselves. “This is a hard blow for America,” acknowledges Michael Fullilove, director of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, “but it doesn’t change the calculus for Australia.” Asked whether Japan is worried, one senior official in Tokyo replies: “No, because Afghanistan is Afghanistan…Japan is different.”

And just as European allies welcomed America’s withdrawal from Vietnam, anxious that it was diverting resources and attention from the Soviet threat to Europe, many allies (and China hawks in Washington) spy an opportunity to refocus America on their concerns. As Mr Biden noted: “Our true strategic competitors—China and Russia—would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilising Afghanistan indefinitely.”
The long view
The enduring lesson from Vietnam may be the importance of perspective. In the short term America’s confidence was shaken and its adversaries cheered. Yet within 15 years of defeat in a war that was waged to hold back the communist tide, America had won the cold war and emerged as a power without peer. Its armed forces, shattered by the conflict, rebuilt themselves into an unrivalled, technologically advanced force. And four decades on, Vietnam is a close partner of the superpower it vanquished. That may be a consolation to America. It is of little solace to Afghans who trusted it to defend them, and must now face life under the Taliban.

1680,"A new Met Police policy on handcuffing tells officers to ask themselves 44 questions before arresting a suspect and details the procedure in a child-style ABC guide.
The mammoth decision process is laid out in full in the new 25-page document published by Scotland Yard.
It puts into official policy nearly 50 questions officers should consider when they are using the police-issue restraints.
The questions include, 'What could go wrong (and what could go well)?', 'What is happening?', and, 'What do I not know?'.
Other advice to mull over also includes, 'Do I need to take action immediately?' and 'What would the victim or community affected expect of me in this situation?' 
Most are from the College of Policing's National Decision Model but are now enshrined in the official equipment policy. 
It is not clear what the Met's previous policy on the police restraint tactic had been.
But the new rules have been drawn up after complaints from the black community they had been disproportionately targeted in stop and search. 
Also featured is an alphabet-themed guide to handcuffing that warns to, 'Always ask the suspect if the cuffs are too tight'.
It includes the advice to 'always double-lock the handcuffs'. 
The Met publicised the new policy this morning, which comes after a review by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist. 
Industry insiders and former police officers have slammed the alphabet-style guide, with former Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley warning it was indicative of the 'weakness of senior police leadership'.
He told GB News: 'Frankly, it's an example of the ineptitude, the pusillanimous, the weakness of decision-making that we now see with senior police leadership.
'Police officers, when they decide to use force or apply handcuffs, need to run through in their mind a lot of different things which comes down to: ""Is this the right thing to be doing, and can I defend my options?""
 'What we've now see happen is something that's going to affect three groups of people. 
'First, it is going to put off the cops using force or arresting people. There's nothing more difficult than trying to get some officers to deal with confrontation.
'It's very easy to back down. The hard thing is to motivate a police officer to be nosy. 
'The second thing is, the public are going to think: ""What on earth is going on here?""
'The third point really is that those who are ""baddies"", it's going to give them an opportunity for an outer.'  
Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said of the force's new policy: 'My number one priority remains tackling violent crime and keeping people safe from street crime – which is blighting the lives of too many young people.
'Alongside that, I have set out to increase the trust and confidence of communities in their police service.
'We know that not all communities have the same level of trust in us – I am determined to change that.
'The handcuffing review could not have taken place effectively without the input and contribution of many front line police officers and members of the public. I thank them all for their time, effort and valuable honesty.'

The policy follows a review commissioned by the Met Commissioner Cressida Dick in 2019 into the use of handcuffs before an arrest has taken place.
It came after complaints from black communities they were being disproportionately targeted.
The Met said the review would make sure the tactic, for which there is a sound legal basis in some circumstances, was justified and recorded on each occasion.
It fed in consultation responses from young black men aged between 16 to 25 years-old.
A Met spokeswoman said: 'The launch of the policy, which covers all aspects of the use of handcuffs, is the final recommendation from the 2020 review to be implemented.
'Officers are already receiving additional legal training, more public and personal safety training, with further emphasis on de-escalation; and more community input to understand the respective experiences of the public and police officers during encounters on the streets of London.' 
Last October a highly criticial review of the Met's use of stop and search powers has revealed officers stopped two black men after they were seen 'fist bumping,'.
The review by the Independent Office for Police Conduct revealed the officers thought the pair had just completed a drug deal, in one of a number of issues raised by the watchdog.
It found handcuffs were used in nearly all instances where other tactics could have de-escalated an encounter, while officers also failed to use bodycam video from the outset of their interaction with some members of the public.
The IOPC said their review 'mirrors concerns,' already raised by communities in the Capital.
Regional director Sal Naseem said: 'We saw a lack of understanding from officers about why their actions were perceived to be discriminatory.
'We recommended the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) takes steps to ensure that assumptions, stereotypes and bias (conscious or unconscious) are not informing or affecting their officers' decision-making on stop and search.'
The IOPC has now recommended 11 ways the Met Police can improve its use of stop and search powers.
The watchdog's recommendations include offering better education of powers to officers, improving monitoring from above, ensuring racial prejudice is removed and making sure the stop and search encounter is ended swiftly after suspicion is allayed.
There were 558,973 stop and searches carried out in the year to March , 2020, under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Pace) in England and Wales, according to Home Office figures.
Just 13 per cent (73,423) of that year's stop and searches led to an arrest - down from last year's 15 per cent.
The increase in stop and searches was larger for white people in 2021 (with an increase of 95,562 to 280,661) than for black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds people (who saw an increase of 55,215 searches to 185,401).
But BAME people were stopped at a rate of 4.1 times higher than those who were white, a similar rate to the previous year (4.3), the report added.
And the rate of black people who were stopped and search per 1,000 of the population was at its highest since 2014 at 54, compared with 35 in 2014.
This is the highest number of stops and searches since 2013/14 (872,518), but still below the peak in 2010/11 (1,179,746), the report said.
It is also an increase of 193,419 (53%) compared to the 2018/19, when 365,554 searches were recorded.
Mr Naseem added: 'The review highlights the need for the Met to reflect on the impact this kind of decision-making is having.
'There is also a need to better support officers on the front line to do their jobs effectively with the right training and supervision so they aren't subjected to further complaints and investigation. There is clearly much room for improvement.'",-2
1681,"CHINESE OFFICIALS used to insist that social harmony in Xinjiang could be achieved only by developing the far-western region’s economy. But in 2014 the government began to argue that for economic development to occur, stability was needed first. This small shift in wording heralded the fiercest storm.
Authorities had long been troubled by occasional violence involving Uyghurs, a mainly Muslim ethnic group that makes up more than 40% of Xinjiang’s population of 26m. Over the past five years China has demolished thousands of Xinjiang’s mosques, thrown a million of its people into camps for “re-education”, placed the rest under high-tech surveillance and cut their links with the outside world. The government has shrugged off international criticism and Western economic sanctions against companies and officials deemed responsible for these abuses.

Buildings and roads around Xinjiang are decked today with signs proclaiming that the government wants “long-term peace”. It says there have been no “terrorist” incidents in Xinjiang since 2017, when it began rounding up Uyghurs for even the most trivial displays of religious or ethnic loyalty, such as praying in a public place or wearing a beard.
Now China is turning back to the economy. That does not mean easing repression. Highways remain dotted with checkpoints. Cameras rotate to track people as they walk past. The detention camps seem to have transferred many inmates to regular prisons. But Xinjiang is also launching industrial zones, pouring money into infrastructure and building new cities.
Already, Chinese officials are boasting of success. In July Chinese diplomats at the UN organised a video conference in which they insisted that Xinjiang was prospering, contrary to the “smears” of Western media. Late last year Xi Jinping, China’s president, said Xinjiang had scored “unprecedented achievements” in developing its economy and improving people’s lives. The reality is much grimmer.
Xinjiang’s economy can be divided into two halves. Much of its wealth and importance for China derives from its abundant supplies of energy. Related industries—oil and gas extraction, power generation and chemicals—account for more than half the region’s industrial output. As in other resource-rich parts of the world, they are relatively disconnected from society. They depend more on capital from large state-owned firms than on labour, and are concentrated in the sparsely populated north.
The other half of Xinjiang’s economy is more agrarian and more informal, centred in the south, where most Uyghurs live. This is the half the government is focusing on. There are three main planks to its efforts: fostering industries that create lots of jobs; reconfiguring the area’s economic links with other parts of China and the world; and promoting tourism.
The government has long encouraged labour-intensive industries to set up in Xinjiang. Now it is trying much harder. In its latest five-year plan for the region, finalised in June, it stressed the importance of basic manufacturing. It sees factories as the best source of steady, well-paid jobs.
Human-rights groups sense ulterior motives. Analysis of satellite imagery points to factories being built alongside many of the region’s expanding prisons. Testimonies from inmates suggest that forced labour is common. Many of those released from re-education camps seem to be on indefinite probation, compelled to work wherever they are assigned.
The government denies such allegations. It claims to have created jobs last year for about 2.7m “surplus labourers” in Xinjiang, many in textile factories. At present, textiles account for only about 2% of Xinjiang’s industrial output. That should soon start to rise. From Manas in the north to Bachu in the south, the government plans to boost production by building seven industrial parks, three industrial zones and a trading hub in Urumqi, the region’s capital. Employment in Xinjiang’s textile industry has grown from about 400,000 in 2017 to nearly a million today. The industry appeals to the government because it can be contained almost entirely within the region, from planting cotton (Xinjiang produces 20% of the world’s supply) to spinning yarn and making clothes.
About 25km outside Kashgar, the biggest city in southern Xinjiang, lorries unload bales of cotton at the factory gates of Dongchunxing, a state-owned fabric-maker that started production just four years ago and now has 5,000 employees, mostly Uyghurs. At lunchtime the scene looks similar to factories elsewhere in China. Workers in loose blue uniforms saunter out, some crowding round a snack stall, others zipping off on electric motorbikes.
A five-minute drive away, though, is a more sinister sight: two police checkpoints restrict access to another textile park, managed by the government of Akto county in Kizilsu prefecture, which borders Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Nearby is a cluster of dormitory-like buildings behind the high walls of what an Australian think-tank has identified as a re-education facility. At one checkpoint, a Uyghur security guard sits at a table with two books on it: a short history of the Chinese Communist Party and a selection of Mao Zedong’s quotations. It is the kind of material that China believes will help cure wayward Muslims of extremist tendencies.
One difficulty with China’s industrial plans in Xinjiang is that many in the West want nothing to do with them. In July America’s Senate passed a bill that bars all goods from Xinjiang, unless importers can prove they were not made with forced labour—a virtually impossible standard.
The second part of China’s strategy could help overcome this hurdle. It involves making it easier for goods and labour to move around and out of Xinjiang. Over the past five years, the local railway network has expanded by 1,530km, or 25%. Over the coming five years the region will build 15 civilian airports, bringing the total to 37. Links with other countries are being strengthened. Of the six trade corridors that form China’s Belt and Road Initiative, three pass through Xinjiang (see map). The dry ports of Khorgos and Alashan—both on the border with Kazakhstan—have become busy. Exports from the Kashgar area, which plunged by nearly 50% in 2018 at the height of the re-education detentions, have stabilised over the past year. A manager outside the Akto textile park brushes aside a question about American sanctions. “Our products aren’t for the West anyway. We sell to Pakistan and Kazakhstan,” he says.

The third element, promoting tourism, could reap considerable benefits. Revenues from tourism already amounted to a quarter of Xinjiang’s GDP before the pandemic. It also helps advertise China’s success in imposing stability. This year about 200m tourists are expected. By 2025 the government wants to double that number to 400m, almost all from China.
From Silk Road to theme park
The message that Xinjiang is stable may also encourage more people from China’s ethnic majority, the Han, to settle in the south, diluting its Uyghur culture. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a Han-dominated state-owned conglomerate that functions like a state within a state, says it wants to encourage “southward development”. The bingtuan, as it is known, offers subsidies to migrants from outside Xinjiang. In Caohu, a village run by the bingtuan south of Kashgar, a Han construction worker from Shaanxi province says he was given a house when he agreed to settle there permanently.
Two years ago armoured vehicles and paramilitary police were ubiquitous in Kashgar. Today the city looks less intimidating, but retains few reminders of Uyghur identity. Streets that once echoed with calls to prayer are lined with trinket stalls. In one mosque near the centre, the room where worshippers used to wash themselves has been turned into a tourist toilet.
On heavily stage-managed trips, China has started bringing foreign diplomats to Xinjiang. When consuls-general based in Shanghai from countries including Belarus, Cuba and Serbia visited in June, Kashgar looked more like a theme park than an ancient Silk Road city, with Uyghurs in bright clothes singing and dancing to welcome the visitors. “We have seen the great effort by the government to improve the lives of local people,” gushed the consul-general of Singapore, according to Xinjiang Daily, a state-run newspaper.
Yet even in economic terms, the government’s story is unconvincing. Cash is flooding into the region: investment in factories, roads and other fixed assets rose by 16% in 2020, more than five times faster than the national average. But Xinjiang’s economy grew by only 3%—a weak outcome, given such spending.
Officials may hope that Xinjiang will follow the model of coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang, where the path to prosperity began with factories that made cheap clothes and shoes. Yet the coast’s take-off was led by private entrepreneurs and made possible by a relatively free labour market. Uyghur workers, even if they are not in labour camps, cannot easily change jobs, let alone move around China without being hounded by police.
Many of the biggest investors in Xinjiang are state-owned firms, driven not by profit but by political duty. In the past Xinjiang had its own business leaders who were Uyghurs. But officials saw them as a threat. Many have disappeared into prisons and re-education camps. Far from laying a foundation for growth, the pursuit of such stability is more likely to end in stagnation. ■",2
1682,"Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin met in Geneva for a summit. It lasted less than four hours, but both men described it as constructive. The two sides agreed to return their ambassadors, who were recalled earlier this year, and said they would work on new nuclear-arms-control measures. Mr Biden criticised Russia’s human-rights record, but said the topic should be dealt with separately from other matters, such as security and climate change. Mr Putin denied that Russia engages in cyber-attacks.
China rejected criticism made by G7 countries at their summit in Britain. The G7 had called for peace in the Taiwan Strait and asked China to respect human rights, especially in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. A Chinese official said America was sick and the G7 should give it medicine. Meanwhile, 28 Chinese military aircraft flew into Taiwan’s airspace, more than had been recorded on any previous day.

China passed a law allowing its government to retaliate against sanctions imposed on it by other countries. Individuals or entities involved in implementing such sanctions could be put on a blacklist and have their assets in China seized. In Hong Kong the editor and four other people associated with the Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper, were arrested for publishing articles calling for sanctions against the city’s and mainland’s governments.
North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, warned that the country faced food shortages, which he blamed on flooding, covid-19 and sanctions.
Myanmar’s ruling junta put Aung San Suu Kyi on trial behind closed doors. The army, which took power in a coup in February, has charged the country’s former leader with seven crimes, including corruption and possessing walkie-talkies. If found guilty she faces decades in prison.
Tens of thousands of people rallied in Madrid against the government’s plan to pardon 12 separatists from Catalonia who were behind an illegal independence referendum in 2017. Nine of the separatists were found guilty of sedition, in what was Spain’s biggest political crisis for decades. Some 60% of Spaniards oppose their pardons.
At a referendum in Switzerland, voters narrowly rejected a plan to levy taxes on airline tickets and car fuel to tackle climate change, complicating the government’s ambitions under the Paris accord.
Boris Johnson postponed the final lifting of covid restrictions in England for what had been labelled “Freedom Day”. Cases of the Delta (Indian) variant are rising. Britain’s prime minister hopes that by July 19th two-thirds of the population will be fully vaccinated and restrictions can at last end. Meanwhile, it was reported that care-home staff will have to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs.
A judge found that Joe Biden may have exceeded his presidential powers when he stopped issuing licences to drill for oil and gas on federal land, one of his first orders as president. Granting an injunction against the order, the judge said that only Congress could take such action.
Another six opposition politicians were arrested in Nicaragua, bringing the total to 13 in recent weeks. They have chided President Daniel Ortega, who stands for re-election in November and seems determined to do anything to win.
Pedro Castillo, a hard-leftist, claimed victory in Peru’s presidential election. He finished 44,000 votes ahead of his rival, Keiko Fujimori, the hard-right daughter of a former president. She claims that the count was inflated by fraud and has promised to challenge the result in court.
Criminal violence in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, has led 8,500 people, mostly women and children, to flee their homes, according to Unicef. Some 14,000 people have been displaced.
Naftali Bennett was sworn in as prime minister of Israel, ending Binyamin Netanyahu’s 12 years in power. Mr Bennett faced an immediate test when Jewish nationalists marched through the Old City of Jerusalem, some chanting racist slogans. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, launched incendiary balloons at Israel, which responded with air strikes in Gaza. There were no casualties. It was their first big clash since last month.
Lebanon’s currency, which has lost more than 90% of its value since October 2019, hit a new low. The country is mired in an economic crisis that has left it short of basic goods such as fuel and medicine. Efforts to form a new government remain stalled.
America is considering a plan to send commandos back to Somalia. This would partly reverse a decision by Donald Trump, who withdrew all 700 American troops from the country. The soldiers would train Somali forces battling al-Shabab, a jihadist group.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organisation, warned that poor countries needed more vaccines for covid-19, and now, “not next year”. The G7 had just promised 1bn doses. At least 11bn will be required if 70% of the world’s population is to be vaccinated by the time the G7 meet again in 2022.
Coronavirus briefs

The number of infections continued to fall in India. Tourist attractions, including the Taj Mahal, re-opened to visitors. There are worries that easing restrictions will cause a new wave of cases.
Officials in Moscow told people to work from home, as new daily cases in the city leapt to their highest level since December.
California and New York lifted almost all their remaining restrictions. The number of new infections in both states are at their lowest levels since the start of the crisis.
Tanzania said it would release data on covid-19 infections for the first time in more than a year. This would make the IMF and World Bank more likely to disburse funds. Tanzania’s late president, John Magufuli, had halted the publication of such statistics. He also denied there was covid in his country, and said that vaccines did not work.",2
1683,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.

ON SEPTEMBER 2ND 1859 C.F. Herbert, prospecting for gold in south-eastern Australia, saw something sublime in the evening sky. “A scene of almost unspeakable beauty presented itself, lights of every imaginable colour were issuing from the southern heavens,” he would later recall. “The rationalist and pantheist saw nature in her most exquisite robes. The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and final dissolution.”
Those who saw cataclysm in the auroral display were not exactly wrong: just ahead of their time. The Carrington event, as the geomagnetic storm Herbert observed came to be known, was the result of 100m tonnes of charged particles thrown off by the Sun a few hours earlier slamming into Earth’s magnetosphere, a protective magnetic sheath generated by currents in the planet’s liquid core. The electromagnetic effects of the onslaught did not just produce a truly spectacular display of the Southern Lights (and the Northern ones, too, visible as far south as Colombia). They induced powerful currents in any electrical conductors to hand. Some telegraph networks took on a life of their own, no longer needing batteries to generate signals.

Such effects mattered little 20 years before the advent of the light bulb. In today’s ubiquitously, fundamentally and increasingly electrified world a “coronal mass ejection” (CME) as large as that of the Carrington event could cause all kinds of chaos. Induced currents would topple electrical grids. Satellites would have their circuitry fried or be dragged from the sky as the outer atmosphere, bloated by the storm’s energy, rose up towards them.
How bad the effects of an off-the-charts CME might prove is up for debate. Some say a really big storm would knock the power out in various places for a few hours, as a moderate one did in Quebec in 1989. Others predict something little short of the end of days. That the world will some day find out who is right, though, is beyond debate. Solar physicists put the odds of a Carrington-level geomagnetic storm some time in the next ten years at around one in ten. Eventually one will come.
Geomagnetic storms are one of a small set of events found in the historical and geological record that present plausible threats of catastrophe. Pandemics are another, giant volcanic eruptions a third. Seeing how well—or how poorly—countries are currently coping with the only one of these catastrophes of which they have prior experience raises the question of how they might cope with the others.
Technology plays a crucial role in the hazards such events generate. It can bring surcease, as a vaccine might for a pandemic. It can bring vulnerability, as electric grids have when it comes to geomagnetic storms. And it can also bring forth new risks of its own. The most obvious are the technologies of internal combustion and nuclear weaponry, which made possible catastrophic global warming and war on an unprecedented, environment-shattering scale. It is possible that further techno-disasters may lie ahead—and that they may be the most serious of all, putting the whole human future in jeopardy.
In a recent book, “The Precipice”, Toby Ord of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University defines an existential risk as one that “threatens the destruction of humanity’s long-term potential”. Some natural disasters could qualify. An impact like that of the 10km asteroid which ushered out the dinosaurs 66m years ago is one example. A burst of planet-scouring gamma rays from a nearby “hypernova” might be another. A volcanic “super-eruption” like the one at Yellowstone which covered half the continental United States with ash 630,000 years ago would probably not extinguish the human race; but it could easily bring civilisation to an end. Happily, though, such events are very rare. The very fact that humans have made it through hundreds of thousands of years of history and prehistory with their long-term potential intact argues that natural events which would end it all are not common.
Do you feel lucky, punk?
For already existing technologically mediated risks, such as those of nuclear war and climate collapse, there is no such reassuring record to point to, and Mr Ord duly rates them as having a higher chance of rising to the existential threat level. Higher still, he thinks, is the risk from technologies yet to come: advanced bioweapons which, unlike the opportunistic products of natural selection, are designed to be as devastating as possible; or artificial intelligences which, intentionally or incidentally, change the world in ways fundamentally inimical to their creators’ interests.
No one can calculate such risks, but it would be foolish to set them at exactly zero. Mr Ord reckons almost anyone looking at the century to come would have to concede “at least a one in 1,000 risk” of something like a runaway AI either completely eradicating humanity or permanently crippling its potential. His carefully reasoned, if clearly contestable, best guesses lead him to conclude that, taking all the risks he cites into account, the chances of humankind losing its future through such misadventure in the next 100 years stands at one in six. The roll of a single die; one spin of the revolver chamber.
Mr Ord is part of a movement which takes such gambles seriously in part because it sees the stakes as phenomenally high. Academics who worry about existential risk—the trend began, in its modern form, when Nick Bostrom, a Swedish philosopher, founded the Future of Humanity Institute in 2005—frequently apply a time-agnosticversion of utilitarianism which sees “humanity’s long-term potential” as something far grander than the lives of the billions on Earth today: trillions and trillions of happy lives of equal worth lived over countless millennia to come. By this logic actions which go even a minuscule way towards safeguarding that potential are precious beyond price. Mr Ord, one of the founders of the “effective altruism” movement, which advocates behaviour rooted in strongly evidence-based utilitarianism, sees a concern with existential risk as part of the same project.
Risks that are merely catastrophic, not existential, do not tend to be the subject of such philosophical rumination. They are more amenable to the sort of calculations found in the practice of politics and power. Take the risk of a nuclear attack. According to Ron Suskind, a reporter, in November 2001 Dick Cheney noted that America needed new ways to confront “low-probability, high-impact” events. “If there’s a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping al-Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon,” the vice-president said, “we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response”. Such responses included new wars, new government agencies (the Department of Homeland Security) and new executive powers, including warrantless surveillance.
If every perceived 1% risk were met with such vigour the world would be a very different place—and not necessarily a safer one. But it is striking that some risks of similar magnitude are barely thought about at all. Imagine Mr Cheney was considering the possibility of losing a city over a 20-year period. What else puts a city’s worth of people and capital at a 1% risk every few decades? The sort of catastrophic risks that crop up every millennium or so, threatening millions of lives and cost trillions. Perhaps they should be treated equally seriously. As Rumtin Sepasspour of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University puts it: “Governments need to think about security as just one category of risk.”
Carrington events are a good example. The most devastating effect of a really large CME would probably be on the transformers in electrical grids: gigantic, purpose-built machines that step voltage down between the long-range transmission grid and the distribution grid which runs lower-voltage power into homes, businesses and hospitals.
Strong enough induced currents could damage some of these transformers beyond repair. Because it typically takes between six and 12 months to get a replacement transformer made—and only a few countries have the industrial capacity to make them—that could leave grids crippled for some time. “If you simultaneously lose the ability to pump water, to pump fuel, to communicate, lose eyes in the sky, you pretty quickly get into territory that’s never really been explored before,” says Dan Baker, the director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Stockpiling backup transformers could help mitigate some of those problems. But large transformers are not commodity items. “They don’t have a big warehouse holding these things ready to roll out,” says Mr Baker. Redundant local supplies, such as backup generators, would also help. Mr Baker is not sure, though, that enough is being invested in them.
Sudden impact
In general, scientists and policy wonks who think about these things suspect that grid operators are not as prepared as they should be for a Carrington level storm. But some see progress. William Murtagh, who works at the Space Weather Prediction Centre in Boulder, says American policy on space weather has come a long way, to the point where there are now bipartisan bills going through Congress and that grid operators are being required to certify the excess voltages their systems can cope with.
America does, at least, have a solid plan: the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, published in March 2019. It also has an early warning system. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the space-weather centre in Boulder, also runs a satellite called DSCOVR. Rather than orbit the Earth, DSCOVR circles a point on a line between the Earth and the Sun—the point about 1.5m kilometres inward from Earth where the two bodies’ gravitational attractions balance each other out. Conceived of mainly as a way of looking back at an Earth spinning in eternal sunshine, DSCOVR also measures the stream of charged particles flowing past it from the Sun. When a storm passes by, the satellite’s operators down in Boulder will hear about its approach from DSCOVR between 15 minutes and an hour before the brunt of it hits the magnetosphere, depending on its speed.
There is little planning anywhere for what to do in response to a volcanic eruption large enough to cool and dry the climate around the world, as the eruption of Tambora, a volcano in Indonesia, did in 1815. The fact that the stratospheric sulphate particles which bring about such cooling leave a distinctive residue in glaciers and ice sheets reveals the frequency of these eruptions (see chart 1). But there is no pattern which says when another one might be due.

Careful remote monitoring of the world’s volcanoes, including those that are apparently dormant, should reveal if one is likely to blow in a big way. Again, satellites can play a key role. A technique called radar interferometry makes it possible to see when mountains start to deform as a result of the pressure of the magma building up beneath and within them. Scientists at the University of Bristol are using such data from past eruptions to train machine-learning systems on how to see future ones. Very large eruptions should be fairly easy to anticipate; but quite how large one will prove, and thus quite what effects to expect, will be hard to say in advance.
There are also projects devoted to looking for potentially hazardous asteroids. Here, though, the threat is not what it was. When people began to worry about asteroid impacts in the 1980s, the focus was on events smaller than the dinosaur-killer—too rare to worry about—but still big enough to disturb the climate in the way a very large volcanic eruption does, and thus do damage worldwide rather than just wiping clean some random, and probably sparsely inhabited, part of the planet’s surface. Theoretical models of the population of near-Earth objects suggested there might be 1,000 or so big enough to wreak such havoc, of which only a hundred or so had been discovered. Subsequent observation has found most of the rest of them, and they are all, at the moment, keeping a safe distance. As of 2019 the data suggested that only around 43 near-Earth objects of a potentially climate-changing stature were still to be discovered, according to Alan Harris of MoreData!, a research outfit.
As the need to worry about big asteroids has diminished, though, interest in spotting smaller ones has grown—as has an urge to be able to swat them aside. Next year America will launch a space mission called DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) which will change the orbit of a small asteroid orbiting a larger one, thus demonstrating the first step towards a “planetary defence” capability. It is an exciting, dramatic idea. If your aim were to effectively fund ways of lowering the death toll in future catastrophes, though, it would probably not strike you as the best use of $300m. Investing in early-warning systems for pandemics (see article) would seem a much better bet.
Every which way
It is possible to imagine better early-warning systems for pandemics, solar storms and volcanic eruptions, and carefully considered plans which would use that knowledge to reduce the hazard. What of the other big bads?

Existing anthropogenic risks are already quite well dealt with. There are aspects of climate change that could and should be better monitored—methane sources, for example, and changes in soil moisture—but the subject is hardly systematically understudied. It is in the nature of nuclear weaponry that its possessors spend a great deal of time monitoring each other’s capacities and intentions. As for those trying to develop nuclear weaponry covertly, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation operates a remarkably acute network of monitoring stations that brings together seismometers, radioisotope sensors and detectors of low-frequency sound waves which makes setting off a nuclear weapon of any size without being noticed effectively impossible.

Hazards that do not yet exist but may soon come to pass present a harder problem. The prospect of synthetic biology producing advanced bioweaponry is a fitting target for traditional intelligence methods, coupled with the sort of monitoring that might be used to detect novel natural pathogens, too. Countermeasures might emerge from “precision medicine” approaches built around platform therapies which can be reprogammed for various diseases. Deadly AIs, though, are a different kettle of pseudofish. Today’s AI systems, powerful as they are at recognising patterns, are worrying only to the extent that people use them in worrying ways; in themselves they are no more dangerous, or sentient, than stamp collections. That may change. Most in the field seem to think that one day AIs will be able to give humans a real run for their money. But their views as to when vary widely (see chart 2). Such disparity does not mean no threat will emerge. It does suggest that no one really knows what it may look like.
As a field and a threat, though, AI, like synthetic biology, does have the advantage of emerging from an open academic culture. Its expert practitioners eschew closed publication and discussion. This makes it plausible, at least, to monitor both fields.
Getting such risks taken seriously will never be easy. It is to some extent contrary to human nature. Humans assume that the future will be like the past; they prepare for things they have experience of. Mr Murtagh says that grid operators at high latitudes take solar storms more seriously than others do because of experiences like that of Quebec in 1989. Countries hit hard by SARS have, by and large, done better against covid-19 than those which never had to get to grips with the previous pandemic. When it comes to the truly novel, no one will have that core of experience to build on.
Where experience fails, though, science and imagination may sometimes fill in. Humans often look to the future like Herbert’s superstitious and fanatical mates staring up at the Carrington event’s strange skies, filled with “dire forebodings”. But it can be seen in other ways. You do not have to believe in trillions of people living the good life for ever. Just that there are things to come which are worth caring about, and worth protecting from those threats that reason reveals.■",2
1685,"CALL IT AN October surprise. Almost every day over the past two weeks countries across Asia have revealed plans to loosen pandemic-induced restrictions on inbound tourism. India went first, announcing on October 7th that it would at last resume issuing tourist visas for visitors from all countries on November 15th. Two days later Singapore expanded its quarantine-free travel lanes beyond just Germany and Brunei. Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thailand’s prime minister, said on October 11th that fully vaccinated tourists would be able to visit many parts of the country without quarantine from November 1st.
Several Indonesian islands, including Bali, opened up on October 14th. Malaysia’s prime minister hinted at a reopening in December. Fiji’s government said it wants people to spend Christmas there. Even parts of Australia, which has had among the harshest travel policies in the world, will welcome travellers again from next month. “For double-vaccinated people around the world, Sydney, New South Wales, is open for business,” said Dominic Perrottet, the state’s premier.

Yet India is an exception in throwing open its borders to all tourists. Most Asian countries welcoming travellers are doing so only for those from a carefully chosen list of countries, with acres of small print. Thailand initially planned to open its doors only to ten, mostly European countries. Bali is welcoming travellers from 19, half from Europe and none from its own region of South-East Asia. Singapore’s list has expanded from two to 11, with most in Europe, and even then only on designated flights. Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, threw cold water over Mr Perrottet’s reopening a few days later when he said that it will at first apply only to Australian citizens, residents and their families.
Indeed, the more reliant a country is on tourism, the greater seems to be its caution. In 2019 tourism made up about half of Fiji’s exports, a fifth of Thailand’s, and nearly a tenth of Malaysia’s. India, by contrast, relied on tourists for just 6% of exports. The share for Singapore is smaller still, but the city-state’s economic model depends on being open to the world. The announcements are less an indication of enthusiasm for welcoming visitors back than of the sense that it would be especially damaging to delay longer: now is when people book their winter holidays.
That is one reason why the reopening is so limited. Many Asian economies desperately need a decent season of inbound tourism but do not feel fully prepared to welcome lots of visitors. Even in Thailand, where tourism accounts for a fifth of jobs, 60% of people said in a recent survey that November 1st was too soon for the country to open up. Yet that must be balanced against people’s livelihoods. On October 21st Mr Prayuth announced that Thailand would in fact open to 46 countries, more than half of them European. “If we wait until everything is fully ready, we’ll be too late. Besides, tourists may choose to go elsewhere,” he wrote on Facebook.
A phased approach allows locals to get used to the idea of tourists again. It will also help businesses, which must refill their swimming pools and rehire workers after nearly two years of closures. Taking things slowly is useful for governments, too, which are watching covid-19 case numbers and worry that they may need to throttle back.
“The first markets to open up will be vulnerable to overtourism,” says Liz Ortiguera of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, an industry body. The choice of European countries may in part reflect that concern. The vast majority of tourists in Asia come from other Asian countries, who tend to make shorter trips and therefore spend less per visit. Europeans and Americans, having travelled all the way, often stay longer and spend more freely, says David Vanzetti of the University of Western Australia. As countries re-open, they are trying to maximise profits while keeping visitor numbers manageable.
The near-total halt in travel and tourism caused by the pandemic is unique in being caused by a lack of supply rather than demand, says Xiang “Robert” Li of US-Asia Center for Tourism  Hospitality Research at Temple University in Philadelphia. People still want to travel, and will get back on the road as soon as they are allowed. After past crises, such as the SARS outbreak in 2002-04, travel recovered domestically at first, then regionally and eventually across long distances. The same will be true this time, perhaps even more so after nearly two years of public-health messages that painted the outside world as a mortal threat. “We used to take travel for granted,” says Mr Li. But after 18 months of being grounded, “we realise that tourism is not just superficial fun. It actually is part of the contemporary lifestyle and has a lot to do with our well-being, who we are, and how to be happy.”

Editor’s note (October 21st): This piece has been updated to include Thailand’s announcement that residents of several dozen more countries would be allowed to enter from November 1st. It has also been corrected to note that they can travel only to certain parts of the country.

1686,"Washington, DC (CNN)Westport, Connecticut police chief Foti Koskinas would love it if his patrol cars could drive themselves, but his department isn't buying Teslas equipped with ""full self-driving.""  Local governments like Westport and businesses big and small sing the benefits of electric vehicles like Teslas. Westport has saved thousands on fuel and maintenance since purchasing a Model 3 in 2019. Police departments are among the fleet operators that are increasingly turning to electric vehicles for the economic and environmental benefits. Koskinas said he's received more than 500 inquiries from departments around the world asking about Westport's use of electric vehicles.  Westport has saved nearly $7,000 a year on fuel and maintenance costs, he said. There could be more savings coming. Westport expects to save $5,000 a vehicle if it can use Tesla's on-car computer, rather than installing its own for critical features like scanning license plates, controlling lights and sirens, and radioing colleagues. Discussions are on-going between Westport and Tesla, Koskinas said. But for all their Tesla enthusiasm, there's one feature they overwhelmingly aren't touching — ""full self-driving."" Some say the technology isn't ready yet.  The $10,000 optional software feature includes driver-assist features that Tesla hopes will one day allow the cars to drive themselves. (The price is likely to increase, as it has in the past, so the best time to buy is likely now, for those who believe in the technology's future.) Not all Teslas have ""full self-driving."" Currently, ""full self-driving"" is available in Beta form and has only been released to a limited group of people. It can change lanes in some cases, respond to most traffic signals and steer the car.  The technology is far from perfect and requires an attentive driver behind the wheel to take control at a moment's notice. It ""may do the wrong thing at the worst time,"" Tesla warns.  Koskinas can envision the benefits if his department's cars could be trusted to drive responsibly, always doing the right thing. He said officers responding to incidents sometimes end up riding in an ambulance to a hospital, to offer support. But they must leave their patrol car behind.  ""How great if that vehicle drives itself to the hospital and meets the officer there?"" he said.  If Teslas could do that, he might buy ""full self-driving,"" he said.   ""We're just not there,"" Koskinas said of the technology today. The ""full-self driving"" option can be added to Teslas in the future even if it is not purchased at the time of sale.  Westport, Connecticut is one of six police departments that told CNN Business that they have purchased at least one Tesla, but not the ""full self-driving"" feature.  Police departments aren't the only ones taking a pass. Hertz announced in October it will purchase 100,000 Teslas, but not ""full self-driving."" Brightline, the private train operator in Florida, has a Tesla fleet of nearly 50 vehicles to give passengers rides to its train stations, which reopened this month. Revel, a mobility startup, started using Tesla Model Ys to offer rides in Manhattan this year.  Most of the Tesla buyers decline to say why they are not buying ""full self-driving."" But the technology's limits appear clear and are likely a factor. Thilo Koslowski, a consultant at AutoDGTL focused on automotive technology, told CNN Business that ""full self-driving"" is not currently a good value for fleet operators, given the technology's limits and its cost. ""They're not gaining the benefits they're looking for,"" Koslowski said. ""It's not full self-driving. It becomes a question of if it's worthwhile to spend the money."" Fleet operators want safer driving and more productive vehicles, according to Koslowski. He said there is no objective data proving that ""full self-driving"" is safer than a human driver. ""Full self-driving"" has not been shown to make Teslas today more productive, he said. Fleet operators could theoretically face liability risks if ""full self-driving"" would be active during a crash, according to Koslowski. ""That risk overshadows any potential benefits you could get from this,"" Koslowski said. ""It's such a murky gray area that I think the risk is way too high for rental companies to do that.""  The technology's limitations have been documented. Tesla drivers testing ""full self-driving"" have described it as inconsistent, sometimes impressing them, other times alarming them. Videos shot by drivers using Teslas with ""full self-driving"" show that it can brake and turn unexpectedly, and sometimes drive down the middle of the road rather than making space for other drivers.  Several Teslas using ""full self-driving"" have crashed into curbs, damaging the cars' wheels. A person who identified themselves as a Tesla owner reported to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration this month that their Tesla had been severely damaged after crashing into a vehicle while using ""full self-driving."" The agency is seeking more information about the crash, according to spokesperson Lucia Sanchez.  Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk has alluded to the limits of ""full self-driving.""   ""We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition,"" he said on a Tesla earnings call this summer.  At the time he also questioned the merits of paying for a subscription version of ""full self-driving."" Then drivers with ""full self-driving"" were receiving a limited set of features, like automated lane changes.  ""Like right now, is it -- does it make sense for somebody to do [full self-driving] subscription? I think it's debatable. But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear,"" Musk said.  Tesla has repeatedly missed deadlines on when it expects its autonomous system to be widely deployed and has not issued a recent estimate for a broad deployment of ""full self-driving.""  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment and generally does not engage with the professional news media.  ",0
1687,"SOMETHING HAS gone very wrong with Western liberalism. At its heart classical liberalism believes human progress is brought about by debate and reform. The best way to navigate disruptive change in a divided world is through a universal commitment to individual dignity, open markets and limited government. Yet a resurgent China sneers at liberalism for being selfish, decadent and unstable. At home, populists on the right and left rage at liberalism for its supposed elitism and privilege.
Over the past 250 years classical liberalism has helped bring about unparalleled progress. It will not vanish in a puff of smoke. But it is undergoing a severe test, just as it did a century ago when the cancers of Bolshevism and fascism began to eat away at liberal Europe from within. It is time for liberals to understand what they are up against and to fight back.

Nowhere is the fight fiercer than in America, where this week the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a draconian and bizarre anti-abortion law. The most dangerous threat in liberalism’s spiritual home comes from the Trumpian right. Populists denigrate liberal edifices such as science and the rule of law as façades for a plot by the deep state against the people. They subordinate facts and reason to tribal emotion. The enduring falsehood that the presidential election in 2020 was stolen points to where such impulses lead. If people cannot settle their differences using debate and trusted institutions, they resort to force.
The attack from the left is harder to grasp, partly because in America “liberal” has come to include an illiberal left. We describe this week how a new style of politics has recently spread from elite university departments. As young graduates have taken jobs in the upmarket media and in politics, business and education, they have brought with them a horror of feeling “unsafe” and an agenda obsessed with a narrow vision of obtaining justice for oppressed identity groups. They have also brought along tactics to enforce ideological purity, by no-platforming their enemies and cancelling allies who have transgressed—with echoes of the confessional state that dominated Europe before classical liberalism took root at the end of the 18th century.
Superficially, the illiberal left and classical liberals like The Economist want many of the same things. Both believe that people should be able to flourish whatever their sexuality or race. They share a suspicion of authority and entrenched interests. They believe in the desirability of change.

However, classical liberals and illiberal progressives could hardly disagree more over how to bring these things about. For classical liberals, the precise direction of progress is unknowable. It must be spontaneous and from the bottom up—and it depends on the separation of powers, so that nobody nor any group is able to exert lasting control. By contrast the illiberal left put their own power at the centre of things, because they are sure real progress is possible only after they have first seen to it that racial, sexual and other hierarchies are dismantled.
This difference in method has profound implications. Classical liberals believe in setting fair initial conditions and letting events unfold through competition—by, say, eliminating corporate monopolies, opening up guilds, radically reforming taxation and making education accessible with vouchers. Progressives see laissez-faire as a pretence which powerful vested interests use to preserve the status quo. Instead, they believe in imposing “equity”—the outcomes that they deem just. For example, Ibram X. Kendi, a scholar-activist, asserts that any colour-blind policy, including the standardised testing of children, is racist if it ends up increasing average racial differentials, however enlightened the intentions behind it.
Mr Kendi is right to want an anti-racist policy that works. But his blunderbuss approach risks denying some disadvantaged children the help they need and others the chance to realise their talents. Individuals, not just groups, must be treated fairly for society to flourish. Besides, society has many goals. People worry about economic growth, welfare, crime, the environment and national security, and policies cannot be judged simply on whether they advance a particular group. Classical liberals use debate to hash out priorities and trade-offs in a pluralist society and then use elections to settle on a course. The illiberal left believe that the marketplace of ideas is rigged just like all the others. What masquerades as evidence and argument, they say, is really yet another assertion of raw power by the elite.
Progressives of the old school remain champions of free speech. But illiberal progressives think that equity requires the field to be tilted against those who are privileged and reactionary. That means restricting their freedom of speech, using a caste system of victimhood in which those on top must defer to those with a greater claim to restorative justice. It also involves making an example of supposed reactionaries, by punishing them when they say something that is taken to make someone who is less privileged feel unsafe. The results are calling-out, cancellation and no-platforming.
Milton Friedman once said that the “society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither”. He was right. Illiberal progressives think they have a blueprint for freeing oppressed groups. In reality theirs is a formula for the oppression of individuals—and, in that, it is not so very different from the plans of the populist right. In their different ways both extremes put power before process, ends before means and the interests of the group before the freedom of the individual.
Countries run by the strongmen whom populists admire, such as Hungary under Viktor Orban and Russia under Vladimir Putin, show that unchecked power is a bad foundation for good government. Utopias like Cuba and Venezuela show that ends do not justify means. And nowhere at all do individuals willingly conform to state-imposed racial and economic stereotypes.
When populists put partisanship before truth, they sabotage good government. When progressives divide people into competing castes, they turn the nation against itself. Both diminish institutions that resolve social conflict. Hence they often resort to coercion, however much they like to talk about justice.
If classical liberalism is so much better than the alternatives, why is it struggling around the world? One reason is that populists and progressives feed off each other pathologically. The hatred each camp feels for the other inflames its own supporters—to the benefit of both. Criticising your own tribe’s excesses seems like treachery. Under these conditions, liberal debate is starved of oxygen. Just look at Britain, where politics in the past few years was consumed by the rows between uncompromising Tory Brexiteers and the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.
Aspects of liberalism go against the grain of human nature. It requires you to defend your opponents’ right to speak, even when you know they are wrong. You must be willing to question your deepest beliefs. Businesses must not be sheltered from the gales of creative destruction. Your loved ones must advance on merit alone, even if all your instincts are to bend the rules for them. You must accept the victory of your enemies at the ballot box, even if you think they will bring the country to ruin.
In short, it is hard work to be a genuine liberal. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, when their last ideological challenger seemed to crumble, arrogant elites lost touch with liberalism’s humility and self-doubt. They fell into the habit of believing they were always right. They engineered America’s meritocracy to favour people like them. After the financial crisis, they oversaw an economy that grew too slowly for people to feel prosperous. Far from treating white working-class critics with dignity, they sneered at their supposed lack of sophistication.
This complacency has let opponents blame lasting imperfections on liberalism—and, because of the treatment of race in America, to insist the whole country was rotten from the start. In the face of persistent inequality and racism, classical liberals can remind people that change takes time. But Washington is broken, China is storming ahead and people are restless.
A liberal lack of conviction
The ultimate complacency would be for classical liberals to underestimate the threat. Too many right-leaning liberals are inclined to choose a shameless marriage of convenience with populists. Too many left-leaning liberals focus on how they, too, want social justice. They comfort themselves with the thought that the most intolerant illiberalism belongs to a fringe. Don’t worry, they say, intolerance is part of the mechanism of change: by focusing on injustice, they shift the centre ground.
Yet it is precisely by countering the forces propelling people to the extremes that classical liberals prevent the extremes from strengthening. By applying liberal principles, they help solve society’s many problems without anyone resorting to coercion. Only liberals appreciate diversity in all its forms and understand how to make it a strength. Only they can deal fairly with everything from education to planning and foreign policy so as to release people’s creative energies. Classical liberals must rediscover their fighting spirit. They should take on the bullies and cancellers. Liberalism is still the best engine for equitable progress. Liberals must have the courage to say so. ■",2
1688,"PERHAPS JETBLUE believes that the sky is darkest before dawn. On August 11th America’s sixth-biggest airline, known for its no-frills domestic services, launched its first transatlantic flights, between New York and London. The timing seems plucky. America has yet to follow European countries in lifting tough pandemic-era cross-border travel restrictions. Industry insiders think that long-haul travel will be the last sort to rebound. And low-cost intercontinental travel has historically been a tough business. Can JetBlue crack it?
The flight path of failure can be tracked from Freddie Laker’s Skytrain in the 1970s, via People Express, Tower Air and Air Berlin, to the more recent hard landings for Denmark’s Primera Air in 2018 and Iceland’s WOW in 2019. Norwegian Air Shuttle, which had captured a third of the worldwide low-cost-long-haul market, gave up on it in January, a victim of reckless expansion as much as of covid-19. Even survivors have little to shout about. Malaysia’s AirAsia X has made an annual pre-tax profit only twice since it went public in 2013.

Budget airlines have transformed short-haul flying by running simple point-to-point operations that eschew the hassle of connecting passengers across a complex network. They keep aeroplanes in the air for longer each day than full-service rivals do, fly from less popular airports at ungodly hours when charges are lower, cram punters into minimal legroom, charge extra for every tiny comfort and keep labour costs down by employing fewer and cheaper staff.
These tricks do not translate well to long-haul travel. Sweating costly assets is harder on a ten-hour journey crossing several time zones than when darting around a region with fast turnaround times. That makes it difficult to schedule flights to take off and land at those odder, cheaper times. And exhausted crew must be accommodated in hotels rather than being immediately rostered back to their own beds at the end of the day.
JetBlue thinks it can overcome these obstacles. In contrast to Norse Atlantic, a new carrier that thinks it can make better use of the wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliner, 15 of which it is now leasing, the American airline is using a new breed of aircraft, the Airbus A321LR. This is a long-range version of the European planemaker’s single-aisle short-haul workhorse. These are cheaper than wide-body jets. They are also smaller, and so easier to fill.
And JetBlue has another card to play. The standard business of long-haul flying makes competing on price difficult. Full-service airlines rely on selling lucrative business-class seats at the front of the plane for the bulk of their revenues and profits. As a result, they can afford to sell economy seats relatively cheaply. Unlike most earlier low-cost efforts, JetBlue’s planes will include 24 business seats which should plump up margins. To attract business passengers it has steered clear of remote airports that executives dislike and picked up slots at Heathrow freed up by pandemic flight cuts.
JetBlue plans a further service to London Gatwick starting in September and from Boston to London next summer. Norse intends to fly between several European and American destinations. But full-service carriers will not take the challenge on their most lucrative routes lying down. American carriers succeeded in lobbying their domestic regulators to slow Norwegian’s expansion. Incumbents including IAG, owner of British Airways, have launched their own low-cost-long-haul subsidiaries. Laker offers a sobering lesson. He successfully sued several legacy airlines for predatory pricing—but only after he had been forced out of business. ■

1689,"Annastacia Palaszczuk was the target of a vicious slur from a fired up protestor at an  anti-lockdown march in Brisbane. 
A large crowd gathered at the Botanic Garden on Saturday as part of a co-ordinated nationwide protest against pandemic laws and vaccine mandates. 
During the protest, which was streamed on Facebook by attendee Justin Allen from the Botanic Gardens, a man could be heard yelling 'hang the b*tch'. 

The remark came after announcers asked the crowd what they thought of Ms Palaszczuk. 
There were other ugly scenes at the event, including a man toting a noose.
Announcers were seen asking the man clutching the noose to take it back to his car, telling him in no uncertain terms to 'take that crap down … this is not the place for stuff like that' before adding 'we don't want that crap here.'
The move was widely applauded by the majority of attendees.
Former MP Clive Palmer spoke at the rally in Brisbane, telling the crowd not to vote for major political parties at the next election.
He criticised a number of politicians, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison who he said has 'abandoned Australia'.
The ugly threat directed at the Queensland Premier comes after local MP Brittany Lauga contacted police this week after she and other members of state parliament received an email with 'threats of terrorism, extremism and violence'.
'I understand local doctors have been sent death threats and other threatening letters,' she wrote on Twitter.
'I unequivocally condemn these threats of violence, terrorism and extremism.'
Saturday incident in the heart of Brisbane involving the threat to Ms Palaszczuk followed a similar protest in Melbourne this week.
A gallows and noose were strategically placed outside Victorian parliament, with a prop of Premier Daniel Andrews nearby.
Mr Andrews was unimpressed by the stunt and called out the Prime Minister for pandering to extremists.
He told Channel 9 he has been subjected to personal threats, with his wife and kids also caught up in the drama. 
Mr Morrison on Friday condemned the protests, but 'understood' why scores of protesters were frustrated.
'I don't have sympathy for violence, I don't have sympathy for threats,' he said.
'I have sympathy for Australians who have had a gutful of governments telling them what to do over the last two years.'
Earlier on Saturday, anti-coronavirus vaccine mandate protests drew large crowds across Australia, with tens of thousands marching through city streets.
The rallies, purportedly part of a global 'freedom' movement, were also widely attended in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide.
In Melbourne, a crowd began to mass outside Victoria's parliament before midday and walked to Flagstaff Gardens.
The demonstrators opposed Covid-19 vaccines, mandates and the state's proposed pandemic laws, which stalled in the upper house this week.
Watched on by police, they chanted 'kill the bill' and yelled 'sack Dan Andrews' while carrying placards featuring a range of anti-government and anti-vaccine mandate slogans.
The crowd grew to several thousand at the gardens, where a band played John Farnham's You're the Voice.
In Sydney, police say about 10,000 protesters marched through the city centre to voice their concerns, while smaller, unauthorised protests also took place at Newtown and Newcastle.
No arrests were made and no infringement notices were issued.
'Overall, the protests were conducted peacefully with minimal disruption to the community, and I'm pleased to see that the vast majority of people complied with police directions,' NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell said.
The sound of bagpipes echoed through York St in Sydney's CBD as a man dressed in white screamed 'destroy the new world order' and others chanted 'walk with us'.
United Australia Party leader and federal MP Craig Kelly addressed the crowd at Martin Place after attending a Melbourne protest last weekend.
'We will hold every politician and every bureaucrat responsible for forcing injections upon the Australia population,' he said, drawing chants of 'sack them all'.",-2
1690,"FRENCH OFFICIALDOM is abuzz with preparations for the PFUE, which the MEAE and SGAE are organising for the PR in 2022. Lost? Spare a thought for the outsider who must daily navigate the French passion for acronyms and initialisms. All countries use them, but France has a particular penchant. The latest (PFUE) refers to the French Presidency of the European Union, which starts in January 2022 (and is in fact the presidency of the Council of the European Union). No matter. The abbreviation is already everywhere, and, as the opening sentence says, officials from the foreign ministry and a secretariat in the prime minister’s office are preparing this occasion for the president.
The preference of the French for abbreviations is so ingrained that they scarcely notice it. Britain may have its NHS, or America NASA. France has them for every part of life: transport (TGV, RER, SNCF), politics (PS, EELV, LREM, LFI, RN (formerly the FN) and LR), unions (CGT, CFDT), work (SMIC, CDD, CDI, CSE, RTT), the police (BRI, RAID), taxes (CSG, URSSAF, IFI). The principle seems simple: why use a word like budget when an abbreviation like PLF (projet de loi de finances) will do?

What is behind this zeal? Some date it to the organisation of the modern state in the late 19th century, when bodies such as unions (CGT) or the political movements that later joined together as the SFIO, the precursor to the Socialist Party (PS), emerged, and with them the complex names that deserved shortening. Perhaps it is also the result of the state’s tendency to bureaucratic complication; an acronym can simplify rather than confuse. So the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (the national railway) becomes the less indigestible SNCF.
The fact that practitioners of such an elegant language infect it with such abominations has not gone unnoticed. The Académie Française, which polices such matters, recommends that when it comes to acronyms “moderation is a good thing and abuse dangerous.” Curiously, one of the few spheres in which the French leave prolix descriptions alone is food. No CDC for confit de canard, nor BDV for blanquette de veau. Organisational or bureaucratic life, it seems, is to be tolerated and shortened. Gastronomy can take its time.
Correction (November 1st 2021): The PFUE refers to the presidency of the Council of the European Union, rather than the presidency of the European Council as we originally stated.",2

Maybe you showed up late then too and you didn't hear me,"" Moreno said to Mandel.Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, and his support could be key in the competitive primary.""The President is very popular in Ohio, rightfully so. He did some great things for Ohio. He did some great things for the country, so of course we welcome his endorsement, much like the Democrats would welcome Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton's endorsement and Barack Obama's endorsement,"" Moreno told CNN. Vance -- once a Trump critic who wrote in a since-deleted tweet that Trump was ""reprehensible"" -- now emphatically praises the former President. The Middletown native views focusing intensely on cultural conflicts as the path to victory for Republicans across the country. ""For so long, I think Republican officials have been worried that the culture wars are the electoral enemy or at least a weakness for them, and yet it turns out that a lot of our voters are voting around things like whether their kids are being indoctrinated in schools or whether their kids are being told that there are 40 or 50 or 80 genders,"" Vance told the far-right media outlet Breitbart News earlier this month.Vance declined CNN's requests for an interview. Shannon Burns, who leads the Republican Party in Strongsville, said he is leery of Vance's reversal.""I'm suspicious. I think everyone should be suspicious. You hear it, in his own words, what he was saying against President Trump in a way that wasn't policy-driven. He was clearly a self-proclaimed never Trumper,"" he said.Burns credits Trump with transforming the GOP in the Buckeye State.""He has done something for the Republican Party in Ohio that no other candidate has ever been able to do. And that is decisively turn Ohio from what was a purple state, or in some years maybe a blue state, to a hard red state,"" said Burns.Timken suggested she's working to build a coalition that includes both Trump loyalists and non-Trump Republicans.""I am the candidate that can build a winning coalition of the Trump supporters and the education parents and bring back those suburban voters ... in order to not only win a primary but win the general election. You have to be a candidate of addition,"" Timken said Tuesday in an interview in her Columbus campaign office. Her office includes a picture of her with Trump and a large cartoonish banner with the 45th President atop a military-style tank surrounded by fireworks and the American flag.Timken said that top of mind for Ohio voters are inflation and the state of the economy. She took a subtle dig at the more incendiary tactics of her rivals:""You can't win a race in Ohio on Twitter. That's not how you win races in Ohio. ... Saying outrageous things to garner attention is not how I'm going to run this race and not how I'm going to win this race.""Dolan is the only Republican candidate not seeking Trump's endorsement. He doesn't criticize the former President but says the race should be narrowly focused on policy.""President Trump's not going to vote in May of 2022; Ohio Republicans are going to go to vote. And when they look at what I've been able to do, my conservative results here in the state Senate ... they're going to see that those are good Republican ideals that help Ohio grow,"" Dolan said to CNN.",0
1692,"BENGALURU, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Setting the global average price of carbon per tonne significantly higher at $100 or more is necessary right away to incentivise net zero emissions by 2050, according to a Reuters poll of climate economists.
Carbon pricing has come to the forefront of policy measures seen as ways to reduce emissions to a level consistent with the Paris Agreement target of less than 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of warming.
The G20 group of large economies recognized carbon pricing for the first time as a possible tool at a meeting in Venice in Italy this year.  read more 
A higher price for carbon is seen as essential to fund the transition to net zero emissions by 2050, which is estimated to cost $44 trillion or 2%-3% of annual global GDP.  read more 
The International Monetary Fund has recommended a global average carbon price of $75 per tonne by the end of the decade.
But that figure should be at least $100, and right away, to reach net zero emissions by 2050, according to the median view of about 30 climate economists from around the world polled from Sept. 16 to Oct. 20 ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow.
That is significantly higher than where most countries who set the price currently have it, including among high carbon emitters.
Nearly 70% of respondents - 19 of 28 - said the cost of carbon per tonne should be above $75, of whom 17 suggested $100 or above. While six respondents agreed with the IMF recommendation, only three believed it should be lower than $75. Recommendations ranged from $50 to $250.
""Current carbon prices in G20 economies are between $3-$60 per tonne of carbon emissions, but many large emerging economies like Brazil, India, Indonesia still have no carbon prices,"" said Patrick Saner, head of macro strategy at Swiss Re.
""We also need to recognize that carbon pricing in itself is no silver bullet.""
The top three largest emitters - China, the United States and India - account for approximately half of global carbon emissions today.
According to the International Energy Agency, current carbon pledges by governments are insufficient to reach targets, and closing the gap would need the global average price of carbon to be much higher than what the IMF recommends.
Indeed, Julien Holtz, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, argues the global average carbon price per tonne is really only around $2 given only about 20% of global emissions are currently covered by actual carbon pricing schemes.
While China, the biggest carbon emitter, kicked off its emission trading system on July 16, with an opening price of 48 yuan ($7.51) per tonne, the U.S. and India still do not have a national carbon pricing market mechanism.  read more 
Even the European Union, at the forefront of reducing carbon emissions, has set the carbon price at a little more than half the poll's recommendation. Benchmark carbon prices in the EU Emission Trading System , the first such system, were last trading at 57.78 euros ($67.26) as of Oct. 20.
The EU price is expected to average around 55.88 euros ($65.07) and 69.87 euros ($81.36) per tonne this year and next, according to a separate Reuters poll.  read more 
Wide economic disparities pose a major challenge to all countries agreeing to a uniformly high global carbon price, which partly explains the wide range of recommendations provided by climate economists to reach net zero by 2050.
With most emerging and some developed countries' continued reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources to meet their energy demands, a high carbon price will be hard to sustain.
""It should start modestly but (be) sufficient to push out coal in the electricity merit order, at least partially,"" said Charles Kolstad, professor of economics at Stanford University.
Despite being crucial to fight climate change, experts say carbon pricing alone is not enough.
""While carbon prices in the major world economies are necessary, they are not by themselves sufficient to deliver net zero economies by 2050,"" said Jon Stenning, associate director and head of environment at Cambridge Econometrics.
""The key issue is the need for supporting fiscal and regulatory policy, in addition to carbon pricing to ensure that economies can decarbonise at the pace required.""

1693,"WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Mobile phone companies advertise high-speed 5G service with U.S. maps splashed with pink or blue to suggest widespread coverage, but the latest generation wireless technology is actually only available less than a third of the time in the best served states, new data shows.
5G technology was designed to be faster than 4G wireless, with so little latency to help make things like driverless cars possible. 5G running on low band spectrum is the slowest, but it has the advantage of considerable range while mid-band can't travel as far, but is faster. High band spectrum, which is sparsely available, may travel only a mile but is by far the fastest.
An analysis done by OpenSignal released on Thursday found that their testers connected with T-Mobile 5G just 34.7% of the time, AT&T 16.4% of the time and Verizon just 9.7%. And that's generally not for the fastest 5G many expect.
For a graphic, click here
The numbers are in stark contrast to what the carriers promise about 5G in their advertisements, showing how much they are banking on 5G as a selling point in the hotly-contested market for cellular service.
T-Mobile advertises that it has ""America's largest, fastest, and most reliable 5G network"" with a map covered almost completely in pink, suggesting broad coverage. The map does not distinguish what type of 5G a customer will get, but the fine print states its a mix of lower-performing versions. Top-performing ""ultra capacity"" 5G coverage, meanwhile, is only available in ""hundreds of cities and (for) millions of people"" instead of most of the country.
AT&T says it has the ""most reliable 5G network,"" citing a test done for AT&T by Global Wireless Solutions, which evaluates mobile networks. The company notes, however, that its high speed 5G+ is ""available in select high-speed zones and venues in over 20 states across the U.S.""
Asked about what appears to be a disparity between advertising and coverage, T-Mobile's Grant Castle, a vice president in network engineering, said that he thought the company is doing well.
""Is our network as big and broad as I would like it to be? No, we're still working on it,"" said Castle.
Andre Fuetsch, chief technical officer, Network Services at AT&T, said in an emailed statement that 5G ""is still early in its lifecycle and is being evolved and enhanced through ongoing investment and innovation.""
The BBB National Programs' National Advertising Division has criticized claims made about 5G by all three of the companies, including one in August that prompted Verizon to change its claim about it being the ""most reliable"" to indicate that it did not specifically refer to 5G service.
""5G right now is (in) the fake it until you make it stage,"" said Harold Feld, of advocacy group Public Knowledge which promotes affordable communication, adding that when new technology is developed, advertising often gets ahead of actual deployment.
Low income neighborhoods, and to some extent rural areas, are generally the last to get new technology, said Christopher Mitchell of the advocacy group Institute for Local Self Reliance.
Mitchell said that what is touted as 5G in rural areas is often just ""incrementally faster 4G.""
""We're not expecting to see the super fast 5G in many rural areas. T-Mobile has been better about that,"" he said. ""I feel like there's been a lot of dishonesty in the advertising.""
Internationally, the story is similar. South Korea tops the list of best 5G availability at 28.1% of the time, with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Hong Kong all above 25%, according to an OpenSignal report from early September.",3
1694,"BREXIT BATTLES are back. And not surprisingly the biggest is over Northern Ireland, the hardest issue in previous negotiations. It was supposedly solved in the withdrawal treaty of 2020 by the Northern Ireland protocol, which averts a hard border with the Republic of Ireland by keeping the North in the EU’s single market and customs union for goods, even though Great Britain is out of both. But that inevitably means border and customs controls between the two, in the Irish Sea. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) complains that 20% of EU border checks in the first quarter were in Northern Ireland, and wants the protocol scrapped. In July the British government proposed instead a radical revision that would dispense with almost all controls.
On October 13th the European Commission offered a compromise to keep the protocol but pare back checks, notably for chilled meats and medicines, and scrap those on products clearly destined for consumption in Northern Ireland. It claims this would end half today’s controls. Yet as in a game of chicken, Lord Frost, Boris Johnson’s EU negotiator, pre-empted this offer a day earlier by reiterating his demand for a complete rewrite of the protocol, placing much emphasis on British insistence, on grounds of sovereignty, on eliminating the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing it.

The protocol was central to the Brexit deal that Mr Johnson presented to voters in December 2019 as a triumph, because it got rid of the Northern Irish backstop negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May. That would have kept the whole of the United Kingdom in a customs union with the EU. Mr Johnson said his deal gave Northern Ireland the best of both worlds. But Lord Frost now says the protocol was accepted at a moment of negotiating weakness and has proved unsustainable. The suspicion in the EU is that the government acted in bad faith by agreeing to the protocol with no intention of applying it—a notion confirmed this week by Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s then chief of staff.
Flouting one treaty hardly makes it easier to win agreement to another. And it is also unlikely that the EU could accept the removal of the ECJ, which is essential to the single market’s legal order. Other countries might then seek similar treatment. It was Mr Johnson and Lord Frost who rejected alternatives: not only Mrs May’s backstop but also the Norwegian one of joining the EFTA court that mirrors the ECJ or a Swiss-style veterinary deal to avoid food checks. And despite the DUP’s campaign, business and most voters in Northern Ireland support an improved protocol if uncertainty over its future can be settled. There is no popular demand to scrap the ECJ’s role.
Now weeks of talks will start. Brussels is wary of a British habit of pocketing concessions only to ask for more. Trust is lacking all round. Lord Frost’s labelling of Britain’s EU membership as a “bad dream” rankles. So do his threats to invoke Article 16, which allows unilateral suspension of parts of the protocol if trade is badly disrupted. It is unclear how this would help either to increase certainty or to end the ECJ’s involvement. It might well trigger retaliation, including suspension of part or all of Britain’s trade deal with the EU. Unilaterally stopping controls on goods flowing to Northern Ireland might force a hard north-south border instead. And Mij Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, notes that, if this is rejected on political grounds, it would create pressure for customs controls between Ireland and the rest of the EU, which would be unacceptable to Dublin as well as the EU.
Better than risking a trade war would be to co-operate on simplifying checks under the existing protocol. Yet Mr Johnson and Lord Frost believe that bloody-mindedness towards the EU is the only way to win out. The evidence for this is thin: it was Britain, not the EU, that made the most concessions in the withdrawal treaty and trade agreement. Perhaps more worrying is the view that fights with the EU may bolster domestic support for Mr Johnson’s government, just as they may for the DUP in Northern Ireland, which faces a tough election battle against other unionist parties and Sinn Fein, the main nationalist one, next May. This winter may be frosty. ■

1695,"A new zebra crossing which lights up as pedestrians approach it is the first in the UK.
The innovative new concept in Portsmouth, Hampshire has LED panels installed in the road surface and illuminates as pedestrians walk towards it.
It was developed to make zebra crossings safer as it makes pedestrians more visible to approaching drivers at night.
The new crossing system will be monitored and the concept could be replicated across other parts of the city if it's successful.  
Portsmouth City Council's cabinet member for traffic and transportation, Councillor Lynne Stagg, said: 'We are always looking for new ways to improve road safety and I'm delighted we're the first place in the UK to use this innovative new technology.
'We chose this crossing because it's very busy particularly at night with all the nearby bars and restaurants, we want to make the crossing more visible and encourage more people to cross there safely.
'We always tell people to make themselves as visible as possible, it's a really simple way to improve safety and lighting up this crossing is a great example of how that can work.'
Road contractor Colas developed the lighting system, which worked with the local council and the Department of Transport.
TIan Gibson, director of asset contracting at Colas, said: 'It is a first in the UK and we are looking forward to sharing the results of this trial within the industry.'",-2
1696,"As delegates haggled over the final drafts at the UN COP26 climate-change summit in Glasgow, America and China issued a joint declaration to work together to reduce emissions. The two countries said they were committed to keeping the increase in Earth’s mean surface temperature to “well below” 2oC compared with pre-industrial levels. China said it would come up with a national plan to curb methane emissions. Time will tell whether their statement was diplomatic showboating or the start of something more substantive.
Belarus kept dumping migrants at the border with Poland and barring them at gunpoint from retreating. It has been luring them onto flights from the Middle East with false promises of easy passage to the European Union. The migrants cannot enter Poland, and with winter coming, may soon freeze. The despotic regime of Alexander Lukashenko apparently hopes to cause another political crisis in the EU about refugees. Poland has sent 15,000 troops to the area.

The British government announced that National Health Service frontline staff in England will need to be vaccinated against covid-19 by April 1st. The latest government data show that 10% of all NHS employees are not fully jabbed. This week was the deadline for care staff to meet the requirement; around a quarter of those workers have not received their full dose.
The White House urged large companies to press ahead with plans to ensure their staff are vaccinated by early January, after a federal appeals court temporarily suspended Joe Biden’s  vaccine mandate. The court said it had “grave statutory and constitutional” concerns about the order. The government asked it to reverse its decision.
Mr Biden was able to claim a big victory when the House of Representatives at last passed his $1trn infrastructure bill. The bill had seemed in peril when left-wing Democrats insisted that welfare legislation should come up for a vote at the same time.
It’ll still be there
NASA pushed back its planned mission to land astronauts on the Moon, its first since 1972, by at least a year, to 2025. A lawsuit brought by Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin over the contract awarded to SpaceX to build the Moon lander was one reason for the delay (a judge recently dismissed the suit).
Daniel Ortega, the authoritarian president of Nicaragua, won a fourth consecutive term. Joe Biden called the election a “pantomime”. Over the past six months Mr Ortega has imprisoned some of his potential opponents and forced others to flee. Many hundreds of ordinary people who have protested against his regime in the past remain behind bars.
Chile’s Chamber of Deputies approved impeachment proceedings against Sebastián Piñera, after leaked documents raised more questions about a mining deal that the president’s family signed during his first term in 2010 (he denies wrongdoing). But the opposition will struggle to obtain the two-thirds majority needed to impeach Mr Piñera formally in the Senate.
The Central Committee of China’s Communist Party held an annual meeting at which delegates discussed a resolution on the party’s history, the first of its kind in 40 years. It appeared to be aimed at justifying an extension of Xi Jinping’s rule beyond a party congress in 2022.
America urged China to release Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist who was sentenced to four years in prison for her reporting on the early days of the covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan. The government continued to battle a new outbreak of the disease that began in mid-October and has caused hundreds of infections.
Thailand’s constitutional court ruled that three activists who called for reforms to the country’s monarchy during protests last year were guilty of attempting to overthrow the king. The court focused on whether the speeches were constitutional, so no penalty was imposed, but the ruling will stifle debate about the monarchy’s role.
The Duterte dynasty
Sara Duterte, the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines, withdrew her candidacy for re-election as mayor of Davao City, kindling speculation that she intends to run for a national post in the presidential election next year. Her father will have served the full presidential term allowed.
Mustafa al-Kadhimi, the prime minister of Iraq, was the target of an assassination attempt. The attack reportedly involved drones, one of which reached Mr Kadhimi’s home. He was unharmed, though six of his guards were wounded. Suspicion has fallen on Iranian-backed militias.
Iran’s top nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri-Kani, visited European capitals ahead of talks with America and European powers aimed at resurrecting the nuclear deal that Iran signed in 2015. Mr Bagheri-Kani seemed to rule out any discussion of Iran’s nuclear activity at the talks, and said that instead they should focus on lifting sanctions. America, which walked away from the deal in 2018, disagrees.

France formally handed back to Benin 26 precious artefacts, including statues and a royal throne, that it had taken when it colonised the west African country in the late 19th century. Other former colonial powers are also under pressure to return looted items. These include Britain, which holds more than 900 “Benin bronzes” that were taken from Nigeria.

1697,"A former Target employee has gone viral for quitting in spectacular fashion with a profanity-laden announcement over the PA system at his Chicago store.
Edwin Pos, 21, shared a TikTok video of himself making the exit speech, which he managed to complete before anyone stopped him.
In the clip, he announces to the store that he is quitting 'this f***ing whole-a** job' and calls out several employees by name, including 'that b**** Jessica' and 'Karen-a*** Lucifer Linda.'
The video shows Edwin talking on speaker phone into a phone in an office appears to be connected to the PA system. 
'Attention Target guests. The time is now nine whatever and I quit, I'm quitting this f***ing whole-a** job,' he begins.
'F*** that b**** Jessica and f*** your p**** a** email, that no-lip b**** Linda who [harasses] the style team daily, which is why we call her that Karen-a*** Lucifer Linda. And your mannequins look like s***,' he said.

And then as I was walking out, I walked past security, and I heard Amanda, this b***, tell them to go to channel three [on their walkie-talkies] and then they went to channel three and she was telling them something about that she heard something on the speaker.
'But I was already walking out, so I'm sure as I was walking out they were putting two and two together,' he said.
He also shared that one of the things that 'drove me insane': how, during one shift, he got in trouble for retrieving his water bottle from another part of the store when he got thirsty.
'And this f***ing b**** stops me as I was getting my water and was making it seem as if I was loafing or doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing.
'And we had a meeting about it,' he went on, where he recorded what she said.

1698,"THIS FUNERAL mask, photographed by Yoshii Yutaka of the Sicán Archaeological Project, in Peru, was discovered 30 years ago, 800km to the north of Lima. The Sicán were a group who flourished around 500 years before the arrival, in the 1500s, of Europeans. The red paint adorning the mask is made of cinnabar, a compound of mercury and sulphur. But turning cinnabar into paint requires a binding agent—and in this case it must have been a good one, to keep the paint attached to the mask for so long. Luciana da Costa Carvalho of Oxford University therefore set out to discover what it was.
Initial mass spectroscopy suggested proteins were involved, but shed no light on which. A follow-up study, however, produced the astonishing suggestion that the binder in question was chimpanzee blood—astonishing because chimps are African, not American animals. Further investigation revealed the mistake. The blood was actually from chimps’ close relatives, Homo sapiens.

Human blood is sticky when it clots, and would certainly bind cinnabar to gold for a millennium—but so would that of many other species. This suggests human blood in particular was chosen for another, presumably ritual, reason. Being picked as the donor of this blood may well have been an honour, though that is impossible to tell. But given many pre-Columbian peoples’ proclivity for human sacrifice, rather than mere bloodletting, it might not have been an honour that was highly sought after.

1699,"CALL IT THE multiplication of the metaverses. Ever since Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook—sorry, Meta—laid out his vision in late October for immersive virtual worlds he thinks people will want to spend lots of time in, new ones are popping up all over. An entertainment metaverse will delight music fans, influencers will flock to a fashion metaverse to flaunt digital clothes, and there is even a shark metaverse (it has something to do with cryptocurrencies). Mostly these are the brainchildren of marketeers slapping a new label on tech’s latest craze.
One new virtual world deserves real attention: the “enterprise metaverse”. Forget rock stars and fancy frocks, this is essentially a digital carbon copy of the physical economy. Building living, interactive blueprints that replicate the physical world might, in time, come to shape it. The vision of what this might mean has become clearer in recent days. Microsoft, the world’s largest software firm, earlier this month put it at the centre of its annual customer shindig, as did Nvidia, a big maker of graphics processors, on November 9th.

Corporate virtual worlds are already more of a reality than Meta’s consumer version, where people will get to hang out with their friends at imaginary coastal mansions. Unlike that metaverse, which is populated mostly by human avatars, the corporate version is largely a collection of objects. These are “digital twins”, virtual 3D replicas of all sorts of physical assets, from single screws to entire factories.
Crucially, they are connected to their real selves—a change on the shop floor, for instance, will trigger the equivalent change in its digital twin—and collect data about them. This set-up enables productivity-enhancing operations that are hard today, for example optimising how groups of machines work together. Simulating changes virtually can then be replicated in the real world. And, its boosters hope, a path would be laid to automate even more of a firm’s inner workings.
Whether the enterprise metaverse becomes a reality is not simply of interest to aficionados of corporate information technology (IT). Innovations unlocked through insights gleaned from digital mirror-worlds can help firms become more adaptable and efficient—helping them reduce carbon emissions, for example. Promoters of the concept even argue that it will put to rest the old adage, coined by Robert Solow, a Nobel-prizewinning economist, that you can “see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics”.
The concept of this “twinworld”, as the enterprise metaverse might be called (a spiffy moniker will surely be found), is not new. Some of the necessary technologies have been around for years, including devices with sensors to capture data, known as the “internet of things” (IoT)—another field still waiting for a moniker upgrade. Software to design detailed virtual replicas originated in computer games, the current benchmark for immersive worlds.
But other bits have only recently become good enough, including superfast wireless links to connect sensors, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, which can predict how a system is likely to behave. “Digital twins aggregate all of these things,” explains Sam George, who runs the enterprise-metaverse effort at Microsoft.
As is its wont as a maker of corporate software, Microsoft has developed an entire platform on top of which other firms can develop applications. This includes tools to build digital twins and analyse the data they collect. But this “stack”, as such collections of code are known, also provides technology which allows people to collaborate, including Mesh, a service that hosts shared virtual spaces, and HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset, with which users can jointly inspect a digital twin.
Nvidia’s roots in computer graphics mean it focuses more on collaboration and creating demand for its chips. Its Omniverse is also a platform for shared virtual spaces, but one that allows groups of users to bring along elements they have built elsewhere and combine these into a digital twin they can then work on as a team. The common technical format needed for such collaboration will come to underpin digital twins in the same way HTML, a standard formatting language, already underpins web pages, predicts Richard Kerris, who is in charge of Omniverse.
Both platforms have already attracted a slew of startups and other firms that base some of their business on this technology. Cosmo Tech, for instance, takes Microsoft’s tools to do complex simulations of digital twins to predict how they might evolve. And Bentley Systems, which sells engineering software, uses Omniverse to optimise energy infrastructure. Both Microsoft and Nvidia have also teamed up with big firms to show off their wares. AB InBev, a beer giant, collaborates with Microsoft to create digital twins of some of its more than 200 breweries to better control the fermentation process. In the case of Nvidia, the top partner is BMW, which uses Omniverse to make it easier to reconfigure its 30 factories for new cars.
Despite all this activity, it is not a given that the enterprise metaverse will take off as fast as its champions expect, if ever. Similar efforts have failed or disappointed, including many IoT projects. “Smart cities”, essentially attempts to build urban metaverses, turned out to use technology that was just not up to snuff and relied too much on proprietary standards.
If the enterprise metaverse does indeed take shape, though, it will be an intriguing process. Will it be based on proprietary technology or on open standards (there is already a Digital Twin Consortium)? And, asks George Gilbert, a veteran observer of the IT industry, how will software-makers such as Microsoft be paid for their wares? Since their code will be more embedded than ever in firms’ products and services, some may ask for a slice of revenue instead of licensing or subscription fees.
And then there is the question of how the overall metaverse economy will function. Since most business activity will be digitally replicated, economists may have unprecedented insight into what is going on. Digital twins could exchange services between themselves and perhaps replace firms as the main unit of analysis. If digital twins live on a blockchain, the sort of platform that underpins most cryptocurrencies, they could even become independent and own themselves. Expect at least as many possibilities as metaverses to unfold.■",2
1700,"CHINA’S PRESIDENT, Xi Jinping, is hardly ever grilled in public about what he thinks. The few interviews he has given have been highly staged. But his propagandists have been building a network of institutes devoted to studying his thoughts. In June one was established to research “Xi Jinping thought on the rule of law”. The following month, two others were founded to analyse, respectively, his pronouncements on economics and green development. It is the biggest mobilisation of academic effort to parse the speeches of a serving leader since the era of Mao Zedong.
China now has 18 Xi-thought research centres. Many of them focus on a particular topic such as politics, culture, science, education, religion, diplomacy or national security. Mr Xi’s ideas about these matters make up what is officially known as “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era”. The Communist Party adopted this as one of its guiding philosophies at a five-yearly congress in 2017. The first study centres were opened soon afterwards.

They enjoy high political status. Some of their directors are senior party officials. The new one devoted to the economy is embedded within the National Development and Reform Commission, the government’s planning agency. It will be “an important think-tank”, according to state media. For much of the post-Mao period, the prime minister has overseen economic policy. Not so under Mr Xi. He has, in effect, sidelined the current prime minister, Li Keqiang, who has a PhD in economics.
The new rule-of-law centre is run by the China Law Society, an official club of legal experts. One of Mr Xi’s main messages on this subject is that the party leads the judiciary and that notions such as the separation of powers or judicial independence are Western-inspired heresies. In a speech in December China’s domestic-security chief, Guo Shengkun, used the phrase “Xi Jinping thought on the rule of law” 27 times. The Education Ministry’s centre is studying the promotion of Mr Xi’s thoughts in schools.
The recent flurry of Xi-centre openings may reflect an attempt to boost his already enormous profile ahead of the next party congress, which is due to be held late next year. It will be a crucial one. In 2018, not long after the latest congress, the country’s rubber-stamp parliament scrapped the state presidency’s ten-year term limit. The move fuelled speculation that Mr Xi planned to remain as China’s leader for at least another five years beyond 2022 (he also serves as party chief, a far more important role for which there has never been a term limit, but the two jobs have usually been held concurrently). In the coming months, officials are likely to build a case for Mr Xi’s continued rule. The centres will play their part.
Keep it short
Analysts will watch for signs that the cumbersome 16-character phrase used to describe Mr Xi’s thinking is being modified to put him on a par with Mao (who ruled until he died). Mr Xi has already surpassed his other predecessors. The thinking of two of them, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, is also enshrined in the party charter but without their names attached. Deng Xiaoping is mentioned by name, but his thoughts are merely described as a “theory”. The only Chinese leader with a snappily named philosophy is Mao: his is known simply as Mao Zedong Thought. Were Mr Xi’s to be abbreviated in the same way, it would be yet another indication that his grip on power is unlikely to wane next year. Few people believe it will decline.
Mr Xi’s ideas are so wide-ranging and often so vague that they defy ready definition (although the idea that the party must control everything, including academia, permeates his speeches). But those with questions may turn to the party’s main newspaper, the People’s Daily. It is halfway through a serialisation of a book published in February titled “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era: Questions and Answers for Learners”. Each day it prominently publishes a couple of new ones. Despite its connections, the newspaper appears not to have persuaded the man himself to explain. ■",2
1701,"SOMEONE WISE once said that all the problems of capitalism are agency problems. Agency costs arise when somebody (the principal) delegates a task to somebody else (the agent) and their interests are at odds. In the textbook example, the principal is a manager, the agents are employees. It is in the manager’s interest that the agent works hard. The more effort each worker puts in, the higher the firm’s output and the greater its profits. But the employer cannot gauge the true effort of the workers, especially if the results are a team effort. Each worker has an incentive to shirk.
Asset management has a double agency problem. The first lies with the separation of ownership and control in large public companies. Shareholders are the principals, who delegate running the firm to managers. Shareholders care about returns on their investment, but managers have different goals. They may value perks and prestige—a plush office, a company jet, a high-profile merger deal—more than profits. Running a big company is a complex task. It is hard to be sure if the bosses are making a good fist of it. No individual shareholder has a big enough stake to make the effort of monitoring worthwhile.

Mechanisms have emerged to limit such agency costs. A classic paper published in 1976 by Michael Jensen and William Meckling argued that loading a public firm with debt was a useful device to stop managers frittering away shareholders’ cash. Bosses feel greater pressure to cut costs and raise revenues if they must meet regular interest payments. The leveraged buy-out boom of the 1980s was predicated on the idea of debt as a tool to focus the minds of managers. Private-equity firms employ this trick.
Another way to limit this sort of agency problem is to give managers the right to buy discounted shares once their price reaches a predetermined target. Stock options, it is argued, make managers act as if they were shareholders. Yet this device just creates a different sort of agency problem. Traders of shares use quarterly earnings as a rough-and-ready guide to how well a company is run. Managers know this. So they eschew investment projects that are in the long-run interests of shareholders in order to boost short-term profits, lifting the share price and the value of their stock options.
The second agency problem arises from conflicts of interest between asset managers and those on whose behalf they invest. It is in the interests of investors that asset managers seek out the best long-term returns. But fund-management firms are paid a fixed percentage of the value of assets. To attract capital into their funds, they may opt for faddish stocks that do well in the short term, but whose shortcomings become apparent only in the long run. They may shun unfashionable stocks, even if they believe they are good long-term investments. Once an asset manager has captured funds to manage, they tend to stay. A good recent run will lure in more funds. This agency problem has no easy solution—but investors could be quicker to ask searching questions.",2
1702,"FIFTEEN YEARS ago Maria, a school secretary, and her husband Samuel, a technician at an electronics firm, had just bought a car when they found out she was pregnant. They couldn’t afford the payments with a baby on the way, so they returned it. Today the couple and their three children live in a three-bedroom house in Tesistán in western Mexico, and have just bought a second set of wheels. They eat out once a fortnight and have a subscription to Netflix, a video-streaming site. “My children used to ask me if we are poor and I would say ‘No, we have food, a roof over our heads, clothes, and we are moving ahead’,” says Maria. “For me and my husband this is the best moment we’ve had yet.”
In recent decades Mexico, like many emerging markets, has witnessed the growth of its middle class. Incomes have risen—Maria and Samuel bring in around 20,000 pesos ($1,000) a month, an increase of more than 50% in real terms since they first got together 16 years ago. More people like them have bought cars, fancy TVs, smartphones and nice clothes. But recently the middle class, long neglected by politicians, has had two setbacks, thanks to covid-19 and the policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Class is nebulous. It can be defined by income, profession or aspirations. The markers of status vary. Middle-class Mexicans do not look like their Spanish peers. They are poorer and more likely to work in the informal sector, rather than be a doctor, teacher or other professional. The World Bank defines middle class as earning $13-70 per day in 2011 dollars, adjusted for purchasing-power parity. The OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, defines it as earning 75% to 200% of the median income of the country where you live. In Mexico almost half the population of 126m meets that definition of middle class. (Some 36% fall below that and 19% are officially rich.)
In Mexico the growth of a large swathe of people who are neither rich nor poor owes much to NAFTA, a free-trade agreement with the United States and Canada. It brought jobs and cheaper goods to the country when it was implemented in 1994. (A renegotiated, more restrictive version came into force last year.) The fact that Mexican consumers have more clout than in the 1990s can be seen in the proliferation of cafés and restaurants in urban areas. In 2019 Mexico City, the capital, had the world’s highest number of songs streamed on Spotify, an audio-streaming service. Mexico is one of the five biggest markets globally for Uber, a ride-hailing firm. In April IKEA, a Swedish furniture giant, opened its first store in the country.
Going places
The middle class is a vital part of any economy. In Mexico, many of its members own the small- and medium-sized businesses that provide most of the jobs in the country. “They may start with a puesto [stall] on the street and then invest in starting a fixed restaurant that goes on to employ other people, too,” says Javier Lazarín of FES Aragón, a university.
Aspiring types tend to press governments to provide better services such as health care and education, because they rely on them more than the rich, who can buy what they need. Better education can often lead to better public debate, too. Middle-class citizens are also thought to be good for democratic stability, since they are keen to protect what they have. Nonetheless, membership of the middle class in Mexico is far more precarious than in richer places. An economic shock—a family illness or a recession—can send people tumbling back into poverty. Today several forces are battering Mexico’s middle masses.
The most immediate threat is covid-19. The World Bank reckons that, by its measures, last year a net 4.7m Latin Americans fell out of the middle class. In 2020 Mexico had its worst recession since the Great Depression, with the economy shrinking by 8.5%. (It normally grows by around 2-3%.) Mr López Obrador’s fiscal hawkishness, sensible in good times, appears to have been a liability. His government provided very little financial support, deepening the pandemic’s impact. By contrast, handouts in Brazil were so generous that the World Bank says they reduced by 12m the number of people falling out of the middle class.
Miriam Corona works as an accountant at an office-furniture shop in Mexico City. Her salary of 16,000 pesos a month was cut in half when the pandemic started, she laments from her living room in Pantitlán, an eastern neighbourhood of modest houses, restaurants and shops. Ms Corona and her son, a university student, have got by only because they live with her brother and mother. “We limited what we spent,” she says. Neither she nor her company received extra handouts last year.
Even before covid-19, government policies were hurting people like Ms Corona. “In a country with so much poverty, the middle class is often not appreciated,” says Armando Regil, who runs an NGO. The rich are undertaxed in Mexico and the poor have little spare cash, so middle-class Mexicans pay more than their fair share. They pay for public services and, since these are patchy, for private substitutes too.
Mexico ranked 56th of 78 countries in the most recent PISA ranking, a test of 15-year-olds’ skills in science, maths and reading. According to a survey in 2017, less than half of Mexicans were happy with the state of public health care. Services, and access to them, have improved in the past decade but not by much. One-sixth of Mexicans lack effective access to health care.
When asked about their spending priorities, middle-class Mexicans are most likely to mention private schooling and private health care. If she had more cash, Maria would send her children to a private school—and buy them swimming lessons.
Despite his populist rhetoric, Mr López Obrador has not done much to improve matters. Since coming to power in 2018 the president has focused on the poor, doling out funds for social programmes to support them. Meanwhile, his lackadaisical approach to foreign investment, which fell in 2019, has hurt the slightly better-off, says Luis Rubio, an analyst and co-author of a book on Mexico’s middle class. One of Mr López Obrador’s first acts in office, for example, was to cancel a big new international airport, spooking investors.
Now the president is verbally chastising the middle class. Mr López Obrador blames them for his party’s losses in Mexico City in the elections in June. He has called middle-class Mexicans “individualist” and accused them of wanting “to be like those above and climb as high as possible with no scruples”.
The president conceded that people should want to “improve” themselves, but clarified that they should “not become selfish and aspire to be snobs”. Such messages are off-putting to many middle-class folk. “He talks about the richness of culture and family but not about finances—and those matter, too,” says Luis Castellanos, an academic.
Viri Rios, an analyst, reckons that taking into account the limited access to public services, a Mexican needs at least 16,000 pesos per person per month to live comfortably—what Ms Corona earned before the pandemic. A report from 2019 by McKinsey, a consultancy, talks of two “missing middles” in Mexico: robust mid-sized companies and a middle class with more spending power.
“If you don’t fight to move ahead, you don’t move ahead,” says Carla, a freelance consultant (and Mr Castellanos’s spouse). If public services improved, middle-class Mexicans could spend their money on other things—and more people could climb the ladder, too. ■",2
1703,"IDEALISTS SEE leadership as steering the ship of state in the right direction (Plato), or embracing the “ethic of responsibility” (Weber). Realists see it as the ability to seize the horse of history by the tail and lever yourself onto its back (Machiavelli), or to sell a coherent vision to a fickle public (Schumpeter). But whatever its nature, everyone can agree when it is absent.
As it has been from the Foreign Office during the past fortnight. Even as Afghanistan was falling to the Taliban, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, dawdled in Crete before cutting his holiday short. He delegated to a junior minister the job of calling his opposite number in Kabul to discuss the fate of Afghan interpreters working for British forces. His response to criticism in a television interview was risible: he had been focused on his job in Crete, he bristled, not paddle-boarding, because the “sea was closed”.

The permanent secretaries of the Foreign Office, Home Office and Ministry of Defence, as well as the prime minister, Boris Johnson, also initially refused to let a little thing like the fall of Kabul interrupt their holidays. And Mr Raab made some reasonable points during a combative appearance before the foreign-affairs select committee on September 1st. There was a limit to how much Britain could have done to improve the situation in Afghanistan, given America’s precipitous departure. Britain was not alone in underestimating the speed of the Taliban’s advance. As foreign secretary he had to keep his eye on lots of pots that threaten to boil over, not on Afghanistan alone.
Moreover, Mr Raab inherited a Foreign Office that had been broken by decades of cuts and marginalisation. “Embassies have been sold off; a diplomat’s career path has become arbitrary; the last Permanent Secretary prioritised diversity over diplomacy; and too much experienced advice has been ignored and subordinated to the whims and instructions of Downing Street,” lamented Sir Alan Duncan, who served a spell as a foreign-office minister, in a recent article. Brexit has left Britain’s diplomatic strategy in disarray, tearing up nearly five decades of patient work with the European Union and doubling down on the transatlantic relationship, at precisely the moment when America has decided to turn inward and towards the Pacific.
But leadership is about rising to challenges. A lesser man than Ernest Bevin, foreign secretary from 1945 to 1951, might have surrendered to pressure from within the Labour Party to side with the Soviet Union rather than America, or to shift opportunistically between the two. Moreover, Mr Raab helped create the difficulties that now beset his department. He was among the hardest of the Brexiteers, helping to bring down Theresa May, the previous prime minister, when she tried to compromise with the EU, and running for party leadership in 2019 as the champion of the ultras.
That Mr Raab’s Foreign Office is not a happy place is hardly surprising, given his ideological leanings. But the atmosphere has been worsened by his personality, variously described as “tightly wound”, “controlling” and “cold”. Some officials have taken to calling him “five i’s”, a double reference to the “five eyes” arrangement that sees Britain share intelligence with America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and what they see as his attributes: insular, imperious, idle, irascible and ignorant. He has handled this hostile environment by sidelining ambassadors and surrounding himself with special advisers. But the cost has been high. He has built no close relationships with his counterparts around the world, failing to talk to foreign ministers in Afghanistan, Pakistan and several of the surrounding states in the six months leading up to the fall of Kabul. Important decisions have been shaped by callow youths who have seldom strayed outside the Westminster village, rather than by seasoned diplomats.
Nor does Mr Raab supply much in the way of intellectual leadership. The son of a Jewish Czech refugee, he has a fine record on standing up to Russia and China. He pressed for residents of Hong Kong to be welcomed in Britain as China tightened its grip on the territory. But on many difficult choices facing Britain, he has been reticent—so much so that some other Brexiteers are losing patience. Instead of buccaneering about the place, as they fondly imagined Britain doing once freed from the EU, he has got lost in pettifogging process, they complain. He is a strange combination of ideologue and technocrat, a hard-line Brexiteer by conviction but a human-rights lawyer by training and experience. Somehow, this mixture has left space for neither vision nor panache.
His dismal performance over Afghanistan has provoked another round of Westminster snakes and ladders. Will the prime minister sack him in the next reshuffle, or at least move him sideways? Who would take his place? (Michael Gove, the cabinet-office minister, and Liz Truss, the trade secretary, are early front-runners.) And might the manifest failings of one member of his cabinet inspire the prime minister to take a hard look at the others? Why does it contain so many people who mess up everything they do, like Gavin Williamson, the education secretary? Why have so many of the most impressive Tory politicians languished on the backbenches, like Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the foreign-affairs select committee, or jumped ship, like Rory Stewart, a former soldier, diplomat and Conservative leadership candidate?
Holding on tight
When Mr Johnson took office, surrounding himself with Brexiteers was understandable, given the need to end his party’s 30-year civil war. But sensible Remainers have reconciled themselves to a future outside the EU, and the cost of packing the cabinet with mediocrities is rising by the day. The prime minister would strike no one as a follower of Plato or Weber. The realist school of leadership seems a better fit. But having seized the horse of history by the tail when he backed Brexit, he is in danger of failing because he has assembled incompetent horsemen, rather than crack cavalry. ■

1704," (CNN)President Donald Trump knew back in the spring that it would probably take a year to develop a coronavirus vaccine, according to interviews with journalist Bob Woodward.Trump also suggests that's why he initially pushed so hard for the use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, because the malaria drug had already been tested and approved for other uses.""Well, we're doing great on vaccines,"" Woodward quotes Trump as saying in his latest book, ""Rage.""""The problem with a vaccine is a vaccine will take 13 to 14 months once you have it. Because you have to test a vaccine. As opposed to the hydroxy, you have to test it. Because the hydroxy's been there for 25 years.""Hydroxychloroquine was indeed an approved drug, but it had never been tested in people with coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration gave hydroxychloroquine emergency use approval but later rescinded it after several studies showed the drug did not help patients were coronavirus and might be harmful.Trump heavily promoted hydroxychloroquine for months but after the FDA rescinded the EUA, began talking about development of a vaccine. He has repeatedly said he believes a vaccine could be approved before the Nov. 3 election.His interviews with Woodward -- also recorded on audiotapes -- show he was briefed on the timetable for a coronavirus vaccine. The US government had been working with vaccine makers, including Moderna Inc, and Johnson & Johnson, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The new vaccines are made using pieces of genetic material and researchers started testing the first vaccines in human clinical trials in March.""We probably already have the vaccine,"" Trump said on April 13, according to the book. ""You know the biggest problem though? You have to test it, so you have to make sure it kills the virus, but you've got to make sure it doesn't kill the person. Can you imagine? You vaccinate a hundred million people and you find out it's poison, right?""Administration officials have told CNN that in meetings focused on vaccine development throughout the spring and summer, Trump consistently pressed officials to speed up the timeline for developing a vaccine, and the President appeared intent on being able to deliver at least the solid promise of an effective vaccine by the time he faces reelection.Those efforts have scaled up as Election Day nears, and Trump has repeatedly complained that some officials at federal health agencies are actively working to stymie his reelection chances by slow-walking announcements.""It will be delivered before the end of the year, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October,"" Trump said about a vaccine at a rally this month. ""How do you like that? Wouldn't that be nice? And you know why? Not because of the election. It'd be nice because we want to save people.""Trump's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has denied there's pressure on the FDA ""to do anything.""",0
1705,"A federal judge has blamed the former president for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot, saying that Donald Trump 'created the conditions' for the unrest with his 'lies.'
Judge Amit Mehta, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, indirectly invoked the president's name Friday when sentencing John Lolos to 14 days in jail for his role in the deadly demonstration.
'The fact remains that he and others were called to Washington, DC, by an elected official, prompted to walk to the Capitol by an elected official,' Mehta said.
'People like Mr. Lolos were told lies, were told falsehoods, were told the election was stolen when it was not,' Mehta added, calling Lolos a 'pawn,' according to CNN.  
Mehta appears to be the first judge to hold Trump responsible in a Capitol riot case. 
Judge Mehta, 50, was born in India and attended Georgetown University and the University of Virginia Law School. He was appointed by former President Barack Obama in July 2014 and confirmed by the US Senate via voice vote in December. 
'Once you hear people who should know better tell you that an election was stolen and they say it loudly enough, frequently enough, it's not surprising that people will believe it,' the judge said, according to Politico.
Nearly 700 people have been charged in the riot, Insider reports, and 40 have been sentenced. 
Lolos was sentenced to 14 days in jail and was ordered to pay $500 in restitution.
Prosecutors say that Lolo was seen in a video leaving the Capitol doorway waving a red 'Trump 2020 Keep America Great' flag hooked together with the United States flag, yelling, 'We did it, yeah!' after an unknown individual yelled, 'We stopped the vote!'
He was arrested after a DC airport officer saw a video of Lolos at the riot on his Instagram feed and noticed him at the airport wearing the same shirt.
At the time, Lolos was waiting for another flight out of DC because he was kicked off the first one after 'continuously yelling ""Trump 2020!""' while the plane was on the tarmac, according to Lolo's charging document.
On Wednesday, a judge sentenced Jacob Chansley, also known as the 'QAnon Shaman,' to nearly three-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the riot, with credit for the 10 months he's already served.
'I admit to the world, I was wrong. I have no excuses. My behavior was indefensible,' he said.
Chansley insisted that he is not a violent man, a domestic terrorist or a 'white supremacist.'
As part of an impassioned 30-minute speech to the court, Chansley quoted Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Jesus, and the prison break film The Shawshank Redemption.
January 6 rioters were hoping to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results in favor of President Joe Biden after President Trump repeatedly said the election had been stolen from him, a claim he continues to make today.
Earlier that day, Trump had given a speech in which he told his supporters, 'If you don’t fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'
The riot resulted in the deaths of five people, including Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an officer trying to stop a crowd from breaking into the building. 
'Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos who were told those lies took it to heart. And they are the ones paying the consequences,' Judge Mehta said. 
'Those who created the conditions that lead to Mr. Lolos' conduct have in no meaningful measure been held accountable.'
He told Lolos: 'You were a pawn. You were a pawn in the game played by people who know better.'
Various reports of Friday's hearing describe Lolos as 'rambling' or going into an 'extended rant.'
As his defense attorney tried to stop him from talking, he continued to cite debunked election fraud claims, claimed the evidence against him was tainted, and encouraged people listening in on the hearing to look up a video of him online, according to CNN. 
'I may have failed to explain why incarceration is necessary here, but I think Mr. Lolos just summed it up,' prosecutors said.",-2
1706,"TURTLES PEER down on visitors to America’s Supreme Court and support lamp-posts on its plaza. But for an institution engraved with the semiotics of slow, steady change, the Supreme Court has been on a bit of a tear. On October 4th, for the sixth straight year, the justices will take the bench with a lineup that differs from the previous term’s opening-day roster. After a tumultuous summer break, the first complete term with all three of Donald Trump’s appointees promises to reshape American law on its most contentious fronts.
Along with disputes over immigration policy and pandemic-inspired pauses on evictions, the most divisive issue in American politics reached the justices while they were on holiday, when the court declined to stand in the way of a Texas law that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. That demurral has, in effect, erased Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision protecting abortion rights, for 7m Texans. But officially scrubbing Roe from the books is on the agenda on December 1st, when the justices take up Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organisation. Dobbs concerns a 15-week ban enacted by Mississippi in 2018.

The Mississippi law gives the justices a chance to reconsider viability—the line (about 24 weeks’ gestation) that, since Roe, has distinguished between protected terminations and those which states may bar in the interest of protecting fetal life. In June 2020, Mississippi told the justices that its law could be upheld without undermining Roe and other long-settled cases. A year later—after Justice Amy Coney Barrett had succeeded Ruth Bader Ginsburg to create a 6-3 conservative majority—Mississippi sharpened its tune. With a more receptive audience, the state spent the bulk of its brief contending that the court’s abortion precedents are “egregiously wrong” and should be overruled, not merely tinkered with.
Another contested liberty—the right to keep and bear arms—has a brighter future. On November 3rd, in New York State Rifle  Pistol Association v Bruen, the justices will hear a challenge to New York state’s rules governing concealed-carry licences. New York issues “restricted” permits for people to hunt or carry a handgun to target practice, but it requires “proper cause”, a special justification, before it grants a general licence to carry a gun outside the home for self-defence. The challengers say New York “cannot reserve for a happy few a right that the constitution protects for all ‘the people’”. The state’s lawyers respond with historical examples of gun restrictions from medieval England to the founding era and beyond. In the decade-plus since the Supreme Court first recognised an individual right to own a firearm in the home, gun-rights activists have been pressing to expand the range of the Second Amendment. The justices seem to be on the brink of doing just that.
Carson v Makin, to be heard on December 8th, may buttress another project of the conservative legal movement. Maine pays private-school tuition for students in more than 100 small towns that lack a public high school. But parents may not use state money at schools that promote a particular faith—an exclusion the plaintiffs say violates the First Amendment. In 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that religious pre-schools could not be excluded from secular benefits like playground resurfacing. Last year, a 5-4 majority sided with Montana parents who wanted to use state scholarship funds at religious schools. Carson will push this principle one step further if it requires states to fund explicitly sectarian education whenever it offers state money for private schooling.
With only 37 cases on the docket (little more than half its recent load), a momentous term could soon become more so. The justices are mulling whether to hear a showdown over affirmative action at Harvard University. This could up-end precedents, dating back to 1978, allowing schools to pursue diversity through race-conscious admissions. Challenges to private-sector union rules and the power of the Environmental Protection Agency are in the pipeline, too, along with still more abortion and gun cases.
Justice Stephen Breyer, the 83-year-old leader of the court’s depleted liberal bloc, has been out promoting his new book on the purported non-political nature of the place where he has worked since 1994. His colleagues to the right, Clarence Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett, have made similar remarks in recent speeches. Those assurances come amid plummeting support for the institution. Last week Gallup reported that just 40% of Americans approve of the Supreme Court. That is the lowest percentage since 2000, but support could dip further if the court ends its term next spring by reneging on half a century of protections for women while fortifying gun rights. There is little doubt the court will continue to move the country to the right. The question is how far and how fast. ■",2
1707,"IN THE NEGOTIATIONS which led up to the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Saudi Arabia spent a great deal of time attempting to insert the term “environmentally safe and sound” in front of references to “energy sources” and “energy supplies”. Given that the oil Saudi Arabia exports in greater quantities than any other country is now understood to be anything but environmentally safe, this seems bizarre. At the time, though, the aim was obvious to all concerned: the phrase was a way to keep nuclear power off the Rio agenda.
The oil shocks of the 1970s had led to many countries increasing their nuclear efforts. In the ten years to 1992 the amount of nuclear energy consumed worldwide had increased by 130%. What was more, some talked of using nuclear plants to produce not just electricity, but also hydrogen which could then form the basis of synthetic fuels. The Saudis may or may not have had real concerns about the environment. But they knew a competitor when they saw one.

Their scheming proved unnecessary. In contrast to the oil shocks, the threat of global warming has not served the nuclear cause well. After peaking in 2006, the amount of nuclear energy consumed in 2019 was just 18% higher than it had been in 1992. As a share of global primary energy, it had fallen from 6.1% to 4.3%.
Because nuclear power is expensive in ways that show up in profits, whereas damage to the climate is not priced into burning fossil fuels, this would be unsurprising even if it were popular with environmentalists—which, by and large, it is not. But it is still too bad. The paradigm-shifting drop in the cost of renewable electricity in the past decade is central to the decarbonisation pathway the world is fitfully following. But a clean-energy system requires redundancy and reliability in its electricity grids that are hard to achieve with renewables alone. It will probably also require lots of hydrogen for, say, powering aircraft and making steel and chemicals, which reactors could provide.
Nuclear power has its drawbacks, as do all energy sources. But when well-regulated it is reliable and, despite its reputation, extremely safe. That is why it is foolish to close down perfectly good nuclear power stations such as Diablo Canyon, in California, because of little more than prejudice. It is why some countries, most notably China, are building out their nuclear fleets. It helps explain why others—including, as it happens, Saudi Arabia—are getting into the game for the first time. And it is why approaches to reducing nuclear energy’s cost penalty are at last coming into their own.
France, which has found its newest generation of huge reactors impossible to build on time and within budget, and consequently also hard to export, has new plans for small, modular reactors (SMRs) that might do better on both counts. Rolls-Royce, a British engineering company, is touting a similar approach. On November 4th an American company, NuScale, signed a deal to sell six such reactors to Romania at the COP26 in Glasgow. Russia already has a floating SMR power station.
Such designs can in principle be produced in factories and shipped where they are required, keeping their costs down. These advantages have been extolled for decades without being realised, so caution is in order. But today’s efforts are broader-based and have real impetus. They need regulatory approaches which, while not lax, permit their makers to learn as they build. That will allow competing designs to prove themselves against each other, making nuclear power, once again, a source of innovation—and adding to the world’s capacity to ditch unsafe and unsound fossil energy. ■

1708,"IN THE 1980s, when Basak Demirtas was just five, the police came for her father. Four years ago, her children watched their father being arrested in their turn. “I didn’t think my daughters would have to experience the same thing,” she says. But the lot of the Kurds is slow to change.
Selahattin Demirtas, her arrested husband, was at the time of his imprisonment the leader of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), the strongest democratic voice of Turkey’s Kurds. He remains behind bars on trumped-up charges, along with thousands of other Kurdish politicians and activists. Turkish prosecutors recently applied to the country’s top court to have the HDP as a whole outlawed and disbanded. “Our parliamentarians are thrown in prison and our votes are ignored,” says Ms Demirtas, sitting in her husband’s office in Diyarbakir, the biggest city in the largely Kurdish south-east of the country. “Turks and Kurds still cannot live as equals.”

Turkey’s recent moves against the Kurds are not limited to its own territory. Kurdish insurgents in Syria have seen their attempts to carve out a statelet stretching from the Iraqi border to the Mediterranean knocked back by three Turkish offensives since 2016. In 2017 it joined the governments of Iran and Iraq in punishing the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), the autonomous administration which has ruled northern Iraq since the Gulf war of 1991, for holding a referendum on independence. More recently its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, threatened to invade parts of the KRG’s territory in pursuit of members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an armed group that has fought Turkey’s security forces for nearly four decades.
It is a long way from the time, half a decade ago, that some saw as heralding a “Kurdish spring”. The HDP had seen its support increase significantly in the Turkish elections of 2015, a development that deprived Mr Erdogan and his Justice and Development (AK) party of a parliamentary majority. Kurdish militias in northern Syria had secured Western support by expelling Islamic State (IS) from Kobane, a town on the border with Turkey; fighters from the KRG had captured and held Kirkuk as part of the same struggle, taking control in the process of some very large oilfields. A significant fraction of the 30m Kurds spread across Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey were living under Kurdish rule with what appeared to be reasonable prospects. Further autonomy seemed possible.
That moment of hope led to both backlash and overreach. In the 2000s Mr Erdogan’s government had made unprecedented attempts to deal with the demands of Kurds in Turkey, allowing more use of their language in schools and trying to clinch a peace deal with the PKK. After the 2015 elections Mr Erdogan abandoned the peace process to court the nationalist vote. For its part the PKK, heartened by the success of Kurdish fighters in Syria, tried to replicate them in Turkey. Insurgents proclaimed autonomy in cities across the south-east; the government responded with tanks and artillery. By the time the smoke cleared, some 3,000 people, including hundreds of civilians, were dead and entire neighbourhoods lay in ruins. Dozens more were killed in PKK suicide- and car-bomb attacks elsewhere in the country.
Mr Erdogan’s government now seems determined to crush the Kurdish cause altogether. Of the 65 mayors elected on the HDP ticket in local elections two years ago, all but a few have since been either expelled from office or arrested. The same goes for over a dozen MPs. Kurdish parties have been suppressed before, only to reappear in short order with slightly different names. But Mr Erdogan’s coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, head of the country’s biggest nationalist party, wants the HDP gone for good, and he may get his way. Prosecutors want 687 of its top politicians banned from politics for five years.
In northern Iraq the response to the referendum of 2017, in which 90% voted for independence, saw Iraqi forces, backed by Iran, recapture about a third of the territory then in Kurdish hands, including Kirkuk and its oilfields. Turkey and Iran closed their borders with the KRG’s domain, and Iraq its air space, cutting the region’s customs revenues. Masoud Barzani, who had presided over the KRG since its inception, left office.
In Erbil, the KRG’s capital, the hint of spring in the air is long gone, and a certain despondency has set in. April 5th marked the 30th anniversary of the declaration of a no-fly zone over northern Iraq, the decision which allowed the Kurds’ rebellion against Saddam Hussein to succeed. In some young polities such a milestone would be marked with fanfares. Yet when one of your correspondents visited the city in March no one, from the president to the pedlar at his palace gates, seemed even to be aware of the anniversary, let alone in a mood to celebrate it.
But the KRG remains a beacon, of sorts. When the Kurds rebelled the region was the poorest part of Iraq—just as the Kurdish homelands over the border were then the poorest parts of Turkey. Both have developed since. But while the gap between Turkey’s south-east and the rest of the country has not closed, in Iraq things have reversed. The north’s relative stability and access to oil have brought those who rule it serious wealth.

According to Iraq’s finance minister, Ali Allawi, 60% of the country’s imports now come through the Kurdish region. A lot of the proceeds seem to stay there. Mr Allawi complains that the KRG rakes in fees and oil revenues it should be transferring to the government in Baghdad. Iraqi officials say that the Ster Group, a conglomerate close to the KRG’s prime minister, creams off customs revenues at the borders.
But if gains are being ill-gotten, they are also on display. While much of Iraq languishes, the Kurdish north booms. The development is often ugly, and a fair bit is beyond the reach of most citizens. But it is investment. In March the KRG unveiled plans for a railway linking Erbil to southern Iraq. Work has begun on a third international Kurdish airport close to Mosul, Iraq’s third-largest city.
Northern Iraq also profits by offering its neighbours a way around Western sanctions. The border crossings with Iran and Syria are packed with lorries taking oil one way and goods which are the target of sanctions the other. The trade is particularly important for the enclave in northern Syria. Kurdish forces, led by a local franchise of the PKK, took a broad swathe of territory there early in Syria’s civil war, and though their enclave has been reduced by the Turkish army—and is harassed by Iranian-backed militias in the south—it still comprises a quarter of the country, including its best agricultural land and its largest oilfields. About half the oil production goes to local needs or to other parts of Syria. The rest is exported via Iraqi Kurdistan.
Oilmen say that at least two pipelines violating American and EU sanctions now span the Tigris between Syria and KRG territory. Once in northern Iraq, according to Mr Allawi, some 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) flow through a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, where it is sold as Iraqi oil. But blind eyes are turned. None of the Kurdish middlemen in the trade has been blacklisted. One of the largest, Abu Dilo, operates from a currency-exchange in Qamishli, a mainly Kurdish-run city near the Turkish border, with heavies guarding the entrance. America considers the oil trade a fitting reward for the Kurds, who lost thousands of fighters in the war against IS.
Setting suns again
At the urging of their American backers, and to win over local Arabs and placate their neighbours, the Kurdish forces in northern Syria have played down Kurdish nationalism and their links to the PKK (which America and the EU, as well as Turkey, consider a terrorist organisation). Having once called the enclave Rojava, Kurdish for “land of the setting sun”, the Kurds now call it the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES), emphasising, in the light of the KRG’s experience, a desire for autonomy rather than outright independence.
They have also moved their administrative seat away from the front lines with Turkey to Raqqa, an Arab city which served as the capital of the IS caliphate, and was reduced to rubble during its defeat. While the cities still under the control of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, lie in ruins, oil money and Western aid are bringing Raqqa back to life. As in much of the rest of the enclave, roadsides are piled with marble slabs, concrete blocks and rebar. Local officials say that much of Raqqa’s housing stock has been restored, and its university, closed by IS, is set to reopen in August. Leila Mustafa, the Kurdish woman running the city’s council, says “We want it to be Syria’s capital.”
That illustrates the NES’s professed commitment to a united but federal Syria. The forces governing the NES want Mr Assad to recognise their region’s autonomy and grant it a budget subsidy and a share of the country’s raw materials. But the government in Damascus, faced with dire bread and petrol shortages, fumes at NES’s bogarting of the country’s resources: “Pirates!” snaps Syria’s oil minister, Bassam Tomeh. Though Syria’s Kurds have invited Russia and Mr Assad to send their forces into the NES to defend it against further Turkish attacks, three rounds of political talks between Kurdish officials and the Syrian regime’s head of national security, Ali Mamluk, ended in a deadlock last December, according to a Kurdish negotiator. Syria and Turkey continue to insist that the UN exclude the enclave’s Kurdish leaders from the peace talks it hosts in Geneva.

Iraq’s Kurds have also been trying to improve their relations with the rest of their country. They have committed themselves to selling 250,000 bpd of oil through Iraq’s state marketing board and paying half the customs revenues they collect to the central government. In return the Iraqi parliament agreed in March to resume the transfer of 12% of Iraq’s budget to the KRG. Iraqis from the Arab south have flocked north, drawn by Kurdistan’s better security and more liberal lifestyle, though a recent surge of covid-19 cases has halted the flow.
Some come to holiday without their abaya, but others come to settle. After a generation of erecting barriers against such migration, the KRG has made it easier for Arabs to buy land without a local sponsor. Arabic and international schools have opened their doors. Of the region’s 5m people, hundreds of thousands are Arab. “We’re a multicultural city, not a Kurdish one,” says a Kurdish minister in Erbil.
The outreach has partially eased tensions. Turkey, Iran and Iraq have reopened their borders, and trade with northern Iraq has been a boon for Turkey’s Kurdish south-east. The economy there was badly damaged by the urban insurgency; the crackdown against the HDP has not helped. Companies with links to the party are denied contracts, says Mehmet Kaya, head of Diyarbakir’s chamber of commerce, and mayors elected one day are ousted the next. “I’ve been doing this job for less than three years and I’ve had to work with four different mayors,” says Mr Kaya. “They can’t bring in investment.”
Turkish exports to Iraq reached more than $9bn last year, despite covid-19 restrictions. Mr Kaya says the local economy would also have plenty to gain from the opening of Turkey’s border crossings with Syria’s north-east. But because these are under the control of Syria’s Kurds, the government in Ankara refuses to entertain the idea. To cut intra-Kurdish trade and restore control of customs revenues to Iraq’s government, Iraqi and Turkish officials have mooted a joint operation to seize a sliver of territory along the border from the Kurds and open a crossing of their own.
Their economic development provides the Kurdish territories in both Syria and Iraq with advantages. Their politics are a drawback. In Iraqi Kurdistan the political structures and the ruling families remain as they were 30 years ago. The feudal houses of Barzani and Talabani—which fought a civil war in the 1990s over UN aid—now tussle over trade routes. They have resisted Western pressure to merge their two forces into a single Kurdish army; the Iraqi government is trying to tempt the Talabanis away from the Barzanis by dangling the prospect of a separate budget subsidy.
No country for old men
Divided, the Kurds make easy pawns for regional powers to project influence. Iran lends support to the PKK in Iraq even as it fights one of the same group’s offshoots at home. The Shia militias it backs in Iraq arm and fund PKK fighters on Sinjar, the strategic mountain perched on the border with Syria. Turkey has responded by urging the KRG to crush its troublemaking PKK cousins in Iraq’s north-eastern mountains. Meanwhile Nechirvan Barzani, the president, struggles with his cousins Masrour Barzani, the prime minister, and Mansour Barzani over control of the security forces.
In his Erbil palace he feels Turkey’s mounting pressure. He blames the PKK presence for destabilising northern Iraq; 400 villages near the border have been evacuated as Turkish fighter jets and drones target their positions. But he seems loth to take on the group alone. “It’s a sovereign matter,” he says, for once anxious to pass the buck to Baghdad.
Infighting undermines the Iraqi Kurds’ confidence in their leaders. So do a lack of rewards and a lack of justice. Last year the 1.2m on the government payroll saw their pay cut for six months; they were told this was because the central government was not sending money north. During protests against the non-payment of salaries last December at least eight people were shot dead. Journalists covering unrest are sentenced in courts with scant regard for due process. “You promised me freedom but instead took it away,” says Shivan Fazil, a Kurdish analyst with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Across the border, people in the NES know that their lot is better than under the Assad regime—but that is the lowest of bars. The enclave remains a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Union Party (PYD), a group close to the PKK. Power-sharing talks between the PYD and the Kurdish National Council, a group endorsed by Turkey and the KRG, have gone nowhere, despite American backing. Kurds and Arabs cry for the relatives the PYD sends to Qandil for military training only to be killed in Turkish bombardments.
The threats and the obstacles the Kurds face across the region will not disappear any time soon. But in the enclaves in Iraq and Syria, Kurdish leaders have real power; and in Turkey so, too, do the Kurdish people. The fact that they face being deprived of their favoured party does not mean that they are being deprived of a voice.
In a country split evenly between Mr Erdogan’s supporters and his opponents, the Kurds have become kingmakers—as they proved in local elections two years ago, handing control of Turkey’s biggest cities, including Ankara and Istanbul, to an opposition alliance. “If you want to be in power in Turkey today,” says Vahap Coskun, an academic in Diyarbakir, “you need to be on good terms with those voters.” Mr Erdogan may have lost them for ever. Banning the HDP will only drive its supporters, as well as devout Kurds who might otherwise continue voting for Turkey’s strongman, further into the arms of the opposition.
Few Kurds now believe they will live in a single, sovereign Kurdistan—even the PKK long since dropped such a dream from its demands. But in Diyarbakir, Ms Demirtas wants her daughters, when grown, to one day feel a hope like that which she felt in the peace process a few years ago—and to see that hope end in something other than another cycle of disappointment, violence and arrests. Experience suggests that may be a lot to ask for. But the Kurds have already come a long way, in Turkey and elsewhere. Despite recent setbacks, they may yet see better days. ■",2
1709," (CNN)What's that we hear? Is it the sound of prominent conservatives and Trump allies openly rebuking former President Donald Trump? Are these the early murmurs of a conservative backlash against Trump? And is it possible a political lane is opening for another Republican presidential candidate in 2024?It's too soon to know, of course, and there's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.The statements from Rupert Murdoch -- who controls a media empire that includes, among other properties, the shamelessly pro-Trump Fox News -- and from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- an adviser who worked with the former president and helped him prepare for the presidential debates during the 2020 election -- may serve as a test for Republicans who understand just how harmful Trump's dominance of the GOP is, and how it could ultimately sink the party.It was startling when Murdoch, addressing his company at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said that the United States faces a number of major political decisions that conservatives will fail to shape unless Trump moves on. ""The current American political debate is profound,"" he said, citing education, welfare and economic opportunity. ""It is crucial that conservatives play an active, forceful role in that debate,"" he added, ""but that will not happen if President Trump stays focused on the past.""Murdoch is not alone in arguing that Trump is a threat to conservatives. Christie, who has just published a new book that looks very much like his unofficial entry into the 2024 presidential race, is making the same case, only more forcefully.Consider the title of Christie's book -- which effectively labels Trump a threat to the GOP: ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Notice that Trump fits two of the three reasons the party needs saving (by Christie, presumably).Murdoch and Christie are not the first Republicans who have stood up to the former president --  but their rebukes of Trump are markedly different. Trump's early critics, like Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and others, melted into passionate defenders once their criticisms proved perilous to their own standing. Their reversals bring to mind a quote often attributed to Groucho Marx: ""Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others."" Christie says many in the GOP are frightened of Trump, whose ""conduct is meant to instill fear."" Conservative Republicans who refuse to fall in line, such as Rep. Liz Cheney, are being hounded out of a party that is increasingly remade into the former president's raging, iconoclastic and intolerant brand.Sure, it's possible Murdoch and Christie's words may also fail to change the course of the GOP, but their criticism is different. They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party -- and the rest of the country -- that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.Coincidentally or not, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, finally acknowledged Biden's win on Thursday, more than a year after the 2020 vote. ""Painfully,"" she said, ""Joe Biden won the election and it's very painful to watch. He's the President. We know that."" Murdoch and Christie undoubtedly have their own personal motives for speaking out against Trump in this moment, and there's plenty of evidence to warrant accusations of hypocrisy. Murdoch, whose Fox News -- home of Tucker Carlson, a purveyor of harmful lies and propaganda about everything from the Covid vaccine to American democracy -- is still serving Trump's goals. But Fox News now faces billion-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by two voting technology companies that allege the network spread false claims of election fraud. Murdoch might be driven by a fear of liability and the potential damage additional lawsuits could inflict on his bottom line if Fox News continues to follow Trump down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and baseless claims. There is, also the possibility that he cares about the future of conservative politics, and genuinely fears the GOP might get trampled if Trump doesn't let up.Christie, for his part, is trying to promote his book and his prospects of occupying the White House.Still, it is remarkable that they have done the calculus and decided they can benefit from speaking out against the former president, even after other Republicans have been badly hurt by doing the same thing. I think their calculation makes sense. With President Joe Biden's ratings sinking, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are doomed. But it is Republicans who may be doomed if they continue to stick with the former president.There's no doubt the Biden administration is terrible at messaging. The economy is booming and yet consumers are feeling pessimistic. Meanwhile, Biden is making important legislative progress, and the inflationary pressures that are creating the false impression that the economy is failing could be resolved in time to boost Democrats' fortunes.Even if Democrats are still in the doldrums in 2024, it's hard to imagine that voters will be yearning for another four years of Trumpian chaos. Biden may look uninspiring now, but the former president, who had the most consistently poor approval ratings of any president in the modern era, remains highly unpopular and controversial. Do Republicans want a candidate embroiled in endless -- and serious -- legal troubles? According to the New York Times, prosecutors are likely to impanel a grand jury in Georgia in the criminal investigation of the former president's attempt to overturn the 2020 election (In September, he suggested he was being unfairly targeted, saying, ""Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me."") Meanwhile, prosecutors in New York have convened a second grand jury to hear evidence about Trump Organization's business practices, according to the Washington Post. (The first grand jury, which convened this spring, charged two Trump companies and an executive with tax evasion. Trump, who was not charged, blasted the indictment and called the investigation a ""political witch hunt."")A Pew poll conducted in September found that two-thirds of Republicans want Trump to remain a major force in the party, but only 44% want him to run again. One-third of Republicans and 92% of Democrats don't want him to be a major national political figure going forward. That's not the arithmetic of victory. There's the potential for a post-Trump Republican Party to gain ground. It still seems like a long shot at this point, but if his critics are successful in persuading the GOP to move in a different direction, there's a chance American democracy can return some semblance of normality, where political leaders debate what policies are best for the country, without fear of upsetting the tender, explosive feelings of a very bad loser.",0
1710,"THE STORY of the Trojan war, as told by Homer and related down the centuries, is one of intrigue and heroes. And, as is the way of characters from Greek mythology, the names of many of those involved have ended up attached to objects in the sky.
In the early 20th century astronomical photography showed that Jupiter, the solar system’s largest planet, was accompanied not only by its moons, but also by more distant acolytes. These were clusters of asteroids that followed the giant planet’s orbit precisely, but either led or trailed Jupiter itself by about 60° of arc.

 Those clusters are centred on places called Lagrange points L4 and L5, after the mathematician who predicted their existence. L4 and L5 are traps in space caused by the interaction of the gravitational fields of Jupiter and the sun. Once in one of them, an asteroid is generally stuck there. Given the division of these captured asteroids into two camps, it amused their early discoverers to call bodies discovered at L4, which leads Jupiter, after Greek heroes of the war, and those at L5, which trails that planet, after Trojans (though each camp also has a spy from the other in its midst).
The siege of Troy
Most known asteroids reside in a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Spectroscopic analysis of sunlight reflected from these, and comparisons with chunks of space rock that have fallen to Earth as meteorites, suggest that some are fragments of dwarf planets which subsequently collided with each other (a few such dwarfs, for example Ceres, remain intact), while the rest are conglomerations of material from the early solar nebula, often including pebbles of once-molten rock called chondrules. Many of the conglomerate-based asteroids are rich in carbon, which makes them dark and vaguely reddish in colour. In particular, their spectra resemble those of chondrule-bearing meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites.
Certain asteroids in the outer part of the main belt are, however, redder still—carbonaceous chondrites on steroids, as it were. These types are also abundant in a second, more distant set of asteroids and dwarf planets, the Kuiper belt, found beyond the orbit of Neptune, of which Pluto is the best-known member. The nuclei of active comets are often objects of this sort. And they constitute, too, the bulk of the members the Greek and Trojan camps.
The distant orbits of these asteroids mean that they do not seem to contribute to the mixture of meteorites that fall to Earth, so there is nothing to compare them with directly. Their colour, though, is suspected to be caused by complex organic molecules similar to terrestrial kerogen collecting on their surfaces. This material’s exact chemistry will reflect where in the solar system these asteroids formed, and thus cast light on how objects moved around in the system’s early days. That makes the Trojans (as the two groups are known collectively) of special interest to those who study the formation of planetary systems. So, on October 16th NASA, America’s space agency,  launched a probe to have a look at them.
Lucy, as this planetary-ancestor-investigating mission is dubbed, after a well-known specimen of Australopithecus, an early hominid, blasted off from Cape Canaveral, in Florida, and will now follow one of the most complex paths around the solar system yet devised by NASA’s orbital navigators. The diagram which shows Lucy’s journey, indicates how the craft will first pick up speed using two velocity-boosting fly-bys of Earth. It will then head for the Greek camp, passing, for a practice run at observation, by way of a convenient main-belt asteroid that the mission’s scientists have named Donaldjohanson, in honour of the discoverer of Lucy the Australopithecine. When it arrives at L4 in 2027, it will encounter five bodies: Eurybates and its tiny satellite Queta, Polymele, Leucus and Orus.
Having examined each of these, it will leave the Greek camp in 2028 and cross, via another velocity-boosting fly-by of Earth, to the Trojan camp at L5. Its final planned encounter, when it reaches L5 in 2033, is with Patroclus and Menoetius.
These were thought to be a single object until 2001, when an examination by the Gemini North telescope, in Hawaii, showed they were actually a pair of rocks, each about 100km across, in orbit around one another. Classicists will recognise Patroclus, the name used when the pair were believed to be one, as the Greek spy in the Trojan camp. It is now the name given to the larger of the two. Menoetius, hurriedly pressed into service to designate the smaller, was Patroclus’s father. (For the curious, the Trojan spy in the Greek camp is Hektor, which is not on Lucy’s itinerary.)
The most widely used classification of asteroids, invented by David Tholen of the University of Hawaii, now recognises 14 spectral types, each called by a letter of the alphabet. Main-belt asteroids are mostly types C (carbon-rich, as with carbonaceous chondrites), M (believed to be metallic, and derived from the cores of dwarf planets) and S (silicaceous, or stony, and either other types of conglomerate or fragments of the outer layers of dwarf planets). Some Trojans are also type C. But the deep-red ones are of rarer types known as D and P—the difference between them being the exact shapes of the curves of their spectra.
To look at its targets in detail (Polymele, Patroclus and Menoetius are type P; Orus and Leucus are type D; and Eurybates and Donaldjohanson are type C), Lucy is equipped with three instruments: a high-resolution camera, an optical and near-infrared spectrometer, and a thermal spectrometer. Together, these will be able to map the various asteroids the probe encounters, and analyse the chemical compositions of their surfaces.
That, in turn, will test the ideas of Harold Levison, the mission’s principle scientific investigator. Dr Levison, who works at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, helped create the Nice model of the solar system’s early days. This hypothesises that the largest planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, have moved around a lot since they formed.
The gravitational effects of all this movement would have scattered asteroids like leaves in a gale, ejecting many of them from the solar system altogether and moving others far from their places of origin. Dr Levison suspects the Trojan D and P asteroids to be such travellers, and that their surface chemistry will show they formed much farther from the sun than Jupiter’s current orbit. The Nice model suggests such distant asteroids would have been scattered, in particular, by the movement of Neptune, which began life closer to the sun than Uranus but is now farther from it, and that some would then have been ensnared by Lagrange’s gravitational traps. If the D and P types Lucy encounters did indeed form far from the sun, that would add weight to the Nice model.
Once Lucy has visited Patroclus and Menoetius its formal mission will be over. These days, however, space probes often have an afterlife beyond the period intended. The New Horizons mission to Pluto, for example, has gone on to observe a second Kuiper-belt object, Arrokoth, and Opportunity, an American Mars rover that had a design life of 90 Martian days, actually operated for 57 times that period. In Lucy’s case, the craft’s final orbit will take it on an endless loop from L5 to L4 and back again. Each loop will take six years. So, if the hardware holds up, there is sufficient fuel left for manoeuvring, and someone is willing to pay to keep the mission team together, other Trojans might yet receive a visit. ■

1711,"“WE’RE WORKING at the limit,” says Apostolos Tsalastras, treasurer of Oberhausen, a town in the Ruhr valley. Like many places in this region, Oberhausen sits on a vast debt pile, mostly accrued when the mines closed and the steel jobs went. Unemployment stands at 10.6%, almost twice the national rate. Last year Olaf Scholz, the SPD finance minister (and its chancellor-candidate), sought to relieve municipalities like Oberhausen of their old liabilities, but was thwarted by his CDU coalition partner. “It’s time for a fresh start,” pleads Mr Tsalastras. His town is locked in a vicious circle of declining investment, slumping tax revenue and a shrinking population.
A federal bail-out meant most municipalities avoided disaster last year. But by 2023 many will face a fiscal crunch, says Jens Südekum, economics professor at the University of Düsseldorf. The commercial taxes that are their main independent source of income are volatile, and covid-19 creates new demands. National laws limit their ability to cut current spending, one of Mr Tsalastras’s bugbears. That puts capital investment in the firing line.

The country’s 11,000-odd municipalities are responsible for a big chunk of public investment. The KfW, a state-backed development bank, puts the municipal-investment backlog at €149bn ($172bn), a number that has risen even as tax revenues pour in. School buildings account for nearly a third of the shortfall; roads just under a quarter. Endlessly delayed mega-projects like Berlin’s airport may have made the country a laughing stock, but it is rusting bridges, shaky phone signals and decrepit school toilets that are the staple of daily conversation.
Ask anyone in local government what the problem is, and the answer is always people. A report by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, which is linked to the SPD, finds a huge decrease in municipal staff over 30 years. Immigration has helped, but a quarter of posts remain unfilled, says Henrik Scheller, one of the authors. Planning and engineering are especially affected, and local governments struggle to compete with private firms. Two-thirds of municipalities expect it to get even harder to find town planners. Surveys find construction companies working at capacity. With such supply constraints, spending more without proper planning merely risks stoking inflation.
Bureaucracy and nimbyism play a role. Companies struggle with a patchwork of planning and building rules. Opponents delay public-infrastructure projects with endless litigation. The number of projects blocked by citizens’ initiatives has doubled since 2000. This is problematic for roads, railways and bridges. But it is a “real hurdle” to climate transformation, says Mr Scheller. The recently revised climate law mandates a reduction in carbon emissions of 65% from 1990 levels by 2030, and their net elimination 15 years later. The share of renewables in electricity production must also reach 65%. And overall demand for electricity for batteries to power electric cars, for heat pumps in buildings, and for “green” hydrogen to help decarbonise industry may rise by a quarter.
Agora Energiewende, a think-tank, estimates that Germany will have to install an extra 5GW of onshore wind power every year until 2030, and 7GW a year after that. In 2020 it managed just 1.4GW. A visit to Schleswig-Holstein shows how hard it will be. As far back as the early 1990s, wind power in this northern state began to revitalise what had been some of the poorest communities in western Germany. Today turbines dot the landscape. Schleswig-Holstein has 8.5GW of installed wind-power capacity, and produces 160% of the electricity it consumes from renewables. It can export the excess via new power lines, including to Scandinavia.
In December the state government published new rules for wind-farm construction, after a five-year moratorium imposed amid growing local tensions. The new rules set aside 2% of land for wind energy, but this may not be enough to meet wind-power targets. Add long waiting times for permits and other restrictions and these targets seem unattainable, says Marcus Hrach of the Kiel branch of Germany’s Wind Energy Association. Industry insiders despair at all the hoops they must jump through. “Few people here oppose wind power, but those who do have loud voices,” says Anton Rahlf, a frustrated wind-farm owner on Fehmarn, an island in Schleswig-Holstein.

Other states are even more restrictive. Rules to protect endangered species vary from state to state. A few years ago litigation, regulation and complex tendering slowed the construction of wind farms to a crawl, although 2021 has offered flickering hints at a revival. The mismatch between the federal government’s ambitions and the reality of local regulation, says Mr Hrach, will make it impossible for Germany to reach its commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
Another difficulty, says Alexander Reitzenstein from Das Progressive Zentrum think-tank, is constructing the power lines needed to transport electricity from the windy north to southern industrial states like Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. Local communities can be given a financial stake in wind farms, but that is harder to do for power lines simply transporting electricity. And under Germany’s federal system, states cannot be bossed around by the government in Berlin. “Lots of politicians who agree on climate in Berlin act differently when a line comes to their local community,” says Tim Meyerjürgens, chief operating officer of TenneT, an electricity-transmission operator, adding that the “salami-tactics” of regular legislative changes harm trust.
There is a near-consensus that the next government must do more to satisfy vast public-investment needs. The debate is over how. For some, tackling the country’s austerity bias is a priority. The debt brake now in the constitution limits opportunities for deficit spending. Critics of German tightfistedness are legion. The European Central Bank has long urged countries with “fiscal space” to exploit it. But all such suggestions have tended to run into an austere wall of fiscal orthodoxy.
Austerity excesses
Since 2013 the annual public-investment budget has risen from around €93bn to €137bn. This, argues Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, suggests the debt brake is “a bit of a straw man”. Better to tackle bureaucracy, capacity constraints and municipalities’ volatile revenues by changing the federal structure. But Sebastian Dullien at the IMK, a union-linked research group in Düsseldorf, counters that a guaranteed, long-term income stream of just the sort the debt brake inhibits might give municipal authorities, construction firms and engineers the planning certainty they need to reduce bottlenecks and increase staff.
Last year the government invoked an escape clause in the debt brake to finance corporate-support, furlough and other schemes during the pandemic, running up a deficit worth 4.2% of GDP. It will be bigger this year. The CDU/CSU wants to reimpose the debt brake once circumstances allow, probably in 2023. So does Mr Scholz, who presents himself as a safe pair of hands (plenty in his SPD would like a more expansive approach). The most interesting proposals come from the Greens, who want to add a “golden rule” allowing a debt-funded ten-year €500bn investment programme, focused on climate and digital infrastructure.
Yet the two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to change the constitution is a formidable hurdle. A more likely prospect is the establishment of public-investment companies, essentially off-budget special-purpose vehicles (SPVs), devoted to capital spending on, say, broadband provision in schools or upgrading railways. SPVs are legally complicated and democratically iffy, frets Mr Südekum. They would incur borrowing costs at a time when investors actually pay to lend to the federal government. But by not adding to the public-debt stock they offer a way of getting round the debt brake. The CDU/CSU chancellor-candidate, Armin Laschet, has flirted with what he calls Deutschlandfonds.
More radical ideas are afoot, notably a proposal by Dezernat Zukunft, a think-tank led by Philippa Sigl-Glöckner, a former finance-ministry official who calls SPVs “a declaration of defeat to silly fiscal rules”. Dezernat Zukunft wants to shift the fiscal debate away from arbitrary debt limits towards the goal of full employment. Low headline unemployment, the group notes, masks low labour-force participation rates among women and part-time workers seeking more hours.
Although the debt brake limits deficits to 0.35% of GDP, the calculations rely on a complex estimate of “potential” output. In the short run, Dezernat Zukunft reckons tweaks that require legal but not constitutional tampering could allow more deficit spending worth €50bn-60bn a year. In the long run Ms Sigl-Glöckner hopes to see off the debt brake for good. That such ideas now get a serious hearing suggests the fiscal debate has at last begun to shift. ■

1712,"A GERINGONÇA IS pleasing to say, but difficult to operate. The Portuguese term, sometimes translated as “contraption”, refers to a device patched together from oddly fitting parts. Although the governing arrangement that António Costa, Portugal’s prime minister, assembled in 2015 was dubbed the geringonça, it proved surprisingly durable. But on October 27th it finally fell apart, as two left-wing partners voted down his budget, triggering elections two years early—a rare occurrence in Portugal.
Though the budget was expansive, splashing out on free kindergarten and other goodies and increasing the minimum wage, it was not lavish enough for Mr Costa’s radical allies, the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and the Left Bloc (BE). Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president, had announced in advance that if it failed, he would call elections. If he was hoping to put pressure on the parties to seal the deal, the gamble failed.

The parties are scrambling to influence the electoral timetable. Most want elections on January 16th, to avoid prolonged instability. But the calendar is complicated by the plans of the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats (PSD), a centre-right outfit despite its name, to hold leadership elections on December 4th. That would leave the winner scant time to pick candidates for the general elections. One PSD candidate, Paulo Rangel, is lobbying Mr Rebelo de Sousa (who hails from the PSD himself) to hold the elections later, to allow the party time to regroup. The current leader, Rui Rio, wants to postpone the primary instead. The president was due to announce the date on November 4th.
After an inauspicious start Mr Costa has won respect, not least in neighbouring Spain (where the centre-left Socialists also depend on a far-left party, Podemos). His Socialists came second in 2015’s election, then toppled the short-lived minority PSD government, cobbling together a majority with the BE and PCP, previously considered untouchable by the moderate Socialists.
The then-president required a written agreement between the parties: the BE and PCP never joined the government but made clear commitments of support. But Mr Costa increased his party’s seat count in 2019’s elections. Mr Rebelo de Sousa decided not to insist on a formal agreement before blessing the second geringonça. The Bloc and the Communists, weakened and unbound by any deal, were sure to flounce out at some point.
Some think Mr Costa might have been happy for them to do so now. Portugal’s covid-19 vaccination rate, 87%, is one of the world’s highest. He can point to decent GDP growth and falling unemployment until the pandemic (which in 2020 caused GDP to plunge further than in any year since the 1930s). He has kept the deficit, which made Portugal a ward of the European Union and the IMF after the financial crisis, low enough to win international respect.
But this has come at the cost of public investment: Portugal’s is thought to be the lowest in the EU in 2020 and 2021. Salaries are low by Western European standards: the minimum wage, at €775 ($900) a month, is around €300 less than Spain’s. Many Portuguese head abroad to work.
If Mr Costa nonetheless does well, he might be able to govern with smaller, more tractable allies than the ones that have just let him down. Miguel Maduro, an ally of Mr Rangel in the PSD leadership contest, wants to return to an informal arrangement where whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the second-largest tally of seats agrees not to try immediately to topple a minority government led by the other one.
But all the moderate parties are warily watching Chega, a far-right party with just one deputy now, but worryingly strong support in the polls. Mr Rangel refuses to govern with Chega. (Mr Rio has been more equivocal.) If Chega squeezes the other parties, any new government will be tricky. Portugal may be joining a new European normal: shrinking established parties, growing extremes and complex coalitions, a kind of permanent geringonça. ■",2
1713,"THE PRESIDENT, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was not on the ballot, but Mexico’s mid-term elections, held on June 6th, were largely a referendum on his polarising performance. Voters selected representatives to the lower house of the national legislature and 30 of the 32 state congresses, as well as governors of 15 states and thousands of local posts. Although Mr López Obrador’s party, Morena, and the parties in its coalition won a majority in the national legislature’s lower house, it lost its two-thirds supermajority. The results are a blow to the president’s ambitions to transform Mexico.
Parties in power tend to lose seats in mid-terms, so the result is not entirely surprising. Morena dropped from 256 of 500 seats in the lower house to around 198. Even with the help of its allies, it falls well below the 334 seats needed for a supermajority. More gallingly for Mr López Obrador, the coalition of established parties did well: the National Action Party ( PAN), which held the presidency from 2000 to 2012, will be the second-biggest political force, followed by the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI), which ruled the country for seven decades until 2000.

The president will now have to negotiate with other politicians to pass laws. That could put constitutional reforms beyond reach, since he would need around 40 opposition lawmakers to side with him. The party also suffered losses in Mexico City, long considered a bastion of leftism. Still, Morena remains the most popular party, bagging the most seats in the legislature. It also won 11 of the 15 governorships, and most of the state congresses. This suggests the party has a future after Mr López Obrador’s term ends in 2024.
It is likely that Mr López Obrador’s agenda will remain much the same, thinks Carlos Elizondo Mayer-Serra, the author of a book on the president. He can easily ignore the disapproval of urbanites. (He accepted the results overall but blamed Morena’s battering in the capital, where he was once mayor, on a “dirty war”.) And enough people still support Morena for him to feel he has a mandate. Outside a polling station in Mexico City’s posh Roma neighbourhood, María Teresa Crespo, a pensioner, says she is “very happy with the government”, as she feels it is tackling corruption.
Morena and its allies’ majority in the lower house will allow the president to continue to set the budget. Mr López Obrador can still dole out funds for pet projects, such as social programmes to support the young, who are given a stipend while they complete an apprenticeship, or to old folk in rural areas, who are paid to plant trees.
But the lack of a two-thirds majority will limit Mr López Obrador’s chances of enshrining in the constitution his energy policy, which seeks to boost state-owned firms. It also curbs his ability to damage Mexico’s institutions, such as the electoral body, which he has threatened to disband altogether. Indeed, despite a violent campaign—at least 36 candidates were murdered—Mexico’s largest-ever elections were a success. At least 53% of more than 93m eligible voters turned out, the highest for a mid-term election in this century.

Some fear that Mr López Obrador may try to advance his agenda by calling for small referendums, or by going after judges. He has called for investigations into a judge who ruled against one of his energy initiatives. On June 7th the government enshrined in law its controversial extension of the term of the Supreme Court’s chief justice, who is considered friendly to Mr López Obrador. The president is unlikely to tone down his divisive rhetoric, which distinguishes between the people and the elites. He will continue to scold his critics in his rambling daily press conferences.
The fact that Mr López Obrador will have to compromise and work with other politicians is undoubtedly a good thing. Indeed, many who voted for the opposition said they did so for this reason alone. However, the opposition’s lack of focus will complicate matters. The PAN and PRI formed a coalition to compete in the elections, but on a platform of curbing Mr López Obrador rather than to advance shared policies. In fact, the PRI may yet work with Morena. That would raise eyebrows, but Mr López Obrador’s desire for power could trump his political principles. ■
A version of this article was published online on June 7th 2021",2
1714,"NEW DELHI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - An Indian antitrust investigation into suspected price collusion by some prominent global agricultural firms was triggered by farmers who complained about excessive pricing of imported carrot seeds, documents seen by Reuters showed.
A group representing about 1,500 farmers in the mountainous Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu, a top carrot-growing state in southern India, petitioned the watchdog in 2019 alleging that an ""unfair profit margin"" was being charged on the carrot seeds, the regulatory documents showed.
This is the first time the complaint is coming into public view. It has touched off an investigation that has the potential to affect pricing practices in an Indian vegetable seed market expected to be worth $1.2 billion in five years.
In some instances, the agricultural firms' seeds were allegedly being sold at four times the imported price, according to the documents. The farmers were also denied sale of such seeds in the northern parts of India where they were available at prices up to 50% cheaper, they alleged, according to the documents.
As part of the investigation, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) conducted a multi-city search and seizure operation on Sept. 8 at the local units of Germany's BASF (BASFn.DE), France's Vilmorin & Cie (VILM.PA) and other firms. The watchdog as a policy does not disclose any ongoing cartel investigations.
""There appears to be an understanding/arrangement between the seed importing companies to control the supply of imported variety of carrot seeds and determine their prices,"" the CCI said in May last year in a confidential order, in which it asked its investigation unit to look into the matter.
There ""appears to be a restriction on dealers not to sell to farmers other than those belonging to a particular region,"" and the CCI believed ""seed companies/distributors/dealers are apparently using their market power"" to control demand and supply in the Nilgiris, added the eight-page order.
The subsequent September 2021 raids were conducted at the local units of BASF, Vilmorin's HM Clause, a former distributor entity of Dutch-based Bejo Zaden and some other Indian entities, two people familiar with the operation said.
The investigation could take several months to complete and opens up seed firms and their executives to fines if they are found guilty of violating India's antitrust laws, the sources added.
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
BASF spokesperson Úlia de Domènech said in a statement Nunhems India - its vegetable seeds unit which was raided - was committed to complying with Indian laws and was cooperating with all regulators, including the CCI.
A Bejo India official, who declined to be named, said the company sells seeds at same prices to all distributors and in different geographical regions.
Franck Berger, Vilmorin's head of vegetable seeds, told reporters in France last month five companies were raided in India in the case, adding that HM Clause assisted the authorities.
Spokespersons for Bejo and HM Clause did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
CCI's RAID OPERATION
India's vegetable seed market is set to be worth $1.2 billion by 2026, growing 10% a year since 2020, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence. The country is among the top 15 carrot producers in the world, industry estimates show.
The farmers' 2019 complaint cited an example in which an HM Clause's carrot seed variant was allegedly imported at 7,000 rupees ($93.63) per kilogram and sold at four times the price. A similar margin was charged allegedly on a variant of Bejo's seeds.
The farmers also alleged that when they provided positive feedback on the seeds, company dealers jacked up their prices, which were also different across south and north India.
Ahead of ordering the broader investigation, two CCI officials visited the region last year and interviewed farmers and government officials and collected some seed samples from a laboratory, according to a separate internal CCI report. One farmer during that visit showed the CCI a message on his phone to claim prices of same seeds were different in north and south India, the document stated.
The CCI's confidential order noted that as the same type of carrot seed can be used across India, there was ""no apparent reason"" for selling them at different prices.
During the September raids, data from laptops and smartphones was copied by CCI officials, and some executives were questioned about their practices, the two sources said.
Carrot is a key crop grown in the Nilgiri mountains and R. Rangasamy, president of the complainant farmer group, the Nilgiri Potato & Vegetables Growers Association, told Reuters farmers were suffering due to the high pricing and sale curbs.
""The methodology to fix rates is not transparent ... We are incurring heavy losses because of this randomness,"" he said.",3
1715,"OCTOBER 6TH 1979 was a beautiful Saturday in Washington. It was not the kind of day that augured wrenching change in economic policy. But on that date Paul Volcker, then chairman of America’s central bank, announced a radical plan to quash persistent inflation. Before the battle was won, America’s interest rates reached 20% and unemployment surpassed 10%. Car dealers sent him the keys to vehicles they could not sell, in coffins.
China is now facing its own “Volcker moment”, according to Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank. The government’s aim is not to curb an inflationary spiral (China’s consumer prices are rising only modestly) but to break a vicious circle of property speculation and credit expansion. Regulators are making it harder for developers to raise money and for households to buy homes. The new rules have already pushed several property firms, including the country’s biggest homebuilder, Evergrande, to the brink and contributed to a decline in home sales. But are China’s rulers willing to endure anything like the economic discomfort that Volcker inflicted to achieve their goals? The world may be about to find out.

An Englishman’s home is his castle. In China, a home is much more besides. As well as providing shelter and security, housing often serves as collateral, nest-egg, speculative investment, bride-price and ticket to a good school. Housing makes up three-quarters of household wealth, according to the China Household Financial Survey, a data set compiled by academics in China. It accounts for the biggest chunk of household debt, which by one estimate exceeded 70% of GDP at the end of last year. Local governments raise 30% of their revenue by selling land to developers. And policymakers often rely on homebuilding to revive the economy in downturns.
Property dons other guises, too. The high price of housing is often likened to a “big mountain” (alongside costly health care and education) and a “grey rhino” (an obvious but neglected risk). In March Guo Shuqing, the head of China’s banking and insurance regulator, warned that if house prices were to drop, people holding multiple properties would not only suffer “huge losses”, they might also fall delinquent on their mortgages, endangering the banks and leading to “economic chaos”.
The government wants property to play a more modest role. In December 2016 President Xi Jinping said homes were for “living in, not for speculating”, a phrase that officials now often repeat. In 2019 the Communist Party declared that property was not a tool for short-term economic stimulus, a commitment reiterated at a meeting of the ruling Politburo in July.
The authorities are facing the grey rhino more squarely by trying to tackle the industry’s financial fragilities. Last year regulators capped the share of mortgages and property-related loans that banks may hold. They also imposed “three red lines” on prominent property developers, limiting the size of their debts relative to their assets, equity and cash. Now when the president of Country Garden, a high-end developer, talks of his aim to “turn green” he is not referring to the environment, but to keeping clear of those lines.

The impact of the curbs on the property market is becoming more stark. Sales of new homes in 30 cities tracked by Wind, a financial-data firm, fell by 23% in August compared with a year earlier, having fallen less sharply in July and June. Sales were also lower than in the same period of 2019, before the pandemic (see chart). Nomura’s Mr Lu says investors should prepare for a “much worse-than-expected growth slowdown, more loan and bond defaults, and potential stockmarket turmoil.”
Will the regulators blink? In the past, policymakers have been quick to ease property curbs in downturns. A big drop in house sales or prices over several months would probably “jolt the government into a more dovish stance”, argues Rosealea Yao of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy. But Mr Lu believes it will be hard for leaders to reverse course. They have publicly committed themselves to a tighter policy and created bureaucratic momentum behind it. Earlier this year the central government sacked officials in the southern city of Shenzhen for failing to tame prices.
The curbs can be seen as part of the government’s new preoccupation with creating “common prosperity”. Unaffordable housing conflicts with this aim. Research by three Chinese academics—Guanghua Wan, Chen Wang and Yu Wu—has found that the cost of housing causes about 75% of China’s wealth inequality. It may also be one reason why China’s families now have so few children, a trend that increasingly worries the government.
To shore up growth, China may try building more subsidised homes. It has ordered 40 cities to construct almost 1m low-rent housing units this year. But it will take time to ramp up such work on a sufficient scale. Meanwhile, China’s growth will face other threats. Service industries may suffer from pandemic-related lockdowns. Exports may grow more slowly as manufacturing recovers abroad. And infrastructure spending will weaken if local governments cannot sell as much land to developers.
It is hard to imagine China pushing things nearly as far as Volcker did. But then Volcker himself did not foresee the full economic pain that would follow that beautiful Saturday. China’s hard-pressed developers may find themselves with many unsold properties in the months ahead. Where will they send the keys? ■",2
1716,"Boris Johnson is facing mounting Tory unrest over 'unforced errors' today as a poll found nearly two-thirds of the public believe he should apologise for the Owen Paterson shambles.
The PM delivered a mea culpa to his own MPs last night admitting he 'crashed the car' with the extraordinary bid to save the ex-minister by pausing the Commons standards regime.
But research by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for MailOnline found that 63 per cent of the public think he should have said sorry - something he has pointedly refused to do.
Despite the government's 80-strong majority, there are growing signs of discontent on the Conservative benches at the premier's record of blunders and U-turns - which seems to be starting to hit support among voters. 
There appeared to be a thin Tory attendance at the weekly PMQs session yesterday, which is usually an opportunity for raucous shows of support.
And not all MPs turned up last night for votes on triggering a process of reform for rules on conduct and second jobs, which many politicians regard as 'knee-jerk' and impossible to implement.
The government is fending off more Red Wall anger today as HS2 and Northern Powerhouse links to Leeds have been dropped from a huge package of 'Levelling Up' rail improvements.  
One senior Conservative told MailOnline that Mr Johnson needs to mount a charm offensive on the 2019 intake, with fears they have not been integrated into the party due to the pandemic. He has already hosted a drinks reception at No10 in a bid to 'reach out' which is said to have 'gone well'.
'Colleagues are being dragooned into voting in particular ways without consideration of the damage that can be done... There is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with where we are.
'He has burned through political capital and it is unnecessary. When you have to do things that are difficult that is fine.
'But if you fail to spot things that is a problem. They hadn't spotted it and then they panicked.'
The MP said Mr Johnson had made the 'right call' by coming to speak to the Tory backbench 1922 committee last night - but pointed out that only around 150 politicians were there, out of around 365.
'The PM has seen a large number of colleagues but by no means the full parliamentary party,' they said.
'We have got to bring people back together. The PM has already started reaching out, he had the 2019 intake for drinks the other night. He is doing that for all sections of the party basically.
'We haven't been able to go to No10 since the general election really… he wasn't able to do what he would normally do, which is have receptions for colleagues.' 
Redfield & Wilton surveyed 1,500 people online yesterday, with the results weighted to represent the wider population.
A third 'strongly' agreed with the statement that Mr Johnson should have apologised for attempting to change the standards system in response to the Paterson case.
Another 30 per cent agreed - and only 6 per cent disagreed.  
At a private meeting of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee last night, Mr Johnson took responsibility for the Government's botched attempt to get Owen Paterson off the hook after he was found to have broken the rules on paid lobbying.
'On a clear day I crashed the car into a ditch. I will get the car out of the ditch,' he reportedly told the gathering.
In a round of interviews this morning, Deputy PM Dominic Raab conceded that Tories were 'disgrunted' but insisted ministers are committed to 'fixing the problem'. 
Asked on Sky News about discontent within the party, he said there is always 'one or other disgruntled individual' who is prepared to complain anonymously in the media.
Pressed on whether that means there is no general unrest, Mr Raab added: 'Not sure I'd put it in that idyllic way. There's always debate amongst MPs, but the most important thing is we're fixing the problem.'
On Wednesday, the Commons backed Mr Johnson's proposals to ban MPs from taking paid political consultancies and to limit the time they can spend doing second jobs.
However just 297 MPs – fewer than half the total – voted for the motion, with opposition parties abstaining.
Four Tory MPs even voted for a rival Labour motion which would have imposed a clear parliamentary timetable for implementing reform.
Former Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the PM had been poorly advised when it came to reforming the standards system.
He told ITV's Peston: 'It has been a very difficult two weeks and almost everyone involved would agree that it's been handled poorly by the Government and it's damaged the Government to an extent, and it's damaged Parliament as well.
'We need to take action now to restore a degree of public trust in the standards in public life, and what you would expect from a Member of Parliament.'
Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said there is a lack of urgency from the Government when it comes to dealing with the issue.
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning: 'The problem with the amendment from the Government which was passed yesterday is that there is no timetable.
'It wasn't a binding vote and, as a result, I just fear it is going to be kicked further into the long grass rather than the fundamental reform that people want and need to see now to restore confidence in our parliamentary democracy.
'I think that public service and being an MP is something that I am proud of and I think most MPs are, but at the moment you don't feel that proud. People look at MPs and just think it is just mired in sleaze.
'I think we need to sort this out quickly to restore the reputation of Parliament.
'It seems that Government just don't have that sense of urgency about restoring people's faith and trust in our parliamentary democracy.' 
Mr Johnson's appearance before the 1922 Committee was the culmination of weeks of pressure following the fiasco over the attempt to save Mr Paterson from suspension.
The former Cabinet minister had been found to have breached lobbying rules by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards but a Government-backed amendment attempted to save him from suspension and overhaul the whole standards process.
The Government U-turned on the idea after a backlash and Mr Paterson resigned as an MP, but the saga kicked off a deep dive into standards in public life, with a focus on second jobs.
Appearing before the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday, Mr Johnson admitted the initial effort to shield Mr Paterson had been an error.
'The intention genuinely was not to exonerate anybody, the intention was to see whether there was some way in which, on a cross-party basis, we could improve the system,' he said.
'In retrospect it was obviously, obviously mistaken to think we could conflate the two things and do I regret that decision? Yes I certainly do.'",-2
1717,"MOST DEMOCRACIES would struggle to match the productivity of India’s Parliament. During its “monsoon” session, which ended on August 11th, a score of bills covering everything from coconuts to bankruptcy have passed the upper or lower house, or both.
Alas, the reason why laws pass so easily is far from benign. Under Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has eroded many of the checks and balances that underpin true democracy. Elections themselves are largely free and fair. But defamation laws are abused to hound critics. Political opponents are intimidated and even imprisoned. Over 7,000 Indians have been charged with sedition under the BJP, casting a chill on civil society. In a scandal that would topple any accountable government, a global investigation by a group of newspapers and NGOs suggests that Mr Modi’s government has slipped Israeli eavesdropping software called Pegasus into the mobile phones of hundreds of Indians, including opposition leaders, journalists, a former top election official and senior civil servants. As yet, it has faced no serious consequences for an act which, if proven, would no doubt be illegal as well as illiberal.

As for Parliament, Mr Modi and his sidekicks think of it not as a deliberative body but as a rubber stamp. They can do this because the opposition are disorganised and lethargic. Granted, opposition MPs are now demanding a debate and investigation into Pegasus, and boycotting Parliament to press their demands. Alas, the boycott plays into the prime minister’s hands, at least for now, as he bulldozes through his bills. One was discussed for just a single minute. A bankruptcy code of national significance commanded the monsoon session’s longest deliberation—a full 39 minutes.
This is no way to run a country. The V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg, which produces an annual report on the state of democracy around the world, declared this year that India has gone from “electoral democracy” to “electoral autocracy”, as autocratic as Pakistan and worse than Bangladesh or Nepal. It is not the only Asian state where democracy is under assault.
Like unhappy families, every decaying democracy is unique. Myanmar has reverted to full-blown military dictatorship. Sri Lanka has fallen under a family dynasty. Four Rajapaksa brothers run the place, including the president and prime minister, and a younger Rajapaksa generation is on the make.
In Indonesia, elections are free and fair. But President Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, has hollowed out democracy by gutting the anti-corruption commission and co-opting the opposition, thus fostering cronyism and ministerial ineptitude. Malaysia’s gerrymandered constituencies have long ensured the dominance of parties pandering to the ethnic-Malay, Muslim majority, at the expense of secular or multiracial representation. Recent rot has been occasioned by grabs at power by shifting groupings of the Malay elite. The current prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, came to office last year in a backdoor putsch. His power now hangs by a thread, with supporters offering to buy opposition MPs’ support. None of this helps ordinary Malaysians cope with the pandemic or the accompanying economic crisis.
Though countries or territories are all unhappy in their own way, certain shared attributes signal a lurch for the worse. One is the use of investigative authorities to go after domestic foes. In India, after Dainik Bhaskar, a media group, highlighted the government’s bungling of covid-19, tax inspectors launched a raid. Hong Kong was never a democracy, but until last year’s promulgation of a draconian security law at least limited elections gave voice to an opposition. Since then Hong Kong’s most critical newspaper has been closed and national-security cops now vet political candidates. Aspiring to win is, for a Hong Kong democrat, seditious.
Can the rot be stopped? Indian democracy survived Indira Gandhi’s dictatorial Emergency from 1975 to 1977. Today some see the opposition’s coming-together over Pegasus as the beginning of its revival, while a new chief justice is showing welcome independence. In Sri Lanka voters have a record of turfing governments out, and have done so once already with the Rajapaksas. Yet each burst of autocracy leaves democratic norms a little more battered. Once they are broken, it is hard to put them back together, whoever is in office.",2
1718,"Thousands of Year 12 students have descended on the glitter strip to kick off a three-week celebration notorious for out-of-control partying.  
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday - but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up in the Sunshine State last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light for festivities on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
Many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning before they hit the shops to stock up on supplies.
As the sun went down the celebrations kicked off with dozens of teens seen enjoying their new-found freedom.
Everyone appeared in high spirits with one girl seen enjoying a ride in a trolley and another having fun on a friend's shoulders. 
A handful of teens were seen chatting to police with some reciving on the spot fines. 
Like so many milestones missed for the past two years due to the Covid pandemic,  schoolies was very close to being added to the list.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",-2
1719,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",3
1720,"THIS PICTURE of a set of sedimentary rocks, just published in Science, could have come from any geology textbook. Its illustration of the bottomset-foreset-topset transition found in river deltas is a classic of stratigraphy. Except that, technically, it is not a geological feature at all. The word “geology” derives from the Greek for “Earth discourse”. The rocks in question, however, are on Mars.
Specifically, they are in Jezero crater, which was once, when Mars had liquid water, a lake that had rivers flowing into it. The photograph was taken by Perseverance, NASA’s latest Mars rover, which landed in February, and adds to understanding of Mars’s watery past. The three groups of rocks—the gently inclined bottomset, with a more steeply sloping foreset above and a horizontal topset capping the lot—show, as might be expected, that Martian river deltas were similar to terrestrial ones.

The field of selenology (Moon discourse) also had a boost this week with the publication, again in Science, of results from China’s Chang’e-5 lunar-sample-return mission. This landed on December 1st 2020, on the Moon’s largest lava field, Oceanus Procellarum, the Ocean of Storms, and returned its samples to Earth on December 16th. Though now dead calm, in the distant past this was indeed a stormy place, for it was covered with liquid rock that subsequently solidified into the dark plain now visible to the naked eye in the Moon’s north-western quadrant.
The question is, when did all this happen? And the answer provided by Che Xiaochao of the Beijing SHRIMP Centre, a part of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, and his colleagues, is just under 2bn years ago. That is quite a long time, but is less than half the Moon’s age. Orbital evidence from crater counting had already suggested parts of Oceanus Procellarum were the youngest lava fields on the Moon. Recent features have a lower density of craters than do old ones. But estimates based on crater counting had ranged from 1.2bn to 3.2bn years. An exact date for the region’s formation helps calibrate the technique, which is used not only for the Moon, but also for Mercury and Mars.■",2

1722,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3

DELIVERANCE, WHEN it arrives, will come in a small glass vial. First there will be a cool sensation on the upper arm as an alcohol wipe is rubbed across the skin. Then there will be a sharp prick from a needle. Twenty-one days later, the same again. As the nurse drops the used syringe into the bin with a clatter, it will be hard not to wonder how something so small can solve a problem so large.
On November 9th Pfizer and BioNTech, two firms working as partners on a vaccine against covid-19, announced something extraordinary about the first 94 people on their trial to develop symptoms of the disease. At least 86 of them—more than nine out of ten—had been given the placebo, not the vaccine. A bare handful of those vaccinated fell ill. The vaccine appeared to be more than 90% effective.

Within a few weeks the firms could have the data needed to apply for emergency authorisation to put the vaccine to use. The British and American governments have said that vaccinations could start in December. The countries of the EU have also been told it will be distributed quickly.
The news lifted spirits around the world, not to mention stockmarkets (see article). The end of the pandemic seemed in sight; scientific insight and industrial know-how had, in a bravura display of their power, provided an exit strategy. Pfizer and BioNTech have not just developed a vaccine against a previously unknown disease in a scant ten months. They have done so on the basis of an approach to vaccination never before used in people. And their novel vaccine has shown an unanticipated efficacy. Most in the field thought 70% efficacy was good as could be hoped for first time out; just 50% could have been good enough for regulatory approval. Exceeding 90% hits the virus for six.
Russia and China have been vaccinating some citizens against covid-19 for some time outside the scope of clinical trials. On November 11th the Russian Direct Investment Fund announced that data showed Russia’s vaccine, known as Sputnik V, to be 92% effective. Before the Pfizer announcement this would have seemed highly implausible. Now it may seem less so, though the evidence is weak compared with Pfizer’s. And neither Sputnik V nor the Chinese vaccines have yet had their safety and efficacy addressed by the stringent regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in America and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Pfizer’s vaccine is now headed into that regulatory gamut with a small posse of followers hot on its heels (see table). Two other vaccines which are in phase-three trials—the sort of large, randomised trials designed to show the efficacy of a treatment—could submit data to the regulators fairly soon. Moderna, an American biotech firm, is expected to deliver interim findings about the efficacy of its vaccine in the next few weeks. AstraZeneca, a pharmaceuticals company working in partnership with the University of Oxford, should deliver results from its trial before the end of the year.

Challenges remain. Though the regulators will want to move quickly, they will still have to do their job. Missteps could erode confidence in the vaccine, as well as vaccination more generally. Plans for scaling up manufacture and for distribution on an unprecedented scale have been being made around the world for months, but it is hard to imagine that they will not require revision on the hoof. Even if the news continues to be good, the numbers vaccinated will remain small for months to come. But a fateful corner has been turned.

The technology of hope
Great speed has come from great efforts. Cath Green, the boss of the clinical biomanufacturing facility at the University of Oxford, remembers the pressure to get the first candidate-vaccine vials filled in April. Everyone was doing double shifts and working on weekends. “We knew it had to be this fast if we were to get a vaccine to people this year,” she says.
But it was not just hard work. New technology, a lack of financial constraint and a commitment to speeding up regulatory processes without sacrificing standards mattered, too.
Technology first. Vaccines against viruses used to be based on the virus particles they were meant to stymie. Some were strains of the virus “attenuated” so as not to cause disease; some were normal virus particles inactivated so that they could not reproduce at all. Design was somewhat hit and miss. Today vaccine development is based on viral genomes. Researchers look for a gene which describes a protein the immune system seems likely to recognise. Then they put that gene into a new context.
In the case of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, the genome was published on January 10th. Understanding its structure on the basis of their experience with other coronaviruses, would-be vaccine-makers immediately homed in on the gene for the distinctive spike protein with which the virus’s membrane is studded: just the sort of thing, they reckoned, to provoke a response from the immune system.
At BioNTech, a German biotechnology company that specialises in the use of mRNAS—sequences of genetic material that provide cells with recipes for making proteins—the spike-protein gene was more or less all it took. The company’s researchers made an mRNA version of it that could be injected into the body in tiny capsules made of lipids. There it would lead cells to produce the spike protein, and the immune system would then take note. Or so they hoped: no mRNA vaccine had been used in humans before. Moderna, too, has as its name suggests taken the mRNA route.
In Oxford a version of the spike gene was instead put into the genome of a harmless adenovirus originally found in monkeys; when the resultant virus infects cells it, too, makes them produce spike proteins that attract the immune system’s attention. The vaccine developed by J also uses the adenovirus approach, as does Sputnik V.
It is no accident that the vaccines that have come along fastest are based on these novel strategies. Before the coronavirus struck these technologies were already being developed as platforms on which a rapid response to a new viral disease could be built, work supported in part by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Vaccines which are built on such platforms are quick to engineer and comparatively easy to make.
The correct egg-to-basket ratio
That said, the work still requires money, which in the vaccine world is usually in short supply. With covid-19, though, governments have been willing to shovel cash at vaccine developers even though there was a risk they would get nothing in return. “We persuaded the UK government to fund us before they had any idea whether it would work,” says Dr Green. It was this ready cash, sometimes provided in the form of a commitment to buy the end product, which sped the process up, rather than any loosening of normal rules and procedures. “We haven’t cut any corners,” Dr Green continues. “And we haven’t taken any risks with our product.”
Rather than standing back, regulators in many countries have worked closely with companies to make sure their trials provide all the data needed for approval when the time is right. When it was safe to do so, the different phases of trials were allowed to overlap, with larger, later trials starting before smaller preliminary ones had produced all their data. At Oxford they were able to start human trials the day after animal safety data had been published.

Richard Hatchett, the head of CEPI, says Pfizer’s positive results increase the probability that other covid vaccines will be successful, too. They show that an mRNA vaccine can work, which is good news for Moderna; they also show that targeting the spike protein pays off. And the success goes beyond the current pandemic. Work CEPI expected to take five or ten years has been managed in less than one; if the various platforms in play all pay off, Dr Hatchett says, it will “transform vaccinology”.
The fact that there are more vaccines on the way matters for a number of reasons. One is that, despite this week’s good news, the Pfizer vaccine is not yet guaranteed approval. For one thing, its safety needs to be more fully ascertained. The firm says that no serious safety concerns have arisen during the trial. But the vaccine will come with side-effects, at least for some, and the company will only be in a position to request approval for the vaccine on an “emergency use” basis after it has two months of safety data showing such effects to be manageable. That requirement looks likely to be met in time for an application in the third week of November.
Then comes the question of what exactly the vaccine does: is it stopping infections completely—providing “sterilising immunity”—or simply amping up the body’s response so that infections do not cause disease? The latter attribute is undoubtedly a useful one for the individual concerned; all the better if, as well as lowering the chance of infection leading to disease, it also makes the disease less severe in those who succumb (there is as yet no available data on this). But it is a lot less desirable in public-health terms. If the vaccine stops disease but not infection, vaccinated people may be able to infect others while staying safe themselves.
If the Pfizer vaccine does not provide sterilising immunity there will be a need for one that does. And there are other ways that subsequent vaccines might prove preferable. Different vaccines can work better or worse with different populations, and for covid-19 it is important to find a vaccine which works well in old people. Their immune systems can often be unresponsive to vaccination, and they may do better with vaccines which, in the general population, do not look as effective. There is no guarantee that the best vaccine overall will be the best for the elderly.
And the Pfizer vaccine has some inconvenient characteristics. It needs to be kept at -70°C or even colder as it is moved from where it is made to where it is used, which requires a lot of equipment that other vaccines do not need. Seth Berkley, head of the vaccine finance group GAVI, warns that many countries do not currently have the wherewithal to meet that challenge. But he also notes that the lack is not insuperable. The Democratic Republic of Congo successfully deployed an Ebola vaccine that required similarly special care. “It’s a pain in the ass, it’s expensive, but it’s doable.”
Still, a vaccine which, if not liking it hot, at least liked it less cold would be a boon. So would one that only needed to be given once. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines all require two jabs weeks apart. A one-and-done vaccine, which is what J hopes for, makes setting up a vaccination programme far simpler. It also means a given number of doses will go a lot further.
On top of all this, the long-term efficacy of the vaccine will matter a lot. The Pfizer/BioNTech collaboration says that protection should last at least a year. But that will not be known for sure before they apply to regulators for full authorisation on the basis of final trial results, which they are expected to do in the first quarter of next year (as are the makers of the other front-runners). A vaccine that provides protection only briefly might well not be able to disrupt the virus’s transmission, instead feeding a constant stream of newly susceptible people back into the population at large. Marcus Schabacker, the boss of the Emergency Care Research Institute, an American organisation focused on the quality and safety of medical practices, thinks six months of follow-up data ought to be scrutinised, not just two, before final decisions are made on deploying the vaccine.

Such questions will be on the minds of regulators at the FDA and EMA when they are asked to consider the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use later this month and when Pfizer and the makers of other vaccines submit all the data from their trials next year. Their opinions will have worldwide effects, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) will use the analytical capabilities of those authorities to accelerate the review of vaccines for use in low- and middle-income countries.
If emergency authorisation is granted it is likely the agencies will restrict the use of these vaccines, initially, to those at highest risk of death or serious disease. If after seeing the full data the regulators still have worries they may continue to limit the vaccines’ use. Whatever they decide they are very likely to insist on years of follow up.
Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, says it is important that all developers carry on with trials as long as possible. But this may be hard unless early use is restricted to specific groups. If a vaccine is approved for use in the general population, few will volunteer to take part in a trial for another vaccine that uses a placebo as a control (if Pfizer and BioNTech receive an emergency authorisation they plan to offer all the volunteers who were given a placebo the active vaccine). A trial that compares an experimental vaccine with one that is already approved needs to be very large to get results, since both wings can be expected to show comparatively few infections. Such trials are under discussion, but they will take a long time.
If vaccines are approved for widespread use, the world will face what some have called the largest supply-chain challenge in history. There is normally little spare vaccine-manufacturing capacity to repurpose. And production is not the only limiting factor. Analysts at UBS, a bank, warn that “fill and finish”, where the vaccine is put into vials and packaged, could be one of the most significant bottlenecks.

Pfizer says it will only be able to make enough vaccine to inoculate 25m people in 2020. Up to 1.3bn doses are possible, in theory, next year—enough for another 650m people. If other vaccines are approved then the supply will increase. In even the most optimistic scenarios, though, Dr Hatchett expects demand to exceed supply throughout 2021.
Various countries have already set up purchase agreements with vaccine developers (see chart). The COVAX facility set up by CEPI, GAVI and the WHO will buy vaccines for 150 countries, and aims to procure enough for them to get 20% of their populations vaccinated over the course of 2021. UNICEF, the UN’s children’s agency, will take a leading role in distribution. It normally procures 600m-800m syringes for routine childhood immunisations every year. The demands of covid are likely to treble or quadruple that number.

There is clearly a risk that nations will hoard some vaccine for their own use rather than that of the most needy, but it is not easy to say how large the problem will be. Pharma firms have cleverly placed manufacturing sites around the world, including in small countries such as Belgium and Switzerland which can quickly produce more vaccine than these countries could ever want. And the COVAX framework has wide international support.
That framework follows advice from the WHO in identifying three priority groups for early vaccination: front-line health- and social-care workers; the over 65s; and those under 65 who have underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, which put them at particular risk. Countries setting their own priorities are by and large prioritising the same groups. This means that young and middle-aged people not in any risk categories are unlikely to be vaccinated until well into next year. Social distancing and mask wearing will stay important for some time to come even after vaccination becomes widespread. But a more normal form of life looks unlikely to be too long delayed.
For vaccination to work as well as it can requires a widespread willingness to be vaccinated—something that cannot be taken for granted in a world where anti-vaccine disinformation has a strong foothold. The data on this front, though, are broadly encouraging. A survey of 20,000 adults in 27 countries undertaken for the World Economic Forum this August found that 74% would get a vaccine if it were available. In China the figure was 97%, in India 87%, in America 67%. Countries with low rates of acceptance were Russia (54%), Poland and Hungary (both 56%) and France (59%).
A cold coming
Better testing, new antibody treatments and improvements in care will continue to drive down the death rate for coronavirus both before widespread vaccination and after it. Vaccination will instead change the fundamentals. Its advent marks the beginning of the end of covid-19 as a pandemic.
But for all the hope that diligence and science have kindled, there are hard winter months to face before that spring. The official tally of daily deaths round the world is now for the first time higher than it was in the pandemic’s first peak, and the spread of the virus in America appears to be out of control (see article). In the next three months hundreds of thousands of people look likely to die. Not only will their loved ones have to come to terms with this loss, they will also have to live with the knowledge that a vaccine that could have saved them, even though developed at breakneck speed, arrived just too late.■

1724,"IT LOOKS LIKE the perfect time to be a chipmaker. The market for semiconductors continues to grow rapidly. By the end of the decade it will exceed $1trn globally, up from $500bn this year, forecasts VLSI Research, a firm of analysts. Demand keeps outstripping supply; the chip shortage is now expected to last well into 2023, paralysing factories of everything that needs processors—which in this day and age is basically everything. Western governments have earmarked billions to build chipmaking capacity within their borders in order to become less dependent on Asian suppliers. America alone is planning to spend $52bn over the next five years.
In this context the initial public offering (IPO) of GlobalFoundries, a contract manufacturer which makes chips for other firms, seems a safe bet. The firm, which unveiled its prospectus on October 4th and is expected to list soon, is the world’s fourth-biggest chip foundry by revenues. The typical characteristics of an IPO—a lowish offering price and a small proportion of shares available to public investors, both of which have yet to be decided—should ensure a healthy “pop” in the share price in the early days of trading. But GloFo, as semiconductor aficionados endearingly call the firm, is also an example of how tough the chip business has become, notwithstanding the favourable climate.

GloFo is a product of consolidation, caused by the industry’s unforgiving economics that demand ever-tinier silicon furrows and hence ever-costlier fabrication plants (or “fabs”). The most advanced of these now cost more than $20bn apiece. After a spin-off in 2009 from AMD, which designs processors for personal computers and servers in data centres, GloFo later acquired Chartered Semiconductor, another foundry, and the chip-manufacturing business of IBM, a purveyor of assorted information-technology wares.
With billions from Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign-wealth fund from the United Arab Emirates, which currently owns all of GloFo, the firm tried to keep up with rivals in the race to forge cutting-edge electronic circuitry. In 2018 it gave up and started catering to the lower end of the market. These are semiconductors which go into products such as cars and machine tools, and therefore do not need the highest-performing processors, rather than data centres or smartphones. This niche is still a $54bn market, according to Gartner, another market-researcher.
Today GloFo operates a handful of fabs across the world, employs around 15,000 people and has a market share of 7% in the chip-manufacturing business. Most of its customers, which include AMD, Broadcom, another American chip designer, and NXP, a Dutch one, are “single sourced”. That means their chips cannot be made by other foundries, such as Samsung of South Korea and in particular Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s mightiest chip manufacturer, which controls more than half the market.
The difference in size goes a long way to explaining why TSMC is hugely profitable whereas GloFo struggles to generate cash. In the first six months of this year the Taiwanese giant boasted sales of $26bn and profits of $9.8bn. Although GloFo’s revenues rose to $3bn in the same period, up by nearly 13% on a year ago, and its accounting losses have been narrowing, it still lost $300m between January and June.
Investing in GloFo will therefore be a wager that the company can ride the current tailwinds in its industry and start making serious money. But it may also be a bet that another firm snaps up GloFo for itself. In July it emerged that Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker by revenues, was in takeover talks with the firm. These did not go anywhere because the parties could not agree on a price. Once GloFo is listed it should be clearer how much it is worth. Negotiations could restart. Then again, with GloFo’s numbers now public, Intel may have a hard time convincing its shareholders that it needs to pay the $25bn that GloFo is expected to fetch. ■

1725," (CNN)Success hasn't spoiled ""Succession,"" as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of ""Veep"" blush.Having become HBO's version of ""Game of Thrones"" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of ""fine wines"" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, ""Can I do this? Can I win?""Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.While Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by ""Succession"" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with ""Veep,"" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.""Succession"" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that ""Game of Thrones"" comparison, the battles on ""Succession"" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.""Succession"" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",0
1726,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Media entrepreneur Byron Allen has raised $10 billion in preferred equity and debt for his bid for U.S. regional TV station operator Tegna Inc (TGNA.N), hoping to prevail over a rival offer from investment firms Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) and Standard General LP, people familiar with the matter said.

Allen, who acquired the Weather Channel TV network for $300 million in 2018, made a $23 per share offer for Tegna in September, while Apollo and Standard General offered $22 per share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tegna wants both bidders to raise their offers, one of the sources said. It also expects assurances from both bidders that they will entertain all regulatory demands necessary to complete the acquisition, and views the Apollo/Standard General bid as most likely to raise antitrust concerns, the source added.
Apollo owns 33 TV stations in 20 markets through its portfolio company Cox Media Group, while Standard General owns four TV stations, according to their websites.
Tegna reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday and said on a call with analysts it was still evaluating acquisition proposals versus its stand-alone prospects.
The company recorded $756 million in revenue in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. It has 64 television stations in 51 U.S. markets, and a market value of $7.75 billion including debt.",3
1727,"AN ANTIBODY THERAPY from Regeneron, a firm in upstate New York, improves the survival of patients with covid-19 and offers renewed hope for the treatment of those most seriously ill with the disease. A study in British hospitals found that Regen-Cov saved the lives of many of those unable to make their own antibodies in response to SARS-CoV-2. Such “seronegative” individuals constituted about a third of the 9,785 hospital patients in the study. As compared with a control group given standard treatment (either a steroid called dexamethasone or, for the sickest, an anti-inflammatory known as tocilizumab), 20% more patients survived. Regen-Cov also reduced the median length of hospital stays from 17 to 13 days.
Regen-Cov is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, known as casirivimab and imdevimab. Antibodies are immune-system proteins that disable pathogens by locking specifically onto them. Both casirivimab and imdevimab bind to different sites on the coronavirus’s “spike” protein, preventing the virus from infecting cells. Using two antibodies instead of one reduces the risk of the virus evolving resistance to the treatment.

Until now, trials have not made a convincing case for the widespread use of antibody therapies for covid-19. One problem has been a failure to identify a clear group of patients who can benefit from these costly treatments. This is the first study large enough to show that such a therapy reduces mortality in patients admitted to hospital with severe covid-19. A year ago, the same Recovery trial run by British scientists also discovered that dexamethasone would save patients’ lives.
Regen-Cov already has emergency authorisation for use in America, Brazil, Canada, the European Union and India, but remains an investigational drug in Britain and elsewhere. Even if authorisation follows in many other countries, though, access to it is likely to remain extremely restricted.

Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist at the World Health Organisation, said the result was good news, but warned that access to monoclonal-antibody drugs was “limited globally”. A recent study by the Wellcome Trust, a British medical charity, and IAVI, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, showed just how unavailable these drugs are in various parts of the world (see chart). More than three-quarters of the market for them is in America, Canada and Europe. So far, two countries, America and Germany, have bought large supplies of Regen-Cov. In January, America agreed to purchase up to 1.25m doses for $2.6bn. In the same month, Germany spent $487m on 200,000 doses. (Donald Trump was treated with Regen-Cov when he fell ill with covid-19.)
The reasons for this geographical concentration are twofold but related: quantity and price. Production facilities for monoclonal-antibody therapies are few. And, in general, only wealthy countries can afford them. Regen-Cov costs many thousands of dollars a dose.
Dr Swaminathan says more monoclonal-antibody factories need to be established around the world so that such treatments become accessible and affordable. Lack of availability of Regen-Cov will probably become a topic of interest to those who argue that intellectual property in covid-19-related technologies should be waived by the World Trade Organisation.
So far, trials for covid-19 antibody-therapies have generally been disappointing, but news of Regen-Cov’s success is likely to reinvigorate interest in them. Eli Lilly’s antibody therapy, LY-CoV555, failed to provide benefit to hospital patients in a trial reported last December, while on June 15th a similar drug from AstraZeneca also disappointed when given to those who had been exposed to the virus. These drugs might, however, turn out to be beneficial if they are given to the narrower patient group identified by the Recovery trial.
Should demand for Regen-Cov now increase, though, it is not clear how quickly supply could be improved—even in countries that have the money to pay for it. Monoclonal-antibody production lines are currently used to make cancer and arthritis drugs, which are also badly needed. Moreover, supplies of much of the equipment required, including biobags (giant disposable plastic bags used to make drugs), filters and sterilisation gear, are already stretched thin by demands from vaccine manufacturers. Earlier this year, two pharma companies complained that their ability to make monoclonal antibodies was hampered by shortages of equipment, thanks to the global push to make vaccines.
Any attempt to increase the supply of monoclonal antibodies in coming months could thus compete with vaccine manufacturing. America currently has a lock on much of the supply of equipment and raw materials needed to make vaccines, a hold it maintains through the use of the Defence Production Act. If America chose to use the DPA to support monoclonal antibody production, that might have an impact on vaccine production in countries such as Brazil, Britain and India.
The Recovery study also seems to settle a scientific debate about whether it is worth giving antiviral therapies to covid-19 patients when they arrive in hospital. It is. It had been thought that, by the time a patient arrived, only anti-inflammatory drugs, which treat damage already done by the virus, were relevant. Knowledge that patients who are seronegative are able to benefit from antiviral therapies opens up further lines of investigation for antiviral drugs. In the Recovery trial, untreated seronegative patients were twice as likely to die as those who were able to mount an antibody response.
For doctors, the trial raises an intriguing question. If they have patients languishing at home with covid-19, might it be worth offering a cheap lateral flow test to try to identify those who are not mounting an immune response? If it is possible to spot those most likely to end up in hospital, and stop that happening, it would help to weaken the virus’s hold on patients, and on society at large.

1728,"IT WAS ONLY a question of time before Kabul fell, says A.S. Dulat, a former head of India’s top spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, speaking from Delhi. The only surprise was the speed of the Taliban’s advance, concurs the ex-boss of Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence, or ISI, Asad Durrani, speaking from Islamabad. The two old warriors nod in unison. Despite lifetimes spent jousting in the shadow war between India and Pakistan, the former foes seem happy to agree on the inevitability of the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. What they do not tell their Indian interviewer is how sharply different the implications of the change are for each of the South Asian rivals.
For India, the house-of-cards collapse of the 20-year-old Afghan democracy represents a strategic setback and a stinging humiliation. Since 2001 India has spent a non-trivial $3bn or so to bolster the American-installed regime. It built roads, dams, power lines, clinics and schools across the country. It trained Afghan officers, including women, in its military academies. It gave scholarships to thousands. India even presented a fancy new parliament, complete with fountains and a giant bronze dome. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, himself inaugurated it in 2015.

Besides losing all its investment in a secular, democratic Afghanistan, India has also lost strategic leverage. There were never Indian troops in Afghanistan, but its aid projects and four consulates certainly spooked the generals running the show in Pakistan. India’s close ties with the Afghan government gave its own security establishment a whiff of “over-the-horizon” influence that felt appropriate to an emerging superpower. When Pakistan-backed Islamists mounted terrorist attacks on India and stirred violence in its restive region of Kashmir, India could threaten to use its Afghan assets to stir trouble in Pakistan’s restive region of Balochistan. Now, with Mr Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government having stirred its own troubles in Kashmir, by stripping the region of autonomy in 2019, it must face the prospect of a new generation of Muslim Kashmiris inspired by the Taliban’s fanaticism.
Perhaps because its spies read the writing on the wall, or perhaps because its teachers and engineers increasingly risked being kidnapped, India had wound down its Afghan presence in recent years. Yet it was only in June that Indian envoys took the first tentative steps to engage with the Taliban. The reckoning with what an abrupt American departure from its backyard means for India has also been slow to settle. The Times of India, the country’s biggest-circulation English daily, voiced one common perception in a sour editorial on August 16th: “At a time when India has strategically hitched its wagon to the US, the Afghan situation should make New Delhi think twice about putting all its eggs in Washington’s basket.”
This is a conclusion that Pakistan, as well as its “all-weather friend” China, will be happy for India to draw. With a stagnant economy and stymied politics, India’s nuclear-armed neighbour has not had much to cheer about of late. So it is that even if urban Pakistanis have little affinity with the Taliban, many are crowing at the Islamists’ success. Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, went so far as to proclaim that Afghans had “broken the chains of slavery” with the West.

Mr Durrani says that Pakistan itself deserves no credit for the Taliban victory, except for having resisted pressure from America and its allies to crack down on the group. He is too modest. The original Taliban, or “students”, of the 1990s, were students in Pakistani madrassas. Certainly, after America’s invasion in 2001, the Taliban would never have survived their years in the wilderness without the haven provided by Pakistan.
That Pakistan has stood by the Taliban is especially striking, considering that an ideological affiliate based in Afghanistan, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), has terrorised Pakistan itself, for example by slaughtering more than 145 children and adults at an army-run school in 2014. Questioned about reports that the Taliban have released TTP leaders from the Afghan prisons, the Pakistani interior minister says airily that he hopes for an agreement between the two countries not to allow their soil to be used to attack the other. Luckily for Pakistan’s generals they are rarely held accountable for any violent “blowback” from the ISI’s nastier associates. Aside from the occasional diversion of a television interview, Mr Durrani can continue to enjoy his retirement in peace.",2
1729,"WHILE ASSORTED G20 “Sherpas”, officials who do the donkey work on summits, gathered in Dhahran in Saudi Arabia in March last year, lockdowns were starting and international travel was stopping. A scramble to get home began. But within weeks, after some teething troubles with videoconference technology, the Sherpas were conducting talks over Zoom and Webex, and their bosses were holding a leaders’ summit by video. Diplomacy had gone virtual.
“For a long time we’ve been talking about the advent of digital diplomacy,” says Jonathan Black, Britain’s sherpa. “It has really now arrived.” Over the past year diplomats have all but abandoned big multilateral meetings in the flesh. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which normally clogs up New York for two weeks in September as thousands of delegates jet into the city, became a more modest affair with leaders joining via screens.

In the parts of the world that have secured vaccines “in-person” diplomacy is slowly restarting. When Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, hosts fellow G7 foreign ministers for “covid-secure” talks in London on May 3rd-5th, it will be the first time the group has met in the same room since they did so in Saint-Malo in France in April 2019. Current plans envisage that the full G7 summit in Cornwall in June, and a NATO one in Brussels immediately afterwards, will be in-person too.
In the meantime, a great experiment in virtual diplomacy has been under way. In February, for example, Joe Biden held his first summit meeting as president, with Justin Trudeau of Canada, by videoconference. Without leaving the White House, he has since joined a virtual meeting of fellow G7 leaders hosted in London in February—cyber-hopping across to Germany on the same day to speak at the Munich Security Conference—as well as the inaugural summit of the “Quad” (America, Australia, India and Japan) in March. In April he brought together 40 world leaders on screen for a climate summit. Diplomats everywhere, accustomed to ceaseless flying around the world, have spared the national coffers and done their bit to save the planet by cutting out travel.
“Diplomacy has not stopped; it’s accelerated in some respects,” says Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador, now at Harvard University. Communiqués have been agreed upon, resolutions passed, relationships nurtured. In some respects diplomats have probably never been busier.
Hurdles have had to be overcome. At the UN, Russia has refused to accept anything other than physical presence for the Security Council, depriving virtual meetings of formal status. That has slowed things down. Since the seats in the council are not sufficiently socially distanced, a system had to be worked out for voting by emailed letters. With receptions and other forms of entertainment ruled out, diplomats have had to adapt. Instead of the usual dinner to mark their stint as president of the Security Council in February, for example, the British distributed picnic baskets to other missions—placing an unusual amount of diplomatic weight on Branston pickle and Fortnum  Mason tea.
The main workarounds, however, have involved not tea but technology. Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms have both enabled diplomacy to continue and opened new possibilities for efficiency and reach. “We’re a lot better off now because of covid, in terms of diplomacy and mediation, because we’ve been forced to think more carefully about how to do our job,” says Martin Griffiths, the UN’s special envoy for Yemen. “It’s a huge seismic change to the way we do business.”
It is not the first time that technology has transformed the world of diplomats. Ambassadors used to be “the equivalent of ship captains”, says Charles Freeman, a former American ambassador, now at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University. “They were far away and not subject to control.” At the Congress of Vienna in 1814-15, the British foreign secretary, Lord Castlereagh, enjoyed great autonomy, since letters to London might take four to six weeks to arrive. “I did not wait for instructions at Vienna,” he later told Parliament. “I took upon myself the responsibility of acting.”
The telegraph changed all that. News and instructions travelled instantly, to generals in battle and diplomats in embassies. Envoys bemoaned their loss of autonomy (one British diplomat lamented the “telegraphic demoralisation of those who formerly had to act for themselves”). Diplomatic power became more centralised.
The pace could still be leisurely. Winston Churchill fished with Franklin Roosevelt and painted with Dwight Eisenhower. Leaders invested time “tending the diplomatic garden”, as George Shultz, America’s secretary of state under Ronald Reagan, put it. In his final year in office, in 1988, Shultz undertook an eight-country, three-week tour of Asia, “unthinkably long by today’s standards”, recalls Mr Burns, who accompanied him.
Cables and wireless
Since then, air travel and the demands of the news cycle back home have led to shorter summits and a general acceleration of diplomacy. Email and social media have further speeded things up, often bypassing careful drafting and clearance procedures developed to avoid mistakes. Under the presidency of Donald Trump, an impulsive tweet could short-circuit the best-laid diplomatic plans. Modern diplomats have had to adjust to “the annihilation of distance and the compression of time”, as Mr Freeman puts it.

Now covid-19 has shaken things up still more. For one thing, it has played havoc with foreign services’ plans and personnel. At the top, foreign trips have been scaled right back (see chart). Down the ranks, many diplomats have been withdrawn from their posts because of health precautions, or find themselves on extended tours without their families. The pandemic itself has also become a core element in diplomacy, whether as part of soft-power manoeuvring between America, China and Russia, or among allies in tensions stoked by vaccine nationalism. But its longer-term impact will probably be on how diplomacy is conducted, changing practices in three important ways.
First, in the often staid world of diplomats, it has accelerated the adoption of technological tools. Videoconferencing and other means of direct communication, especially via WhatsApp and (for greater security) Signal, have been used more widely. Foreign services’ investment in secure video technology is expected to grow.
Martin Waehlisch, who leads an “innovation cell” at the UN in New York, says the pandemic has boosted adoption of virtual-reality (VR) technology to give decision-makers in New York a sense of what it is like to be on the ground in conflict zones. He sees this as “the future of briefings”, replacing the traditional reports in “Times New Roman, single-space, black-and-white block text”. “Iraq 360”, a VR experience to help mobilise donors, showed the possibilities in 2019. Now the restrictions on travel have led to an investment in other immersive storytelling projects as an extra format for briefing the Security Council. Such projects are under way for Yemen, Sudan and Colombia. Mr Waehlisch hopes this will become standard practice.

The second change is improved productivity, thanks to videoconferencing. Interacting with people around the world has become a lot simpler. “I’ve been able to reach out to more people because I’m not constantly in an airport or on the road,” says Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN’s undersecretary-general for political affairs. Thanks to Zoom and other platforms, it has become possible for diplomats and political leaders to show up for speeches and meetings that they would almost certainly not have attended had their physical presence been required.
For example, 12 foreign ministers and a prime minister might not have flown to New York in February to discuss global vaccine access, but they did all take part in a virtual Security Council meeting on the subject. Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, would hardly have travelled from Canberra to the Rocky Mountains just to address the Aspen Security Forum, as he did last August. It takes months of planning to assemble all the people necessary for a G20 or ASEAN gathering, but you can bring presidents and prime ministers together on a video screen with relative ease. For peace talks, too, virtual platforms make it possible to bring in people who probably wouldn’t find the time to get on a plane and spend several days cloistered in Stockholm or Geneva.
Virtual meetings also cut out a lot of the formalities and pomposity of traditional diplomacy. They are “a great leveller”, says a diplomat from a UN Security Council member: “They’re in their bedroom and you’re in your bedroom.” In the bigger gatherings, officials feel less need to be loquacious than when they have the floor after travelling for a day to deliver a message. As a result, they can sometimes achieve much the same outcome, insiders say, only faster.
Blessed are the peacemakers
The third change may be the most important: the pandemic has accelerated experiments in ways to include a wider range of voices in peace efforts. For some time “inclusivity” has been a buzzword in the world of conflict resolution. Diplomats know that peace processes are often perceived as being imposed from above, or from outside, and that any such deals may not enjoy widespread support. A number of private-diplomacy outfits, such as the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), based in Geneva, have worked to facilitate the involvement of grassroots representatives, including women and young people. But the logistics can be hard. Getting a handful of women from a conflict zone to Switzerland for a few days of discussion is a challenge at the best of times. During a pandemic it can be an impossibility.
So mediators turned to technology—and found relatively quick and easy ways to bring in people who are not normally consulted on a political or peace process. Diplomats are now excited about the potential. “This should become a standard part of how we operate,” says Ms DiCarlo. Her innovation cell in New York repurposed a commercial tool normally used for market research to develop the ability to conduct what it calls “large-scale synchronous dialogues”. These digital focus groups feel like a texting chat, but have the scale of an opinion poll.
The first experiment was in Yemen. A regular poll with 20-30 questions in that country would cost €250,000 ($300,000) and take a month to get the answers, according to Mr Waehlisch of the innovation cell; the digital dialogue cost only a modest consultancy fee for the question design, and produced results instantly. “It’s quite extraordinary for the UN to be in the forefront of this stuff,” says Mr Griffiths, the envoy for Yemen. “It’s terrific, it’s 21st-century diplomacy, because of course it gets away from men in rooms.”
The absence of alternatives
Libya shows the impact this can have. Last year the pandemic pushed negotiations between the country’s rival forces onto video platforms—Zoom for the political dialogue, Teams for the military track. In the summer, with the help of HD’s mediators, a physical meeting in Montreux led to a road map for reconciliation, the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF). Stephanie Williams, at the time the UN’s acting special representative for Libya, realised she needed to expand the numbers in the dialogue for it to be more representative.
In September she started doing big Zoom sessions with mayors, women’s groups and youth activists; representatives of each group reported back to the LPDF, giving their suggestions. In all, Ms Williams says, some 200 women took part, as well as 100-150 young people and the majority of Libya’s 130 municipalities. And then, between November and January, she held five digital dialogues, averaging over 1,000 people for each one, typing back and forth in Arabic. “It really took off with the Libyans,” says Ms Williams. “And it turned out to be a great tool.”
The dialogues included spot polls, which confirmed a lot of what she knew Libyans wanted from the political process, “but we were also able to use it to push the political class, to say, hey, it’s not just the UN mission that’s saying what Libyans want.” In particular the dialogues were useful in pressing the need for unified institutions before elections, which are planned for December. In giving Libyans a voice, the UN’s diplomats reckon, the Zoom calls and dialogues not only boosted confidence in the peace process but improved the prospects for it lasting. An opinion poll (of the traditional sort) in February by Diwan Research found that 71% of Libyans were satisfied with the LPDF process to select a new government, and 68% deemed the process fair and transparent.
Sooner or later these tools would have been put to use in diplomacy. But the constraints of covid-19 had the effect of hastening their adoption, in Libya saving valuable time. “I don’t think that we would have considered things like the digital dialogues had it not been for the pandemic,” Ms Williams says.
Even enthusiasts for the new possibilities of digital diplomacy, however, are keenly aware of its limits. Building a rapport is harder on Zoom than in person. Samantha Power, when appointed by Barack Obama to be America’s ambassador at the UN, went to the trouble of paying a visit to each of her 192 fellow mission heads (with the sole exception of North Korea’s), an investment in relationships that could no doubt be done far more easily today by Zoom, but with much less impact.
Part of what is missing are the signals you can pick up about an interlocutor in a physical meeting: the visible reaction. “When you ask a tough question, do they blanch or do they back up, do they lean into it?” says Mr Burns of Harvard. “You’re not going to get that on Zoom.”
And the really hard part of a negotiation is best done in person. If things aren’t going well, a chat at the bar, or a stroll in the grounds, may help create a breakthrough. The plus side of virtual meetings, the efficiency gains, are also their minus side: you lose the time spent on the margins, the space for informal conversation that helps to establish trust. Difficult messages, often the stuff of diplomacy, can be delivered with more nuance, and less lasting damage to a relationship, face to face than when struggling with a poor connection. At a distance, diplomats say, it is easier to camp on a red line than when you are in the same room. Confidentiality is another concern: “The most delicate issues aren’t amenable to virtual,” says Mr Griffiths.

For all these reasons the toughest agreements—such as Britain’s Brexit deal with the EU—and the hardest conversations will still have to be worked out in person. It is one thing for the White House to convene world leaders to make worthy on-screen statements about tackling climate change, as happened on Earth Day in April. It is another to cajole and corral countries into a difficult agreement, as happened in the negotiating rooms at COP21, the Paris climate summit in 2015. Hence the hope that COP26 in Glasgow later this year can be held in person too.
So physical summitry will not end. Neither is the role of the resident ambassador under serious threat, despite the ease of direct digital communication between governments. Diplomats insist there is still no substitute for that man or woman sitting in the foreign capital, soaking up the culture, the politics, the media, the arguments, and being the acknowledged interpreter of that culture back home.
Diplomatic immunity
But any complacency about a simple reversion to pre-pandemic habits of diplomacy would be misplaced, just as it was after previous disruptions such as the telegraph and the jet plane. The big diplomatic jamborees of the past, such as UNGA, may never return in quite the same way. Digital tools, from virtual meetings to inclusive focus groups, have proved their worth. The diplomatic handbook is ready for a rewrite.
Covid-19 has hastened the arrival of hybrid diplomacy, a blend of the physical and digital. Quite what the ideal mix turns out to be has yet to be worked out, but it is something international negotiators and foreign services are starting to think through. In America Mr Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, want to reinvest in a State Department that had been badly neglected. The money and training should go on preparing for tomorrow’s diplomacy, not yesterday’s. ■",2
1730,"WHEN RICHARD NIXON made his historic visit to Beijing in February 1972, he reassured Mao Zedong that neither of their countries had plans for global hegemony, meaning that they could work together and “find common ground, despite our differences”.
Nixon’s trip marked a shift not just in America’s relations with China but also in the centre of gravity for analysis of the country in America. China-watchers moved towards a more doveish presumption that China did not pose a threat and a hope that engagement would mean it gradually becoming more like America. Nearly half a century on, the balance has shifted once again, towards a hawkish posture that, as in the cold war, stresses ideological competition. The relationship is as confrontational now as at any point in the 50 years since Nixon went to China.

“It doesn’t take any bravery to be a China hawk today. It takes bravery to not be one,” says a former official who advised several presidents on China. He and many others see a desire for a new cold war in Washington. President Joe Biden’s officials, like President Donald Trump’s, talk of “strategic competition” with China, rather than co-operation.
Both parties on Capitol Hill strike a similar tone. A bill called the Strategic Competition Act passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 21st, promising to “counter the malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party globally”. Analysts at think-tanks and in the media have written stratagems for containment and elegies for engagement.
Expertise about China is not necessary. Within government, analysts who once focused on war zones have pivoted to China. Those who preach moderation towards the Chinese government risk being tarred by the most strident hawks as apologists, their motives called into question. Esteemed China specialists who were previously called on by the White House for advice have fallen out of favour.
China’s own actions have prompted the pushback. In the past decade the Communist Party has intensified repression at home, ramped up military activity in its near seas and, with its newfound economic heft, pursued an increasingly aggressive foreign policy. Meanwhile Xi Jinping, China’s president, warned that China was engaged in an ideological struggle with the West, and that he would not tolerate dissent or unrest. His removal of term limits on his rule, the crushing of civil liberties in Hong Kong and the mass internment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang shocked many previously doveish analysts into hawkishness.
Former proponents of engagement are often now the loudest cheerleaders for the change in tone. “It was an illusion that China would change if we just sent more ballet troupes, more foundations, more academic exchanges, more journalists, more trade,” says Orville Schell of the Asia Society. “The message, and this is what the academic community is starting to understand, is that Leninism, if you have had many decades of it, is deep.”
Under Mr Trump, America’s national-security policy became focused on challenging China, by improving deterrence, especially in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait; by trying to stop Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, from building 5G networks around the world; and by rooting out Communist Party influence and espionage in America, subjecting an unknown number of academics and researchers with China links to scrutiny from the FBI.
Mr Trump appeared personally inclined to court Mr Xi and overlook or even applaud his repressive impulses. Yet the Trump administration was the first in the world to impose sanctions on Chinese officials and companies for their complicity in human-rights abuses in Xinjiang (the Biden administration would later co-ordinate further sanctions with its allies).
Dozens of American dissenters, including some prominent China scholars, pushed back in 2019 in an article in the Washington Post entitled “China is not an enemy”. They argued that America was exaggerating the threat from China as an “existential” one, and that its confrontational policy would weaken the hands of moderates within the Chinese government. On both counts their arguments were dismissed by critics as a rehash of engagement-era tropes, in particular the notion that there exists a meaningful pro-reform faction within Mr Xi’s Communist Party. The conversation about China in Washington remained unchanged.
In the summer of 2020 four Trump officials gave a series of speeches describing the Communist Party as a threat to freedom and democracy globally. And in January the Trump administration became the first government to declare that the atrocities committed against Uyghurs in Xinjiang constituted genocide, a view the Biden administration has repeated but other countries have generally not. Mr Biden has adopted the Trump hard line, with less fire-breathing rhetoric, about the contest between authoritarianism and democracy.
Public sentiment against China runs high, too, in America and among its democratic allies. Being tough on China will continue to be popular. What worries the moderates, and even some of the hawks, is how China will respond if it decides the Biden administration is, like the Trump administration appeared to be, locked in an adversarial struggle. The strategic rationale of Nixon’s opening to China was that they had an adversary in common, the Soviet Union. Now America and China are left only with each other.■

1731,"THE 13TH hole at Augusta National, named Azalea after the riotous pink blooms behind the green, is one of golf’s most celebrated par-fives. Its fairway turns sharply left after 275 yards, still 235 short of the flag. Most recreational players need three strokes to reach that azalea-fringed green—which is protected by a creek at the front and four bunkers at the back. Yet several competitors at this year’s Masters tournament, which starts at Augusta on April 8th, will expect to be on it in two.
Among them will be Bryson DeChambeau. Thanks to data analysis, more powerful clubs, more muscle and better technique, golf’s biggest hitters are driving the ball farther than ever, and the Californian farther than anyone. Last year Mr DeChambeau put on 40lb and a few yards. In September he won the US Open. And in November, at the Masters, bookmakers predicted he would triumph again, thanks to his ability to bomb the ball 350 yards or more and reach the greens on par-fives with just a drive and a short, lofted iron. On the final day, he holed out in a mere three shots on the 13th. (Alas, he hit some wild shots into the bushes, too, so he did not come close to winning the tournament. Another mighty hitter, Dustin Johnson, did.)

The defanging of golf’s most fearsome courses encapsulates a problem facing authorities in several sports. How should they respond when better technology, allied with improved physique and technique, lets players take a leap forward? Do they weigh them down again, or let them soar?
Thirty years ago, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) was facing a similar conundrum. Players were getting stronger and wielding more powerful rackets. Games were dominated by big serves and shorter, less entertaining rallies: “Just boom, boom, boom; bang, bang, bang,” shrugged Jimmy Connors, winner of eight Grand Slam tournaments in the 1970s and 1980s. According to Jeff Sackmann, a tennis analyst, the average length of a point in men’s singles finals at Wimbledon fell from just under three shots (ie, serve, return, winner) in 1981-85 to just above 1.5 (serve, returned half the time) by the end of the 1990s. On his way to the title in 2001 Goran Ivanisevic blasted 213 aces.
The ITF, with the organisers of the four Grand Slams, took action. Balls were made bigger and fluffier, so they travelled through the air more slowly. Courts were relaid with different materials to encourage bounce; at Wimbledon, different grass was sown. It worked: Mr Sackmann calculates that in 2011-15 the average point length at Wimbledon was up to more than four shots. Points got longer at the Australian and US Opens, too.
All the while, players have adapted, both to power and to changing conditions. Mark Kovacs, a tennis coach, says that having grown up facing big serves, the generation of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal not only served well themselves but became better than their predecessors at returning the ball. And Mr Kovacs expects “a big increase in the next five years in the power and speed of tennis players’ shots” as the game makes fuller use of sports science. This could in turn prompt the authorities to act again if power becomes too dominant once more.
In athletics and swimming, technology poses governing bodies a different problem. Runners and swimmers battle not only their opponents and the elements, but also the clock. Great rivalries and fierce championship races are thrilling—but doubly so when records are broken.
Several studies have suggested that humans are approaching the physical limits of how fast they can run and swim. On the track and in the pool, the progression of world records has slowed dramatically. In the 1960s seven men lowered the record for the 400 metres by a combined 1.3 seconds. In the next 50 years it was broken only thrice more, by a total of 0.8 seconds. Several marks in women’s sprinting have stood for more than 30 years. In 2008 Mark Denny, a Stanford biologist, estimated the fastest possible times for a range of races. So far, all but one of his predictions have held up. Even the mighty Usain Bolt failed to break the Denny barrier, despite setting records for the men’s 100 and 200 metres (9.58 and 19.19 seconds, both at the world championships in Berlin in 2009).
But lately, technology—in the shape of the newest running shoes—has helped athletes start smashing world records again, at least at longer distances. At the same meeting in October 2020, runners wearing Nike shoes cropped four seconds from the best time for the women’s 5,000 metres, which had stood for 12 years, and six from for the men’s 10,000 metres record, after 15.
Unlike the tennis authorities in the boom-boom years, World Athletics has taken a broadly permissive view. It has updated its guidelines, but the new rules would still allow almost all of the record-breaking shoes to be worn at the Olympics due to take place in Tokyo this summer. “It is a very difficult line to tread,” says Gareth Balch of Two Circles, a sports marketing agency. “You want to balance being modern and relevant with being contextual and traditional. The shoes are right on the line.”
A blanket ban on next-generation shoes would open World Athletics to accusations of obstructing innovation. But if it does nothing, record times could become so quick that modern, tech-powered athletics becomes shorn from glorious achievements in the past. Swimming offers a cautionary tale. Its governing body, FINA, permitted drag-reducing all-in-one polyurethane suits before the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Twenty-five world records were set, 23 of them by swimmers wearing all-in-ones. The suits became almost a requirement for winning a gold medal. FINA banned them the following year, but has been left with a group of records that subsequent swimmers have struggled to break. Instead, competition pools have been deepened and drainage improved to encourage faster times.
At Augusta golf’s rulemakers (the USGA in America and Mexico; the R elsewhere) will watch the tee shots with more than just the usual appreciative eye. In recent years they have become more concerned by the lengths that elite golfers are driving. One could make golf courses longer to accommodate big hitters, but that is expensive, since it typically requires more land. So this year the R and USGA published a report making the case for new regulations on clubs and balls. Outlawing new equipment would annoy its manufacturers—who spend a lot of money on sponsorships and advertising. And many players chafe at putative restrictions on their driving power.
Any changes would need to be phased in slowly, so whoever dons the winner’s green jacket at this year’s Masters will probably be a big hitter. But afterwards golf’s authorities are likely to look to the example of tennis, and tilt the balance of the sport back in favour of its most demanding holes and away from its power-hitting players.",2
1732,"“THE SHIPPING NEWS”, a novel about family history in Newfoundland by Annie Proulx, includes a passage about work. Jack, a former fisherman, explains how the local economy changed after the province joined Canada in 1949. Fishing went into decline, and with it a life that was “hard” but where “a man did what he wanted”. Manufacturing rose in its place, offering jobs where men sheltered indoors, away from the elements, and did what they were told. Today, politicians on all sides say that jobs in manufacturing represent good, honest work and lament their demise. Jack thought they were utterly miserable. 
For as long as capitalism has existed people have worried about labour markets. Why is this so? Perhaps it is because they produce inequalities that even the most right-wing know are not really fair. Perhaps it is because they are always changing, and people are resistant to new ways. But it is also because labour markets produce uncomfortable trade-offs. The rise of the factory gave workers more pay but less autonomy. Trade unions boosted workers’ wages but reduced employment. As textual analysis of books shows, at different times authors have worried about different problems linked to work.

The modern labour market has similar trade-offs. Yet this special report has argued that before covid-19, it was working fairly well. Contrary to popular belief, work was both more plentiful and more rewarding. Overall wage growth was not as strong as many hoped; but low pay was falling and job satisfaction was rising. There was no sign of an ever-growing “precariat”. 
The pandemic has been catastrophic. Yet it may presage improvements in the world of work. The shift to remote work may make many people happier and more productive. It is unlikely to encourage job-killing robots. And it is forcing policymakers to acknowledge some difficult truths about whose interests today’s economy serves best.  
Reform or perish
Politicians have more to do. Some reforms have long been called for. Dismantling occupational-licensing barriers would mean more jobs and lower prices. More liberal immigration regimes would boost innovation.
But the pandemic highlights two other necessary changes. The first concerns welfare. It turns out that in recessions sending cold, hard cash to families, especially poor ones, can do much good. America massively boosted the value of unemployment-insurance payments. Poorer households’ incomes held up, and America’s economic bounceback was one of the world’s strongest because people had money to spend.
Outside recessions, there is still more to do. Boosting in-work payments does a lot to reduce poverty, as America’s latest stimulus package will show. But it is of less use to those who are out of work altogether. Simply lavishing the unemployed with public funds may discourage them from finding work; but the lesson of Denmark is that it is possible to combine targeted generosity with incentives to take jobs, making the labour market more efficient. Another reform is updating the technology of welfare systems so that people are reliably paid what they are entitled to and poverty traps disappear, something Britain’s universal credit system should eventually guarantee.

Boosting welfare in this way would give workers better options, making them less willing to put up with bad jobs. More could also be done to improve people’s bargaining power at work, the second big change. The pandemic showed that many workers have too little clout. Some paid with their lives.
A few favour a renaissance of trade unions, and even detect the stirrings of a movement in the tech sector. Irrespective of whether this is a good idea, a meaningful revival is unlikely when manufacturing and heavy industry are so much smaller than they were. Others say that the entire rich world should follow Denmark and Germany down the path of collective bargaining, where workers and bosses come together to reach deals on pay and conditions. But that would require wholesale corporate-governance reform. Other ideas are more practical. Talk to corporate bosses and, because of the pandemic, many now believe that they need to give frontline workers more of a voice. This can be as simple as giving them access to a corporate email account.
Governments also need to step up. Particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries, too many unscrupulous employers flout labour law. Many of the most egregious violations relate to gig-economy companies, which pretend that their workers are self-employed contractors when they are in fact more like employees. These firms have not found loopholes in existing employment law, as is often believed. Instead they act with impunity mainly because enforcement of existing labour law is weak and punishment is feeble. That calls for more inspections of suspicious firms and tougher fines for rule-breakers.
Such reforms may be hard to do. And history suggests they will come with their own trade-offs, creating different sorts of discontents. But the eventual outcome should be to move towards a more efficient and fairer world of work. ■

1733,"WHO IS RISHI SUNAK? Listen to the chancellor’s recent rhetoric, and you could be forgiven for thinking he was cast in the mould of a predecessor, George Osborne, who slashed the state in response to the global financial crisis. In a speech to the Conservative Party faithful on October 4th Mr Sunak described borrowing as “immoral”, and emphasised his eagerness to restore order to the public finances. But the budget he delivered on October 27th confused the picture. Reeling off spending measures, he refused to apologise for raising taxes and lauded the spending they supported. “The Conservatives are the real party of public services,” he trilled.
Mr Sunak displayed rare munificence. Government departments will get real increases in their budget of 3% a year on average until 2024-25, an increase reminiscent of largesse last seen consistently in the 2000s. Even more eye-popping are the chancellor’s plans for the size of the post-pandemic state. According to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), a watchdog, spending will grow from 39.8% of GDP before the pandemic to 41.6% by 2026-27, the highest sustained share since the 1970s. Tax will rise from 33.5% of GDP to 36.2%, a level not seen since the early 1950s. The announcements recalled not Mr Osborne, but a very different predecessor: Labour’s Gordon Brown.

The Brownite giveaway was prompted by a surprisingly perky economy. In March the OBR projected GDP growth of 4.1% this year. Now, thanks to rosier employment figures, it predicts 6.5%. In the same period, medium-term damage expected from covid-19 has gone from a gloomy 3% of GDP to a cautious 2%. Part of this is simply the passage of time revealing that investment has performed better than expected. But Mr Sunak is also benefiting from his adroit handling of the pandemic, which limited the hit to corporate balance-sheets.
All of this means Britain is borrowing less than expected. People are earning more, which increases the tax take. And Mr Sunak has raised taxes. In September he announced a health and social care levy, which will bring in a net sum of £12bn ($16bn) by 2024-25, and increased dividend tax rates. This year has seen the biggest overall tax rise since 1993—which is not a message the Tories will put on leaflets at the next general election.

Mr Sunak did offer some red meat to Conservative members. There was relief for payers of business rates, a cut to corporate-tax rates for banks and the now traditional fuel-duty freeze (as has happened without fail for the past decade). But none of these will cost more than £2bn a year by 2024-25. Mr Sunak also announced new fiscal rules: there will be no borrowing for day-to-day spending in three years’ time and debt will fall as a share of GDP. On current plans, he will meet these targets, but he has left less margin for error than his predecessors did with their rules, which all went unmet.
By the next election, Mr Sunak plans to be using most of the windfall delivered by better economic growth to lower borrowing (or, perhaps, as a slush fund for tax cuts). But now, he is spending—and in particular to ease the pressure on public services brought about by the pandemic. The health department will see the biggest increase, because hospitals must deal with both covid and an enormous backlog, but most will have at least some sort of rise. This will begin to reverse the cuts applied by Mr Osborne (see chart).

Given how much of the budget was trailed before, some wondered whether anything would be left for the main event. But the chancellor managed a few surprises. Half the planned increase in departmental spending in 2024-25 will restore foreign aid to 0.7% of GDP, a target abandoned during the pandemic. A welcome simplification to the mess of alcohol taxation was seized on by Mr Sunak, a Brexiteer, as a benefit of leaving the EU (it would not have been possible as part of the bloc). Firms running retail, hospitality and leisure properties will enjoy a temporary cut to business rates, to help their post-pandemic recovery.
The most impressive rabbit Mr Sunak pulled out of his hat was an increase in the generosity of Universal Credit, a benefit for working-age people. He faced criticism in September for allowing a pandemic-related uplift to expire, which cost recipients £1,000 a year. Rather than reverse the cut, Mr Sunak reduced the rate at which the benefit is withdrawn as people earn more. The Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, was quick to point out that together with higher minimum-wage rates, the change would still leave the poorest fifth of households £280 a year worse off.But it does at least cushion the blow.
Critics complain that the outlook for households’ disposable income is still pretty dismal. Mr Sunak’s cursory treatment of climate change smacked of complacency—and the trove of documents released alongside his speech revealed little that would fulfil Britain’s bold climate-change ambitions. Given the number of global leaders about to descend on Glasgow to discuss the matter, it was slightly odd to announce a cut on short-haul flights taxes (and not to raise fuel duty).
Before the budget, there was lots of noise about the growing distance between Mr Sunak and the prime minister, Boris Johnson. There were even rumours that Mr Johnson would move the chancellor to a different, less prominent job, so perturbed was he by his rival’s star power. But the fiscal event revealed them to be aligned, at least as far as governing the country is concerned. Both are happy to spend big if circumstances call for it. Neither is a small-state ideologue. ■",2
1734,"Six-year-old Areia Perdios darts through capes, hot-dog suits and warrior-queen sets. Spirit Halloween has popped up on 57th Street in New York, just a few blocks from her home, and in a few days it will be gone—leaving as suddenly as it arrived. “You kind of wait for it,” says Emily Perdios, Areia’s mother, still unsure what she will dress as. Her daughter, however, is certain: she wants to be a bunny. After all, Ms Areia is “not really into witches any more”. 
The Perdios family is one of many who turn to Spirit Halloween—a pop-up store that arrives in shopping centres and strip malls for a couple of months each year. The business has existed for close to four decades and now has more than 1,400 costume stores across the United States and Canada. 
Americans spend big money on Halloween, for which adults as well as children dress up as ghosts, penguins or cardinals. This year the average American will probably shell out more than $100, according to the National Retail Federation, and households with children are projected to spend $50 on top of that. Total Halloween spending is likely to be $10.1bn, up from $8bn last year, when covid precautions curbed the fun.  
Spirit’s stores appear for only a couple of months each year, but Steven Silverstein, the company’s boss, says setting up takes all year: it’s “24/7, 365 Halloween”.  He hires more than 25,000 seasonal staff and relies on a network of local estate agents to make deals with landowners. After Spirit takes possession of premises in early August, the shops are up and running in a matter of weeks. 
This year supply-chain backlogs delayed the arrival of goods at Spirit’s stores, Mr Silverstein says. Those delays have complicated online shopping, too. “If I can’t get anything [at Spirit] and have to go to Amazon, it’s not going to make it,” says Bala Gopal, a 34-year-old who turned to his local Spirit store a week before the holiday. Besides, Mr Gopal enjoys shopping in person. In the store, he inspects a Harley Quinn jacket and deems it to be of “decent-quality pleather” (imitation leather). 
A temporary storefront gives a pop-up direct access to consumers without saddling it with the costs of a full-time bricks-and-mortar store. And although many businesses might benefit from that connection to shoppers, Spirit depends on it. A Halloween costume is an opportunity to amuse, seduce, terrify or impress. Unlike on other holidays, there’s little pressure to cook or play host. For many, it’s a chance to be a child again.",2
1735,"THE LITANY of foreign leaders Angela Merkel has outlasted is impressive. Since she took office in 2005, America and France have been through four presidents each, Britain has seen five prime ministers and Italy no fewer than eight. But at home an entire generation has grown up with no memory of another leader. In September 2.8m of these Merkelkinder, making up nearly 5% of the electorate, will be eligible to vote for the first time in a federal election. The Economist met a few at the Sophienschule, a Gymnasium (grammar school) in Hanover. All are near or have just finished their final year of schooling.
For some, the experience of covid-19 was a harsh reminder of political reality in a country where the over-60s make up well over a third of eligible voters. “The pandemic showed how unimportant younger voters really are,” says Marie Sophie Scholz. “Apart from our teachers, no one cared.” All the students have harrowing accounts of failed technology, disrupted home lives, lost motivation and loneliness. Some say their pandemic experiences will influence their vote.

Climate concern looms large. Many students have participated in Fridays for Future climate marches. “The average voter is in their 50s, so for us it’s not enough to vote,” says Julian Köppen. “But we can demonstrate.” Marie is infuriated by condescending politicians who dismiss such actions as excuses for truancy: “If they don’t act now, politics will become a very dark place.” Hannah Sprengel grumbles: “They see what we do, but don’t act.”
Julian is excited by a court ruling that partly struck down the climate law for not taking sufficiently into account the rights of future generations. This approach to sustainability, he reckons, must extend beyond climate to areas like the digitalisation of schools. Max Brinkmann wants more focus on inequality and pensions—and thinks change comes from collective movements (he has joined the SPD). For Julian, a big issue is “security”, by which he means “avoiding international conflicts and not provoking other leaders.”
Mrs Merkel was good at that, he reckons. All students appreciate the chancellor’s calm, rational approach to politics, in contrast to what Max fears has become an “emotional and populist” campaign. “We will miss her,” he says, while conceding that the chancellor “pushed away problems” that seemed too hard to solve. There is some scepticism about assuming Mrs Merkel’s departure will mean rupture. “We don’t have to be nervous,” says Hannah. “No one person will make or break a system.” Still, adds Marie, life after Merkel is “looking into the unknown”.

1736,"FLANKED BY THE leaders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, hailed the opening of the Svilaj bridge, linking the two countries. It was part of her tour of the western Balkan region, a term used by the EU to define the Balkan countries that have not yet joined the club and which have sat waiting on the doorstep since being promised eventual membership back in 2003. The happy integration between the EU and its Balkan neighbours was cast as nothing less than inevitable. “All the western Balkans belong in the European Union,” said Mrs von der Leyen. “It’s in our common interest, but I also believe it’s our destiny.”
Kind words collided with reality a week later. At a summit in Slovenia on October 6th of all 27 EU leaders and their six counterparts from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, the prospect of new countries joining the EU any time soon was absent. Instead, the western Balkan countries emerged with a pledge to cut roaming fees when their citizens visit the EU. An attempt by Slovenia to guarantee their membership by the end of the decade was dismissed as an outrageous publicity stunt. Literal bridge building was not accompanied by the metaphorical kind.

Enlargement of the EU is, bluntly, dead. Across the western Balkans, governments are hurt. North Macedonia may have dutifully jumped through every hoop required to begin accession talks, including changing its name to settle a dispute with Greece. Yet an arcane row about the origins of the Macedonian language led to Bulgaria vetoing the start of negotiations. Albania, whose application is linked to North Macedonia’s in a futile attempt to stop such political gamesmanship, is also stuck. Its prime minister compared its relationship with the EU to a failing marriage. Normally, there is at least a wedding first. The EU wants to be a global force, but it is in danger of losing control of its own backyard.
A realistic prospect of joining the EU is the bloc’s main tool for dealing with its neighbours. Yet at the moment, all sides know it is a fantasy. Countries such as France are deeply sceptical, preferring a deeper EU to a wider one. Diplomats from other cautious countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands insist their governments are fine with the idea of enlargement, as long as stringent criteria are met. Domestic politicians are, however, not always so nuanced. There is no chance of new countries joining the EU, even while the club’s leadership says otherwise.
This is a problem. If incentives for good behaviour disappear, so do disincentives for bad behaviour. Tantrums in the western Balkans are now common, in the knowledge there is little to be lost. Why bother taking on vested interests or reforming the judicial system for naught? Those with little to lose have least to fear. Hence a row over number plates between Serbia and Kosovo led to special forces being deployed at the border. In the western Balkans, damned foolish things happen increasingly often.
Sceptics insist that the club cannot digest new members. Former poster-children of EU enlargement, such as Poland, have become problem children. An EU without Poland or Hungary would spend less time worrying about nobbled judges or dodgy use of funds within the club. It is easy to find diplomats who think enlargement was a mistake. But this counterfactual is one that leaves the EU with an even more troublesome frontier. If the EU’s eastern members had remained outside the club, they might have followed the trajectories of other countries beyond the EU bubble, such as Ukraine. Exclusion is no happy solution.
A sense of perspective comes from across the Atlantic. American diplomats remind their more sceptical European counterparts that life would be much easier with the western Balkans firmly inside the European tent, rather than outside getting wet, with other countries offering shelter. Montenegro has already got itself into trouble with a $1bn loan from China. Serbia has become a canny diplomat, accepting vaccines from everywhere and then distributing them to neighbours. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, sees Bosnia as a font of Islamist instability. In short, it is not a region that the EU can afford to lose.
Instead, a dangerous complacency lurks among EU governments. The EU has dished out vaccines. It accounts for almost 70% of trade in the region. It invests about €3bn ($3.5bn) a year, which is a fair sum for a poor region of 20m people. Whatever Russia and China can offer, the EU can more than match, runs the logic. Threats of a geopolitical switch are brushed off by EU officials as diplomatic bravado by their Balkan peers.
Size does matter
Attention thus drifts elsewhere. Leaders would rather focus on the other side of the world, instead of the EU’s chaotic courtyard. On the eve of the Slovenian summit, leaders discussed the club’s strategy in the Pacific, which is a far sexier topic for those who dream of European might. The idea of spending hours discussing Kosovan number plates or the etymology of Macedonian words makes the eyes of European leaders roll into the back of their heads. In the Pacific leaders see history being made. In the Balkans they see history being repeated—to the point of tedium.
Yet it is the western Balkans that is the more pressing test of the EU’s foreign-policy capability, rather than seemingly larger and more global topics. A coherent common policy on North Macedonia, Albania and their neighbours should be simple, compared with more difficult choices that lie ahead for the EU. At the moment, the EU’s China policy designates the country as partner, competitor and rival. Eventually it will have to pick, deciding what is in its collective interest. So the club may be better advised to begin with what should be the easier choices. If the EU wants to be a global power, it needs to become a local one first. A revived enlargement policy is the place to start. ■",2
1737,"AT FIRST GLANCE, a murder in Istanbul, an abduction in Dubai and a deportation from Austria may seem to be unrelated. But they are all part of a disturbing pattern of behaviour by authoritarian regimes, which are using violence, intimidation and technology to silence dissent abroad. A report published on February 4th by Freedom House, a think-tank, argues that “transnational repression” has become more common. It found that 31 states had physically attacked their citizens living in other countries since 2014, with China, Russia and Rwanda among the worst offenders. China alone is responsible for 214 of the 608 direct attacks recorded. Millions more have been intimidated by harassment, digital surveillance and smear campaigns.
Regimes differ in the way they choose their targets. China goes after a wide variety of victims: religious and ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs, political dissidents, human-rights activists, journalists and former princelings. Russia targets outspoken politicians and former insiders who might spill President Vladimir Putin’s secrets. The Kremlin does not usually harass ordinary Russians abroad. However, the regime in Chechnya, a violent Russian republic, does. Chechens who have fled to western Europe are routinely spied on, threatened and occasionally killed. Iran and Saudi Arabia target outspoken exiles. Turkey hunts for Gulenists, members of an Islamic group whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for an attempted coup in 2016.

Physical attacks, such as murders, assaults, detentions and illegal deportations, are the most direct method of crushing enemies abroad. Freedom House believes there have been many more cases than it has managed to count. Blatant assassinations, such as the dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and a columnist for the Washington Post, in his country’s consulate in Istanbul, are quite rare. Illegal deportations and forced renditions, favourite tactics of Iran and Turkey, are more discreet. Dissenters can be hauled back home, tortured and sometimes executed away from the gaze of disapproving foreigners.
Grabbing people on foreign soil can be hard to do alone, so many countries turn for help to friendly foreign powers or even to formal international agreements. The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a security pact involving China, India, Russia and five Asian “stans”, has a shared “blacklist” of dissidents. Saudi Arabia uses the Gulf Co-operation Council to keep tabs on unreliable exiles.
Democracies can be unwitting accomplices. In March 2020 Austria complied with a request to deport Hizbullo Shovalizoda, an activist, back to Tajikistan. Austria’s Supreme Court later invalidated his extradition, but he is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for extremism. Rogue regimes have long manipulated the “red notices” of Interpol, an international policing organisation, to snare their opponents abroad (Russia has issued more than 40% of all such requests for arrest pending extradition now in circulation). And America’s “war on terror” provided regimes with both a model for rendition and a criminal label for those they want to abuse: 58% of the victims identified by Freedom House had been accused of terrorism.
Governments can also make exiles’ lives difficult in more subtle ways. Common tactics include withholding travel documents, denying consular services and threatening relatives back home. For example, in its attempt to shut down the website of a group of Ahmadis, a religious minority, in America, Pakistan has reminded the exiles that Ahmadis back home can be charged with blasphemy for referring to themselves as Muslims. Since many have relatives in Pakistan, where blasphemy is punishable by death, this is a potent threat.
Technology is making it easier for states to oppress at a distance. The internet and social-media networks which at first connected and empowered dissidents can now trap them, explains Marcus Michaelsen, a researcher who studies authoritarian politics. The Arab Spring a decade ago was a turning point. From thousands of kilometres away, states are now able to track the movements of anyone with a smartphone or a laptop, deploying surveillance software and malware to monitor and harass them. Some even have “backdoor access” to social-media platforms. Saudi Arabia bribed a Saudi programmer at Twitter to provide the whereabouts of troublesome tweeters. China is believed to exercise control over WeChat, a lifeline for Chinese abroad. Such technologies make it easier not only to find out where people are, but then to threaten them, or worse.
Technology also makes repressive regimes more aware of far-flung dissidents’ grumbling. Once they had no idea what the diaspora said about the tyrant back home. Now they can monitor social media and hear every unencrypted and possibly seditious word. This makes the exiles seem more of a threat, so repressive regimes feel more impelled to go after them.
The technology and tactics of extraterritorial repression are, for their perpetrators, helpfully inexpensive. “More and more states are realising that this is easy to do and fairly cheap,” says Gerasimos Tsourapas, of the University of Birmingham. Rwanda, a small, fairly poor African country, is a striking example. Determined to silence those who challenge its self-image as an African “development darling”—and to crack down on those who question its version of the country’s bloody history—the government extends its repressive reach far beyond its borders. Last year Paul Rusesabagina, a former hotelier whose heroism saving Tutsis during the genocide was portrayed in the film “Hotel Rwanda”, was kidnapped in Dubai and brought home. He has since been charged with terrorism; many suspect his real crime is to be an outspoken opponent of Rwanda’s autocratic president, Paul Kagame. Like China, Rwanda seeks to control its people abroad through spyware, an army of social-media trolls, and a coercive network of embassies and expatriate organisations. Senior regime insiders who defect have the most to fear. A former intelligence chief, for example, was strangled in a hotel room in South Africa. But Freedom House says that “all Rwandans are at risk of transnational repression.”
One reason why rogue states get away with harassing exiles is that democracies often look the other way. Sometimes, argues Mr Tsourapas, by acceding to extradition requests and Interpol red notices, and by broadening the definition of terrorism, they have even been complicit.
Extraterritorial repression is not new—Leon Trotsky was in Mexico City, more than 10,000km from Moscow, when Stalin had him murdered with an ice pick. What is new is the ease with which dissidents can be snooped on from afar. This, coupled with the global rise of authoritarian regimes and the disinclination of the previous American administration to advocate human rights, has allowed ever more despots to spread fear globally. As Freedom House argues, stopping them will require the re-assertion of international norms and the punishment of the worst offenders.",2
1738,"THE JANICKI OMNI PROCESSOR, a $2m machine paid for by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, turns human waste into water and electricity. In poor cities such as Dakar in Senegal, where it has been piloted, the hope is that people will send sewage to sanitation plants to be processed, rather than chucking it into the streets.
The Omni Processor exemplifies the Gates Foundation’s approach to philanthropy. Mr Gates likes to apply business principles to doing good, which means focusing on innovative, often technological, solutions with quantifiable results. The processor’s inputs and outputs can be counted. The first version, which arrived in Senegal in 2015, was not designed to deal with sewage filled with sand and rocks as it is in Dakar. It was made of materials that corroded quickly in the city’s sea air. These glitches have been fixed in the “OP 2.0”, which arrived in Dakar this year.

Mr Gates has championed the foundation’s data-driven style of philanthropy. But his ex-wife, now known as Melinda French Gates, is thought to have tempered his relentless focus on efficiency, arguing that number-crunching methods cannot resolve the complex causes of poverty on their own. That difference in emphasis, in turn, raises questions about whether the couple’s divorce, announced this year, will set the world’s most powerful charitable foundation on a novel course.

The foundation’s influence is immense. Its $50bn endowment comes from contributions from Mr Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, Ms French Gates and Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor and friend. In 2019 it gave out $4.1bn, according to the OECD, a club of rich countries, more than 11 times as much as the next-largest private American development foundation. If it were a government, it would be the 12th-biggest disburser of foreign aid, between Italy and Switzerland (see chart 1).
The Gates foundation is the second-biggest donor to the World Health Organisation, behind only the American government. It is a founding member of Gavi, a public-private partnership that provides vaccination programmes in poor countries. It has committed more than $1.8bn to fighting covid-19.
It is not the first to embrace a businesslike approach to charitable giving. In 1889 Andrew Carnegie, a steel magnate, wrote in “The Gospel of Wealth”: “One of the serious obstacles to the improvement of our race is indiscriminate charity.” He cautioned against giving people money without scrutinising how they spent it. He and other industrialists such as Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller set up large foundations with big boards to give away their money, mostly late in life.
In recent decades the centre of gravity for American philanthropy has shifted from the east coast to the west. Rich tech founders are giving away their wealth while young and taking a keen interest in how it is spent. Many take their cues from the Gates Foundation in terms of which causes to support and how to do so, says Nick Tedesco, a former Gates employee who is now head of the National Centre for Family Philanthropy in Washington, DC. “The influence of the Gates Foundation”, he says, “is outsized.”
Established in 2000, the foundation employs 1,750 people, mostly in Seattle. Mr Gates, who stepped down from his day-to-day role at Microsoft in 2008, takes a hands-on approach to its work. He and Ms French Gates pick causes on which they believe they can have the most impact, from improving education in America to eradicating diseases such as polio and malaria. They hire academics, former management consultants and mandarins to dish out grants, often referred to as “investments”. The return on grants is measured precisely. A malaria project might be judged on bed-nets distributed; one on education might track attendance rates or test scores. Unsuccessful ventures are dropped.
Not all rich benefactors operate in this way. Some simply give vast sums of money to charities they like, leaving them to spend it as they wish. MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, has announced over $8bn in donations since July 2020 in an approach she calls “seeding by ceding”. She has hired Bridgespan Group, a consultancy, to help her pick grantees. Her gifts come without prescriptions or demands for reports on progress.
The Gates Foundation promotes data-driven, tech-based fixes for discrete problems. Mr Gates’s first charitable effort was to buy computers for libraries in poor parts of America and connect them to the internet. His work in health initially focused on technological solutions, like vaccines, for particular infectious diseases.
Philanthropic Outlook
In other areas, however, that hyper-efficient, outcomes-oriented approach gets you only so far. Counting vaccines is easy; putting a number on a woman’s freedom is not. Mr Gates and Ms French Gates expected global health to be the trickiest part of their portfolio, says Patrick Methvin, who works on education in America for the Gates Foundation. But they found that education projects were more complicated, in part because evaluating what children have learnt—and what they should learn—is far from straightforward. “Education is fundamentally a social-values-based enterprise,” Mr Methvin says.
As Adam Moe Fejerskov, author of “The Gates Foundation’s Rise to Power”, puts it: “Quantification is really about reducing the messiness of the world to formulae and numbers.” The trickiest problems cannot be solved by technology and numbers alone. When the first Omni Processor arrived in Dakar, almost a third of the city’s 3m inhabitants did not live in homes connected to sewers. Public understanding of sanitation is limited. Shortly after the machine appeared, rumours that water extracted from sewage was being added to the city’s drinking water caused uproar. Speak Up Africa, a Gates-funded policy-and-advocacy group, was called on to launch a public-information campaign.
The point of evaluating projects is to steer money away from those that do not work. The foundation says that it does so slowly, winding programmes down gradually. But this trial-and-error method can cause problems.
Early on, the foundation backed the small schools movement in America which suggested that students learn better in small groups getting more individual attention. But running extra-curricular activities and programmes for pupils who needed help with English or special needs was difficult with a smaller student body. With fewer teachers, small schools had to limit their curriculums. The foundation honoured existing grants but channelled new funds into other education reforms. Schools were left struggling for cash and children faced unnecessary upheaval. “We fell short,” Mr Gates wrote in 2009.
For grantees, the level of monitoring and evaluation marks a big difference between the Gates Foundation and other donors. Programme officers oversee their work. That can be helpful. At Speak Up Africa, which has been awarded some $33m in multiple grants since 2015, the team says its monthly virtual meetings with Gates staff in Seattle offer a chance to discuss new ideas and meet international experts.
But the administrative burden can be overwhelming for small groups unused to working with a demanding, global foundation. Askaan Santé, a non-profit organisation in Dakar focused on public health with a staff of 13, received $900,000 in funding after its founder, Fatou Fall Ndoye, met a Gates staffer at a conference. The foundation helped her craft her proposal. But the application took eight months. “It’s a long process,” Ms Ndoye says.

This explains in part why the foundation tends to fund organisations based in the rich world rather than those in developing countries where the money is needed most. An analysis of the foundation’s grants database by The Economist and David McCoy, a professor of global public health at Queen Mary University of London, suggests that grantees with headquarters in Africa and Asia have received just 5.3% and 5.6% of its grants respectively since 1999, though their share has risen (see chart 2).
There are many reasons for this asymmetry. Grantees based in America or Europe often have branches in poorer countries and pass funding on to sub-grantees elsewhere. Fewer people are doing cutting-edge research in sub-Saharan Africa. But it is also difficult for a small organisation in the poor world to get the attention of a Gates staffer. And the paperwork can be intimidating. Those that manage to win Gates funding often know someone at the foundation or have worked at an organisation backed by the foundation and so understand the process. Ms Ndoye had both.
Initially the thought was that the foundation would use its resources for innovation to come up with “breakthroughs”, and leave it to others to ensure they reached the right people, says Mark Suzman, its chief executive. “The wake-up call which hits a lot of people who come into philanthropy is that that doesn’t necessarily work.”
Instead the foundation is now focusing on making sure that its innovations work in the real world. This involves messy social changes that are difficult to track. It has invested $4bn in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, including vaccines. But in Nigeria, the only African country where the disease remained endemic, it has also mapped villages in the conflict-ridden north which were missed in immunisation campaigns. The continent was declared free of wild polio last year.
In family planning the foundation is not simply distributing cheap contraceptives. Women in a low-income country, like India, might not feel comfortable going to a clinic to get condoms or a pill. The Gates-backed Centre for Social and Behaviour Change at Ashoka University near New Delhi tries to understand these social dynamics. It is supporting groups that help women build their confidence in such matters. Confidence is hard to quantify.
The unmeasurable side to philanthropy has drawn on the temperament and insights of Ms French Gates. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, a British medical journal, says she takes a “more holistic approach” to development, encompassing women’s rights and the capacity of health systems. “She humanised the foundation in a remarkable way,” he continues. Chris Eide, who founded Teachers United, an American advocacy group that received a Gates grant in 2011, describes two separate meetings with the pair. Ms French Gates, he says, asked him to bring a group of teachers and asked “open and earnest questions” about their work. Mr Gates met him one-on-one and grilled him on education policy. “The way he took notes from our conversation, it was almost like he was building a machine,” says Mr Eide.
The question now is whether Ms French Gates’s influence will outlast the pair’s divorce. If in two years they no longer want to work together, she will resign as a trustee and receive a payout from him to continue her philanthropic work elsewhere. That would require the foundation to find a new way to get the most out of Mr Gates’s data-driven method. ■",2
1739,"Schoolies has well and truly kicked off on the Gold Coast as thousands of teenagers flock to the city for a week of partying.
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
With a kiss and a hug goodbye to mum, many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning.
Others had already gone to the local supermarket to stock up on food and drinks for the week ahead.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",-2

1741,"Oct 28 (Reuters) - An estimated 30 million to 50 million doses of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) COVID-19 vaccine made early this year sits idle in Emergent BioSolutions Inc's (EBS.N) plant in Baltimore awaiting a green light from U.S. regulators to ship, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Emergent, a contract drug manufacturer, is waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve release of those doses. The agency must still inspect and authorize the plant before Emergent can ship newly manufactured drug substance, one of the sources said.
The exact number of doses sitting idle cannot be determined, the source said, because Emergent only makes raw vaccine substance and does not fill vials with finished product.
Emergent shares opened nearly 1% higher following the Reuters report.
The FDA in April halted operations at Emergent's production facility after J&J's vaccine was found to be contaminated with material from AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) COVID-19 shots, which were also being manufactured there at the time.
The contamination ruined about 15 million J&J doses and set back its U.S. vaccine rollout by weeks.  read more 
Material manufactured for the J&J vaccine at the Baltimore plant prior to the April shutdown and awaiting FDA approval could be enough to produce as many as 50 million shots, the two  sources said. They asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.
Of the 100 million doses worth of vaccine material Emergent described in an April Congressional hearing as being sidelined, the FDA has so far cleared nine batches of J&J's vaccine and three batches of AstraZeneca's. It has not disclosed how many doses were in those batches.
Emergent in late July said it would resume production of J&J's vaccine at the plant following additional FDA reviews, but has not provided updates on production or timing of potential shipments. L1N2P535Q
Emergent has begun making new vaccine substance, but the FDA has yet to provide guidance on when it plans to inspect the  Baltimore facility, one of the sources said.
The FDA said in a statement that it conducted a limited inspection of Emergent's facility in July to confirm it had conducted corrective actions following the April production pause. A previous inspection had turned up a raft of sanitary, safety and bad manufacturing practice issues at the plant.  read more 
The agency said it has not yet authorized the facility to ship doses and continues to review batches made prior to the production halt. It has based its batch approvals on reviews of facility records and quality testing conducted by the manufacturer.
The FDA typically waits for a drug manufacturing facility to produce multiple batches of its product before conducting an inspection, according to a former FDA official who asked not to be named because she was not authorized to speak with the media.
Following the Emergent plant shutdown, J&J lowered its production target for 2021 to between 500 million and 600 million doses from around 1 billion. It expects to be able to make 1 billion doses annually starting next year.  read more 
J&J has not specified whether it needs Emergent to restart production to hit its 2022 target. It has another manufacturing facility in Leiden, Netherlands, and production agreements with other contract manufacturers, including Catalent Inc (CTLT.N) and India's Biological E.
The United States contracted with J&J for 100 million shots in 2020.
Last week, the FDA authorized J&J's vaccine as a booster for people who are already vaccinated but desire additional protection against COVID-19, including anyone over age 18 who originally received the company's single-dose shot.
Use of J&J's vaccine fell sharply in the United States after it was linked to a rare but potentially lethal blood clotting disorder.",3
1742," (CNN)Primary school students in China experienced more depressive symptoms and made more suicide attempts after schools closed for the pandemic, a new study found.When Covid-19 hit China in January, the Ministry of Education postponed the start of spring semester to late April. That closure separated children from their friends and their broader community network, and seems to have had an impact on their mental well-being.The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, compared reports of mental health problems in November -- before the pandemic started -- to mid-May, two weeks into the new spring semester when schools had re-opened.Researchers from Anhui Medical University got results back from surveys for 1,241 students who were in grades 4 through 8, and in junior high. The kids lived in Chizhou, Anhui Province, an area that did not have a large number of Covid-19 cases.Nearly 25% of the students reported depressive symptoms in May, when only about 19% did in November. Suicide attempts more than doubled -- at 6.4% in May compared to the 3% who made suicide attempts in November. There were no similar increases seen in reports of children who reported feeling an increase anxiety.Researchers hope school leaders will use this research to prepare the necessary mental health services to help children as they return to school following the lockdowns.This study is consistent with others that have found that enforced social isolation can cause mental health challenges for children.Benefits of in-person school outweigh virus risksAs states grappled with how to safely reopen schools earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics led a push for students to be physically present in classrooms rather than continue in remote learning for the sake of their well-being.The group, which represents and guides pediatricians across the country, updated its back-to-school recommendations in June to say evidence shows the academic, mental and physical benefits of in-person learning outweigh the risks from the coronavirus.""The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school,"" the group said on its website.""""The importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020. Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation,"" the group said.What it looked like when schools reopenedThis overhaul of the traditional school day become reality in August, as schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Indiana opened their doors for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic abruptly shuttered classrooms across the United States -- all while the virus remained largely uncontrolled.More students and teachers tested positive for Covid-19, some schools were forced to suddenly change plans, while others opted to delay the start of the school year giving educators more time to prepare for in-person classes.""What we do know is children have a harder time social distancing. And we can't put a whole bunch of them in a classroom with a teacher right now,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in an August briefing announcing a delay.""Other states that have tried to open this new school year are now having to close. We don't want to start and stop. That may be more difficult on our children,"" he said.Now, many have embraced virtual learning, which has posed its own set of challenges.Schools across the country have reported system outages, cyberattacks and other issues that prompted some districts to postpone the first day of class.If you're experiencing a suicidal crisis, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or text the Crisis Text line by texting HOME to 741741 to get help.",0
1743,"ECONOMY PASSENGERS taking one of the few international flights still running have had an unusually pleasant experience of late. Exasperated cabin crew battling to close overhead lockers full to bursting with wheelie-bags, duty-free booze and laptop cases have been replaced by masked attendants presiding over planes two-thirds full at best and often with only a handful of passengers. Some report sleeping across empty rows of seats. The collapse of passenger numbers and revenues will damage the industry. Yet previous disruptions have shaken up the airlines to the benefit of the flying public. It could happen again.
The advantages of the previous big interruption to air travel, the second world war, are debatable. The experience of servicemen crammed into uncomfortably spartan transport aircraft, argues Eric Zuelow in his book, “A History of Modern Tourism”, created a generation without pre-war expectations of air travel as glamorous and luxurious. When those same aircraft were converted for civilian use, travellers accepted being packed in like sardines. The cattle-truck economics worked in passengers’ favour when deregulation brought competition to a previously highly regulated and often state-controlled industry. Air fares tumbled everywhere. Between 1995 and 2014 they fell by half in real terms, according to IATA, a club of the world’s airlines.

World wars aside, past crises have passed speedily. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the financial crisis of 2009 were “nasty shocks”, says Brian Pearce, chief economist of IATA, but “small bumps in the road” compared with covid-19. At its height in April 2020 flying was down by 94% over a year earlier, measured by total revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs). Current estimates are that RPKs in 2020 will be down by 66% on 2019, when (including domestic flights) 4.5bn passengers took to the skies. Only 1.8bn people buckled up last year. By the end of it, some 30% of the global fleet was still grounded, according to Cirium, an aviation-data firm. And the sense of optimism that had slowly grown took a fresh hit early in 2021 as more transmissible and dangerous variants of the virus emerged, leading to renewed border closures and capacity cuts.

The plunge comes after years of bumper growth. In each 15-year period since 1988 RPKS doubled. They were expected to do so again between 2018 and 2033, according to Airbus, the European half of the duopoly that builds the world’s biggest passenger jets. Boeing, its American rival, notes an acceleration over the past decade, when growth averaged 6.5% per year, above the long-term average of 5%. Darren Hulst of Boeing is confident of an eventual return to a growth trend of 5% a year, even if over the decade from 2019 the number may be closer to 3.7%. In the meantime it will be a rough ride for airlines. Only 2.8bn passengers are expected to take to the air this year.

Signs of recovery are scant. Domestic flying in China and Russia has largely recovered, but in Australia it is still down by 86% and in America, the world’s biggest domestic market, it has fallen by 60%. International routes are suffering the most. Despite huge capacity cuts (only a quarter of the international flights scheduled a year earlier were still running in January), load factors are still low. Planes are often taking off a third full at most.
The opportunity for travellers to stretch out comes at a heavy cost. Full service will not resume for a long while. Mr Pearce says the gradual deployment of vaccines merely makes him more confident about his baseline forecast of a return to 2019 levels by 2024. Not all air travel will recover at the same pace. Domestic flying will continue its rebound, followed by regional international traffic. The last part of the industry to refill its seats will be long-haul flying. This has a disproportionate impact on legacy airlines that still rely most on long-haul international routes.
All airlines face a bleak period. Rather than increase by 4% on 2019 levels to $872bn, air-transport revenues in 2020 have plummeted to $340bn, reckons IATA. In a good year the industry makes an operating profit of $50bn. Losses for 2020 are forecast at $118bn and, even if the second half of this year sees a recovery, they will still be around $38bn in 2021.
Airlines have responded by slashing costs, getting rid of staff and cutting fleets, yet carriers continue to burn cash at a rate of $5bn-6bn a month. Looking at the cash and liquid assets of carriers in mid-2020, the median airline had enough funding to last just eight-and-a-half months (or half way through this month), according to IATA. Some big names have succumbed. Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers, sought bankruptcy protection in November 2020. Dozens of smaller airlines including FlyBe, a British low-cost carrier, Virgin Australia and Avianca, based in Latin America, have gone to the wall.
Two types of carrier have the best chance of survival. Those with sound business models and strong balance-sheets, such as Ryanair in Europe, Southwest in America and AirAsia, are all low-cost carriers ready for a rebound. And legacy carriers, mostly propped up by governments, will keep their grip on long-haul flying when it returns.
Subsidies, subsidies
Support for airlines has been prodigious. Governments are used to helping airlines for reasons of national pride and to maintain international connections. Many countries in the Middle East, India and Africa cling to ownership of loss-making national carriers. Others are just returning to the orbit of governments. Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, has promised to “do what is necessary to guarantee the survival of Air France”. Germany’s Lufthansa has had a bumper aid package. America’s airlines, never shy to extend an upturned palm, benefited handsomely from its CARES stimulus act, signed into law in March 2020, which set aside $25bn in grants for airlines and the same in loans and guarantees.
The result will be an industry wallowing in debt and beholden once again to the state. Aviation Strategy, a consultancy, puts the total in 2020 of government support plus loans from banks, other investors and aircraft-leasing companies at $600bn, an increase of $170bn since the end of 2019. Keith McMullen, a partner at the consultancy, points out that most government aid has come in the form of loans, the terms of which incentivise rapid repayment. But the fragile state of the industry will make that tricky. European governments may then be obliged to swap debt for equity.
A return to the days before deregulation and the rise of low-cost carriers, when governments controlled national flag-carriers, set (high) fares and decided routes based on national goals rather than demand, is the fear of Andrew Charlton of Aviation Advocacy, another consultancy. America’s big carriers, Asian giants such as Singapore Airlines, and Lufthansa and Air France-KLM may be subject to government meddling. The terms of bail-outs for Air France stipulate that it must no longer compete with high-speed rail on some routes; Lufthansa’s decide what planes it may purchase.
That could give the low-cost carriers an advantage. Michael O’Leary, boss of Ryanair, admits to mixed feelings about state aid. Although it is “hugely distorting”, it is also likely to “sustain high-cost employment”, he says. And high-cost competitors are what he and his kind thrive on. Legacy airlines, already having to compete harder on short-haul routes and often weighed down by heavy pension-fund deficits, could struggle to adapt to an uncertain future that will require flexibility and nimbleness as well as lower costs.
Moreover, legacy carriers rely especially heavily on lucrative business travellers, a sector that may never recover fully, to subsidise seats at the back of the plane. If business customers and feeder routes dwindle, the complex web of domestic and international flights becomes harder to sustain, reducing connections and forcing up long-haul prices.
Not all will suffer. British Airways has slashed costs and raised capital and is fast-tracking its previous restructuring effort to compete with low-cost rivals. Other models look riskier. The Gulf carriers—Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways—that have grown swiftly in recent years may struggle. They lack a large domestic market to fall back on, unlike their Chinese competitors, and passengers may prefer not to mix with people from all over the world as they change planes at vast airports in the Gulf. If their model falters, the sky will be clearer for China’s state-controlled behemoths, which are already eating away at long-haul routes.
Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Wizz Air, based in eastern Europe, sniff opportunities. Mr O’Leary has promised to slash fares to rekindle his business. His ability to compete with airlines under the heavy hand of the state will be helped by several factors. The availability of bargains from embattled planemakers and leasing companies will help carriers in decent health or with new business models. Ryanair confirmed an order for another 75 Boeing 737MAXS in December, taking its total to 210. The plane’s grounding after two fatal crashes had led to cancelled orders, so a big vote of confidence from Ryanair was surely worth a hefty discount. Wizz Air, which relies on more robust parts of the market such as younger flyers and east Europeans going west for work and returning to visit family, also has big growth plans. Southwest, America’s biggest low-cost carrier, is in expansion mode as the country’s legacy carriers retreat. Tony Fernandes, boss of Air Asia, based in Malaysia, is “quietly optimistic” about 2021, and hopes to start three new airlines in the region.
A surplus of pilots where there was a dearth and unemployed cabin crew looking for work could also boost low-cost carriers. Once-scarce landing slots at busy airports may become more available. And, if prices rise for long-haul seats, this may rekindle interest in low-cost long-haul services, which have a patchy history. The demise of Norwegian was largely down to its inability to make profits on long-haul routes. The business model of short-haul carriers does not easily translate to long-haul flights, where fuel is a bigger share of costs and schedules are compromised by time differences and airport curfews that do not affect short-haul travel. But a new plane, Airbus’s A321XLR, a single-aisle jet with the ability to fly long-haul routes, could change the equation again.
The commercial-aviation business will be smaller for years to come. Yet opportunities abound, especially if legacy carriers fail to adapt. Higher fares and lower costs will attract competitors that threaten the old guard. In 20 years’ time air travel will be back on track and growing again but the old names may no longer be on the tarmac. Just as Pan Am and TWA are distant memories, so a clutch of now familiar airlines may become relics of the past.■",2
1744,"IF YOU LOOK only at the scale of the profits cranked out by American businesses, they seem to be indestructible (see chart). Despite a pandemic and a savage slump in 2020, large listed American firms’ net income for the third quarter of this year is expected to reach over $400bn, at least a third higher than in the same quarter in 2019. Yet as earnings season gets into full swing this week, bosses and investors are watching for signs that three related worries are biting: supply-chain tangles, inflation, and hints that a long era of profitable oligopolies is giving way to something more dynamic and risky. Already big firms such as Snap, Honeywell and Intel have given the jitters to investors. Could there be more to come?

Only a quarter or so of firms in the S index have reported results so far. Those that have done so have pleased investors with better than expected figures. Superficially the picture is of “back to business as usual”. Bad-debt provisions taken by banks in the depths of the panic over the economy, which proved unnecessary, have been unwound.  JPMorgan Chase got a $2bn benefit to its bottom line from this reversal in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs has shelled out $14bn in pay and bonuses so far this year, up by 34% year on year. American Express reported a leap in revenues as small firms and consumers spent on their cards more freely. United Airlines confirmed it was on track to hit its performance targets for 2022.
Yet look again and the three worries loom. Start with supply chains. The number of ships waiting off California’s big ports remains unusually high at about 80, according to Bloomberg. On 22nd October, Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said that supply-chain problems may last “well into next year”. The knock-on effects are feeding through industry. Union Pacific, a railway firm, lowered its forecast for traffic volumes because semiconductor shortages (often in Asia) have hit car production, in turn reducing the number of vehicles and components transported by rail. Honeywell, an industrial firm, cut its full year sales target by 1-2% complaining of a shortage of parts. VF Corp, which makes shoes (including white ones that fans of “Squid Game”, a hit TV show, hanker after) complained of supply-chain problems in Asia. So far the problem is not disastrous but it is inflating costs and forcing firms to adapt.
This supply-chain headache is one element of a second, broader worry, about inflation and its impact on profits. Commodity prices are a source of pressure, with crude oil reaching $86 a barrel this week. Wages are too: although there are still 5m fewer people employed across the economy than before the pandemic hit, average hourly pay rose by 4.6% year on year in September. The immediate effect tends to be felt by low-margin firms that employ a lot of people: Domino’s Pizza has complained of a “very challenging staffing environment” and falling sales.

Elsewhere a mild inflationary mindset is slowly infiltrating boardrooms. Procter  Gamble predicted that commodity and freight inflation would raise its operating costs this financial year by about 4% and that sales would rise by up to 4%, owing to a mixture of price rises, and volume and mix effects.  Honeywell warned there would be a “continued inflationary environment” in 2022. All firms are weighing how much they can raise prices to compensate for higher costs. So are fund managers who are busy running screens for companies that they judge to exhibit the all-important quality of “pricing power”. The shifting psychology of bosses and investors towards expecting more inflation should concern Mr Powell at the Fed. 
The final big issue is whether an economy with shortages that is running hot ultimately forces an end to the managerial consensus of the past decade, which has favoured keeping margins high and being stingy with investment in order to maximise short-run cashflow. Already there are signs that attitudes are shifting in response to shortages and pent-up demand: economy-wide investment, excluding residential investment, rose by 13% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with the preceding year. United Airlines has said it will increase its capacity on international routes by 10%. FreePort McMoRan, a huge miner of copper (used in electric vehicles among a wide array of industrial applications), has said that it is “prepared to make value enhancing investments in our business” in response to red-hot prices. Hertz has announced an order of 100,000 cars from Tesla. And on Wall Street a fund-raising bonanza for speculative start-ups continues, including last week the merger of a special-purpose acquisition company with the social-media ambitions of a certain Donald Trump.
Rising investment is exactly what economists want because it increases capacity today and boosts the economy’s long-run potential. Yet whether investors are prepared to take the plunge remains to be seen. Habituated by years of high margins, they tend to run shy of rising investment and competition. Snap’s share price dropped by over 20% on October 21st as signs that the war over privacy settings on the iPhone between Apple and social-media firms, and the intensifying competition in advertising between a wide array of tech firms, is hurting its results. And Intel, which earlier this year boldly announced plans for a huge rise in investment in order to return to the frontier of the semiconductor industry, alongside TSMC and Samsung, presented Wall Street with the bill in the form of much lower than expected short-term earnings: its shares dropped by 12%. If you run a company or invest in one this is the new calculation: demand is recovering and costs are rising. Can you raise prices? And should you expand capacity? By the end of this earnings season the answer may be clearer.",2
1745,"Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, was shot dead at his private residence. The police said that they killed four suspects during a gun battle and had arrested two others. It was unclear who ordered the assassination, or why. Claude Joseph, the interim prime minister, who was due to be replaced this week, said he would take charge as interim president. The opposition had been seeking Mr Moïse’s removal from office, saying his term had expired. In February the government claimed it had uncovered an attempted coup against him.
American forces left Bagram airfield, near Kabul, which had been their biggest base in Afghanistan. A small number remain in the capital, largely to protect the American embassy. After 20 years America has effectively given up on the war in Afghanistan, which now looks likely to intensify. The emboldened Taliban have been seizing territory. Some of the official Afghan army have surrendered without a fight. Local warlords are raising militias to resist the jihadists.

In Brazil the Supreme Court authorised an investigation into Jair Bolsonaro for failing to comply with his public duty. The case claims that the president overlooked irregularities in a deal on a covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin. A senate inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic is also looking into allegations that one official asked for a $1-per-dose bribe to purchase the AstraZeneca vaccine. Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets, the third mass protest in just over a month to call for Mr Bolsonaro’s impeachment.
Jacob Zuma, a former president of South Africa, was taken into custody for contempt of court. He had refused to appear before a commission investigating the corruption that was rife during his time in office.
At least 50 people were killed by security forces in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) after protests against the rule of King Mswati, Africa’s last absolute monarch. The protests began after the death of a law student, allegedly at the hands of the police. They say he died in a car crash.
Some 140 children were kidnapped from a school in Nigeria, taking to more than 1,000 the number of students and scholars abducted since December.
Iran told the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world’s nuclear watchdog, that it had begun the process of producing enriched uranium metal, which can be used in reactors—or to make bombs. European powers called Iran’s action “a serious violation” of the multinational nuclear accord they signed in 2015. America, which left the pact in 2018, is trying to revive it.
Egypt agreed to a compensation deal with the owners and insurers of the Ever Given, which ran aground and blocked the Suez canal for six days in March, seriously disrupting global trade. The terms were not made public. Egypt, which had demanded $550m, refused to release the vessel until a deal was reached.
Israel’s parliament declined to extend a law that denies citizenship rights to Palestinians who marry Israelis. It was the first test of the new Israeli government, which supported the extension on security grounds.
Lebanon is days away from a “social explosion”, said the country’s caretaker prime minister, Hassan Diab. Mr Diab appealed for help with a long-running economic crisis that has seen the value of the currency plummet and left much of the population short of food, fuel and medicine.
The state legislature in Texas prepared to meet in a special session. Republicans are trying to pass a bill on election procedures that critics say is intended to curb voting by blacks and Hispanics. The Republicans have the wind in their sails. The federal Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, recently limited the scope for challenging state voting laws on racial grounds.
Eric Adams was deemed to have won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York, maintaining a lead over his rivals in a ranked-choice tally. Mr Adams, a black former police captain, ran on a law-and-order ticket; he soaked up votes in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and north Manhattan.
Less than a week after it opened the resort island of Phuket to fully jabbed international visitors,  Thailand recorded its first case of covid-19 in a tourist. Thailand hopes its “sandbox” model, where visitors can avoid quarantine if they stay in Phuket for 14 days, will allow it to reopen more parts of its tourism-dependent economy.
Indonesia’s covid-19 outbreak worsened as daily cases doubled from a fortnight ago. Hospitals are approaching capacity and some have reported running out of oxygen.
Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, confirmed that covid-19 restrictions would end in England on July 19th. The vaccination campaign has gone well, and although cases are surging and hospital admissions rising sharply, the number of deaths remains low. Social distancing will end, as will the mandatory use of face masks, a controversial topic in Britain. The chief medical officer, when asked, named three situations where he would still wear a mask.

1746,"WHEN THE news finally comes it triggers a range of emotions. Most people told when and where they will receive their first shot of covid-19 vaccine speak of their relief, delight, even their elation. One person danced around the room, another “screamed a bit”, yet another felt giddy. “It feels”, says one, “that my life’s about to begin.” But for some, there are other emotions in play: concern, fear, even anger.
Almost as soon as biomedical researchers began working on vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19, people concerned with public health began to worry about “vaccine hesitancy”. It can sound trivial, even foolish, but it regularly costs lives. Hesitancy is a large part of the reason that few young Japanese women get themselves vaccinated against human papillomavirus, and thus are more likely than vaccine-accepting young women elsewhere to contract cervical cancer. Widespread hesitancy during worldwide campaigns against covid-19 could cost many lives, both among the hesitant and among their fellow citizens. Scott Gottlieb, who led America’s drug regulator, the FDA, from 2017 to 2019 (and who is also on the board of Pfizer, a vaccine-maker) argued in a recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that the main challenge to vaccination efforts in America could soon move from supply and logistics to individual reluctance to be vaccinated.

In Britain, a country generally quite keen on vaccination, about 15% of those offered a covid jab so far have refused it. With 13m mostly elderly Britons vaccinated as of February 10th, that suggests almost 2m people who could have been vaccinated have not been. When, eventually, social distancing measures are reduced, those people will remain vulnerable to infection. What is more, that level of refusal, combined with the fact that children are not being vaccinated and that new variants of the virus are less tractable to vaccination, means the country may never see the “herd immunity” that population-wide vaccination programmes tend to aim for—the state in which people neither previously infected nor vaccinated are so few and far between that the virus is hard put to find them. And the level of refusal could grow in months to come; younger people, perhaps because they feel in less danger, seem less keen on the vaccine.

Hesitancy is promoted and spread by a hard core of proselytising “anti-vaxxer” voices whose misinformation and downright lies about microchips, infertility and damage to DNA have spread to the four quarters of the internet. They have been helped by large online misinformation campaigns run by China and Russia seeking to undermine confidence in Western vaccines. But hesitancy is a broader and more complex phenomenon than that. Some are worried, not opposed; some reject specific vaccines while accepting various others; some are adamant, some persuadable, some, in the end, willing to get vaccinated despite their reservations. People interpret vaccines in the light of their own experiences, relationships and trust in authority. Such subtleties make the molecular biology behind the vaccines seem simple in comparison.
There is nothing new about this complex set of fears. To introduce anything other than food into your body or blood is always likely to be an emotionally freighted experience. When Edward Jenner, a British doctor, began vaccinating people with cowpox to defend them against smallpox in the late 1790s there was immediate disquiet. Critics said the idea of vaccination was repulsive and ungodly; cartoonists showed people who had been vaccinated sprouting cow’s heads. But elite medical and political opinion fell in line. Thomas Jefferson was a fan. Napoleon vaccinated his armies, writing that “Jenner...has been my most faithful servant in the European campaigns.” In Sweden vaccination was compulsory in 1803, in Bavaria in 1807; both countries saw smallpox rates plummet.

In 1853 vaccination was made compulsory for all infants in England and Wales with parents who failed to comply liable to a fine or imprisonment. Opposition to this infringement on personal liberty promptly grew, even more so after the law was strengthened in the 1870s.
Victorian anti-vaxxers spread misinformation eerily similar to today’s. In 1878 the National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Reporter told its readers that vaccination could cause diseases including diphtheria, abscesses, bronchitis and convulsions. “On the whole”, it wrote, “it is a greater evil to humanity than smallpox itself!” In echoes of today’s concerns about Big Pharma, the Reporter speculated that compulsory vaccination was a plot by the medical establishment and averred that faithful obedience to the “sacred laws of health” would provide superior protection. It is hard to put a sliver of organic carrot between this sanctimony and the notion that nasty viral pathogens can be warded off by raising children “naturally” and using alternative medicines.
Nevertheless smallpox vaccination became near universal. And then in 1977, 177 years after Benjamin Waterhouse, a Harvard professor and correspondent of Jefferson’s, published his pamphlet “A Prospect of Exterminating the Small-pox”, it became obsolete. The disease was wiped out. No other human disease has yet followed it to oblivion, though polio is close. But many death tolls have been slashed.
Vaccinations have become the most successful public health measure in history. About 85% of one-year-olds around the world now receive all three doses of the combination vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Public support for this is high; nine in ten people worldwide think vaccines are important for children. But there are variations. Support for childhood vaccination is lower in North America, Europe and Russia than in Africa, Asia and South America, and there are pockets where it dips dangerously. What is more, the success of long-running childhood vaccination campaigns does not necessarily translate into acceptance of novel vaccines for adults.
Against complacency
Towards the last quarter of 2020 polls on vaccine hesitancy spurred mounting concern among public health officials. In September a significant number of British people said they were unlikely to get one. A month later, in a STAT-Harris Poll in America, only 58% said they would—down from 69% a month previously. Though Britain bounced back, other countries have seen worrying drops since (see chart 1).

But such polls come with caveats. One is what psychologists describe as the “intention-behaviour gap”; humans are sufficiently complicated that what they say and what they do can be very different things. A second is that polls are snapshots of a process in flux. Vaccine hesitancy is extremely fluid in time and space, subject to all manner of influences. A poll is an instantaneous map of temperatures, when what you need is a moving forecast.
One of the main vaccine-weather forecasters is Heidi Larson, a professor of anthropology, risk and decision science at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She is also the founding director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, which monitors global concerns about vaccines. Looking at her latest survey of sentiment toward covid-19 vaccines in 32 countries Dr Larson sees storms brewing in Lebanon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—two countries in which the political climate is tense.
Hesitancy in the DRC might seem surprising; novel vaccines recently helped quash an outbreak of Ebola there. But Dr Larson says that unlike Ebola, which people have had to live with for almost half a century, covid-19 is new and brings new distrust. Maître Donat, a lawyer in Kolwezi, a mining city in the south of the country, bears out that case. “Here everyone thinks covid is a scam”, he says, “dreamed up by the whites, by Americans.”
Dr Larson worries about this because she has found that, in general, concerns about vaccines that arise in Africa spread much more quickly than in higher-income countries: “It is quite explosive.” Last year a comment by a French doctor about using Africa as a testing ground for vaccines spread like wildfire across Francophone Africa. He apologised, but the damage was done. There are now reports of rising hesitancy, at least partly tied to trust in government, in South Africa and Nigeria, where plans are being laid to start vaccination.
Just as there is variation over time, so there is in space. Even in countries where there is a rush to get vaccinated, hesitancy can crop up in particular communities, particularly in marginalised groups: some groups distrust state authority—sometimes, given the history of medical experimentation, for sound historical reasons; some seek spiritual rather than temporal guidance on how to live their lives.
Naively, one might believe that education would be enough to change this. It is not. Take the reluctance of some American health-care workers to get vaccinated. This is not down to a lack of information or a failure to understand what vaccines offer. It can often reflect a lack of faith in their employers. As in many other parts of the world, nurses, long-term-care staff and others in similar jobs report feeling badly treated over the past year. They may have been put at risk of covid, or fallen ill, or struggled to obtain protective equipment. They will have seen a lot of death. They will mostly have done so on low pay. And they have either not succumbed to the disease or have survived it. This all disinclines them towards accepting the vaccines that their employers now want them to take.
A December survey of 16,000 employees of a health system in Pennsylvania revealed concerns about unknown risks and side effects. At the nadir 45% said they either did not want the vaccine at all or wanted to wait (see chart 2). One-fifth did not trust the rushed regulatory review. Others worried they were not actually at high enough risk for infection or disease. Hard refusals, though, soon began to wane. 

In general, a feeling that the government is cutting corners seems to drive hesitancy up. When Donald Trump appeared to be trying to rush approval along before the election Americans became more hesitant. Concerns have risen in Indonesia and India at the same time as there have been controversies about aspects of government vaccination programmes.
Another factor in hesitancy is peer-group sentiment transmitted through social networks. Parents who choose not to vaccinate children have a much higher percentage of people in their social networks with similar views. The same will be true of people who intend not to get vaccinated against covid-19.
Understanding how the hesitancy weather changes offers ways to modify it. Some are well known to advertisers. People are encouraged by the sight of happy people eagerly lining up to receive vaccines, or by politicians, royalty and celebrities rolling up their sleeves. They may also respond to the notion that something is in scarce supply. Since scares about the H1N1 flu vaccine in 2009 the French have been very dubious about vaccination. But since realising that their country has few doses to offer, their opinions have been changing. To refuse is one thing; to be denied another. Marine Le Pen, a right-wing nationalist who had previously said she would wait and see before getting vaccinated now says she will do so, a decision which is expected to be influential (and which will better position her to attack Emmanuel Macron on the issue in next year’s election campaign).
The bad news about changing the weather in this sort of way is that it can quickly change back again. Vinay Nair, boss of Lightful, a tech firm that works in the charity sector to enhance its use of technology, says that because vaccine sentiment is dynamic, so the response to it has to be too.
It is also important to reach vaccine-hesitant communities directly rather than through the media. In 2017 Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner at the Children’s Minnesota Hospital, told Modern Healthcare, a magazine, about intervening this way among Somali-Americans in Minneapolis after their under-vaccinated community suffered a serious measles outbreak. “We spend a great deal of time meeting imams in the community and ask them to partner with us.” Even with the help of social-media campaigns aimed at younger parents, it is slow, painstaking work. But it is effective.
Storm warning
Unfortunately, help through social media is far from the norm. The Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a not-for-profit group, is tracking 425 anti-vaccine accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube that it says spread covid misinformation; they have 59.2m followers between them, and the number is rising rapidly. The organisation says that while a minority of these anti-vaxxers act on the basis of profoundly held beliefs, about four-fifths have a financial motive as well, or instead. Half are entrepreneurs with businesses that promote alternative or oddball remedies such as homeopathic immunisation or a bleach nebuliser “with a 100% success rate”. The other half are conspiracists who profit from the online-advertising revenue their sites attract and the merchandise they sell.
The work of these groups is a lot easier than that of public-health workers: fear and uncertainty are easier to foster than trust and confidence, and inaction easier to encourage than action. In October last year representatives of the CCDH were present at a private online conference held by influential opponents to vaccination who, it says, saw a historic opportunity to reach larger numbers of supporters, and drive long-term vaccine hesitancy. They outlined three basic tools with which to do so: sow doubt about the seriousness of the threat posed by covid-19; spread concern about the safety of the vaccines; stress the untrustworthiness of experts.
These three basic messages will be adapted with selective reporting—making sure, for example, that Brazilians know that their president has said he will not be vaccinated—half-truths and lies. Ethnic minorities will be told that covid vaccines are unsafe for them, or part of a plot or experiment—something that will resonate in communities that remember stories of this in the past. Young people will be told taradiddles about fertility. The religious groups will hear that vaccines are not halal or contain fetal material. (It is true that the vaccine produced by AstraZeneca is grown in a cell line derived from material taken from a fetus in the 1970s; it is also true that the pope has deemed the use of such cell lines morally acceptable.)
A recent study in Nature using data from 2019 created a network map of 1,300 Facebook pages carrying pro- and anti-vaccine messages and their followers. Anti-vaccine pages were more numerous, faster growing and increasingly connected to pages containing undecided users. If current trends continue, the researchers predicted, anti-vaccine views will dominate online discussion in a decade. A new preprint by many of the same authors reports that the strengthening of online bonds that has been seen during the pandemic has given conspiracy theories greater access to mainstream parenting communities.
On February 8th, in the teeth of ongoing criticism, Facebook said it would remove false claims related to covid vaccines (see article). Many think the move has come too late—and that to shift the balance of power decisively will require further action. Mr Nair believes that tech companies need to amplify positive messages, stories and campaigns
“A mix of factors will challenge our plans to defeat covid-19, from new variants to supply issues. But vaccine hesitancy is a significant threat to population protection against covid-19,” says Dr Larson. And after emotional contagion has taken hold it is difficult to tamp down. As the French experience with the H1N1 vaccine has shown, once widespread a negative impression about a vaccine can be hard to shift.
At the moment, people are leaving vaccination centres happily, and tweeting and posting about their good fortune and success. They proudly display the badges and stickers that show they have received the vaccine. For now, public health is winning. But continued good news cannot be taken for granted; in this struggle, fair weather has to be fought for, not counted on. ■

1747,"IMAGINE A TOY boat that might fit in the palm of your hand. At mid-ship add a squat spool of sewing thread lying on its side. Scale that up about a thousand-fold and the result is the 150-metre-long Nexans Aurora. The thread in question is kilometres of high-voltage power line ready to be deployed from the aft of the ship across the sea floor. Each cable, weighing a hefty 150kg per metre and thick as a tree trunk, is a woven mix of aluminium, steel, lead and insulating material. The single stretch loaded up in a bobbin nearly 30 metres across is as heavy as the Eiffel Tower.
The ways electricity is both consumed (more of it, notably by cars) and produced (also more, increasingly through renewable sources, see chart 1) are changing. Balancing energy supply and demand is never easy, as mayhem in European gas markets has shown. It is all the more complex for electricity, which is trickier to store than not just gas, but also coal, diesel or wood chips. Renewables add more wrinkles: wind blows haphazardly; the sun can be obscured by clouds or night. As a result, most of the power that is produced has to be consumed immediately, and mostly in the place that produces it.

The idea of separating consumption from production in time—using giant batteries or other storage—has received plenty of attention from entrepreneurs, politicians and investors. But it is currently impractical at scale. So the notion of separating the two in space instead is gaining ground. It requires an upgrade in the behind-the-scenes wiring that carries power from where it is made to where it is used. The task can involve plugging an offshore wind farm into the grid. Also needed are connections joining up national networks, often within blocs where most of today’s electricity trade takes place, like the EU.

Either way, cables are required, and boats to lay some of them. The potential is vast. Just 4.3% of power generated in 2018 by members of the OECD, a club of industrialised countries, was exported, up from 2% in the 1970s but a far cry from a fungible commodity like oil.
All this has resulted in surging order-books for cable-makers and -layers like Nexans, the Nexans Aurora’s eponymous French owner. Credit Suisse, a bank, forecasts undersea wiring alone to bring in revenue of around €5.5bn ($6.4bn) in 2022, up from €4.5bn this year. It expects cable firms’ revenues from offshore wind installations to more than treble in size between 2020 and 2035. Investors’ enthusiasm around electric cables has sent share prices of Nexans and the industry’s two other European giants, NKT and Prysmian, up by 48-125% in the past two years (see chart 2). In February Nexans announced that it would soon spin out its non-electric cables business (catering to industry and data centres) to focus on transmission lines.

Satisfying see-sawing electricity demand is complicated but well understood. British grid managers have long known how to turn on power plants just as soap-operas end and tea-craving viewers turn on their kettles. Connecting power grids with different production and consumption patterns is equivalent, matching supply and demand by transferring electricity across distance instead.
Take Denmark. It has installed enough wind turbines that, when it blows, no other source of electric power is required. But it needs a Plan B, given the fickleness of wind. Without batteries it could keep old fossil-fuel plants open, and use them intermittently. A more elegant solution is a cable to Norway, which has ample hydroelectric potential. When the wind blows, both places can use Danish wind power, keeping Norwegian water in reservoirs. On calm days the Norwegian lakes are drained a bit faster to succour Denmark.
Further links from Denmark to the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Britain (planned for 2023) provide yet more options. Add enough links to enough places, and electricity becomes a tradable commodity. For a local grid manager, reducing carbon emissions becomes a case of buying and selling the right contract rather than building a solar or wind farm in the wrong place.
That prospect explains why interconnections are multiplying. Europe is the new frontier of cable-laying. Electrification, notably through renewables, is a key plank of its ambitions to reach “net zero” emissions by 2050. National grids have been compelled by EU rules to integrate into a single network, often backed with public cash. The continent’s scraggy coastline is ideal for wind power—and for deploying electric cables at sea, out of sight of anyone who might object to them.
Shifting power-generation dynamics play a part. Germany, for example, was once a big exporter of power but is becoming an importer as it finishes shutting down its nuclear plants and phases out coal. The green push also means electricity is being generated in all the wrong places. In Italy, power plants were built near where industry was located, mostly in the north of the country. Now the wind blows and sun shines mainly in the less-developed south. “The shift to renewables means we need more rebalancing, more transition,” says Stefano Antonio Donnarumma of Terna, an Italian manager of transmission lines.
As a consequence, the making and deploying of electric cable is one of the rare industrial sectors that European firms dominate. Besides France’s Nexans, Prysmian is Italian and NKT is Danish. They have around 80% market share outside China, where demand is largely met locally. Beyond merely manufacturing woven metal wires (among other products), they lay them as well, commissioning and operating ships like the Nexans Aurora, a €170m craft fitted up the coast from an existing Nexans factory in Halden, Norway.
Advances in undersea cable-laying have helped open up the prospect of new and novel interconnections. Whereas previous generations of ships risked tipping over if they were to send wires much below 1,200 metres, the Nexans Aurora and a flotilla of similar vessels from its rivals can lay the cables at depths of 3,000 metres. (An accompanying robot can dig a trench in shallower waters, the better to protect against stray anchors and fishing nets.) That opens up the Mediterranean. This week the Nexans Aurora was preparing to deploy her first cable, connecting the island of Crete to the Greek mainland.
Longer cables mean fewer legs of 100km or so that need to be stitched together. The viability of much longer interconnectors is being mooted as a result. A 720km Norway-to-Britain link started operating this month. Many are in various stages of planning, for example hooking up Greece and Israel, or Ireland and France. Others are more speculative, such as a 3,800km cable linking the sun-baked solar fields of Morocco with Britain. Another consortium wants to link Australia, Indonesia and Singapore, a 4,200km project.
Christopher Guérin, boss of Nexans, says 72,000km of such cables will be laid in the decade to 2030, seven times the current stock. That comes on top of wiring needed to upgrade antiquated connections on land, many of which are past their sell-by date. A power crisis in Texas earlier this year helped unlock stimulus funds for grid upgrades in America, too.
A more immediate opportunity is hooking up wind farms to onshore power grids. Cable salesmen are cheered by the fact more and more such facilities are being developed far out at sea. The possibility of floating wind farms, which could be farther away still, will add to their order books. The International Energy Agency, a rich-country energy club, estimates 80 gigawatts of offshore wind farms will have to be installed every year by 2030 to meet decarbonisation targets. Each gigawatt of offshore capacity requires around €250m of cable input including the installation, says Max Yates of Credit Suisse. The cable costs roughly as much as the foundations, behind only the turbine itself.
The urgency of this global rewiring effort is almost imperceptible from the deck of the Nexans Aurora. Spools release their wire at a leisurely pace: 10-12km a day is considered tidy work. But the future energy highways are at last becoming a reality. Steady as she goes. ■",2
1748,"READING HIS local newspaper last month, Bruce, a 70-year-old retired executive, could take it no longer. “Almost every article” on Nola.com—website of the Times-Picayune, New Orleans’s paper of record since 1837—had “an element of Wokeism”, he wrote in an email cancelling his subscription. Among those elements, he objected especially to references to climate change, an issue that he considered “had not been empirically established”.
“Case in point: It’s August 23rd and there is no tropical activity presently being monitored in the Atlantic or the Caribbean,” he wrote. “But just a couple of weeks ago Nola.com advised that we should be ready for a higher-than-normal level of tropical activity this season—due to Climate Change.” As Bruce was desperately manning the defences of his home this week against the severe flooding wrought by one of the fiercest tropical storms on record to hit Louisiana, your columnist got in touch to ask whether he had revised his sceptical view.

Not a bit. Louisiana had had bigger hurricanes than Ida, he said. His house on the Bogue Falaya River was flooded in 2016. And though he didn’t claim to understand storms, Bruce (who asked for his surname to be withheld because he feared retribution from the federal flood-insurance agency) felt scientists didn’t either. He did not deny climate change was happening. But he believed it was “on a longer cycle” than that described by scientists and journalists, whom he accused of trying to “divide people”.
It was once hoped that as Americans started to experience global warming’s devastating effects they would become more accepting of climate science. But as Bruce and millions like him illustrate, this is not happening. After four years of warming-related tempests in the south-east and infernos out west, public opinion has hardly budged. Six in ten Americans think global warming is anthropogenic and already manifest, and want drastic cuts in fossil-fuel use. The rest, a group that represents a majority of Republican voters, say the opposite, come fire or high water.
This capacity for motivated reasoning is losing its power to amaze. Every day brings reports of Trump voters denouncing covid-19 vaccines on their covid-19 deathbeds. By comparison, the complacency the same voters show towards the impacts of warming is almost rational. Bruce believes in hurricanes. He just doesn’t believe climate change is making them more frequent or fiercer; so why should a bad storm, or several, make him think differently? Especially—as covid-19 also shows—because people normalise extreme circumstances. In a seminal study of white conservatives in coastal Louisiana, the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild asked how they reconciled their loathing of environmental regulation with living in one of the most polluted areas of the country. Part of the explanation was that they grew used to the pollution. Unlike the maligned frog, which will try to flee a dangerously high temperature however gradually it has been raised, humans are liable to wallow and boil.
Another part of the answer is short-term self-interest. Many coastal Louisianans (including formerly Bruce) owe their living to carbon-intensive industries. Evidence from Australia suggests this is an obstacle to climate realism everywhere. Yet America is the world’s leader on climate-change scepticism for additional political and cultural reasons that will be hard to unwind.
Most obvious is how systematically one of the two governing parties has misled its voters on the issue. Until the mid-1990s, Republicans and Democrats worried about climate change equally. Voters on the right were then persuaded to quit worrying by a well-documented misinformation campaign, paid for by industrialists and executed by conservative think-tanks, politicians and media. The parties diverged so sharply on the issue that their respective positions—accepting climate science or rubbishing it—became a mark of political identity. That made them even more entrenched.
There have always been Republicans arguing against the misinformation, including John McCain and in recent years lesser figures, such as the members of the newly formed Conservative Climate Caucus. Yet the sceptics hold sway because of how strongly their message is aligned with the party’s other main currents.
One is a pessimistic strain of evangelical Christianity. On global warming, as on covid-19, white evangelicals are especially anti-science and ready to rationalise the negative fallout of their views as God’s will for a fallen world. Another is mistrust of expertise, cemented by decades of misinformation. Both factors propelled Donald Trump—the most anti-science Republican leader ever. And it is unclear that even he could now redirect his followers on climate change. When he recommended they get vaccinated against covid-19 at a rally last month, Mr Trump was booed.
Shelter from the storm
Yet despite these depressing fundamentals, the situation is not hopeless. The falling cost of renewable energy, and its deployment across Republican states, has created surprisingly broad support for decarbonisation even among those who claim to see no need for it. A recent poll found that Joe Biden’s plan for a zero-carbon electricity grid by 2035 is backed by a majority of voters in every state and all but six congressional districts. The proposed means to pay for that shift—borrowing trillions from the future—also has something approaching bipartisan support among voters. To launch the transition, via the sweeping budget bill the Democrats are now preparing, all that is needed is unanimity among their own senators. And the natural disasters that are now buffeting both coasts have probably made that more likely.
It may be little consolation to the million Louisianans without electricity in 90-degree heat, but storms always bring, as well as destruction, a hope of refuge. Ida is no exception. The front door may be barred; but America is inching towards a possible escape from its dysfunctional climate politics round the back.■

1749,"COUNTRIES HAVE to make revealing choices as they craft patriotic messages for children. To put it kindly, young minds are tiny treasure-houses that deserve to be stocked with only a nation’s most precious beliefs. To be more blunt, small children are easily distracted, so are best taught only a few important things.
It is therefore worth studying what China’s propaganda chiefs have in store for youngsters this summer. As usual, June 1st was marked this year in China as International Children’s Day, a festival of visits to museums, school picnics and wholesome games. A month later there will be a much larger event: celebrations on July 1st of the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding in 1921.

China’s leader, President Xi Jinping, is presented to the young as “Xi Dada”, or “Uncle Xi”, an austere but caring patriarch. Mr Xi stresses the importance of loyalty, which is why children’s choirs are busy performing such songs as “Me and My Country” and “Follow the Leadership of the Communist Party of China”. Party history is being used to inspire the masses. That explains reports of kindergarten pupils being dressed up in miniature combat fatigues and told to crawl on their bellies while clutching straw-wrapped “rations”, to re-enact Red Army supply runs. There is much talk of China entering a “new era” of prosperity, national strength and global influence. It is not hard, as a result, to find children’s drawings on public display, showing high-speed trains and space rockets adorned with Chinese flags. The young are urged to be proud of ancient glories too, as heirs to what they are told is the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.
This year’s Children’s Day saw the release of a new patriotic film made especially for children. It depicts the pre-teenage life of Zhou Enlai, who was China’s prime minister from 1949 until his death from cancer in 1976. This brilliant, disappointing man is a puzzle for historians. To this day, many Chinese revere Zhou as a moderate who tempered Mao’s worst excesses, especially during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Too often, alas, the record shows Zhou enabling Mao’s follies and failing to defend close allies from political attack. Born in 1898 into a once-grand family of scholar-officials, Zhou was a precocious student of the classics. But his childhood was blighted by the deaths of his mother and adoptive mother and by money woes that, at the age of 12, forced him to leave his birthplace, Huai’an, in the plains between the Yellow and Yangzi rivers, to seek a new life with an uncle in the north.
During the first decades of Communist rule, his privileged class background had to be explained away. A biography published in 1977, “The Early Life of Zhou Enlai” by Hu Hua, depicts Zhou as a “rebel against feudal society”, who as a boy came to hate the gentry class into which he was born. Deepening poverty turned him into a “great proletarian revolutionary”, it relates. That official history manages to praise Zhou’s traditional education while reflecting the party’s then-noisy disdain for pre-Communist codes of ethics, such as those taught by Confucius. Describing Zhou poring over books from his grandfather’s library, Hu asserts that the boy was stirred by histories of “laudable national heroes” fighting foreign invaders, but was uninterested in Confucianism.
Biographies written in the 1990s by historians in the West, including Chae-Jin Lee, Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgen, take a different view. They find that Zhou had a conventional Confucian education, which marked him for life. Nor do they agree that he was an angry rebel, noting his later, loving praise for his two mothers. Both were educated, tradition-minded daughters of scholar-officials. Indeed, they link Zhou’s survival at Mao’s side to a reverence for Confucian teachings about self-restraint and the need for officials to swallow small insults in the national interest.
The new film appears to agree. Chaguan watched “Zhou Enlai in his Childhood” on Children’s Day in a cinema in Huai’an. The movie does not hide Zhou’s ancestral wealth. It portrays him as a solemn little boy in a silk gown, visiting relatives in antique-filled mansions. Confucian customs are shown as expressions of love. The young Zhou kowtows to his elders and studies cobwebbed texts to make his dying mother proud. His adoptive mother teaches him to swallow an unjust punishment with tales of an ancient general who endured humiliations on his way to greatness.
The film is not fast-paced. There is much fidgeting in the cinema, though children perk up at a brief shot of a boy’s bare bottom, and again when Zhou urges his adoptive mother to drink ink as a medicine. The Zhou family’s struggles to afford a middle-class life are crafted to resonate with older cinema-goers. Zhou’s father, a petty official in another town, is depicted as a migrant worker—largely absent, always fretting about money, and emotionally distant from his own son. The film shows health crises that wreck family finances and trigger rows about whether to spend money on medicine or school fees. Such dilemmas remain common today. The film’s ending unites all ages. Over swelling chords, young Zhou waxes indignant on learning that Russia and Japan have taken territory from the ailing Chinese empire, then declares that he studies hard so that China may rise. That phrase of Zhou’s is taught in schools to this day, and triggers murmurs of recognition.
Nationalism instead of class struggle
After the film, a mother in the audience, Lu Ye, calls it “very educational” to see the orphaned Zhou confront debt-collectors, endure hardships and assume responsibilities beyond his years. Ms Lu’s 12-year-old son, Rongye, says that he “really liked” the film. He praises an episode in which Zhou picked and sold wild vegetables to help repay those debts, until his hands bled. “For the welfare of the family, he didn’t care,” Rongye notes approvingly.
The film-makers say that their aim is to promote education and family harmony. China is a deeply conservative place, even as it prepares to celebrate its revolutionary past. Chinese children, told constantly to be diligent and obedient, sensed that all along. ■",2
1750," (CNN)President Joe Biden underwent his annual physical Friday morning at Walter Reed Medical Center, his first such appointment since he was inaugurated as the oldest first-term president in US history.Afterward, his physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor wrote in a memo Biden ""remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.""The doctor, who has been with the President since he served as vice president, singled out two areas of ""observation"" he set aside for detailed investigation: an ""increasing frequency and severity of 'throat clearing' and coughing during speaking engagements"" and the President's ambulatory gait, or walking abnormality, which O'Connor said was ""perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago."" Both have been noticeable elements of Biden's public appearances since taking office. In a detailed, six-page summary of Biden's health, O'Connor said X-rays showed Biden has arthritis of his spine and normal wear and tear damage for someone of his age. The doctor characterized that damage as moderate to severe, but said it was not severe enough to warrant any specific treatment. He wrote it would help account for some of Biden's recent stiffness and clumsy gait. An ""extremely detailed neurologic exam"" was ""reassuring,"" O'Connor wrote, and showed no evidence of a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's.Biden also has a condition known as hiatal hernia, which causes him to have reflux -- something O'Connor said could account for his more frequent throat clearing.The document contained a detailed accounting of the physical exam, including his height of 5 feet 11.65 inches; his weight of 184 pounds; and his blood pressure of 120/70. Biden does not drink or use tobacco and works out five times a week, according to the report. ""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,"" O'Connor wrote in his summary.Biden received a routine colonoscopy Friday while at Walter Reed. The process, which required anesthesia, meant that he temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman to assume presidential power for 85 minutes Friday morning.As he left Walter Reed, Biden said he ""had a great physical and a great House of Representatives vote,"" alluding to the House passing his Build Back Better bill on Friday morning.The last extensive update on Biden's medical state came in December 2019, when the doctor he eventually recruited to serve as White House physician described him as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, hasn't released a full report on his health since.Biden is not behind in releasing medical information compared to his recent predecessors, who waited a full year before undergoing a physical and authorizing details to be released publicly.The latest update on Biden's health came after he, then-president-elect, fractured his foot in November while playing with his dog. In February, Biden's physician said the foot fractures ""are completely healed.""Presidents are not required to publicly disclose results of their annual check-ups but have done so to be transparent and assure the American people in the face of questions about their state of health. Presidents, however, have also hidden their illnesses, the severity of their illness, or medical treatments.Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009 and the White House physician, wrote the three-page medical summary Biden's presidential campaign released nearly two years ago. The 2019 summary showed Biden was being treated for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, or AFib -- an irregular heartbeat that O'Connor said Biden experiences no symptoms of. He was taking Crestor to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as Eliquis to prevent blood clots, Nexium for acid reflux, and Allegra and a nasal spray for seasonal allergies.The most significant medical event in Biden's history, O'Connor wrote, was when Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988. He was serving in the Senate at the time. During surgery, doctors found a second aneurysm that had not bled, which they also treated. While in the hospital after that surgery, Biden suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Doctors at the time inserted an ""inferior vena cava filter,"" which would prevent future blood clots from reaching the heart and lungs and treated him with an oral anti-coagulant for several months.Biden also had his gallbladder removed in 2003, and according to O'Connor he has had multiple surgeries and physical treatments for orthopedic injuries and sports medicine. Biden also has had several non-melanoma skin cancer lesions surgically removed. This story has been updated with additional information. ",0
1751,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. We begin our coverage with the publication of a special report by our US editor.
WHEN DEREK CHAUVIN knelt on George Floyd’s neck at the corner of 38th and Chicago on a warm, cloudy night in Minneapolis a year ago, there was little unusual about the scene. Not for Mr Floyd, who had been arrested before. Not for Mr Chauvin, who had been disciplined twice for misconduct and had 17 complaints against him. And not for America, where police kill over 1,000 people a year—three-quarters of them, unlike Mr Floyd, armed. Sorted by race, more whites die like this than any other group. But black Americans (13% of the population) are over twice as likely to be killed by the police. In this, as in many other ways, African-American men who are poor are at the bottom of the heap. To find someone else’s knee on their throat is, sadly, unsurprising.
The reaction to this murder was a shock, though. Mr Floyd’s death, which was filmed by a bystander, sparked the biggest civil-rights protests in America’s history. Some 20m Americans took part, flouting covid-19 restrictions. There were 7,750 protests in over 2,440 places, in every state. Beyond America, Black Lives Matter protests were staged in Brazil, France, Japan and New Zealand, among others. Companies around the world have been busily examining whether, through their hiring, buying and selling, they play a part in perpetuating racism. A year on, footballers in England’s Premier League, who play in a country where just 3% of the population is black, still take a knee before games, a gesture that is broadcast to 188 countries. Thus America’s struggle to defeat racism shapes other societies too.


The image of a white-skinned man, wearing a uniform that reads “To Protect With Courage, To Serve With Compassion”, kneeling on the neck of a dark-skinned man evokes the worst of America’s past so strongly that there seems little doubt what killed Mr Floyd. Police violence was part of it, as was poverty. But the real culprit was racism. The jury that on April 21st, after a short deliberation, convicted Mr Chauvin of murder seemed to agree.

For many African-Americans, watching a constant stream of death videos, combined with the country’s still racialised politics, feels like “drowning in the news”, according to Eddie Glaude of Princeton University. “I never really had faith in the United States in the strongest sense of the word,” he writes in “Begin Again”, a book about James Baldwin published after the protests. “I hoped that one day white people here would finally leave behind the belief that they mattered more. But what do you do when this glimmer of hope fades, and you are left with the belief that white people will never change—that the country, no matter what we do, will remain basically the same?”
Drowning in the news makes it easy to miss the profound improvements in racial attitudes in America that have taken place just in the past generation, a change reflected in the scale of outrage about Mr Floyd’s murder (and the rare conviction of a police officer for it). When Bill Clinton became president, a majority of Americans disapproved of interracial marriages. Cynthia Duncan, a sociologist who worked in the Mississippi Delta during the 1990s, observed that “when blacks describe a white who does not seem racist, they say, ‘she treated me like a person’, repeating the phrase to emphasise how rare and remarkable the encounter had been.” And this was 30 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
Now another 30 years have passed, 90% of Americans approve of mixed-race marriage. Measuring changes in racial attitudes is fraught, because as people become more conscious that prejudices they hold are no longer widely accepted, they may become more reluctant to admit them. Yet changes in behaviour suggest the shift is real, not just what people believe they should say to pollsters. More than 10% of babies born in America are now mixed-race. Research drawing on data from dating apps suggests that one in three couples who meet online are too. This is part of a demographic transformation. Since 2019, white, non-Hispanic children have been in a minority in America.

African-Americans, whose opinion on the matter ought to count, think there is less racial discrimination than there was. In 1985 three-quarters of African-Americans thought that the fact that whites had better jobs, better wages and better houses was mainly down to discrimination. By 2012, less than half thought this was the case (a share that rose after Donald Trump was elected). And yet among the general population, racism is rated a more important issue in Gallup’s polling than health care, poverty, crime, the environment or national security.
How can the country have become both less racist and yet more worried that the prevalence of racism is growing? And if racism is indeed declining, why do so many African-Americans still seem to be so stuck?
Racism and awareness of racism are related but distinct. Sometimes they move in opposite directions. In the old South, where people were denied the right to vote for a century after the abolition of slavery because of the colour of their skin, it was a cliché for whites to claim not only that they were not racist but also that they understood African-Americans better than did those progressives in northern cities. Similarly, many whites who may have been unaware of racism when it was far more prevalent are more conscious of it now, as the protests after Mr Floyd’s murder showed.
Guess who’s coming to dinner
Since Barack Obama’s election in 2008, left-leaning white Americans have undergone what Matt Yglesias, a journalist, dubbed a Great Awokening on race. R.T. Rybak, a former mayor of Minneapolis, calls it “reality therapy”. The Trump-powered birther movement, which asserted that the country’s first black president was a foreigner, the well-publicised killings by police of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Eric Garner in New York, a mass-shooting at a black church in South Carolina: all these made people realise that racism was more widespread than they had thought. And then Mr Trump was elected president.
The share of whites who thought black Americans had worse jobs, lower incomes and crummier houses because of discrimination shot up. The share of whites who thought government should give no special treatment to black Americans shrank by a third in six years. In the year Mr Obama was elected, half of white Americans thought racial differences in incomes and wealth were caused mainly by lack of will. By 2018 that share had fallen by 15 points. Now black respondents are slightly more likely to blame African-Americans for their circumstances than whites are.
Understanding race and racism in American means grasping a set of contradictions. Despair at the slowness of improvement can be a sign of progress. Racial attitudes have changed, but black and white Americans are as segregated as they were in the era of James Brown and John Denver. As a true multiracial democracy, America has existed for less than the span of a lifetime. It is home to the biggest black middle class in the world, but also to a large black underclass that has made little economic progress since the 1960s. Writing about race is normally shorthand for writing about African-Americans, Hispanics or Asians. But as they are becoming more aware, whites are a race too.
In a multiracial democracy, emphasising race can be a recipe for zero-sum competition for public resources. Partly for this reason, the French government largely bans collection of data on race. But ducking the issue can mean that racial inequality persists. In 1967, another time of despair at racist violence, James Baldwin wrote that he wanted black Americans “to do something unprecedented: to create ourselves without finding it necessary to create an enemy.” America’s task now is to make multiracial politics work without setting groups against each other. No other big, rich democracy is as multiracial, but plenty will be one day. So America is once again a testing-ground for a great democratic experiment. For it to work, the first thing to understand is why it was Mr Chauvin’s knee that was on Mr Floyd’s throat, and not the other way around.■

1752,"MPS GATHERED in the Palace of Westminster on October 18th, first in the House of Commons and then in St Margaret’s Church, to celebrate the life of one of their own. They told stories about the man with the widest grin in Westminster: how this lifelong Roman Catholic had once got the pope to bless a boiled sweet by mistake and how this inveterate campaigner for city status for Southend deluged the authorities with proof of the place’s worthiness, such as the fact that it held the world record for the number of triangles played simultaneously. They also hinted at serious questions about what his murder meant for British democracy. How could potential murderers be spotted before they struck? What should be done about internet trolls who spew hatred? And would MPs have to retreat behind armed guards or fortified screens when meeting their constituents?
Sir David Amess was never one of Parliament’s high-flyers—indeed, he might well be described as a low-flyer. The furthest he climbed up the greasy pole was as a PPS (parliamentary private secretary). But he was nevertheless a far more significant figure than many famous MPs. He was the embodiment of perhaps the most important political trend of the past 40 years: the rise of “Essex man”, that upwardly mobile figure who, thanks to his combination of self-reliance and truculence, drove the Thatcherite revolution of the 1980s and the Brexit revolution of the past decade.

His parents were Cockneys who moved to Essex in order to start a family. He was brought up in modest circumstances, with “an outside toilet and a tin bath hanging on the wall”, but nevertheless decided to become an MP in the same year that he passed the 11-plus test for the local grammar school. In the late 1970s he appeared in a political advertisement with Margaret Thatcher, who became his lifelong heroine. In 1983 he stood successfully for Basildon, then a swing seat that shifted to the Conservative column. And in 1997, after boundary changes, he switched to another Essex seat, Southend West. The constituency had been a pocket borough for the Guinness-Channon dynasty for more than a century, starting with Rupert Guinness, then passing to his wife, Gwendolyn, then to his son-in-law, the socialite diarist Henry “Chips” Channon, and finally to Chips’s son, Paul Channon. Sir David’s arrival was yet more proof that the party of the old aristocracy was becoming the party of the Essex man.
Sir David was also the quintessential local MP who believed that the highest calling of an elected member was to represent the people to the state rather than the state to the people. He gloried in the House of Commons in all its magnificent quirkiness, hanging an ornamental sword on his peg in the cloakroom, in deference to the tradition that swords had to be abandoned before entering the chamber. He disliked almost every change to the institution, not because he was a fuddy-duddy—or not just because he was a fuddy-duddy—but because they weakened Parliament’s power to oversee the executive. The end of late-night sittings was eroding camaraderie. The rise of professional politicians was turning Parliament into a rubber stamp. (He was particularly contemptuous of Tony Blair, “the biggest egotistical maniac I’ve ever met” and “sickeningly smooth” with it.) His proudest achievements were all local—keeping schools and hospitals open and preventing a forest of silver birches from being razed to the ground.
Sir David was happiest with his constituents. He relished the flummery of constituency life such as judging dog shows and raising money for a statue of Dame Vera Lynn, a popular wartime singer. But he didn’t just relish the Friday constituency surgeries where MPs meet constituents to hear their problems. He regarded them as key to the sacred bond between elected politician and electors. He pooh-poohed threats which, like all too many MPs, he received, and held his surgeries in local community centres to make himself accessible. It was while he was holding one of these surgeries in a Methodist church that he was stabbed to death.
The atrocity has provoked an agonised debate about how to stop future attacks. Politicians from the prime minister down have insisted the best way to honour Sir David’s legacy is to remain open to the public. But this is a little blasé. Sir David is the second MP to be killed at work in five years (the first being Jo Cox, a Labour MP who was murdered on her way to a surgery by a neo-Nazi). Many politicians are considering posting police officers and security guards in their surgeries. Policymakers are also discussing the question of how to identify potential assailants before they make it to surgeries. William Shawcross, who is reviewing the government’s counter-terrorism Prevent strategy, to which the suspect was referred, is likely to argue that MI5 should have more say as to whether potential extremists are placed in anti-extremism programmes. Policy Exchange, an influential think-tank, urges the authorities to combat the grievance culture that poisons the minds of some young Muslims rather than waiting until they show signs of violent intent.
In memoriam
The physical defence of MPs needs to be linked to a wider defence of their calling. There is a tendency in popular culture to demonise politicians as self-seeking parasites who do not care about the common good. But if you are interested in fiddling your way to wealth there are easier ways to do it than to put yourself in the public spotlight. There is a tendency among historians to treat the history of Parliament as a sideshow. But in fact the House of Commons has played a crucial role in providing a civilised outlet for social divisions that elsewhere result in violence. It is fitting that the queen should have honoured one of Sir David’s quixotic causes by making Southend a city. It would be even more fitting if the political nation—journalists and academics, as well as politicians—were to devote more energy to seeing the virtues as well as the failings of the institution to which he devoted his life. ■
Correction (October 25th 2021): A previous version of this piece defined PPS as ""personal private secretary"". It is in fact ""parliamentary private secretary."" This has been corrected. Sorry.
An early version of this article was published online on October 20th 2021",2
1753,"WHEN, IN 1996, President Bill Clinton announced that “the era of big government is over”, supporters to his left feared that saying so would only serve to make it so. They were wrong. So was Mr Clinton. Between 1996 and 2019 America’s annual government spending grew by one percentage point of GDP. And when, last year, the economy crashed, it rose by another ten (see chart 1). Now President Joe Biden is building on what started as emergency pandemic-related policy, expanding the child-tax credit, creating a universal federally funded child-care system, subsidising paid family leave and expanding Obamacare.

America’s government spending remains somewhat below the developed-world average. But this change is not just a matter of catching up; the target is moving. Government spending as a share of GDP in the OECD as a whole has consistently inched higher in the six decades since the club was formed in 1961.

Some countries buck the trend, a bit, for a while. Germany’s spending as a share of GDP in 2019 was the same as it was in 2006, Angela Merkel’s first full year as chancellor. But the stable level was also a pretty high one. And German attempts to impose frugality elsewhere were short-lived. Spain and Italy both went on courses of strict austerity during the euro-zone crisis of the early 2010s. But in both cases public-sector spending, relative to GDP, was higher in 2019 than in 2006.
Examples of genuine state retrenchment in developed countries are few and far between. Sweden managed it in the 1980s. In the early 1990s Ruth Richardson, then New Zealand’s finance minister, cut the size of the state drastically. Wags called her plan “Ruthanasia”. The patient did not die. State spending is now six percentage points lower as a share of GDP than it was in 1990. But this is a rare achievement, and perhaps one doomed to pass. Grant Robertson, the current finance minister, pledged to “address the most inequitable of the changes made 30 years ago” as he promised a large boost to welfare payments.
This is a sorry state of affairs if you believe that low taxes and small government are the right, and possibly the only, conditions for reliable, enduring economic growth. The argument that even the best government cannot know what millions of sovereign individuals need better than they do themselves, an argument made by Friedrich Hayek, an Austrian philosopher, Milton Friedman, an American economist, and others in the mid-20th century, has fallen from favour. The practical argument that governments rarely meet this ideal and, corrupting and ineffective, strangle growth is still made, but to little electoral effect. Yet this hardly constitutes a triumph for the left, which continues to see insufficient government spending as fundamental to a whole raft of problems.
The tendency for government to grow is a hallmark of modernity. From 1274 to 1691 the English government raised less than 2% of GDP in tax. Over the 18th and 19th centuries that changed, with the tax-raising and spending capacities of the government massively expanding, especially at times of war. In the 1870s the governments of rich countries were spending about 10% of GDP. In 1920 it was nearer 20%. It has been growing ever since (see chart 2). It is now much higher in the rich world than either in the past or in developing countries.

The growth in what governments spend typically comes with a growth in what they do, and how much they control the doings of others. In America the number of federal regulations has more than doubled since 1970. The total word count of Germany’s laws is 60% larger today than it was in the mid-1990s.
Governments have not grown more powerful by all measures. Bureaucrats no longer, as a rule, set wages or prices, nor impose strict currency controls, as many did in the 1960s or 1970s. In recent decades the public sector has raised hundreds of billions of dollars from privatisations of state assets such as mines and telecoms networks. If you find it faintly amusing to hear that, from 1948 to 1984, the British state ran its own chain of hotels, that is because the “neoliberal” outlook on the proper place of government has triumphed.
Yet in other areas today’s governments have more power than ever. Building things requires developers to jump through more environmental, conservation and local-opposition hoops than it used to. Health-and-safety laws have proliferated. Occupational licensing has grown dramatically across Europe and North America.
For decades unions in many rich countries successfully argued against government-imposed minimum wages, saying they would do a better job of raising pay themselves. But as they have withered, the government has stepped in to provide wage floors. Rules relating to other workplace matters such as parental leave and gender-pay gaps go in only one direction.
And if direct government control of the economy has weakened, it has been more than replaced by redistribution. The objective correlative of Mr Clinton’s claim that the era of big government was over took the form of tax credits; he tripled those for low earners with children, and introduced the universal credit for children that Mr Biden now wishes to expand. In 1979 the bottom fifth of American earners received means-tested transfers worth on average 32% of their pre-tax income, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By 2018 the figure was 68%. Total social-protection spending in the OECD—comprising cash benefits, direct in-kind provision of goods and services, and “tax breaks with social purposes”—grew from 15% of GDP in 1980 to 20% in 2019.
Three forces stand out as driving the trend: the incentives which bureaucrats and politicians face; the rising costs of services provided by the government; and the demands of voters.
Governments and bureaucrats are at least partly self-interested: “public-choice theory” says that unrestrained bureaucracies will defend their turf and seek to expand it. A good recent example would be central banks. Their mandates typically compel them to control inflation and see off bank runs. Yet in recent years, with a cursory and often unconvincing nod to those mandates, central bankers have taken on fresh responsibilities. America’s Federal Reserve seems to believe it has both the obligation and the tools to reduce racial inequality, while many central bankers want to raise the relative cost of capital for fossil-fuel companies via interventions in the corporate-bond market.
Politicians have their own incentives to expand the state. It is generally more rewarding for a politician to introduce a new programme than it is to close an old one down; costs are spread across all taxpayers while benefits tend to be concentrated, thus eliciting gratitude from interest groups and sometimes even voters.
Technology, in particular communications technology, has served to strengthen the bureaucracy’s grasp. It is no coincidence that bigger governments emerged at roughly the same point in the 20th century as large corporations, which also required a new communications infrastructure. More rapid economic growth powered by those new arrangements made the growth of government less burdensome than it might have been.
Hardly cromulent
The second broad factor behind the growing power of the state is what William Baumol, an economist, named “cost disease”. In the 1960s Baumol noted that productivity in some sectors is greater than in others. But wages must rise in less productive sectors as they rise in more productive sectors to prevent workers quitting. So despite the fact that an orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall contains about the same number of musicians as it did when the venue opened in 1871,each musician is paid a lot more today, given the vastly greater opportunities that are on offer in the economy.

A lot of government spending is in areas where labour-productivity growth is slow, most notably the provision of education and health care (see chart 3). As the real wages of doctors, nurses and teachers go up at a rate set by other parts of the economy, so does spending. What is more, education and health care are also what economists call “superior” goods. As people become richer they spend a higher fraction of their income on them. If it is the government that provides those services, it must spend more. Across the OECD overall health spending has risen from 8% of GDP in 2005 to 10%, and governments are responsible for the bulk of that.
Others have extended Baumol’s ideas, arguing that government intervention inhibits productivity growth. A recent report by Steven Teles, Samuel Hammond and Daniel Takash of the Niskanen Centre, a think-tank in Washington, DC, warns of a vicious cycle in which subsidies for services the supply of which is constrained by regulations, such as housing and education, push up prices, creating demands for further subsidies. One example is student loans: in America 60% of any increase in the maximum subsidised loan is passed through into higher tuition fees, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. American politics is replete with promises of further subsidies for higher education. Pledges to reduce costs are thin on the ground.
The final steroid is the voters’ appetite, which depends on who the voters are. Over the course of the 20th century increasing numbers were working class and increasing numbers were women. Political scientists have linked the expansion of women’s suffrage across the rich world to growth in social spending, especially on health and education.
Twentieth-century voters were also increasingly likely to have fought in or lived through a world war. Both world wars vastly increased spending, and in both cases it never returned back to its pre-war level. Mass-mobilisation in war constituted a compelling claim to the greater peacetime provision of services like unemployment benefits and health care.
And today’s voters are increasingly likely to be old. Old people did well out of government even when this was not the case. “Making Social Spending Work”, a recent book by Peter Lindert of the University of California, Davis, shows that in 13 welfare states per-person support for the elderly, as a proportion of income, rose faster than spending on public education per school-age child for most of the 20th century. Spending per person levelled off in the 1980s—but more baby-boomers with longer lifespans means total spending is still rising. And political pressure to maintain spending on the old is acute.
While other forces behind the growth of government can be taken to be pretty steady, the demographic factors are strengthening. Over the next 40 years the share of the total rich-world population over the age of 65 will rise by half. The share of the very old, who according to British data demand four times as much health care per person per year, will grow far more rapidly. The rise of chronic conditions is likely to affect both health and social care, increasing the services that people consume before their final years of life.
A paper published by the OECD in 2019 said that health spending across the bloc would rise from 8.8% of GDP in 2015 to 10.2% in 2030. This is likely to end up being a significant underestimate, given that it is already most of the way there: the enormous infrastructure set up during the past 18 months to test for covid-19 and vaccinate populations will not be dismantled any time soon.
A new factor is at play, too. Rich-world governments are pledging to transform their economies to eliminate net carbon emissions, and this will require huge investment. If governments struggle, as they have thus far, to deploy market mechanisms such as carbon prices to encourage the transition, the number of regulations and subsidies will proliferate. Even with carbon taxation, the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain’s fiscal watchdog, estimates that the spending needed to get to net zero by 2050 will, by the end of that process, have added 21 percentage points to Britain’s debt-to-GDP ratio.
The scene is set, then, for bigger and bigger government. Moved perhaps by this inexorable economic logic, intellectual thought is increasingly statist, not only on the part of the political left, some of whom will never be satisfied with the scale of redistribution, but, more surprisingly, also on the political right. This provides a fourth factor in favour of an ever-larger state: an absence of opposition.
In 2019 American Affairs, a conservative journal launched two years earlier, published an article titled “Toward a Party of the State”. Acknowledging that “the state now occupies a much greater role than it has heretofore in post-war and modern conservative thought”, Gladden Pappin, the author, advised giving “aid and comfort” to, for example, “nation-state-oriented forces in Europe”—think of Hungary offering cash incentives to encourage families to have more children, for instance.
Others on the populist right are happy to preserve spending on the elderly, to intervene in markets in order to help certain interest groups, and at least notionally to favour massive infrastructure investments. Britain’s Conservative Party proclaims its small-state credentials louder than most, but Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is presiding over historically high levels of spending and taxation. There is harrumphing on the backbenches, but little by way of a concrete argument for cuts.
Johan Norberg, a Swedish free-market thinker, says he is politically homeless: “No major political force is listening.” In France Gaspard Koenig, a philosopher who runs a think-tank which focuses on economic freedom, is seeking to shift the terms of the debate. But the consensus in France remains clearly in favour of big government and high public spending. The Belgian region of Flanders, where some of those seeking independence see lower taxes and a smaller state as a possible result, is a curiosity, not the start of a movement.
People such as Mr Norberg might seem to have little alternative but to hope for a turn in the intellectual tide like that which saw the ideas of Friedman and Hayek flood the corridors of power in the late 1970s—a turn driven by the increasingly apparent failures of over-regulated, state-dominated capitalism. But in the meantime they still have policies to advocate.
One option might loosely be called “pave the swamp”: find ways to improve the structure of bureaucracies such that, while they might remain large, it would at least be easier to move things through them. John Cochrane, a free-market economist at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University, suggests adding “shot clocks” and sunset clauses to regulations. The former would mean that America’s Food and Drug Administration, say, would have a prespecified time in which to assess a new drug or food; no defensible verdict in the time allowed would mean automatic approval. Other sorts of regulation would lapse unless deliberately reinstituted.
Another palliative option favoured by some is to argue that the government needs to play a more activist role in making sure that existing markets work well—say by scrutinising mergers more closely so as to prevent the emergence of monopolies. Efficient markets will provide growth that goes at least some way to offsetting the increase in the government share, as it did in the 1950s and 1960s.
More dramatic options involve not just improving markets but expanding their reach in ways that might, ultimately, shrink the role of the state. One example, touted in “Radical Markets” by Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl, would be to transfer the right to admit immigrants from the government to individual sponsoring households, who could in effect sell their visa quota to would-be migrants.
Dare to dream small
Or, instead of eating away at the state, let people opt out of it. Mark Littlewood of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a Thatcherite think-tank, suggests allowing people to pay less in tax in return for abjuring some state services. If the tax cut is attractive but still less than the cost of supplying the service, that saves money. But because the people keenest to step out from under the umbrella of the state will always be those who already rely least on its protection, the state’s tax revenue would probably decline by a lot more than demand for its services.
Margaret Thatcher supposedly once produced her copy of Hayek’s “The Constitution of Liberty”, slammed it on a table, and pronounced “this is what we believe” to her fellow Conservatives. Today’s believers in small government lack the same sense of conviction. But they also face far more challenging circumstances, because stopping further growth of government over the coming decades will be close to impossible. The most important debates to come will be about the state’s nature, not its size. ■",2
1754,"“AM SURPRISED TO realise that anybody ever goes to, lives at, or comes from, Norwich,” wrote the novelist E.M. Delafield in 1930. The town is not Britain’s only one to find that its charms elude outsiders. There are also Slough (John Betjeman invited “friendly bombs” to fall on it), Hull (“a dump”, said Philip Larkin) and Bromley (“suburb of the damndest”, according to H.G. Wells). These opinions are abrasive, but hint at an abiding mystery. The world is our oyster. And yet people happily spend their lives in such unremarkable places.
New research suggests a simple reason. “Most people don’t move,” says Paul Longley, a geographer at University College London. By combining census records since 1851 with other data sources, such as electoral rolls, he and colleagues have plotted 40,000 British surnames to show how they have moved in 150-odd years. Mostly, they haven’t. “The vast majority of family names are…concentrated around the locales in which they were first coined between the 12th and 14th centuries,” they write in Nature Communications, a journal.

An online time-lapse tool animates this information (see maps for some snapshots). Regional names tend to remain in the regions, apart from some spread to London and the nearest big city. Wales remains crowded with Williamses and Scotland with MacKenzies. The Joneses are easy to keep up with as they gently ooze across the Midlands.

This probably seems surprising if you work in or visit London, where a single meeting may contain people from all over not only Britain, but the world. Moreover, the English middle classes have all but institutionalised migration through universities and, for the richest, boarding schools. But their experiences are atypical. For most people, says Mr Longley, “migration is a traumatic experience and is not undertaken lightly”.
Surnames are linked to social as well as geographical horizons. The researchers scored them on an index of multiple deprivation, from 1 (worst) to 100 (best). If Britain were perfectly socially mobile they would cluster around 50, with a little random variation; in fact, some do markedly better and others worse. Among the hundred most fortunate are Shapley, Evershed and Charter, which would sound at home in a Dickensian law firm. The bottom 100 includes Ram, Scamp and Pincher, any of which Dickens might have used for a street urchin.
Mr Longley also rated places in a similar manner. The bottom 100 included Wigan, Liverpool and Coventry; the top Cheltenham, Harrogate and, despite H.G. Wells’s disdain, Bromley. In Britain family, geography and destiny intertwine in an intricate dance—one that spans centuries.",2
1755,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",3
1756,"Boris Johnson has refused to say whether his father Stanley will be probed by the Tories after two women made claims of inappropriate touching.
The PM said it was 'absolutely right' women feel they can make complaints with confidence.
It comes after it emerged Stanley could be fired from a prestigious role as an environmental ambassador over the sexual assault allegations.
The powerful Conservative Environment Network, of which he is international ambassador, said: 'The alleged behaviour is not acceptable.'
The 81-year-old allegedly assaulted Conservative MP Caroline Nokes who said he had smacked her 'on the backside about as hard as he could' in 2003.
Her revelation earlier this week promoted political journalist Ailbhe Rea to come out and say he 'groped me'.
But as calls grew for a probe, a supporter of the 'charming' former MEP vowed it should not be a police matter if he was 'a little over-friendly, indeed handsy'.
Asked about the claims against his father, Mr Johnson said today: 'First of all, it's absolutely right that everybody, women in particular, should be able, have the confidence, to come forward and make complaints.'
The Prime Minister added: 'I'm obviously not going to comment on individual cases.'
He also declined during a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, North Yorkshire, to say whether he has spoken to his father about the allegations.
Last night it emerged Stanley could lose his role as international ambassador of the Conservative Environment Network.
Yesterday in an excruciating exchange in the Commons, the PM found himself being grilled by MP Miss Nokes about government policy on sexual harassment.
She did not mention her own claims against his father, but asked Mr Johnson if women would have more confidence 'if public sexual harassment was a specific crime', and if early intervention might stop 'those harassing women becoming sex offenders?' 
Stanley ignored questions on the matter as he left his house in north west London yesterday.
He had previously told Sky News: 'I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all – but there you go.'
Labour has called for 'criminal authorities' to investigate the claims, which emerged on Monday when Miss Nokes named Stanley during a panel discussion on Sky News.
She said during the Tory Party conference in 2003, when she had been the Tories' candidate for Romsey, Stanley slapped her bottom and said: 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat.'
After the allegation was broadcast, political journalist Miss Rea, who writes for the New Statesman, tweeted: 'Stanley Johnson also groped me at a party at Conservative conference in 2019.'
Yesterday another political journalist, Isabel Oakeshott, tweeted a photo of herself with the PM's father.
But she wrote: 'The charming Stanley Johnson can be a little over-friendly – indeed handsy – but I don't believe this is one for the police.
'Officers should focus their limited resources on investigating real crimes.'
She was deluged with replies from Twitter users accusing her of 'excusing' sexual assault. One said: 'I don't think 'Handsy Stanley' is the defence you think it is.'
Sky News political correspondent Kate McCann tweeted: 'You might be OK with someone being handsy but other women would find that uncomfortable...
'Your tweet suggests… it's their problem if they're offended, not his for being 'over-friendly'.'
Lifelong conservationist Stanley was made international ambassador at the think-tank the Conservative Environment Network in February.
But the organisation has now distanced itself from him, saying: 'We take all allegations of inappropriate behaviour very seriously.
'We have clear internal processes for managing allegations of this nature. The alleged behaviour is not acceptable to CEN.'
The chairman of CEN is Ben Goldsmith, a family friend of the Prime Minister's wife Carrie.
Yesterday the PM was grilled about sexual harassment when he appeared before Parliament's liaison committee of senior MPs.
They included Miss Nokes in her capacity as chairman of the women and equalities committee.
Miss Nokes – two days after accusing his father of smacking her bottom – put it to the Prime Minister.
She said: 'Isn't it fair to say that if public sexual harassment was a specific crime, you might see women with more confidence to come forward?'
Mr Johnson replied: 'All women should have confidence to come forward… and there are proper procedures for those claims and complaints to be investigated.'
The MP asked: 'Should we not intervene earlier, before those harassing women become sex offenders?'
The PM said: 'We need to prosecute people more effectively for things that are already criminal.'
Earlier Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the International Trade Secretary, said if Mr Johnson Snr had touched her inappropriately, 'I'd have probably slapped him'.
She told Sky News: 'This is something women have, for far too long, had to tolerate – the casual sexism, the wandering hand.'",-2
1757," (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris said Thursday she does not feel misused or underused in her role as vice president, following CNN reporting that many in the vice president's circle believe she is being sidelined and that key West Wing aides are exasperated by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus from Harris and her staff. ""We're getting things done, and we're doing it together,"" Harris told ABC in an interview that aired on ""Good Morning America.""Harris pointed to the President signing one of his biggest legislative victories -- the bipartisan infrastructure package -- into law on Monday, saying: ""This was a good week.""""I am very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished. But I am also absolutely, absolutely clear-eyed that there is a lot more to do and we're going to get it done,"" Harris said. Earlier this week, several top White House officials defended Harris, including press secretary Jen Psaki, who described the vice president as a ""key partner"" to the President. CNN reported on Sunday that key West Wing aides have largely thrown up their hands at Harris and her staff -- deciding there simply isn't time to deal with them right now as Biden faces urgent legislative and political concerns. At the same time, many in the vice president's circle are fuming that Harris is not being adequately prepared or positioned in her role, and the vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically.Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a longtime friend of Harris, told CNN: ""It is natural that those of us who know her know how much more helpful she can be than she is currently being asked to be. That's where the frustration is coming from.""In the ABC interview on Thursday, Harris did not say whether Biden had told her if he was planning on running for reelection, and said she and the President were ""absolutely not"" discussing 2024 yet. Harris also dismissed the President's low approval ratings, saying: ""Polls, they go up, they go down. But I think what is most important is that we remain consistent with what we need to do to deal with the issues that we're presented with.""Harris also called dealing with record inflation ""one of the highest priorities"" for herself and Biden.""It's real and it's rough,"" she said, citing rising prices for groceries and gas. She highlighted actions the administration has been taking to try to ease supply chain issues and lower costs for American families. Biden announced last month the Port of Los Angeles would move to 24/7 service, bringing it into line with operations at the Port of Long Beach, which was already working on a 24/7 schedule. Those two ports handle 40% of container traffic in the US. The administration has also taken other actions to attempt to alleviate issues at the nation's ports, waterways and freight networks.""We're seeing great results,"" Harris said.In addition to the short-term actions, Harris said in the long term, the administration is working to bring down the cost of living. She said the new bipartisan infrastructure law as well as the second part of Biden's economic agenda -- a sweeping package to expand the nation's social safety net -- would help achieve that goal.",0
1758,"Shell announced a big change to its corporate structure, with plans to move its tax residency from the Netherlands to Britain, dump its dual-share structure and remove the legacy “Royal Dutch” from its legal name. The oil giant is under pressure to increase returns to investors. Relocating its tax base to Britain gives it more freedom on share buy-backs. Shell is keeping several big divisions, such as global upstream, in the Netherlands. Nevertheless the Dutch government said it was “unpleasantly surprised” by the news.
Toshiba laid out formal proposals to split into three publicly listed companies, a move that came soon after General Electric’s similar decision to split. The Japanese conglomerate wants to house its nuclear, infrastructure and engineering businesses in one company, create an asset-management firm that will oversee its tech holdings in another, and start a new company for its chips and small devices. Some shareholders want Toshiba to sell itself to a private-equity buyer instead.

Meanwhile, Johnson  Johnson, another huge conglomerate, said it would spin off its consumer-health division into a separate business, leaving it to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
Natural-gas prices surged in Europe again, after Germany’s energy regulator temporarily suspended its certification of the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to transport Russian gas to western Europe. More Russian supplies would ease the continent’s energy crunch, but the regulator said that the pipeline’s operator was not in a “legal shape compliant with German law”.
Japan’s economy shrank by 0.8% in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, a blow for Kishida Fumio, the new prime minister, ahead of his announcement of a big stimulus package. Business investment plunged in the quarter, as global supply-chain problems hit the country’s exporters. Consumer spending also fell amid a resurgence of covid-19.

Britain’s annual inflation rate jumped to 4.2% in October, the highest level in a decade and up from 3.1% in September. This was mostly because of higher energy costs and supply-chain shortages, but a tightening labour market has added to inflationary pressures. The number of people in employment rose sharply in October, allaying fears that many of the 1m still on the government’s furlough scheme, which ended in September, would lose their jobs. Record job-vacancy rates persist, which often leads to higher wages to attract staff.
Joe Biden accused oil and gas companies of “anti-consumer behaviour”, alleging they were ramping up petrol prices for profit, and asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. The president is under political pressure as a result of surging prices at petrol pumps.
What supply-chain crisis?
Walmart reported a bumper quarter for sales, and said its shelves would be fully stocked for the Christmas shopping season. The retailer has found that shoppers are gradually returning to pre-pandemic habits, with more of them visiting physical stores than a year ago. Target issued a similar earnings report.
Just a week after its IPO, Rivian, a maker of electric vehicles backed by Amazon, reached $153bn in market capitalisation, overtaking Volkswagen in value. Its share price then dived by 15%, wiping out its lead over VW. Lucid, which produces luxury electric cars, passed Ford in market value. Rivian and Lucid have yet to make a profit, but investors are betting that the companies’ shares will perform as well as Tesla’s, though they could also be as volatile.
The British government ordered a full investigation into Nvidia’s proposed acquisition of Arm, a British chip-designer, in part on national-security grounds. Nvidia, America’s most valuable semiconductor manufacturer, later revealed that America’s Federal Trade Commission has “expressed concerns” about the deal, which is also being investigated in the European Union.
AstraZeneca is looking to make “modest” profits from new orders of its covid-19 vaccine. The drugmaker produced its vaccine in collaboration with Oxford University, and has been selling it without a profit margin (unlike rival firms). Its doses have been used mostly in Europe, but also in developing countries, where it will still be sold at cost.
The right to be disconnected
News sites pored over the recent approval of a law in Portugal that bans employers from contacting their staff outside working hours, including by email. Companies will also have to pay some of the cost of remote working, such as an employee’s higher energy bills, and cannot monitor home workers in any way. Office workers in Portugal have nothing to lose, it seems, but their email chains.",2
1759,"WHEN SATYA NADELLA became the third boss of Microsoft in 2014 one photograph captured the moment. It shows him flanked by Bill Gates, the co-founder and chairman, and Steve Ballmer, Mr Gates’s successor as chief executive. The two white tech tycoons strike a confident pose in casual dress. Mr Nadella, an Indian-American, skulks in a suit, smiling awkwardly.
He had a reason for that awkward smile. The company was in a ditch. While it hunkered down at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, Apple invented the iPhone, and Google and Facebook rose from Silicon Valley. Its share price barely budged for years. When he took over, says Mr Nadella, outsiders questioned if Microsoft will “make it to the other side”.

It did—with aplomb. Mr Nadella dethroned the Windows operating system as its core product. He brought Microsoft’s software and services to other operating systems, including “open source” Linux, as well as Google’s and Apple’s. Most important, he put Microsoft’s cloud-computing arm, Azure, launched in 2010, at the heart of the business. The result has been double-digit revenue growth and a market capitalisation of $1.6trn. Only Apple and Saudi Aramco, an oil colossus, are more valuable.
Microsoft succeeded in its reinvention where other tech firms seeking a second life, such as IBM and Oracle, have not. But nothing lasts for ever in the fast-changing world of technology. The old personal-computer (PC) business has slowed. The firm’s products are not always the best or most popular. Azure is considered by many experts to be technologically behind the market leader, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which the e-commerce giant launched four years earlier. Many users prefer to make video calls on Zoom and chat on Slack rather than use Microsoft’s Teams. This year Microsoft failed to buy TikTok, which might have boosted its consumer-facing business that includes the Xbox games console and (less interestingly for TikTokers) LinkedIn, a careers network; the popular Chinese-owned short-video app inked a nebulous technology partnership with Oracle instead. And Microsoft has to square up not just to Amazon but to younger tech giants such as Alphabet (Google’s parent) and China’s Alibaba and Tencent.
The pressure to succeed is immense. The firm’s shares have more than quintupled in value since Mr Nadella took over (see chart 1). They now trade at 37 times earnings, a higher multiple than those of Alphabet, Apple or Facebook (though far below Amazon’s ratio of 123). The company is priced for perfection, says Mark Moerdler of Bernstein, a research firm. And for further expansion.

Mr Nadella acknowledges the challenge. “This is not some linear transition,” he says. “When the first hockey stick plateaus the question is: have you got the other things?” In an effort to live up to the hype he is dusting off old weapons—bundling and licensing—the aggressive use of which got Microsoft in trouble with antitrust authorities from the late 1990s and earned it the moniker “evil empire”. An insider since 1992, he remembers those days, when the firm narrowly avoided a forced break-up. Can it continue to grow while steering clear of the old pitfalls?
Until 2014 Microsoft had five different business areas. Most of the profit came from three of them: Windows, its Office software (spreadsheets, word-processing, PowerPoint and the like) and programs to run the servers used in data centres and corporate networks. Entertainment and devices, including the Xbox, made a bit of money. Online services such as the Bing search engine and MSN web portal did not.
Mr Nadella reconfigured this structure. Today Microsoft’s 20 or so businesses fall into three big buckets: cloud, productivity software and business processes, and personal computing. Each contains one of the lucrative stalwarts—servers, Office and Windows—alongside lots of others such as Surface PCs and digital whiteboards, or Dynamics business software. Many of the businesses revolve around Azure, which has grown into the internal computing backbone for Microsoft’s applications, as well as a product to sell to customers. Forays into futuristic quantum computing or virtual and augmented reality stand on their own, while boosting Azure’s capabilities. So do artificial-intelligence (AI) algorithms, trained on data from Bing, LinkedIn and other places.
If any of those whizzy bets succeed at scale, they would sharpen Microsoft’s innovative edge, which looks blunter than either Amazon’s or Alphabet’s. Even if they do not, Microsoft may succeed by commercialising products rather than inventing new ones. As insiders quip, the firm is never first to market and often not second, but “man, we will make all the money”.
That has certainly been true of Office. Excel was not the first spreadsheet (remember Lotus 1-2-3?). But it is deemed by many software engineers to be the most consequential program ever written, in part because it has been so widely adopted. Around 1.2bn workers use Office or Office365, a web-based version served up through Azure. Here, too, Microsoft lagged behind Google’s G-suite software, which, among other things, enabled multiple users to work on one document at the same time. Googlers make digs at what they see as Microsoft’s offline, “save as” mentality.
Still, managers prise Office—and especially Excel—from desk-jockeys at their peril. As a result, Microsoft controls 87.6% of the market for such software, to Google’s 11.5%, according to Gartner, a research firm. To boost Teams, Microsoft has started bundling it with Office365 free of charge; by April Teams had 75m daily users. Unfair, rivals say; in July Slack launched an antitrust suit against Microsoft. It calls Teams a copycat product aimed at killing it—just as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer vanquished Netscape, a rival web browser, which led to its battle with trustbusters.
Critically, Microsoft has been a superfast follower in the cloud. In Mr Nadella’s book about the firm’s transformation, “Hit Refresh”, he described how, by the time he took over, AWS had built a vast cloud business with no competition. “Amazon was leading a revolution and we had not even mustered our troops,” he wrote.
The stakes are huge. Over time most of the world’s companies are expected to move computing to the cloud. The share of IT spending going to the cloud is approaching 10%. But that already amounts to an annual market of $240bn. Given expected annual growth rates of nearly 20% it could reach $1trn before long.

In the cloud Azure faces two big rivals—AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)—and two others—Oracle and Alibaba Cloud. Its market share has risen steadily, to 18% (see chart 2). Again, Microsoft’s rapport with firms’ IT departments has served it well. It still dominates parts of business software and nearly four in five personal computers run on Windows, as do 72% of all servers. It can offer corporate clients a single price that bundles Azure with Office and other software. That way Azure can end up costing only a fifth as much as AWS, Microsoft claims (AWS disputes this). And it is easier to use than Amazon’s offering, whose advanced features overwhelm even some IT professionals.
It is also easier to swallow for many clients than Amazon products. When Microsoft pitched for business, recalls a former executive, Azure would lose the technical evaluation but win out of customers’ fear that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s insatiable boss, might use their money and data to invade their turf. Suspicion of Mr Bezos may explain why AWS lost a $10bn Pentagon cloud contract to Microsoft, despite being tipped to win. Amazon believes Microsoft benefited from Donald Trump’s feud with Mr Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper the president does not like. Amazon has legally challenged the award, unsuccessfully so far.

Azure aims to match or overtake AWS in the cloud. Yet in Gartner’s closely followed ranking of cloud providers Azure comes in well behind AWS and has lately slipped down (see chart 3). The way Microsoft has built its global cloud infrastructure, covering more geographical ground than AWS but more thinly, may make it less reliable. Gartner cites insufficient redundant capacity to deal with data centres knocked out by bad weather or other problems. Even without disruptions, capacity has proved problematic. As demand has surged in the pandemic, with millions of remote workers switching to the cloud, Azure has at times been unable to keep up. Microsoft Teams suffered a blackout in March. That month Microsoft put in place temporary resource limits on new Azure subscriptions. AWS has not needed to.
Azure blues
Microsoft cannot afford to get Azure wrong. It is what drives its share price. Azure is estimated to make up only a tenth of Microsoft’s $53bn in annual operating profit. But every quarter Wall Street fixates on how fast the cloud is growing, notes Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Recently analysts have been disappointed to see growth slow, from 59% year on year in the first three months of 2020, to 47% from April to June. (It is some comfort that AWS’s growth has also slowed in recent quarters.)
Azure is sure to get a fillip from new licensing rules, just as Teams has from bundling. Up to now Microsoft let customers use its software on dedicated servers run by AWS or any cloud provider under a practice called “bring your own licence” (BYOL). That freedom enabled easy switching; of all cloud-based Windows software, 57% runs on AWS, nearly twice as much as on Azure.
Last summer Microsoft did away with BYOL and introduced restrictions for customers wishing to put its software on certain big clouds. If a client wanted to run desktop and server programs on those clouds after October 1st, it would have to buy a new subscription, rather than a one-off licence. Not to offend antitrust rules Microsoft put Azure on its list alongside AWS, GCP and Alibaba Cloud. But it separately offered customers a better deal to move to Azure, offsetting the extra cost.
Amazon said Microsoft was trying to restrict what clouds companies can use. Several neutral observers concur. “Microsoft is taking its arsenal of Windows Server, a massive installed software base, and using it punitively against competitors,” says Raj Bala, Gartner’s main cloud-infrastructure expert and author of its cloud ranking. It is the antithesis of Mr Nadella’s more open strategy, adds Wes Miller of Directions on Microsoft, a research firm. After all, he had eased Office’s move to non-Windows devices such as Apple’s iPad. “Satya wants to make people think he’s different, but he’s old-school Microsoft, just with a little softer exterior,” sums up an executive at a rival.
Microsoft is the only big cloud provider which also sells lots of programs that clouds host. “Is there a piece of software that Amazon or Google has built that runs on Azure? Zero,” Mr Nadella says. That also gives Azure a big advantage to exploit. Mr Nadella does not intend to repeat the mistake of letting Windows workloads all migrate to Amazon’s cloud, as happened early on. “We were stupid, not realising what was happening,” he says. “We will absolutely monetise our intellectual property on their clouds.”

Since the licensing changes went into effect Gartner has received several hundred inquiries about them. An executive from a Fortune 500 health-care company that had picked AWS as its cloud provider says that the new rules meant an extra annual cost of $100m, forcing the firm to slow down its transition to the cloud. “They are writing licence terms to get customers to believe their only choice is Azure,” complains a vice-president of a medium-sized firm in Wisconsin that felt forced to switch from AWS. “There is no law against it but it removes choice,” he adds. An IT chief at another midwestern firm likens the new rules to a long lease on a car where “the lessor says you can only use Chevron gas, not BP or Exxon”. Two of the three customers are set on writing Microsoft software out of their stacks over time.
Avoiding defenestration
That points to a risk for the tech giant. By tugging reluctant customers onto Azure too aggressively Microsoft may put a lot of them off Windows—or, possibly, provoke mass flouting of rules, daring the software giant to enforce them. Takeshi Numoto, chief marketing officer of Microsoft’s commerical business, says the feedback Microsoft is receiving on cloud choice after the new rules is positive, adding that “We want to hear from all customers if there are ways we can improve our partnership and support of their businesses.”
How closely is Microsoft flirting with the kind of behaviour that got it in trouble in the late 1990s? After its bruising antitrust battle it is likely to proceed cautiously. If Europe proves sympathetic to Slack, the messaging firm could bring a similar case in America. If that happens, Microsoft may offer concessions to make it go away.
Mr Nadella resists the idea that Microsoft is overstepping the mark. “Look at the number of enterprise SAAS [software-as-a-service] and infrastructure firms,” he says—hardly suggestive of “a monopoly company collecting monopoly rent”.
In its defence Microsoft can certainly argue that Azure has brought competition to cloud computing, which AWS might otherwise have cornered. Tellingly, Mr Nadella was spared the indignity of testifying in front of a congressional antitrust subcommittee, which recently grilled his opposite numbers at Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook. A congressional report on big tech’s digital dominance did not finger Microsoft. America’s trustbusters have gone after Google instead (see article). Google denies wrongdoing.
Microsoft’s rebuffed $25bn-30bn bid for TikTok could have been a boon to competition. Had it succeeded, Microsoft would have challenged Google and Facebook in digital advertising in short order. TikTok’s reams of data on its teenage users would have fuelled Microsoft’s AI, which competes against algorithms being developed by all its big tech rivals in America and China. The purchase of ZeniMax Media, a games developer, for $7.5bn to bolster its flourishing cloud-gaming platform does not make up for the failed bid.
Google’s antitrust troubles could offer consolation. The case may shake up internet search, helping Bing. It is a tiddler despite having a quality of search results that is not all that different from Google’s. In a hint that Microsoft might want to revive its search engine, this month it was rebranded as “Microsoft Bing”.
Mr Nadella is confident about future growth, his early awkwardness long since replaced by a justified and resolute assuredness. “We’re lucky enough to be in the tech business, and IT spending is going from 5% of GDP to 10% over the next ten years,” he says. But competition for those IT dollars is white-hot. Microsoft’s response—leaning heavily on customers not to defect—may work in the short run. But as the pace of change in the technology industry accelerates, thanks to abundant brainpower and oodles of capital, customers may put innovation ahead of loyalty to long-standing providers. One successful reinvention is unlikely to be enough. ■

“THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is now the number-one energy superpower anywhere in the world,” President Donald Trump told oilmen in Midland, Texas this summer, from a stage decorated with gleaming black barrels. The sheer volume of hydrocarbons that such American oilmen have released from the shale beneath Midland and previously unforthcoming geology elsewhere gives substance to his boast (see chart 1). Over the past decade America’s oil output has more than doubled and its gas production increased by over 50%. America is now the world’s top producer of both fuels.

Had they heard Mr Trump say that “We will never again be reliant on hostile foreign suppliers,” presidents from Franklin Roosevelt on might have nodded in envious approval. After the second world war America’s unmatched ability to consume oil outstripped its unmatched ability to produce it. Ensuring supplies from elsewhere became an overriding priority. The oil shock of the 1970s had a profound effect both on the economy and on geopolitics, driving much of America’s subsequent involvement in the Middle East. The surge in domestic supply in the 2010s both boosted the economy and opened up new geopolitical opportunities. America can apply sanctions to petrostates such as Iran, Venezuela and Russia with relative impunity.
But what it might mean to be an energy superpower is changing, thanks to three linked global shifts. First, fears about fossil-fuel scarcity have given way to an acknowledgment of their abundance. Not least because of what has been achieved in America, the energy industry now knows that it will be lack of demand, not lack of supply, which will cause production of oil, coal and, later, gas to dwindle. In its latest “World Energy Outlook”, published on September 14th, BP, an oil company which has recently said it plans to go carbon neutral, argues that demand for oil may already have peaked, and could go into steep decline (see chart 2 ).


This is because of the second shift: an acknowledgment by most countries that, for the sake of the climate, reliance on fossil fuels needs to come to an end. And that leads to the third shift: electrification. Fossil fuels provide heat that is mostly used to move things, be they vehicles or electric generators. Solar panels and wind turbines provide energy as electricity straight off. Maximising their emissions-free benefits means processes and devices that now rely on combustion must in future use currents and batteries instead. The BP analysis argues that in a world going all out for decarbonisation the share of energy used in the form of electricity would rise from about a fifth in 2018 to just over half in 2050.
Falling demand for fossil fuels will tilt the balance of power away from producers and towards consumers—though there will doubtless be reversals now and then along the way. And in a world which needs to generate much more fossil-free electricity, mass production of the means whereby to do so will become crucial, as will government backing and know-how in deployment. Being a mighty pumper of oil will do a lot less for America under such conditions than once it might have done. But China, the world’s biggest fossil-fuel importer as well as its leading exponent of renewable energy at gigawatt scales, will have the wind, as it were, at its back.

The covid-19 pandemic has provided a dramatic preview of a world in which demand for oil falls instead of rising. When the globe stopped spinning in March, its thirst for oil suddenly subsided. Petrostates dependent on pricey oil for their spending now face gaping deficits. Investors have fallen out of love with oil companies. For all Mr Trump’s grateful boosterism, the value of America’s shale sector has fallen by more than 50% since January. ExxonMobil, an oil company included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1928, has been kicked off it. With a market capitalisation of $155bn it is worth considerably less than Nike, a shoemaker with a swoosh.
In the face of this turmoil China’s demand for oil imports, already the largest in the world, continues to grow—providing some welcome stability. The country’s independent refiners—the “teapots”—have become large enough that they help set oil’s price floor. “They are essentially the vacuum cleaner of the crude market,” says Per Magnus Nysveen of Rystad Energy, a consultancy. Michal Meidan, who leads China energy studies at Oxford University, points out that the trading arms of state-owned oil giants SINOPEC and China National Petroleum Corporation are now two of the three largest traders of crude cargoes priced on the Platts Dubai futures contract, which means they influence the price of crude bound for Asia. Low prices also allow China to build up its strategic reserves.
Big finds off the coasts of Brazil and Guyana and the development of Australia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity, along with America’s shale boom, add to China’s opportunities; a buyers’ market is a good place to be the biggest buyer, notes Kevin Tu of Columbia and Beijing Normal Universities. There are plenty of bullish oilmen who think that, BP to the contrary, peak demand has yet to be reached. But even they recognise that the supply of oil below ground outstrips the thirst above it, and that competition for customers is likely to heat up.
In some instances competition for Chinese demand may be straightforward. When it embarked on a price war with Russia this spring, Saudi Arabia slashed prices on shipments bound for China. The country’s biggest refiners are mulling a plan for a buying consortium to strengthen their negotiating power with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. China will probably also flex its financial muscle as petrostates buckle under debt. It has issued oil-backed loans to crude-rich countries such as Angola and Brazil for more than a decade.
China’s position as a buyer also allows it to undercut America’s attempts to squeeze oil exporters. Chinese buyers long continued to import Iranian and Venezuelan crude. Its energy alliance with Russia is particularly important.
A different strength
As energy expert Daniel Yergin points out in “The New Map” (see article) Vladimir Putin realised the significance of energy relations with China early on; but the pivot to China became more urgent after the financial crisis of 2007-09. In 2009 the China Development Bank lent two state-controlled Russian companies, Rosneft, an oil producer, and Transneft, a pipeline builder and operator, $25bn in exchange for developing new fields and building a pipeline which would supply China with 300,000 barrels of oil a day.
In 2014 Western sanctions over Crimea inspired Gazprom, another Russian energy giant, to commit to a long-haggled-over gas pipeline, the Power of Siberia, which opened last December. Tying in Chinese custom gives Russia a large market unmoved by calls for sanctions at a time when European demand is faltering. But as Erica Downs of Columbia University points out, “As soon as a pipeline is built, the balance of power shifts from supplier to buyer.” After the first oil pipeline was built, China refused to pay the agreed price.
All this power in the market, though, cannot mask the geopolitical downside of relying on imports. Being a large importer may give you more power than being a smaller one; but it still leaves you vulnerable. China is acutely aware that much of its oil comes through the straits of Hormuz and Malacca, which could be closed by third-party conflicts or, in extremis, the US Navy. In recent months China’s concern about energy security has risen as relations with America have declined, notes Ms Meidan—for all the current talk of decoupling, China has been buying lots of LNG from America, as well as crude for its stockpiles. Communist Party documents for China’s new five-year plan emphasise the need for a more flexible, reliable energy system.
What China lacks in oil and gas supplies it makes up for with industrial policy, which it has long been using to support domestic coal production and nuclear power as well as what is now by far the world’s largest renewables sector. Chinese companies have invested in mines from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Chile and Australia, securing access to the minerals needed for solar panels, electric vehicles and the like. Unable to be a petrostate, it is becoming what one might call an electrostate, investing strategically all along the chain from mine to meter.
This is not in itself anything like a triumph for climate action. China has more than 1,000 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired generating capacity. This installed base, with which it generates 49% of the world’s coal-fired electricity, makes it the world’s biggest carbon-dioxide emitter. And its coal use is set to expand in the years to come.
Its wind and solar capacity of 445GW, vast though it is by most standards, is less than half coal’s total, and those renewables typically run at a much smaller fraction of their capacity than coal plants do. But China also has 356GW of hydropower capacity, more than the next four countries combined. It has been building nuclear power plants faster than any other country—the average age of the 48 reactors in its fleet is less than a decade—and intends to go on doing so; nuclear, which now produces less than 5% of the country’s electricity, is set to produce more than 15% by 2050.
The evolution of China’s nuclear, wind, solar and battery sectors varies somewhat, but the basic formula remains the same: learn from foreigners and then use massive investment and authoritarian dictat to support deployment on a very large scale. Subsidies at home and abroad have helped. Support for renewables in Europe in the 2000s created a demand for solar panels only Chinese firms, liberally aided by the state, could meet. Chinese battery giants, led by CATL, benefited from a policy that subsidised electric vehicles only if they used batteries from domestic suppliers.
Fossil-fuel free as they are, these technologies still require raw materials. Wind and solar power need a lot more of some non-ferrous metals—notably, if unsurprisingly, copper—than systems which burn fossil fuels; batteries require niche materials in ways that fuel tanks do not. Generally, the world has plenty of these necessary commodities—but less capacity to get them to market than rapid decarbonisation requires. As Andy Leyland of Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, a research firm, puts it, “There’s no geological shortage. It’s a financing shortage.” Mines which frequently go over budget and are too often delayed, sited in countries prone to instability, are not overwhelmingly alluring to most Western investors.
Chinese companies have helped fill the gap. Some of this is through domestic investment. China produces 60% of the world’s “rare earths”, which have properties that make them useful in electric motors, among other things. They are not, generally, rare in a geological sense, but they can be in short supply. (They are also often mined in ways that do great damage to the local environment.)

For other metals China mostly has to look further afield. Tianqi, a private company, has a minority stake in SQM, Chile’s biggest miner of the lithium on which batteries depend. Tsingshan has invested in battery-grade-nickel projects in Indonesia. The DRC’s copper and cobalt have attracted Chinese investors for over a decade, and mines owned by others often send their output to China anyway. China refines more than twice as much lithium and eight times as much cobalt as any other country, according to BloombergNEF, a research outfit (see chart 3).
Ivanhoe Mines, led by Robert Friedland, a veteran American miner, has had backing from two Chinese companies, CITIC and Zijin Mining, to build the world’s largest new copper mine in the DRC. Mr Friedland argues that Chinese investors look further into the fewer-fossil-fuels future than Western ones. “What do the batteries look like? Where is the supply chain?” These are questions, Mr Friedland says, where the Chinese “are probably ten years ahead”.
Politicians in America, Europe and Australia have expressed concern at Chinese control of minerals critical to not just energy but defence. A company backed by Bill Gates and other billionaires plans to search for cobalt in Quebec. America’s Development Finance Corporation is, for the first time, taking equity stakes in mining companies. One beneficiary is TechMet, which is betting that some investors will prefer mines independent of Chinese control. “It’s a very significant strategic issue for the United States and the West,” says Admiral Mike Mullen, a former chairman of America’s Joint Chiefs of Staff and now the head of TechMet’s advisory board. “I almost liken it to Huawei. We wake up and they’re in control of the world.”
Here comes everyone
China now produces more than 70% of the world’s solar modules. It is home to nearly half its manufacturing capacity for wind turbines. It dominates the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries, according to BloombergNEF, controlling 77% of cell capacity and 60% of component manufacturing. With its industries at such a scale, and support costs ballooning, subsidies for them have been cut. Last year China eased restrictions on foreign battery-makers, too
The rest of the world has benefited—the costs of solar panels and batteries have dropped by more than 85% in the past decade. “We will invest continuously in research to make sure we retain our leadership—in research and in mass production,” says Li Zhenguo, president of LONGi, a giant producer of solar modules. China is keen to set technical standards across a range of industries, hoping to shape the playing field for further innovation. For clean-energy technologies in particular, says Mr Tu, it has an edge.
Though it has successful and influential innovators such as Tesla (see article), in this part of the energy world Mr Trump’s superpower looks like an also-ran. His rival in this November’s election, Joe Biden, promises to get back in the race. Developed countries elsewhere are further along. Panasonic in Japan and LG Chem in South Korea are both making innovations in battery technology. Europe’s generous support has provided a big market for the world’s top wind turbine manufacturers, Siemens Gamesa, which has its headquarters in Spain, and Vestas of Denmark.
And Europe’s green ambitions are growing. In her state-of-the-EU address on September 16th, Ursula von der Leyen said that the European Commission, of which she is president, will be pressing for carbon emissions 55% below those of 1990 by 2030. This means European utilities are expected to provide both a large increase in capacity and a near-zero-emissions future. To do so they will have to buy yet more hardware from China. But Europe’s aggressive strategy gives them an opportunity to take the lead in developing the systems which put that kit to work, both at home and abroad, as well as in technologies China has yet to master.
Visit a wind farm in America’s heartland and you may well find an office of Electricité de France (EDF) nestled among the corn. Enel, a utility which has its headquarters in Italy, is the single largest investor in wind and solar projects in developing countries, according to BloombergNEF, with France’s Engie and Spain’s Iberdrola not far behind. Orsted, a Danish firm, is the world’s top developer of offshore wind.
China’s national champions have invested ambitiously in power projects abroad, too. Of the roughly $575bn invested or promised under China’s Belt and Road Initiative as of 2019, nearly half has gone to energy projects, according to the World Bank. But most of this has been on coal plants, nuclear reactors and dams. And nations wary of China’s influence and motives treat its advances with suspicion. Efforts by State Grid, the world’s biggest utility, to buy stakes in European electricity companies have been rebuffed. In Britain, state-owned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) has minority stakes in two nuclear plants being built by EDF, but a plant to be built by CGN itself is years away from approval which may not come at all.
Nevertheless Chinese companies are starting to invest more in wind and solar power abroad. China Three Gorges, a big power company, said in August that it would buy half a gigawatt of Spanish solar capacity from X-Elio, a developer based in Madrid. Last year CGN bought more than 1GW of wind and solar farms in Brazil.
To maximise its electrostate power China needs to combine its renewable, and possibly nuclear, manufacturing muscle with deals that let its companies supply electricity in a large number of countries. The International Renewable Energy Agency has suggested that such “infrastructure diplomacy” might prove as important to Chinese power in the 21st century as the protection of sea lanes was to American power in the 20th. If it uses it deftly, the energy transition could bring it advantages beyond any achievable with rigs, derricks and pipelines.■

1761,"SINCE THE Ming dynasty, Chinese who are oppressed by local officials have sighed, by way of explanation: “The heavens are high, and the emperor far away.” An earthier variant runs: “With no tiger in the mountains, the monkeys are in charge.” Today’s Communist Party bosses have no time for such cynicism. They want the masses to believe that, even in the remotest villages, their welfare is the concern of an all-knowing leader, Xi Jinping, served by officials striving to follow his stern but wise example.
Inspiring the public is not the party’s only concern. A central task of the Xi era is to transform morale among the country’s 90m party members, including millions of bureaucrats. Officials are told that they serve a rising China, whose growing strength is the awe of the world. Since Mr Xi became supreme leader in 2012, party membership has been presented as something close to a secular priesthood, in which a select few selflessly serve the masses. Government ministries in Beijing play their part in spreading the faith. Their high-flying staff—almost always party members—compete for the career-enhancing honour of a stint as grassroots officials in impoverished villages and towns.

Central government departments have sponsored a growing number of poor counties around the country since 1992, when the State Council first urged ministries to pair up with left-behind places. Chaguan recently spent four days in Malipo, a remote county of conical, cloud-topped hills, terraced fields and fruit orchards in the southern province of Yunnan, on the border with Vietnam. Malipo has been sponsored for 29 years by the foreign ministry, which organised (but did not pay for) this reporter’s visit with a delegation of officials from the national and provincial governments. The ministry uses its connections to help the county, which was declared free of extreme poverty in 2019 and last year recorded an average income per person of 11,984 yuan ($1,874). Foreign embassies and businesses have donated school buildings, books and scholarships. On October 17th America’s National Basketball Association donated a new basketball court to a middle school in Malipo (the NBA is still trying to mend fences in China after a coach signalled support for Hong Kong’s democrats, triggering nationalist fury). “Of course this is thanks to the foreign ministry,” said the headmaster, as teenage pupils intently copied the moves of visiting NBA coaches, or shyly asked them for autographs. The nearest city, Wenshan, used to be hours away along winding roads. A new motorway opened on October 1st, following lobbying by the foreign ministry. A diplomatic charity raised funds to build clean water systems for villagers who previously fetched water by hand.
Dozens of younger diplomats have done stints as volunteer teachers in primary schools in villages. More importantly, the ministry sends a mid-ranking official to serve for a year or two as Malipo’s deputy county chief. Duties include conducting foreign policy, for officials in Yunnan must talk to Vietnamese counterparts about exchanges of students or travel permits for ethnic minorities whose lands straddle the frontier. Both sides regularly clear landmines from border areas—a lethal legacy of China’s brief invasion of Vietnam in 1979, which still costs locals limbs.
Domestic tasks also loom. The ministry’s current man in Malipo, Chen Minghuang, served in Japan for several years. In addition to seeking inward investments for the county, he is, among other things, responsible for water quality in several rivers. Asked why a non-specialist can be entrusted with such work, a local official praises foreign-ministry volunteers for their promotional skills. Diplomats may not know how to raise a pig, but they can spot what makes a pig from Malipo marketable, she enthuses.
Chaguan ventures at one point that an Oxbridge-educated British diplomat may receive a thin welcome if sent to help run a county in rural Scotland, without any experience in local government. China is not so hung up about elitism, it turns out. The foreign ministry sends “the best of the best”, responds an official from Beijing. It sends party members, because they are expected to be moral exemplars. “Compared with the masses, party members represent more progressive and developed forces. That’s how they can help the people,” says the visitor from Beijing. A years-long anti-corruption drive has created a culture of honesty among officials of all ranks, she adds. At an agricultural training base, local officials offer a broad defence of rule by technocrats. Farmers may not understand which crops will grow well, and which will make money, says a county official. The role of experts is to guide them to harness market forces.
Heaven near at hand, and the emperor close by
Some may dismiss all this as a mere propaganda tour. Certainly, the delegation was only taken to handsomely restored villages and model farms, and greeted by folk dancers at every turn. It would take many days of independent reporting to assess the foreign ministry’s help, not to mention its sustainability. Malipo is just one of 88 counties in Yunnan formerly ranked as extremely poor.
But a visit to Malipo is a window on something else important. Lots of officials are increasingly proud of the system they serve, especially as they survey what they regard as chaos in the West. More than before they talk openly about the party’s role in that system. As Mr Chen puts it, millions of party members are working towards the same goals, guided by strong leaders. He describes the changing views of Malipo’s masses as they see their roads being paved, and houses and schools restored. “The central government always enjoyed a high status in people’s minds. Now local government’s reputation has also risen,” Mr Chen says.
Mr Xi’s China remains a big country with complex problems, run by men who see a world full of hostile forces. But the domestic confidence of its ruling party is unmistakable. Outsiders miss that tigerish swagger at their peril. ■",2
1762,"THIS WEEK’S signing of a trillion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill brought a glimpse of the politics Joe Biden promised to restore. Leaders from both parties gathered on the White House’s south lawn to praise the bulging spending package for roads and bridges. “I ran for president because the only way to move this country forward, in my view, was through compromise and consensus,” said Mr Biden. Conservative talking-heads were meanwhile rowing with his secretary of transportation over whether the concrete structures earmarked for attention were racist.
Pete Buttigieg suggested last week that some were. “If a highway was built for the purpose of dividing a white and a black neighbourhood, or if an underpass was constructed [too low to allow a] bus carrying mostly black and Puerto Rican kids to a beach…that obviously reflects racism.” Tucker Carlson—who claimed the infrastructure bill was not about infrastructure but is a “weird climate scheme/power grab/race-based redistribution plan”—called Mr Buttigieg one of “the dumbest people in the world”.

The 39-year-old, who used the mayoralty of Indiana’s fourth-biggest city to launch an improbable and impressive presidential run, is cerebral. An alumnus of Harvard and Oxford, he was interviewed on the trail in half a dozen languages (including Norwegian, which he learned to read a favourite novelist in the original). He is also right about infrastructural racism. Non-white communities were often bulldozed to make way for the national highway system. It is one of the reasons a typical white family is eight times wealthier than a typical black one—a staggering disparity.
The disdain on the right reflected not only unconcern about racial injustice, but how much the Biden administration has riding on the spending bill. Even if the Democrats pass a $1.85trn companion bill, covering social and climate policy, the infrastructure package will represent much of the legislative record Mr Biden will take into the mid-terms. Mr Buttigieg’s appointment to the Department of Transportation, whose budget has just been increased by over half, was made with that prospect in mind. A large but unglamorous agency, known inside the beltway for geekish efficiency and outside it hardly at all, the department has never before been run by such a rising star. And the similarly geekish Indianan’s task of selling the infrastructure splurge as a presidency-defining triumph has become even more important as Mr Biden’s ratings have slumped. Rarely has the workaday business of fixing bridges and potholes been invested with such desperate hopes.
Alas for the Democrats, even the sexiest lawmaking does not predict mid-term success. Voters responded to the arrival of Medicare in 1965, the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 and Obamacare in 2010 by punishing the president’s party. And they will feel the benefit of better roads far more slowly than they enjoyed those measures. Yet it should be acknowledged that generating wild enthusiasm for humdrum ideas and governing is Mr Buttigieg’s speciality.
A new film about his campaign, “Mayor Pete”, highlights the incongruity between his ordinariness and the passions he stirred. It shows his supporters joyously celebrating as he appeared—dressed like a dapper science teacher, in crisp shirt and tie, no jacket—and thronging to him. He won Iowa, came second in New Hampshire and stirred more excitement than any other candidate except Bernie Sanders. Some of the enthusiasm concerned the historic nature of his candidacy, as an openly gay man. But it was also testament to his ability to spin his thin résumé, as South Bend’s chief rubbish-collector, and unremarkable centrism into a compelling message of moral force and generational change.
Mr Biden, whose own campaign was less memorable, has his best talker where he needs him most. Mr Buttigieg has already visited a dozen states to cheerlead for the impending spending. This has sparked gossip about his future. Vice-president Kamala Harris, whose presidential campaign was even less inspiring than Mr Biden’s, is looking like an increasingly outside bet to succeed him. Some Democrats want to sideline her, whenever Mr Biden bows out, for the more talented Mr Buttigieg. It is crushing for the Democrats that such talk is afoot. (Less than a year into Mr Biden’s first term, they seem less sure of the identity of their next presidential nominee than the Republicans are.) It is also premature; not least because Mr Buttigieg’s increased exposure carries risks.
One concerns the management of the impending splurge. He understands that policy and messaging are only loosely related (with characteristic precocity, he corresponded with the linguist George Lakoff on the subject while still at Harvard). But few messages can survive a failed policy, and his department’s limited control over its resources makes embarrassments inevitable when so much money is sloshing around. Its main responsibilities are to pass safety regulations and funnel cash—mostly under tight congressional guidelines—to state and city governments. How well they spend it will be largely out of Mr Buttigieg’s hands. At the same time, a massive increase in the amount of discretionary spending he will have at his disposal—it will amount to roughly $42bn next year—will both consume him and make him appear more responsible for the entire spending package than he is. Mr Buttigieg used to argue that managing South Bend’s little budget was ideal training for federal leadership. He’d better hope it was.
A bridge to nowhere
Another vulnerability is the administration’s determination to justify all it does in terms of racial justice—as Mr Buttigieg’s recent remarks illustrated. However well-intended, they raised a question of redress for racist planning that he has no answer to. The bulldozed communities cannot be reassembled. He is not planning to favour poor minorities in his spending. Righting historic wrongs does not seem to be part of his remit; so it would be better if he did not raise expectations on the left and blood pressure on the right by suggesting it is. He already has enough on his plate.■

1763,"ACQUIRING A DRIVER’S licence in Delhi, India’s capital, requires a single 20-minute visit packing in a computerised exam and a brisk, efficient road test. The applicant’s phone pings as she exits the centre: “Congratulations! Licence will arrive by post within 24 hours.” At 8.30am the following morning a courier delivers the sleek, chip-enabled new card.
Such tip-top government service can be found in other poor countries too, but only by paying a bribe. The secret in Delhi is a national biometric identification system called Aadhaar. Rolled out over the past decade, it now covers all but a small fraction of India’s 1.4bn people. Everyone assigned a unique 12-digit number, backed by fingerprint and retina scans, enjoys instant proof of identity and residence. No more need for smudged birth certificates, crumpled utility bills or rental agreements.

Given India’s immense scale and complexity, and with its deep pool of highly skilled workers, its governments have increasingly turned to high-tech solutions for all sorts of problems. Generally these have eased burdens on both rulers and the governed, despite some expected glitches. Administrative infrastructure such as Aadhaar has propelled such conveniences as digital payments, internet shopping and online schooling. Yet precisely because of India’s size and poverty, tens of millions still are left out—because they are poor, illiterate, disabled, lack electricity, do not possess a smartphone or cannot connect to a mobile or Wi-Fi network.
Consider Reena Devi, a mother of two small children in Bihar, India’s poorest state. After her husband died last year, she should have been entitled to a widow’s pension and jobs programmes, among other things. But when Vyom Anil, a researcher, and Jean Drèze, an economist, met Ms Devi by chance, they found that since she had misplaced her Aadhaar card she had also lost all access to benefits. With no phone, no registered postal address and no record of her birth date, Ms Devi was unable to retrieve her unique number. The two academics spent four frustrating months trying to get Ms Devi re-registered. Finally a kind official made an extra effort, found her file and produced a new card.
Ms Devi was lucky to get help. In a few tragic cases those who have lost access to subsidised food because they cannot link their old ration cards to new Aadhaar cards, or because fingerprint readers in remote towns do not work properly, have starved to death. More commonly, poor people simply make do without the aid. Recent surveys by Lokniti-CSDS, a polling group, show that four-fifths of Indian families use public food-supply schemes, of which 28% say they have been denied rations at some point owing to problems with Aadhaar. The biometric ID has helped curb theft and corruption, but less so than non-tech reforms to the food system.
There are gaping holes in other government schemes as well. India’s covid-19 vaccination campaign, launched in January, quickly sagged, and not only because the government failed to order enough doses. Slots for shots could be booked only via CoWin, an online service. This proved easy for digitally literate people with at least some English. Most of those without such talents—the vast majority of Indians—had to wait until June, when the government quietly started admitting walk-ins. India is now close to giving its billionth jab—a notable achievement—but only a quarter of over-11s are fully vaccinated.
A social programme judged among India’s most successful, a decades-old network of some 1.35m free, one-room preschools that also provide meals, known as anganwadis, has suffered high-tech disruption, too. In March its workers, nearly all women paid less than $150 a month, were instructed to use a new, government-supplied smartphone app. Failure to upload classroom data could result in suspension of wages and of food supplies, threatening a vital source of nutrition for India’s poorest children.
The workers say the app is hard to use. It is only in English, which most do not understand, and takes up so much memory it crashes their cheap smartphones. Many do not even have a phone, or electricity or mobile reception in their villages. What was wrong with the old written ledgers they carefully kept for years, they ask? The change is that the government now wants more control and surveillance.
“In scheme after scheme we find that going digital has become a purpose of its own,” says Mr Drèze, the economist. Like many critics of the government’s technology push, Mr Drèze says he does not object to the principle. He points to a popular scheme in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, phased out after Aadhaar, that had simply replaced old ration cards with smart cards. People liked them because they were simple and transferable.
The trouble comes when tech wizards in Bangalore forget that they live in what is still in parts a very poor country. This detachment is then compounded by politicians seeking quick, sexy solutions, who rush projects into action without proper study. Simpler approaches get ignored.
A recent randomised control trial by researchers at America’s National Bureau of Economic Research, for instance, looked at how anganwadis could be improved by employing an extra half-time worker at what are typically single-teacher operations. The results were dramatic. Teachers spent more than twice as much time on the children’s education and health, and on administration, too. Learning scores shot up. In anganwadis with an extra helper, severe stunting dropped a remarkable 42%. Yet whereas the government’s operating budget for anganwadis—meaning food and salaries—has stayed flat, its outlay on tech has soared. In its rush to become a modern, digital economy, India is leaving behind those who might benefit the most.■",2
1764,"By the time you get to the end of this column it is possible that I will have been nicked by the boys in blue. I have been sent a 'warning notice'.
My crime was to buy a car 27 years ago and keep it. I boasted that I was doing the right thing by the environment. 
Replacing a medium-sized car like mine with a new one generates a carbon footprint of 17 tonnes —the equivalent of three years' worth of gas and electricity in a typical UK home.
Since the average motorist changes their car five or six times in 27 years, I've practically saved the planet from global warming single-handedly.
It's not that I expected a knighthood. I just didn't expect to be punished for it. 
But Transport for London has changed emission rules so we OACs (Owners of Ancient Cars) who live within the North and South Circular roads must now fork out £12.50 every time we drive anywhere. All day and every day (except Christmas).
That meant setting up an account to pay the charges. So I did as I was told and got an email confirming that my account was active. 
Off I drove. A few days later, the Warning Notice arrived.
I was puzzled, so I checked the website and got nowhere. The password I'd used for the account was suddenly not accepted. 
So I phoned the number on the website. And got nowhere. This time the problem seemed to be my PIN. 
Or maybe my account number. Or maybe my customer ID. Or my PCN number. Whatever that was. The recorded message didn't really care. I gave up.
I had become the innocent victim of the new digital age in which the algorithm reigns supreme.
There was a time when a human being with a problem talked to another human being who helped to get it sorted. Those days are gone. 
The lives of big companies and government officials are made so much easier if we customers or clients can be kept at arm's length. 
It began long before the pandemic struck. Covid has given it a rocket booster.
It's so much easier to cite Covid if you're dealing with a customer who wants to complain about the heating engineer not turning up.
Easier for them, that is. Not for you. 
You just have to keep listening to the recorded message telling you that your call is important to them, but unfortunately they are receiving a very large volume of calls and, due to Covid restrictions, there will regrettably be some delay in getting to you.
What a load of rubbish. Even if it were true that 'Covid restrictions' still existed and call handlers were forced to work from home, modern technology means calls could very easily be patched through to them. 
But it's not true. Not any longer. Five minutes in the rush hour on any Tube or bus proves that if you want to go to work, you can.
But that's assuming your company actually wants you to go to work. 
The statistics show that many firms are saving loads of money by encouraging office staff to sit at computers in their own homes rather than occupy expensive space in their city centre office block.
At least with private companies we customers retain the merest smidgeon of power. We can always take our custom elsewhere.
It worked for me, sort of, when my home alarm system kept going wrong and my long-suffering neighbour was being woken up in the middle of the night by it.
I spent endless hours on the phone listening to their recorded messages warning me, amongst many other things, that an engineer couldn't visit unless there was somewhere for him to wash his hands and wondering how many homes don't have washbasins.
Eventually, I cracked and told them I was switching companies. Result. The engineer came. Not on the day promised, but let's be thankful for small mercies.
That option does not exist, however, if it's a government department you are forced to deal with. Especially if it's the dreaded HMRC.
You'd have needed a heart of stone not to share the pain Ben Wilkinson described in this paper a few days ago. 
It took him one hour and 44 minutes of being forced to listen to the hideous music and even more hideous recorded messages telling him the delays were 'due to coronavirus' before he was able to speak to an actual person.
And then the human told him she could not help him because she had 'not been trained' to deal with his particular problem. 
So he had to start all over again. The really scary part of this is that Ben is not alone. 
And it's not as if HMRC can claim that they are getting an abnormally high number of calls.
Their own annual report, published this month, shows they received 33 million calls in the past financial year. 
That's 8 million fewer than the year before. Four years ago, only 15 per cent of callers had to wait more than ten minutes. That figure has more than trebled.
This is more than just an inconvenience. The taxman has enormous powers. Quite right, too. 
Nobody enjoys paying tax and even the most diligent citizen might make the occasional mistake. 
Plus there are many fraudsters out there — sometimes aided and abetted by dubious accountants — who should be in jail rather than their Caribbean tax haven.
But there are also many entirely innocent people being threatened with fines and visits from debt-collection agencies over money they do not owe.
And on the other side of the balance sheet are those who are forced to wait months for refunds of money they should never have been made to pay in the first place.
Ironically, the HMRC website offers a service called 'Where's my reply?' I say 'ironically' because I've just checked it out. 
I logged onto the website and claimed (a modest white lie) that I'd made a query about my self-assessment a few days ago.
It told me I could expect a reply by June 2. That's six months. Oh … and if I still hadn't had a reply I could try phoning. To which there is only one response: a hollow laugh.
It's a bit like your doctor telling you not to worry about his rather bleak diagnosis because you'll probably be dead soon anyway.
I suppose we should applaud HMRC for admitting that it's not exactly covering itself in glory. 
Or, to use its own language, 'not fulfilling the ambition to be a trusted, modern tax and customs department'.
Perhaps it would help if their customer-service staff were not working from their offices only one day a week.
I suspect there's something else going on here. Covid is a convenient excuse for forcing us to abandon any hope we might have had of talking to a living, breathing human being who might actually help us with our problem.
The Institute of Customer Service says that for the first time more than half of all our interactions with companies or public services are being made digitally.
Incidentally, you might like to know that I have just learned that 'they' won't be coming to take me away after all.
I have managed to make contact with a real human being at Transport for London who was both courteous and competent. 
It helped, of course, that I have the advantage of a public platform in the shape of this newspaper. Most do not.
Increasingly, we are being deprived of even a semblance of what we once thought of as customer service.
We are left talking to a computer screen behind which sits not another human being, but an algorithm. Or a recorded telephone announcement that may or may not respond to our pleas for help.
It's as though any human compassion in the relationship between customer and provider has simply disappeared. And that's very sad.",-2
1765,"“HERE WE ARE. Thewinners!” boomed Nicolás Maduro at a televised ceremony on May 20th. It was the third anniversary of what the Venezuelan president describes as his “popular victory”: an election in 2018 which secured him a second presidential term. “The election had such an important impact for us,” agreed his wife, Cilia Flores. She was more right than she perhaps intended to be.
For it was that vote, a fraud managed by a biased electoral authority, that led dozens of Western countries to brand Mr Maduro a dictator and isolate his regime. The United States has imposed financial sanctions on him and most of his political allies, including Ms Flores. American companies, once the main buyers of Venezuela’s crude oil, are prohibited from all dealings with the regime. The American government has offered a $15m award for information leading to the arrest of Mr Maduro. Dozens of democracies have, to varying degrees, formally declared the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, to be the rightful leader of the country. The Venezuelan economy has continued its relentless collapse, shrinking by more than 70% since Mr Maduro took office in 2013. Oil production has fallen to levels last seen in the 1940s. One-third of the population do not have reliable access to sufficient food.

Yet if it was not a “popular victory”, it was one for Mr Maduro. He has neutralised the opposition, making a mockery of the internationally supported plan to replace him with Mr Guaidó. The latter’s hope—that an underpaid and demoralised army would switch sides and put him into power—now seems a fantasy. Of the almost 60 countries which at one stage accepted Mr Guaidó as president, all but eight have quietly dropped the designation from their communiqués this year.

Mr Maduro, a former bus driver snobbishly dismissed as a “donkey” by his enemies, has proved far wilier than they had imagined. “He has uncanny situational intelligence,” says a former official in his government. “If there are three people in a room and one must die, it won’t be him.” The key to his survival has been patronage. “The government is more like a clan now,” says the ex-official. Generals, governors and gang leaders rule parts of the country like mini-fiefs. With oil money running short, the state hands out land and development rights to buy loyalty instead. In Los Roques, a Caribbean archipelago, mansions are being built in a national park. In the south, a chaotic gold rush has felled forests and poisoned rivers.
Mr Maduro now wants to reduce international pressure on his regime. His officials speak of a plan to “turn the page”. The idea is that by holding slightly less rigged regional elections and sending a team to negotiate with the opposition, Mr Maduro may persuade President Joe Biden’s administration to pare back sanctions imposed by Donald Trump. Mr Maduro “wants to figure out a way to give up as little as possible but get some legitimacy”, says an official in the US State Department. A significant easing of sanctions is unlikely. But threats from the United States have grown quieter. (Mr Trump publicly mused about ousting Mr Maduro by any means necessary, including an invasion.) Europe has also changed its tune. “The talk these days is of regime improvement, not regime change,” says a diplomat.
After denying for years that Venezuela faces a humanitarian crisis, Mr Maduro agreed in April to allow the UN’s World Food Programme into the country to feed children. He hosted the WFP’s boss, David Beasley (an American) in Caracas, the capital. Eleven days later the government transferred six former executives of Citgo, an oil-refining firm based in America, from prison, where they had been since 2017, to house arrest. The attorney-general vowed to investigate the security services’ role in three controversial killings.
In preparation for regional elections, the government and some elements of the opposition have agreed to empanel a new electoral council (CNE). It is still skewed in the regime’s favour, but two of its five members are friendly to the opposition (previously only one was).
The announcement has, as intended, divided the opposition. Mr Guaidó initially rejected it as an “imposition of the regime”, but others seem keen to take part. Henrique Capriles, a former presidential candidate who helped negotiate the deal, described it as the “least bad” CNE since Mr Maduro’s predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez, won elections in 1998. The Norwegian government is sponsoring a parallel effort, which may take place in Mexico, to get both sides negotiating.
Public support for Mr Guaidó has fallen from over 60% in 2019 to around 15%, according to Datanalisis, a polling firm. His “mandate” derives from his leadership of the National Assembly elected in 2015. Its term expired in January. The assembly has granted itself a one-year extension, saying that no credible elections could be held under Mr Maduro. But many of the governments that publicly support him, and even some allies in the assembly, think it would be wrong to extend again.
If talks go ahead, the opposition’s demands would include the release of political prisoners, perhaps a further overhaul of the CNE, an early presidential election (the next is scheduled for 2024) and the admission of foreign observers for all future polls. In return the regime wants the removal of all sanctions, the release of funds frozen by the United States and other countries, and the acceptance of a rival National Assembly created by Mr Maduro.
The United States has indicated that it would contemplate modifications, at least, to the sanctions. Mr Guaidó has moderated his earlier all-or-nothing approach to talks, with Mr Maduro stepping down as a precondition. Sceptics argue it is all a waste of time, and that Mr Maduro, who has held four rounds of negotiations with the opposition since 2013, has no intention of agreeing to anything that might lead to his losing power.
But there exists another view: that the president and his wife have their eyes on retirement, and would like to hand over to a palatable successor before new presidential elections in 2024. Mr Maduro, says the former government official, “wants to be remembered as the man who took on the United States and won”. ■

1766,"AT A FOOD distribution centre in Bidibidi, a refugee settlement in Uganda, a handwritten cardboard sign tells refugees their maize ration: 15kg for two months. That works out to 250 grams a day, to go with 60 grams of beans, a splash of oil and half a teaspoon of salt. A day after receiving hers, Ito Juani has already used some of it to repay a loan of cassava that got her through a lean spell. “The world has given up on us,” she says.
Who can deny it? In the past year the World Food Programme (WFP) has slashed rations for more than 3m refugees in seven countries across eastern Africa—by 40% in the case of Uganda. In some settlements, where it gives out cash instead of food, refugees must make do with 19,000 shillings ($5.36) a month. In South Sudan, where rations have fallen by half, the WFP is taking from the hungry to feed the starving, writes its executive director, David Beasley. Officials say they have only half the money they need to feed east African refugees for the rest of the year. Donor fatigue had set in before covid-19, but tight pandemic budgets have made things worse.

Most of the 238,000 people who live in Bidibidi fled from South Sudan in 2016, walking for days to escape ethnic killings and war. The settlement briefly became the largest refugee camp in the world. Today it feels like an endless village, clusters of thatched houses sprawling over the horizon. It has shops, video halls and small businesses. Uganda’s government, which is unusually welcoming, has given the refugees land to till and the right to work. But the sheer number of arrivals strains resources. The small, stony plots are the scrawniest of vegetable patches.
Handouts provide staple food and lubricate the settlement’s complex economy. A miller will grind maize into flour for a cut of a few handfuls. A few more can be bartered for firewood from locals from nearby villages. Some are sold to maize dealers to buy goods like soap, sugar and fish. But such trade has slowed since rations were cut, says a dealer, clutching an empty sack.
The rhythm of life is set not by the seasons but by “the cycle”, as aid workers call the routines of food distribution. The meagre rations rarely last until the cycle ends. “When food is distributed, the church is vibrant,” says Felix Taban, a pastor. “But when it runs out, people stop coming.” In the last weeks of each cycle children “don’t have energy” and drop out of school, says Anna Uba Joseph, a teacher. Meanwhile, more patients show up at hospital with gastric problems and stress, says a health worker there.
Ms Juani’s own ration ran out 20 days before the cycle ended, which was why she had to borrow. For those hungry weeks she stopped taking the antiretroviral drugs that treat her AIDS, because she felt ill after swallowing them on an empty stomach. Others resort to casual labour. Jane Mandera worked on a local farm with her two sons, aged ten and seven, digging under the equatorial sun for a meal and 4,000 shillings a day. In the evening she boiled up vegetables she had grown herself.
A WFP survey in March found that 42% of people in Ugandan refugee settlements had inadequate diets. Three-quarters of households skipped meals; three-fifths borrowed to eat. Stephan Deutscher of the WFP in Uganda says more are resorting to emergency measures such as selling assets or pulling children from school.
Aid workers praise Uganda’s openness to refugees, but the model falters without the funds to support it. Some hungry refugees now risk returning to their abandoned farms in South Sudan. A former policeman says he can no longer provide for his family, so he is going back home to join the rebels. When will he set off? “As soon as possible,” he says.",2
1767,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. To see them visit our hub
OF THE THREE officers with Derek Chauvin at the corner of 38th and Chicago, one identifies as African-American. In left-leaning media, James Alexander Kueng was described as Black, after a recent move to capitalise skin tone. Depending on the political leanings of the audience, his presence was proof either that the killing of Mr Floyd was not racist, because one of the officers was black, or that racism is so omnipresent that black officers stand by while white colleagues murder their kin. Yet Mr Kueng’s racial self-identification, which was core to this speculation, is a peculiarly American phenomenon. In Brazil, home to more descendants of African slaves than America, he might call himself white.
Racial categorisation still bears marks of how white Americans thought in the 18th and 19th centuries. The first census in 1790 had three categories: free whites, other free persons and slaves. The 1890 census was obsessed with measuring the African blood in each American: octoroons (one-eighth black) had one box, quadroons (one-quarter black) another. In 1990 respondents were allowed to identify their own racial group (before 1960 census enumerators knocked on doors and decided for themselves the race of the person who responded). But they could choose only one.

This was hard for multiracial Americans, and a headache for the Census Bureau. In the 1960 census people unsure of their race were told to pick the same one as their father (there was no guidance for what to do if that was uncertain). A decade later the bureau decided that, in ambiguous cases, the mother’s race was more reliable. It was not until 2000 that Americans were given the option of choosing more than one race. When filling out the 2020 form they had a choice of white, black/African-American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Some Other Race—or any combination of these.

Asked to fill out the form, a geneticist might tick all the boxes. The classification of races by Europeans began in earnest in the 18th century, and came with generalisations about each race’s characteristics from some of Europe’s most brilliant minds. “In the hot countries the human being matures earlier in all ways but does not reach the perfection of the temperate zones,” wrote Immanuel Kant. The author of the “Critique of Pure Reason” went on to explain why weather meant Indians had less talent. These categorisations, if not the prejudice that goes with them, are still reflected in census categories that divide Asians, Europeans, Native Americans and so on. But the notion that race and ethnicity can be separated goes against how most geneticists think about race.
The genes controlling physical traits that correspond, more or less, with contemporary racial categories (such as eyelid shape, skin tone and nose shape) do not correspond with much else. Attempts to link particular races to desirable characteristics, such as intelligence or athleticism, are becoming rarer. In 2019 James Watson, co-discoverer of the double-helix structure of DNA, had his name removed from his laboratory in Cold Spring Harbour, Long Island, after scientists became exasperated with his repetitions of stereotypes about African-Americans, Jews and so on. The laboratory acknowledged his contribution to research, but condemned his “misuse of science to justify prejudice”.

Such views return in guises like the “human biodiversity” movement, which exists mostly on Reddit, an online messageboard. Reddit is home to a fringe genre in which white supremacists take DNA tests and either discover they are not, in fact, pure bloods, or boast of the percentage of European in them. Richard Spencer, an organiser of the rally at Charlottesville for neo-Nazis, turns out to have Mongolian and north African ancestors from the 19th century. Mankind’s family tree makes this inevitable. “Every white supremacist has Middle Eastern ancestors,” writes Adam Rutherford, a geneticist and author. “Every racist has African, Indian, Chinese, Native American, aboriginal Australian ancestors, as well as everyone else, and not just in the sense that humankind is an African species in deep prehistory, but at a minimum from classical times, and probably much more recently.”
Multiple choice
While geneticists have been breaking down racial categories, more Americans are choosing more than one box in the census. In the first one where multiple options were allowed, 6.8m declared they were multiracial. In the second, the number had risen to 9m. When the 2020 results come in it will surely increase again. Given the effort many white Americans have put into drawing a clear colour line, this ought to be something for anti-racists to celebrate.
Keeping categories separate is one thing Southern segregationists and the Nation of Islam agree on. Even well-meaning activists pursuing racial equality stray towards it. Ibram X. Kendi, a populariser of “Critical Race Theory”, a way of thinking about race in American academia that borrows from French post-modernists and American legal scholars, frets that merging black culture and society into a dominant whiteness will rob black Americans of the identity they need to fight racism. According to this view, integration, the aim of so many civil-rights activists, is suspicious. Mr Kendi accuses “integrationists” of “lynching black cultures”.
For race to become less significant, which would be what most geneticists think and earlier civil-rights activists desired, it may need first to matter more. James Baldwin, who saw black identity politics as a means to the end of race mattering less, grasped this paradox early. “We find ourselves bound, first without, then within, by the nature of categorisations,” he wrote. This is at the core of the disagreement between Mr Kendi and his generation and an older generation of intellectuals, like Glenn Loury of Brown University. Both agree that race is not real as a biological category. But one side favours what Mr Loury calls “transracial humanism”, while the other worries that attempts to make race less defining may be just another form of white supremacy.

Such debates may seem distant from practical questions such as how to organise hiring at large firms or allocate capital. But the distance can be short. In 1989 Kimberlé Crenshaw published a paper on the disadvantages faced by black women working at General Motors in the 1960s and 1970s, who were subject to both sexist and racist discrimination. Thinking about disadvantage or oppression in “intersectional” terms has since become commonplace. Earlier this year Goldman Sachs announced plans to invest $10bn in 1m black women. The idea of micro-aggressions, or daily slights against non-whites revealing underlying prejudice, has moved from academia to mainstream in under a decade.
Such ways of thinking about racism can be helpful. Ms Crenshaw’s paper urged people to be more subtle. Mr Kendi’s Critical Race Theory began as an attempt to persuade legal scholars to think about how American society really works, rather than assuming discrimination had ended when laws were passed in the 1960s. But they can also lead to absurdities like the LGBT People of Colour Micro-aggressions Scale. Not every black woman is oppressed, just as not every white male is privileged. Such a mechanical approach gives the false impression that the key to fixing racism is to seek out the most oppressed perspective possible. To the alarm of some and the delight of others, this view is now close to orthodoxy for many students.
It also shifts attention from poverty towards identity. Some black women may face double oppression, but they still graduate from college and earn higher incomes more than black men. African-American college professors often face maddening slights, reminding them of the country’s racist past. In her book about caste in America, India and Nazi Germany, Isabel Wilkerson writes of feeling uncomfortable while flying on airlines, for example. But these incidents are trivial compared with the macro-aggression of a policeman kneeling on the neck of an unarmed suspect until he dies. What can be done about that?■

1768,"Two people were killed and and four others had to be rescued after they became trapped on the top floor of an empty house they used for a drug-fuelled sex party, a court has heard.
Jurors were told that a 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old mother-of-three died from smoke inhalation and a second woman had to be treated in intensive care after two mattresses and a chair were set on fire 'deliberately' at a house in Huddersfield in March.
Craig Collier, 35, is charged with the murder of Samantha Mills and Reece Schofield who both died days after the terrifying fire, Leeds Crown Court heard.
He is also charged with four counts of attempted murder, one count of arson with intent to endanger life and one count of perverting the course of justice. Mr Collier denies all eight charges.
The court heard the property in Clare Hill was unoccupied at the time but had previously been used by the homeless as a venue for 'drug taking and drinking'.
Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC opened the case and told jurors that six people visited the house on March 23 and engaged in 'drug taking and consensual intimate activity' when they became trapped on the top floor.
Three of those partygoers managed to escape through the skylight of the property, but three others, including Ms Mills and Mr Schofield, were unable to do so.
Another woman was rescued by firefighters and taken to intensive care where she later recovered.
Mr Moulson said: 'All of the matters arise as a result of what the crown contends was the deliberate setting on fire of a house in Clare Hill, in Huddersfield, we submit by this defendant on March 23, 2021.'
He went on to say the property at 17 Clare Hill was 'generally occupied' but regularly used by the homeless and others 'apparently involved in drinking and taking drugs'.
Mr Moulson added that the nearby Cambridge Hotel, opposite the house in question, is used by those in need of accommodation and it was at this hotel that Mr Collier lived.
At around 5.30am on March 23, six people were on the upper floor of the house engaged in 'drug taking and consensual intimate activity'.
Mr Moulson said: 'It is the prosecution's case that three separate fires were deliberately set inside that building by a seventh and only person in the building at that time, namely this defendant Craig Collier.'
He added that Mr Collier was not engaged in either the drug taking or sex activity and returned to his room at the Cambridge Hotel after the setting of the fire.
Mr Moulson said: 'A mattress we say was set on fire by the defendant.
'We contend he then moved to the floor below that floor on the ground floor where he set fire to a further mattress in a room on that floor.
'Then while on that same floor he moved a chair to behind the front door and set fire to that before leaving through that door and going to his room at the Cambridge Hotel.'
He added: 'As a result of those three fires in the positions below where those other six were, they had no option other than to attempt to escape through a skylight or attic window.'
Fire crews attended and three of those people, including Ms Mills, Mr Schofield and another woman, did not make it to the temporary safety of the roof.
Mr Moulson told jurors: 'All of them were rescued at the time alive from within that attic bedroom as a result of the bravery of the attending fire crews.
'Samantha Mills and Reece Schofield, despite the best efforts of those concerned with their rescue and subsequent medical treatment, ultimately died respectively on the 26 and 29 March.
'The cause of death in each of them was inhalation of the products of combustion.
'The third person rescued was admitted to intensive care and ultimately recovered from the effects of the fire upon her.'
Mr Moulson added that three others escaped 'relatively uninjured'.
Mr Collier denies two counts of murder, four charges of attempted murder, one count of arson with intent to endanger life and one count of perverting the course of justice.

1769,"Rebels from Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region captured two strategic towns and were poised to march on Addis Ababa, the capital. An allied rebel force, claiming to represent the Oromos, Ethiopia’s biggest ethnic group, said it had cut roads to Addis Ababa from the south. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, declared a state of emergency and said Ethiopia would defeat the rebels with “the bones and blood of her children”. Tigrayans in the capital were rounded up and detained.
The African National Congress, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, suffered its biggest-ever electoral defeat, falling below 50% in a nationwide ballot for the first time. The elections were local ones, which typically produce a lower turnout of ANC supporters. But they suggest that the party may struggle to gain a majority at a general election in 2024.

America, Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates called on the leaders of a military coup in Sudan to reinstate a civilian-led transitional government. The last two were a surprise: the coup leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, was thought to have had the backing of Arab allies, including the UAE.
The Knesset in Israel narrowly approved the government’s budget for 2021, a big victory for the new prime minister, Naftali Bennett. Had it failed, yet another general election would have been called.
Talks between Iran and six world powers, aimed at resurrecting the nuclear deal that Iran signed in 2015, will resume later this month. The discussions were put on hold in June after the election of Iran’s new hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi. America, which walked away from the deal under Donald Trump in 2018, will take part.
At least nine people were killed by a car bomb near the airport in Aden, Yemen’s temporary capital, the deadliest attack in the city since December. No one claimed responsibility. A day later dozens of people were killed or wounded in the province of Marib when missiles launched by the rebel Houthi movement hit a religious school and mosque, said the government.
Talking hot air
The UN Conference on Climate Change, or COP26, began in Glasgow. Governments pledged to reduce methane emissions and end deforestation by 2030. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping did not attend, but the Chinese president wrote to urge more support for developing countries. Some leaders were mocked for their travel arrangements. Joe Biden’s motorcade consisted of 20 vehicles. Boris Johnson flew back to London on a private plane. A spokesman said the aircraft was carbon-efficient.
Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, said his country aimed to reach net-zero emissions by 2070. Many rich countries have committed to reaching net zero by 2050. India, which still relies heavily on coal, would find that much harder.
As world leaders debated net zero, Britain and France called a temporary truce in a furious row over the economically insignificant question of fishing rights in the English Channel. France had seized a British vessel after French fisherfolk complained that post-Brexit Britain was being slow to issue them with licences. The mackerel mêlée is certain to resume.
Opposition leaders in Nicaragua (at least, those who have not fled abroad) called on voters to boycott a presidential election on November 7th. Daniel Ortega, the autocratic president, is set to win another term after locking up plausible opponents. The EU called the election “fake”.
A judge in Florida dismissed most of the charges of money-laundering against Alex Saab, a Colombian who is an ally of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator. Mr Saab, who was extradited to the United States, denies all the charges.
A Chinese tennis star, Peng Shuai, posted a message on social media accusing a former deputy prime minister, Zhang Gaoli, of assaulting her sexually. Censors quickly moved to suppress online discussion of the case.
Yahoo became the latest American technology firm to withdraw from China. It cited an “increasingly challenging business and legal environment” there. Microsoft’s LinkedIn has ended its services in China for similar reasons.
How low can it go for Joe?
A Republican won the governor’s race in  Virginia, an office Democrats have held for the past eight years. Glenn Youngkin, a former private-equity executive, won over several exurbs that had enthusiastically plumped for Joe Biden last year. Some swing voters were irked that Mr Youngkin’s opponent had suggested that parents should have no say in what their children are taught in school. Democrats narrowly held on to the governorship in New Jersey, a party stronghold.
In Minneapolis a ballot measure to replace the police force with a Department of Public Safety was easily defeated. The proposal, in a city still traumatised by the murder of George Floyd, would have required the city to treat crime as a public-health problem.

1770,"LEBANON IS “days away” from a “social explosion”. So said Hassan Diab, the acting prime minister, on July 6th. The country has been mired in a crisis that has seen the value of the local currency plummet and left much of the population short of food, fuel and medicine. “I am calling on kings, princes, presidents and leaders of our friendly countries, and I am calling on the United Nations and all international organisations…to help rescue Lebanon from its demise,” Mr Diab told a group of foreign diplomats.
But foreign leaders are not listening. Most do not trust Lebanon’s politicians. Mr Diab has been serving in a caretaker role since a devastating explosion at Beirut’s port last August (the result of government neglect). For nearly a year the country’s politicians, divided by sect and notoriously corrupt, have failed to agree on a new government—and failed to make reforms called for by foreign leaders.

Even when parliament appears to do something right, there are doubts over its intentions. Take its recently passed plan to replace unaffordable subsidies for food, fuel and medicine with a $556m programme of cash aid for the poor. In a sense it was following the recommendation of the World Bank, which predicted in December that Lebanon’s central bank (the Banque du Liban, or BdL) would soon lack the reserves needed to support the subsidy scheme. (The scheme had the BdL selling dollars to importers of the covered goods at below-market rates.) The World Bank was right and the BdL has been removing or cutting subsidies this year.
The old system could have been better targeted, as rich Lebanese consumed more of the subsidised goods than the poor. But the new system, yet to be implemented, is opaque. It is not clear who is eligible for the aid. Regardless, few people think Lebanon’s politicians will distribute it fairly. They have a history of doling out government largesse to their relatives and supporters (an election is scheduled for next year). Contracts go to the connected, leading to unreliable services. It is fitting that sweaty legislators passed the cash-aid programme in an assembly without working air-conditioning, the result of a decrepit and poorly managed power grid.
How the cash-aid programme will be funded is also an open question. The central bank could pay for it, but it is running low on reserves and printing more pounds would increase inflation, which is already sky-high. Outside funding may be an option. Lebanon could, for example, use aid that the IMF is giving to poor countries in order to help with covid-related economic slowdowns. The money is expected to be delivered by the autumn. Some officials want to reallocate loans already given by the World Bank for other purposes.
The World Bank probably would not mind if more of its money actually went to directly helping the poor. But it is running short of patience with the government. In January the bank agreed to lend Lebanon $246m to expand the social safety-net, including cash transfers for the poor. Feeding more money into that programme would be an option—if the government ever implemented it. It has been stalled for months because of a disagreement between the World Bank and Lebanese politicians over who gets the aid and how it is disbursed. In short, the politicians do not like the idea of World Bank oversight.
In the coming weeks the government is supposed to present a detailed plan on the funding and implementation of the new aid programme. But the Lebanese people are not holding their breath. Poverty is rising, basic services are failing and politicians appear more concerned with protecting the patronage system that contributed to the crisis. Is it any wonder that Mr Diab’s pleas have fallen on deaf ears? ■",2
1771,"AN OLD JOKE about nuclear fusion—that it is 30 years away and always will be—is so well-known that The Economist’s science editor forbids correspondents from repeating it. No one doubts sustained fusion is possible in principle. It powers every star in the universe. Making it work on Earth, though, has proved harder. Engineers have tried since the 1950s, so far without success. The latest and largest attempt—ITER, a multinational test reactor in southern France—has been under construction for 11 years and is tens of billions of dollars over its initial, $6bn budget.
But that record does not dismay a growing group of “alternative fusion” enthusiasts. Through a combination of new technology and entrepreneurial derring-do they hope to beat ITER to the punch. On June 17th one of their number, a Canadian firm called General Fusion, put its investors’ money where its mouth is. It said it would build a demonstration reactor, 70% the size of a full-blown commercial one, at Culham, the site of the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, Britain’s national fusion-research laboratory. Like ITER, it hopes its reactor will be up and running by 2025.

Power play
On paper at least, fusion is attractive. Existing nuclear plants rely on fission—the splitting of heavy atoms, usually of uranium, into lighter ones. The energy thus liberated is used to boil water into steam, which then turns turbines that make electricity. Fusion plants attempt to do the opposite, generating heat by combining light atoms to make heavier ones.

Unlike coal or natural gas, fusion would produce no planet-heating carbon dioxide. Unlike solar panels and wind turbines, fusion plants could operate in any weather. Unlike fission plants, they pose no risk of spreading nuclear-weapons technology, and should generate much less radioactive waste. They offer safety, too. “I like to say that fission is easy to start and hard to stop,” says Christofer Mowry, General Fusion’s boss. “Fusion is the opposite.”
Fusion is hard to start because it requires extreme conditions. Most Earthly fusion reactors aim to combine deuterium with tritium. (Both are isotopes of hydrogen, in which the single proton in that element's nucleus is joined by either one or two neutrons.) Protons have a positive electrical charge, and like charges repel. Persuading two atoms to join forces therefore means overcoming this repulsion. And that requires a great deal of energy.
General Fusion’s idea is to forge a middle path between two existing approaches, magnetic-confinement fusion (MCF) and inertial-confinement fusion (ICF), with less need for heroic engineering than either. ITER is a doughnut-shaped type of MCF reactor called a tokamak. It is intended to use carefully controlled, high-intensity magnetic fields to heat a hydrogen plasma to hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius, and then hold that plasma stable while its atoms combine. The trick is to control the fields precisely enough to keep the super-hot plasma together for long enough to allow a significant amount of fusion to happen. The present record, held by an experimental reactor in France, is six-and-a-half minutes. ITER’s goal is a reaction that lasts up to ten minutes.
ICF forgoes finicky magnetic fields in favour of super-powerful lasers. Experiments like the National Ignition Facility, in California, use carefully timed pulses to smash fuel pellets from all sides, heating them to temperatures similar to those in MCF plants, but also compressing them by the application of billions of atmospheres of pressure. Thanks to this crushing pressure, fusion happens much more quickly. The hope is that, one day, a useful amount of energy can be produced and harvested in the tiny fraction of a second before the zapped pellet blows itself apart. Once again, though, properly controlling the lasers and ensuring that the pellet is evenly compressed has proved tricky.
General Fusion calls its own approach “magnetised target fusion”. The basic concept dates back to the 1960s. The firm’s reactor, says Mr Mowry, does away with magnetic confinement by using powerful electric pulses to create self-stabilising blobs of plasma that are injected into the reactor’s core. He compares this to blowing a smoke ring, in which the air currents within the ring allow it to maintain its shape for a few seconds before it dissipates.
The puffs of plasma actually last around 20 milliseconds. That would not be long enough to extract much energy were they to be injected into an MCF reactor. But it is long enough for them to be compressed, as in an ICF machine—and by something far less exotic than banks of advanced lasers. The core of General Fusion's British reactor will be lined with molten lithium and lead. Once a puff of plasma has been injected, ranks of gas-driven pistons will compress the core, changing it from a cylinder to a sphere and drastically boosting the fusion rate (see diagram).

But while laser compression happens in mere billionths of a second, General Fusion's takes thousandths—comparable with the timescales on which internal-combustion engines operate, and well within the capabilities of digital electronics to fine-tune. The upshot, the firm hopes, is a reactor which should be cheaper and simpler to build and operate than either an MCF or ICF machine.
Critical mass
Besides compressing the plasma, the liquid-metal jacket serves to capture the energy from the reaction. Heated metal will be piped to a heat exchanger and used to raise steam. Neutrons from the fusion reaction, meanwhile, will transform some of the lithium into more tritium fuel, which would otherwise be rare and expensive. Or at least, it will one day. General Fusion's demonstration reactor will only fuse deuterium with deuterium, to keep things simple.
Still, the firm hopes that a full-fledged commercial reactor—which might be built in the early 2030s—could compete with other forms of electricity. It is aiming at a cost of $50 per megawatt-hour, which Mr Mowry says ought to make it competitive with coal. Renewable energy may prove cheaper, he concedes, but it is hampered by intermittency. And the plant will have one more advantage over existing, fission plants, the electricity production of which cannot quickly be raised or lowered. General Fusion’s reactor can increase or decrease power output ten-fold by changing the speed at which the core cycles. That should allow it to “load-follow”, ramping up production when electricity prices are high and cutting back when they are low.
And General Fusion is not the only firm pursuing commercial fusion. On April 8th TAE Technologies, a rival based in California, which was founded in 1998, said it had raised $280m for a demonstration reactor of its own, bringing the total invested in the firm to $1.1bn (see chart). Like General Fusion, TAE relies on puffs of self-stabilising plasma. Unlike General Fusion, it aims to produce electricity by combining hydrogen with boron, a process that needs temperatures of billions of degrees, but which should require less radiation shielding.

General Fusion’s other rivals include two British firms, First Light Fusion and Tokamak Energy, both based near Culham, and a pair of American ones, Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Zap Energy. Nor are governments putting all their eggs in the ITER basket. The Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, a German government agency, is trying to build a power station based on a device called a “stellarator”—a twist on the MCF approach. Its Wendelstein-7X device began working in 2015. And the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy’s STEP reactor, scheduled to open in 2040, is intended to demonstrate the commercial practicality of fusion. One reason General Fusion chose Culham, says Stephen Dean, who runs Fusion Power Associates, a research and education foundation which covers the field, is that this lab has a focus on getting to market quickly.
For his part, Dr Dean sees no fundamental reason why one or more of the current crop of contenders should not succeed in building a reactor that generates useful quantities of energy. But it is economics, not physics, that will have the final word. High-tech fusion reactors, assuming they are ever built, will have to compete in a world in which the price of solar and wind power is falling steadily. Fossil-fuel companies, meanwhile, are trying to work out how to capture and bury the carbon dioxide emitted from their power stations. Advanced fission reactors are attracting private interest of their own—on June 2nd TerraPower, a firm backed by Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, announced plans for a high-tech nuclear plant in Wyoming. All that competition is good news in a warming world. But it promises a white-knuckle ride for investors. ■

1772,"BY DAY MR WEI sold pancakes in Shaanxi, a northern province. By night he led a gang of grave robbers who tunnelled under an ancient temple near his shop. It took 11 months for them to reach the treasures buried beneath, which included gold statues of the Buddha and the bones of illustrious monks. Mr Wei and his cronies went on to dig several more passages from restaurants that they opened in the vicinity of shrines and pagodas. Over five years the looting earned them 12m yuan ($1.8m). Last year Mr Wei was sentenced to 15 years in prison. It was the second time that tomb raiding had landed him behind bars.
China is redoubling efforts to catch grave robbers. Last year authorities arrested 2,400 such thieves and retrieved over 31,000 lost or stolen items, almost three times the number reclaimed during the previous year. The government agency responsible for protecting relics says it is in the midst of a 12-month crackdown on tomb raiders that involves more investment in staff and equipment. Punishments are growing more severe. In 2017 a man convicted of leading a gang of 200 grave robbers was put to death.

Looting antiquities remains an alluring business, nonetheless. Some 90% of all the major tombs of which the whereabouts is known have been plundered at one time or other, says Ni Fangliu, an independent scholar. Sites in Shaanxi province—home to the world-famous terracotta army, among other ancient stuff—have been a target for centuries. But thieves are fanning out to new areas, including Xinjiang in north-western China and Inner Mongolia, in the north-east (a looted tomb in Henan province is pictured).
The robbers are increasingly professional and often well-connected. Some are backed by investors who cover travel expenses and stump up for tools. On one visit to north-eastern China, Mr Ni was approached by a thief trying to raise funds to buy an excavator. He turned out to be the brother of a senior policeman. Rummaging around for shiny stuff is not the only way they make grave robbery pay. Criminals have been known to snatch bodies or funeral urns, then ask living relatives to pay ransom.
Taboos around disturbing old graves are fading, a little. These were once so strong that even archaeologists shied from opening tombs, and some still set off firecrackers before digs to repel ghosts. But in 2006 two popular fantasy novels, “Grave Robbers’ Chronicles” and “Ghost Blows Out the Light”, made it look fun. Grave robbers’ picaresque adventures soon became the subject of films and television shows. That makes some officials queasy. In 2016 a Communist Party mouthpiece urged people not to “glamorise the grave robber” because “digging up ancestral tombs has always been a wicked practice”.
The craze has had the benefit of strengthening public interest in archaeology. In March the state broadcaster live-streamed a dig that has unearthed 3,000-year-old relics from Sanxingdui, an ancient site in Sichuan province. Millions tuned in. Yang Ying, a 25-year-old history buff milling around the Sanxingdui museum, credits “Grave Robbers’ Chronicles” for nurturing her interest in relics. But “lock up the thieves,” she says. ■",2
1773,"STANDING AT ABOUT five-foot-four, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Nigeria’s northern state of Kaduna, says he models himself on Deng Xiaoping, who put China on a path to growth after the misery of rule by Mao Zedong. Mr El-Rufai sees a new path for Kaduna and, some say, for Nigeria itself.
Mr El-Rufai prizes education: he has a law degree from London, a master’s in public administration from Harvard and is writing a doctorate at Maastricht university. He is usually addressed by the title “Mallam”, out of respect for his erudition, particularly in Koranic studies. So it may seem odd that one of his early acts as governor was to fire almost 22,000 primary-school teachers. Yet he had cause. Those he booted out had failed a test designed for nine-year-olds. Some couldn’t complete a comprehension test. Others couldn’t name a rectangle. Mr El-Rufai has sacked thousands more workers. And he is not done.

With two years left of his second term, the governor is determined to balance the state’s budget by reducing the number of people working for the government. This is something of a rarity in Nigeria, where the governor of another state recently boasted he had hired 38,000 aides, ostensibly to reduce poverty, arguing it was better to spend money on employing people than to invest in roads or ports.
When Nigeria locked down last year to slow the spread of covid-19, it quickly became clear that Kaduna’s administration was not noticeably worse with most of the state’s employees not working than when they were supposedly toiling in the service of taxpayers. Since then Mr El-Rufai has proposed to sack a further 7,000 government workers.
His latest move has provoked the trade unions, whose members went on strike under banners reading “Hell-Rufai”. Once seen as a liberal, he now has a reputation as a harsh disciplinarian. Yet the governor is undaunted. He has dared disgruntled workers to challenge him in court.
Though his means may be unpopular and his critics accuse him of riding roughshod over opponents, his case for streamlining the civil service is strong. Of the 50bn naira ($121m) that Kaduna will receive this year from the federal government (its main source of funds), it will spend about 80% on staff salaries. This is an improvement on last year, when personnel costs outstripped the federal allocation.
Mr El-Rufai argues that unless he can slim the payroll, he will not have the cash to invest in good things like hospitals and bridges. It could also free up funds to fight insecurity, a persistent scourge in Nigeria’s northern states, bedevilled by gangs of kidnappers and by fighting between crop farmers and cattle herders. Sectarian tension in the north between the Muslim majority and the Christian minority is another frequent source of violence. Since Mr El-Rufai was elected governor in 2015 the number of ethnic clashes has fallen.
The governor, who is thought to have presidential ambitions, has had little support for his reforms from the federal government or ruling party, of which he is a member. Yet he is pushing on regardless. He believes that just like Deng, who revoked many of Mao’s stifling economic policies, he may have to defy his party in order to force through his plans.
But Mr El-Rufai would do well to remember that he must worry about more than just his party. Unlike leaders of China, who can lock up critics and never face voters, he operates in a raucous democracy. In June his party lost a by-election in Kaduna, perhaps an early sign of a backlash against his policies. If he does not keep an eye on his dwindling popularity, he may soon have little chance to reform anything. ■",2
1774," (CNN)A report detailing the findings of an impeachment investigation into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to be released to the public in the coming days, according to three members of the New York State Assembly Judiciary Committee.Members on Thursday and Friday reviewed the 45-page report detailing findings from the independent investigation into allegations against the Democratic former governor launched more than eight months ago. The report addresses topics including the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo, discrepancies in reported deaths in nursing homes from Covid-19, Cuomo's pandemic leadership book deal, claims of the executive chamber's hostile work environment, and Cuomo's level of cooperation with the committee investigators, according to one of the members, Michael Montesano, who spoke with CNN.Montesano, a Republican from Long Island, said the report doesn't read positively for Cuomo, calling it thorough and fact-driven with evidence too strong for the former governor to deny. Investigators draw definitive conclusions in the report that are ""fair and adequate,"" Montesano told CNN. ""It's very fact-driven, OK, and we don't make up the facts. They are what they are,"" Montesano said. ""You'll see the level of detail and again, in my opinion, and what we have to back it up and that's not political, that's fact-driven."" The former governor's legal counsel asked the Assembly committee to allow them a preview of the evidence and report draft, which they have not received.""The Assembly Judiciary Committee has chosen not to review their findings with us which is their prerogative, but it may once again result in a one-sided report,"" Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said in a statement Friday.  Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Lavine declined to comment to CNN on whether the committee would accommodate the Cuomo team's request. The report's release will come more than five months after State Attorney General Letitia James announced that her office's investigation into Cuomo found he had sexually harassed 11 women. The former governor, who resigned shortly after James' report was released, has repeatedly denied all of the allegations, saying he never touched anyone inappropriately, but acknowledged that some of his behavior made others uncomfortable.Montesano told CNN that ""the evidence against (Cuomo) was so overwhelming that he can't step away from what it is,"" particularly regarding staffer Brittany Commisso's previously reported sexual misconduct allegations and those of a state trooper on Cuomo's protective detail first identified in James' report. Committee member Phil Steck, a Democrat, similarly told CNN on Friday that the independent report ""strongly corroborated"" and provided additional evidence that supported the attorney general's findings.Steck added that the report makes clear the former governor ""used his office for the purpose of writing a book to benefit himself."" CNN has previously reported that Cuomo was expected to receive more than $5 million from his book ""American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,"" which was published in October 2020. Cuomo donated $500,000 from his book deal to the United Way of New York State for pandemic relief and vaccination efforts and put the remainder in a trust for his three daughters, Azzopardi previously said in a statement to CNN.""On the issue of the book deal, it's pretty clear that the governor was utilizing the executive chamber as a vehicle for writing a book for his own personal benefit,"" Steck said. In the statement Friday, Azzopardi said: ""State employees volunteered to assist the governor with his book American Crisis and now the Assembly apparently wants to criticize them.""Steck also said the report draws inferences between the timing of the book release and the discrepancy in fatality data as it related to Covid-19 in nursing homes at the time, a much-debated subject earlier this year when James' office published a preliminary report that found the New York State Department of Health ""undercounted"" the Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents. ""Preliminary data obtained by OAG suggests that many nursing home residents died from COVID-19 in hospitals after being transferred from their nursing homes, which is not reflected in DOH's published total nursing home death data,"" a statement from James' office said.""I think you can certainly infer the political motive. ... In the governor's book, there's a chapter on the nursing home, so they were trying to preserve the validity of their claims in the book by distorting the facts regarding nursing home deaths,"" Steck said.  Committee members reviewed the report in a secure location with the sergeant-at-arms and staff present. Phones were not permitted in the room and members could not take a copy with them, according to Steck and Montesano.Attorneys from Davis Polk & Wardwell were appointed independent investigators when the Assembly Judiciary Committee launched the impeachment investigation into the then-governor in March.The investigation was suspended in August when Cuomo resigned, but Assembly leadership opted to allow the investigators to publish a report of their findings for the public.

1775,"FINALLY THE rumours are true. For years Algerians whispered about the health of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, their president from 1999 to 2019. After suffering a stroke in 2013 he was rarely seen in public, often leading to speculation that he was dead. When the whispers grew too loud, officials would roll him out in his wheelchair to sit before the cameras, a vacant look in his eyes. The people wondered who was really in charge. By 2019 they had had enough of the charade and toppled the old man.
Mr Bouteflika died on September 17th, aged 84. The young people who make up most of Algeria’s population will probably remember him as that decrepit president—and lament that little has changed since his ousting. It is telling that the government buried him at a cemetery for independence fighters, with few of the honours accorded to past leaders.

Older Algerians may remember Mr Bouteflika more fondly. He was barely an adult when he joined the National Liberation Army in the war against French rule. A year after independence in 1962, he became Algeria’s first foreign minister, still in his mid-20s. He would hold the position for 16 years. Witty and dashing in his three-piece suits, Mr Bouteflika helped establish the country as an influential member of the Non-Aligned Movement and a beacon of the anti-colonial struggle, earning it the nickname “the Mecca of revolutionaries”.
Che Guevara visited Algeria hoping to stir revolutions in Africa. A young Nelson Mandela received military training from Algerian soldiers. Mr Bouteflika, in the role of president of the UN General Assembly, invited Yasser Arafat to address the body in 1974, a historic moment for the Palestinian cause. When Carlos the Jackal took oil ministers hostage in an attack on OPEC headquarters in Vienna in 1975, the terrorist demanded to be flown to Algiers. Mr Bouteflika met him and negotiated the release of some of the hostages.
Passed over for the presidency in 1979, Mr Bouteflika left Algeria to avoid corruption charges (which were eventually dropped). He returned but kept a low profile during Algeria’s civil war in the 1990s, when some 200,000 people were killed in fighting between Islamists and the army. In 1999 the ruling cabal of generals and security men, known as le pouvoir (the power), turned to him. Five months after winning a rigged presidential election, Mr Bouteflika pushed through a referendum on national reconciliation that granted amnesty to Islamists and militia members. Criticism of the army’s conduct was prohibited. Many credit him for guiding Algeria out of its “black decade”.
The regime would invoke the civil war and the need for stability whenever it wanted to justify its repression. Unfair elections were held—Mr Bouteflika won four of them. Le pouvoir siphoned off the country’s vast hydrocarbon wealth, while the young struggled to find jobs. The public’s frustration had been growing for years when the regime announced in 2019 that Mr Bouteflika would seek a fifth term. Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets, chanting “Bye-bye, Bouteflika”. Finally the regime gave in. Slumped in his wheelchair, the president passed his letter of resignation to a colleague. It was the last time most of the public would see him.
Yet any hope that Mr Bouteflika’s resignation would bring real change has dimmed. The army remains the dominant power in Algeria. Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a former prime minister seen as the generals’ choice, was elected president in 2019. The poll was shunned by most Algerians. Meanwhile, the number of political prisoners is thought to be rising. The government has tried to sow discord in the pro-democracy movement, known as the Hirak. It blames opposition groups and Morocco, with which it recently cut diplomatic ties, for fomenting unrest.
Sometimes the government still uses Mr Bouteflika, but now as a scapegoat. Covid-19 has taken a toll and the economy continues to stall. With few answers, officials also point to the villainy of France or other foreign conspirators. Most Algerians, born after independence, are unmoved by these tired anti-colonial narratives. They wish Mr Bouteflika’s regime would expire with him. ■",2
1776,"“THE WORLD wants you to be typical …Don’t let it happen,” Jeff Bezos warned in April in his last annual shareholder letter as CEO of Amazon. Hence bewilderment that his e-empire is to adopt a retail format that is very typical indeed: the department store. Having helped drive many chains out of business, it is now eyeing the format to boost its own retail fortunes.
As a company, Amazon is entering a more mature phase. Now with a new chief executive, Andy Jassy, it is being forced to recognise that pure e-commerce has limits. It is also facing fresh competition from conventional retailers like Walmart and Target that are belatedly showing that they, too, can do the internet well.

Amazon’s high-street presence is small. Since 2015 it has opened 24 bookshops in America. Its 30 “4-star” shops, which stock items customers rate highly, function like a walk-in website. Whole Foods, an upmarket grocer it bought in 2017, contributes the bulk of its physical-store revenues, which accounted for just 4% of Amazon’s total sales in the most recent quarter. Its new Amazon Fresh grocery chain and Amazon Go cashierless stores barely chip in.
So the new 30,000-square-foot (2,800-square-metre) retail spaces it is reportedly envisaging mark a departure. Amazon has neither confirmed nor denied its plans. But leaked details on the stores’ size and locations suggest substance behind the reports. The first are to open in California and Ohio. If they go well, Amazon is expected to roll out more.
Why invest in the high street just as covid-19 has lifted e-commerce? The growth rate of sales on Amazon’s platforms, including third parties, had slowed before the crisis, from nearly 30% a year to below 20%. The trend reasserts itself as people return to shops. In the past quarter Amazon’s own online sales grew by only 16%, short of investors’ (muted) expectations.
In future customers will want “omnichannel” retail that combines online and physical shopping, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a broker. As for Amazon’s move into department stores, he has one question: “What took them so long?” The firm’s motive is also defensive. Walmart has made omnichannel work well during the pandemic by melding its formidable physical network with its website and offering a same-day “click-and-collect” service.
Getting more physical may not be easy. Amazon’s bricks-and-mortar performance has been ho-hum. Whereas most other big American grocers’ sales have doubled or even tripled in the pandemic, those of Whole Foods have barely budged, notes Sucharita Kodali of Forrester, a research firm. Amazon’s total physical-store revenues last year were 6% lower than in 2018.
Making Amazonmarts appeal to shoppers may be harder than Amazon anticipates. It reportedly wants them to sell its cheap private-label garments and gadgets, which is at odds with its aspirations for the stores to offer high-end fashion, where it has struggled online. It is unclear if the outlets will mimic existing examples of the department-store canon, as Amazon Fresh shops resemble conventional grocers, or if Amazon plans to shake things up.
Another question is how the move will affect returns for shareholders. Amazon should be able to rent or buy locations cheaply—bankruptcies have left many department-store properties up for grabs. Yet investors may be disappointed that Amazon will devote ever more resources to retail. Many prefer its faster-growing, vastly more profitable and techier businesses: digital ads and cloud computing. “Why tackle a dying industry?” asks Ms Kodali, suggesting that Amazon could have another crack at making smartphones.
Amazon’s share price is down by 8% since its latest results. As well as posting slower online sales for the second quarter it forecast slowing total sales in the next. It also warned that costs will rise sharply in the future as it ramps up investing. Physical retail would claim some of the dosh. The irony would not be lost on Sears and other defunct department stores. ■

1777,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",3
1778,"AS BIRTHDAY PRESENTS go, a 435km railway line that is expected to open this month in Tibet will be among the most lavish. To seekers of high-altitude thrills, it is one that will be cherished. The 37bn-yuan ($5.7bn) track extends from the region’s capital Lhasa eastward to the city of Nyingchi, which is Tibetan for “Throne of the Sun”. It is the region’s first electrified railway; its trains will be Tibet’s fastest. Officials call it a gift for the Communist Party’s 100th birthday, which will be officially celebrated on July 1st.
But the new line is only part of what China calls the “project of the century”. This involves building Tibet’s second rail link with China’s interior at a total cost that state media say could be about ten times that of the Lhasa-Nyingchi stretch, with even greater engineering challenges yet to come. The section about to open was no pushover. Tunnels comprise nearly half of its length. Workers had to brave landslides, poisonous gas from broken rock, intense cold as well as an oxygen-starved atmosphere at more than 5,000 metres above sea level—roughly the altitude of Mount Everest’s base camps. When completed in 2030, the railway will connect Lhasa with Chengdu, the capital of neighbouring Sichuan province. At a maximum speed of 160kph, the journey will take just 12 hours, a third of the time now required by road.

To the party, it appears no expense is too great in its campaign to integrate the vast, isolated region more closely with the interior. The first rail link, which opened in 2006, was also an engineering feat. Long lengths of that line from Qinghai province had to be laid over permafrost, using high-tech means to prevent temperature fluctuations from damaging the track.

The most obvious impact has been on tourism. In 2005 Tibet received fewer than 2m visits by tourists. By 2018 the number had soared to 33m trips (only 0.7% of them by foreigners). The government is aiming for 61m by 2025—about 17 times the number of Tibet’s inhabitants. Some Tibetans worry their culture is being swamped. An influx of Han Chinese migrants, including shopkeepers and others cashing in on the tourism boom, may have fuelled ethnic tensions that caused an explosion of unrest in Lhasa and elsewhere across the Tibet plateau in 2008. Since then the government has clamped down even harder on dissent in the region.
Strategic thinkers in India worry, too. The new railway runs close to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Chinese officials sometimes refer to as “south Tibet” and claim as Chinese territory. China’s army swept into it during a brief but bloody border war in 1962, before pulling back again. India is annoyed enough by China’s other big infrastructure project in the area: the damming of the Yarlung Tsangpo river (as it calls the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra), which the new railway crosses 16 times. It accuses China of threatening India’s water security. There is little India can do. China is telling it “you are not in my league,” says Ashok Swain of Uppsala University. The trains will keep on running regardless of any complaints. ■",2
1779,"IN 2013 MEREDITH HALKS MILLER, a laboratory director at Illumina, the world’s biggest gene-sequencing firm, spotted something odd as she examined the blood of expectant mothers, looking for abnormalities in the fetuses they carried. In some cases, the DNA of the unborn children was normal, but that of the mothers was not. Suspecting the women had cancer, she went to her superiors, only to be met with scepticism. She pushed nonetheless. “I was determined to bring this to light. As a doctor, I really wanted to help these women,” she says. Her intuition proved right. “Sure enough, every person I predicted had cancer had cancer.”
Her hunch led to the foundation of GRAIL, a pioneering company focused on detecting cancers using blood tests even before any symptoms have emerged. Illumina spun it out in 2016 (tech tycoons such as Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates were early backers), only to repurchase it again in a $7bn deal last month, shortly after GRAIL released a test in America that screens for up to 50 cancers from a sample of blood. And yet until a recent blog post by her daughter, noting how infrequently female scientists get credit for their work, Dr Halks Miller’s role was mostly airbrushed out of GRAIL’s story. When contacted by your columnist, she says she received no extra bonus or promotion for her efforts. Even today, Francis deSouza, Illumina’s CEO, refers to her simply as Meredith, and when asked about her says only that she has retired.

Nonetheless, her brainchild is now firmly in the spotlight. GRAIL’s return to Illumina is intriguing for three reasons. First, in acquiring it, Illumina, described by its biggest investor, Baillie Gifford, a Scottish asset manager, as the “Google of genomics”, hopes to become a colossus of cancer care. In short, it wants to make screening the new search. Second, like Google, Illumina faces a showdown with trustbusters in America and Europe, irked by how similar early-stage acquisitions gave rise to today’s tech giants. Third, Illumina has defiantly gone ahead with the transaction before regulators have given it the green light. The battle pits an acquisitive company on the technological frontier against trustbusters keen to rewrite the rules of tech competition.
There is no question that Illumina, worth $73bn, rules the world of gene-sequencing. Its machines control 90% of the market in America. Its vast global share is reflected in the fact that Chinese scientists used it for the first sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome at the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Using technology acquired with the purchase in 2007 of Solexa, a British company, it provides gene-sequencing tools to genomics companies, including those developing liquid biopsies or blood tests for cancer. Mr deSouza reckons that the global market for cancer gene-sequencing could be worth $75bn by 2035. That looks promising for a gene-sequencing provider. Even more so if GRAIL can change the efficacy and economics of cancer care. Mr deSouza argues that Illumina’s global heft and ability to convince insurers to cover the cost of genomic testing will help GRAIL do that. Far from stifling competition, the takeover will stimulate it, he says. Money is pouring into startups trying to catch up with GRAIL.
The trustbusters see things differently. Last year the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), America’s antitrust agency, blocked Illumina’s acquisition of another sequencer, Pacific Biosciences, on the grounds that it would be anticompetitive. Now the FTC says that Illumina’s takeover of GRAIL will harm innovation in the nascent market for early detection of cancer. The European Commission (EC) has launched a parallel investigation, alleging Illumina could restrict GRAIL’s rivals from accessing its gene-sequencing technology. On August 18th Illumina defied the Europeans, saying that because an EC decision was not expected until after the deal expires, it would complete the transaction anyway—albeit holding GRAIL separately. It is challenging the EC in a Luxembourg court, claiming that the EU’s executive arm does not have jurisdiction over the merger. Moreover, the commission has contested the deal using an untested and controversial mechanism called Article 22. Illumina’s strategy is a bold one—some would say reckless. Its share price has slumped since the closing of the deal partly because investors fear it may stir up a regulatory hornets’ nest.
The antitrust concerns can be viewed narrowly or broadly. From a narrow perspective, customers of Illumina who hope to compete with GRAIL in testing may worry that Illumina will charge them higher prices for sequencers. That could give GRAIL, if it has lower sequencing costs, an edge. Illumina counters that it has no incentive to harm its clients, because it makes much more money selling sequencers than it does selling tests. It has also pledged to supply sequencers to them on the same terms as it does to GRAIL. More broadly, even if Illumina continues to lower the cost of gene-sequencing, the regulators’ focus on non-cost factors such as innovation may reflect a new approach to antitrust that goes beyond the duty to protect consumers’ pocketbooks. In a case of bad timing, or bad luck, Illumina has thrown down the gauntlet to the trustbusters just as they are determined to show they will not be doormats. It will be up to the courts to decide the outcome.
Stick to your guns
Regulators are not the only concerned parties. According to Doug Schenkel of Cowen, an investment bank, some Illumina shareholders say that uncertainty about the outlook for the GRAIL acquisition and the implication that there could be increased risk to the company’s position as an “arms dealer” to the genomics industry are weighing on shares. So are concerns about whether Illumina is the best option for bringing GRAIL’s blood-based diagnostics to market. Some fear it could be the latest example of a hardware firm that bungles the move into software and services. That said, it is a long-term bet and Dr Halks Miller, for one, is excited. She says GRAIL’s new test is “incredibly powerful”. She relishes its success and has no regrets—even if she reaps few of the rewards. ■

1780,"AS THE DELTA variant of covid-19 continues to spread across large parts of the world, the shame is that vaccines are still in such short supply. Worse, they are being hogged by rich countries even though the need elsewhere is so great. For that, blame politics. The triumph, however, is that vaccines exist at all. And for that, praise science.
The sequence of the virus’s genome was made public on January 11th 2020, just one month after a new respiratory illness was first reported in Wuhan, in China. Days later, on January 15th, Moderna, working with America’s National Institutes of Health, had completed the design of the prototype molecule that would comprise its vaccine. Sixty-two days after that, on March 16th, human trials began. Maggie Keenan, a 91-year-old Briton, received the first clinical Pfizer vaccine on December 8th. By comparison, the vaccine against polio in America took 20 years to make the journey from trials to licence.

And yet scientists could do even better. By the beginning of 2021, according to our statistical model of excess deaths, the pandemic had claimed between 4m and 8m lives. If mass vaccination had got under way even a bit sooner and scaled up just a little more quickly, hundreds of thousands of people could have been saved. That is a goal worth striving for in the next pandemic—and, recent research suggests, it is entirely possible.
The foundation for this is decades of scientific and medical research. Katalin Karikó, one of the pioneers of the mRNA technology that underpins the two most successful vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna, spent 30 years studying how mRNA can help fight disease. Her research was often too radical to attract government grants or institutional support. But it is part of a body of work that vastly enlarges the scope to cope with infectious diseases, including those that are new.
As we explain this week, the pandemic has seen a new set of biochemical and computational tools come to the fore in predicting the evolution of viruses. One approach is called “deep mutational scanning”, which observes random changes in a pathogen’s crucial proteins under laboratory conditions. Using machine learning, scientists can form predictions about which combinations of these mutations will, for instance, make the disease spread faster and hence come to dominate a pandemic in much the way that Delta is dominating covid-19.
Armed with these predictions, manufacturers could prepare stockpiles of vaccines and therapies before pathogens have mutated and spread. One day, people could even be vaccinated pre-emptively. Such a degree of preparedness, and the rapid deployment of doses that it will make possible, could save many lives.
The same faster-is-better logic also applies to other areas of pandemic response. Testing and contact-tracing ought to be available as soon as the first signs emerge that a pathogen is going global. The pandemic has shown that large centralised testing facilities, while they are quick to get up and running from scratch, have slower turnaround times than smaller, more local facilities which can process samples on site.
Such facilities ought to be ready for the next pandemic, relying on rapid, purpose-built genetic testing that has only just started to come online in airports around the world. By the time the next pathogen arrives, the same technology which allows the covid-19 testing centre in Berlin’s new Brandenburg airport to turn around a sample in less than an hour should be widely available.
Regulators must also play their part. Health authorities are already grappling with the modular nature of the new vaccine-production systems, streamlining their approval processes so that shots may be updated to confer protection against the coronavirus variants. The new vaccine “platforms” can churn out one vaccine as easily as another, with only minor changes. The authorities should start thinking about how to ensure the safety of platform-produced vaccines against entirely new pathogens without having to start the approval process from scratch each time.
There is no knowing when the next pandemic will come. New pathogens are emerging from complex, unpredictable environments all the time, often far from scrutiny or regulatory control. A fresh disease could be about to take off right now, as a freak bacterium escapes from an antibiotic-abusing factory farm, say, or a mutated virus sweeps out of a laboratory or a forest, as a bat passes it on to a new host which can infect humans. You cannot stop all pandemics, but you can prepare for them better. ■

1781,"Kyle Rittenhouse is now a free man, but he's far from leaving the spotlight.
Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson revealed Friday that there was a Fox Nation crew filming for a Tucker Carlson Original documentary that will appear on the streaming platform in December. He will also sit down with Rittenhouse this Monday during Fox News Channel primetime for the young man's first televised interview following his not guilty verdict.
But Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, told CNN he 'did not approve of that,' referring to the film crew being with Rittenhouse during the trial, and even 'threw them out of the room several times.' 
'I don't think a film crew is appropriate for something like this, but the people who were raising the money to pay for the experts and to pay for the attorneys were trying to raise money and that was part of it, so I think, I don't want to say an evil but a definite distraction was part of it,' he told Chris Cuomo Friday. 'I didn't approve of it but I'm not always the boss.'
Rittenhouse, 18, was found not guilty Friday of all charges against him after a highly publicized, contentious trial that has split the nation. He smiled in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse after being declared not guilty, later commenting that 'self-defense is not illegal.'
Tucker himself referred to the verdict Friday as 'a wonderful moment,' praising the jury and insisting 'all of us should be celebrating.' 
The film crew and upcoming documentary raise questions about just what influence Carlson - one of the nation's most-watched cable news hosts and highly influential conservative commentator - had on Rittenhouse in the lead-up to and during the trial, and whether or not Rittenhouse was or will be paid for the documentary. 
Scroll down for video 
'It's the stuff that keeps you up at night, like... once you finally do get to sleep, your dreams are about what happened and you're waking up in a dark, cold sweat,' Rittenhouse begins in the trailer for the Fox Nation documentary that was posted Friday mere hours after the verdict.
'You had dreams about what happened?' someone can be heard asking Rittenhouse.
'Every single night,' the teen says. '... I'm alive, but what would have happened, like what if I wasn't alive, or what if I did let Mr. [Joseph] Rosenbaum steal my gun?'
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. 
'Almost every outcome is either me getting seriously injured or hurt or dead,' Rittenhouse says in the trailer. 
'Those are just the dreams I have on a daily basis,' he adds, with the preview then cutting to footage of the verdict being read on Friday.  
The teen had collapsed in tears and hugged his attorney as the jury in his double murder trial acquitted him of all charges after four days of deliberation and weeks of testimony. The verdict came in at 12:15 p.m. Friday in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  
'The jury reached the correct verdict,' Rittenhouse told Fox News.
'Self-defense is not illegal. I am glad they reached the correct verdict.' 
He added: 'It's been a tough journey but we made it through. We made it through the hard part.'
The vindicated teen will sit down with Fox News Channel for his first TV interview on Monday at 8 p.m. ET, Carlson said. 
Part of the interview will air that evening, while the remaining portion will be included in Tucker Carlson Originals, the news network said.
Carlson has publicly sympathized with Rittenhouse in the past. 
'People in charge from the governor of Wisconsin on down refused to enforce the law,' he said in August 2020.
'They stood back and watched Kenosha burn. So are we really surprised this looting and arson accelerated to murder? How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?' 
Outside the court on Friday, Richards said his client was feeling a 'huge sense of relief' at the verdict.
'He is on his way home, he wants to get on with his life,' Richards said. 'He has to get on with his life the best he can.' 
The lawyer said he believed the Rittenhouse family would move out of the area because of the number of death threats they have received.
'Kyle is in counseling for PTSD. He doesn't sleep at night,' he said. 
'Eventually some anonymity will come back to him but I don't think he will continue to live in this area,' his lawyer continued.
'I think it's too dangerous,' Richards added. He explained that Rittenhouse has had security following him around the clock 'since this happened.' 
He said Rittenhouse and his team have received a 'scary' amount of death threats. 
Richards revealed that the defense team had two mock trials, one with Rittenhouse giving testimony and one without, and it was clear from the jury reaction that he had to go on the stand. 
He also said the jury deliberations were longer than any other case he had been involved in.
Now that Rittenhouse has been acquitted in the killings, his lawyer said the teen plans to become a nurse. 
Shortly before he traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, armed with an AR-15 - where he shot and killed two protesters on August 25, 2000 - Rittenhouse gave an interview to right-wing news outlet The Daily Caller. 
Armed with a rifle slung across his body, the teen told the outlet that he was a certified EMT and said he was patrolling the streets of Kenosha to provide medical attention to anyone in need and was helping protect local businesses from looters and rioters. 
'People are getting injured. Our job is to protect this business and part of my job is to also help people,' Rittenhouse said of his militia at the time.  
'If there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way,' added Rittenhouse, who was seen earlier guarding a local car shop with a group of armed militia members. 
'That's why I have my rifle because I can protect myself, obviously. I also have my med kit.'
He also claimed he had been 'de-escalating' a potentially violent situation earlier in the night, during which he and the rest of his vigilante crew ordered protesters to leave a church that they had targeted.  
After the trial, Rittenhouse's lawyer took out his anger on prosecutor Thomas Binger. 
'Justice is done when the truth is reached. Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth. It's not about winning,' Richards said.
But he praised Judge Bruce Schroeder, saying he had presided over a 'fair trial.'
'He gives you a fair trial as a defendant - but you don't want him to sentence your client,' he said, commenting on his reputation for handing out stiff sentences.
'If we had lost, we know what would happen, he would have gotten life in prison. We asked for a fair trial and we got one.'
He defended Schroeder's decision to allow Rittenhouse to pick the from a tumbler the jurors who would become alternates, saying the defense team was 'devastated' that three of the jurors they considered most on their side were barred from the final deliberations.
Binger had made it clear earlier in the week that he would not comment on the outcome of the case.
But his boss, Kenosha County District Attorney Mike Graveley, issued a statement saying: 'We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations.
'Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.'
Graveley added a plea for calm: 'We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.' 
The Rittenhouse shootings took place during 2020 summertime riots two days after Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot when police officers responded to a 'family trouble' around 5:15 p.m. August 23, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Kenosha was again on edge Friday as protesters from both sides milled about on the courthouse steps after the verdict. 
The verdict marks the explosive end of a trial that has been riddled with controversy and drama that had threatened to derail proceedings more than once. 
President Joe Biden said Friday that he stands by the jury's verdict - as Republicans renewed demands that he apologize for calling the Kenosha shooter a white supremacist in the wake of the shootings.
'I stand by with the jury as the jury system has concluded. The jury system works and you have to abide by it,' Biden told reporters Friday afternoon as he returned to the White House from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had a routine physical.
He said he 'just heard a moment ago' about the verdict, adding he 'didn't watch' the trial, which featured dramatic clashes between the prosecution and defense lawyers and testimony by the accused teen in an event that got gavel-to-gavel cable news coverage. 
Republican lawmakers and other officials are demanding that Biden apologize to Rittenhouse for linking him to white supremacists while campaigning for president. 
'Joe Biden needs to publicly apologize to Kyle Rittenhouse,' Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said in a statement immediately after the verdict.
Before he gained infamy, Rittenhouse was a hot-tempered student at Lakes Community High School, his former classmates said.
'When he got mad or offended he would always say he could ""f***me up,"" but everyone would just laugh because he was like a 5-foot-4 chubby freshman boy who we thought wasn't capable of harm,' a student told Vice right after the shooting in August 2020.
Other classmates told the outlet that Rittenhouse was fond of police, guns, former President Donald Trump and 'triggering the libs.' 
Rittenhouse was born January 3, 2000, to parents Wendy and Mike and grew up in a broken home after the couple split.
Wendy Rittenhouse, a single mom of three, struggled to make ends meet and the family was evicted numerous times, The New Yorker reported.
She filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and was hospitalized with a gastrointestinal bleed, prompting her son to find work as a fry cook and janitor to support the family financially, the outlet said.
When he was in ninth grade, the aspiring first responder joined an 'explorers program' at the Grayslake Police Department in Illinois, which the local police chief said was meant to 'teach self-discipline, responsibility and other appropriate life lessons to troubled teens,' the magazine reported.
He also enrolled in a cadet program at the Antioch Fire Department, with Chief Jon Cokefair telling The New Yorker: 'Most of the kids that are doing this, they don't play football, they're not cheerleaders. This is their focus.'
By all accounts, Rittenhouse seemed to idolize the police.
Before Rittenhouse's Facebook account was deactivated, it reflected the young man's admiration for law enforcement, which he praised heavily on social media.
In a photograph posted by his mother, Kyle is seen wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform and the kind of brimmed hat state troopers wear. 
Records show that in January 2017, his mom claimed a classmate of her son's had been calling him 'dumb' and 'stupid' and threatening him as she sought an order of protection from police.  
Rittenhouse was identified in court papers as a lifeguard at a YMCA in Lindenhurst, Illinois. 
In January 2020, Rittenhouse sat front row at a Trump rally in Des Moines, Iowa. 
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.

COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
DISMISSED - COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it",-2
1782,"FRESH FROM victories in Tokyo, Russian Olympic medalists were preparing for a reception with Vladimir Putin earlier this month when they were told they would spend a week in quarantine before meeting the president. “I still can’t believe I’ll have to sit in one room for seven days,” Angelina Melnikova, a gymnast, wrote on social media. But the requirement wasn’t new: senior officials, journalists and even veterans of the second world war have had to self-isolate before coming within breathing distance of the man who has stood at Russia’s helm for over two decades, and who next week turns 69.
When Russia first recorded a surge in coronavirus cases in March last year, Mr Putin donned a yellow hazmat suit to visit Moscow’s main covid-19 hospital. State TV cameras captured him taking selfies with staff and shaking hands with the hospital’s chief physician, Denis Protsenko. “No head of state has so far dared to come so close to the infected,” gushed the Kremlin’s chief propagandist, Dmitry Kiselyov, on his Sunday night news show. All par for the course for a strongman who has built his reputation on action-man stunts.

But in the months since then, perhaps no world leader has been as shielded from the virus. Days after Mr Putin’s hospital visit, Mr Protsenko announced that he himself was sick with covid-19, and Mr Putin holed up in his residence outside Moscow, haranguing officials by video-link as his approval ratings sank. Special tunnels were installed at the residence to douse visitors in disinfectant. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s main opposition figure, who is now in jail, coined a new nickname for his political foe: “grandpa in a bunker”.
In March, the BBC reported that the Kremlin had spent $85m on quarantine accommodation for staff and visitors coming into contact with Mr Putin and other measures to ensure his well-being. That figure is all the more startling when you consider that Russia has had a working vaccine since last August, when the president approved the Sputnik V jab. On September 14th Mr Putin announced he was going into self-isolation after covid cases were detected in his inner circle, less than three months after he revealed he had been vaccinated. He emerged two weeks later, to be seen meeting Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan on September 29th. But Muscovites are not expecting to see him around the place.",2
1783,"IT IS HARD work being a capitalist in a communist dictatorship. In the past few months China’s authorities have gone after big technology firms for alleged abuse of monopolistic power and the misuse of data. In the name of social cohesion they have banned for-profit tutoring and hectored companies and billionaires about their wider social responsibilities. The crackdown is reckoned to have wiped more than $1trn off the value of China’s biggest tech firms.
On August 30th the country’s video-gaming industry—the world’s largest with annual sales of $44bn—became the latest target. New rules proclaimed that, in order to “effectively protect the physical and mental health of minors”, children under 18 would be allowed to play online games only between 8pm and 9pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.

The rules are the most restrictive in the world, and will affect tens of millions of people. Around two-thirds of Chinese children are thought to play online games regularly. But the idea is not new. China has worried about what it sees as the addictive and corrupting qualities of video games for more than a decade, says Daniel Ahmad, a senior analyst at Niko Partners, which follows Asian video-gaming markets. Censors frown on things like politics and gore, requiring changes to foreign games seeking a licence for sale in China. The new regulations are an update to ones passed in 2019 that limited children to 90 minutes per day of gaming, and imposed a curfew between 10pm and 8am. (On August 25th South Korea, which implemented a similar curfew in 2011, announced it would scrap its rules.)
Those previous rules had loopholes. China’s “anti-addiction system” requires gamers to use their real names, and a government-issued identity number, to play online, and boots them from the game when their allotted time has expired. But children could use adult credentials to log in, or play in internet cafés that turned a blind eye to long gaming sessions. This time, the authorities seem keen to block such workarounds. Alongside the new rules were promises of tougher policing and punishments for companies found to be dragging their feet. Tencent, China’s biggest video-gaming company, has been experimenting with facial-recognition software to ensure that crafty players cannot use other people’s credentials.
Despite their draconian nature, the immediate impact of the new rules was muted. Shares in Tencent and NetEase, a rival firm, dipped slightly after the announcement. That is probably because the rules are unlikely to make much instant difference to the firms’ bottom lines. Although there are thought to be around 110m gamer kids in China, they have little money to splash on new characters or virtual items. In its most recent set of quarterly results, Tencent said that only 2.6% of gaming revenue came from players under 16.
The long-term consequences could be more painful. The impecunious teenage gamers of today are the young adult gamers, complete with disposable income, of tomorrow. If the crackdown is effective, says one observer, Chinese gaming giants could see their flow of new customers dry up. Western firms could suffer, too. Jefferies, a bank, flags Roblox, an American gaming platform that allows users to create their own mini-games and share them with friends, as particularly at risk. The game, which has over 40m daily users around the world, is aimed at younger players. It launched in China in July.
Another question is how far the crackdown will spread. For now, a thriving grey market links Chinese gamers to foreign firms that are unable, or unwilling, to seek an official licence to sell their products in the country’s vast market. “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds”, an online shooter, is reckoned to have sold around 20m copies in China despite lacking official approval. Around 50m Chinese gamers are thought to use Steam, an online shop for PC games run by Valve, an American firm, that remains curiously unblocked by China’s Great Firewall. That gives them access to tens of thousands of unlicensed games, free from official nannying.
The signs are ominous. In February Apple removed tens of thousands of unlicensed games from the Chinese version of its app store and a stripped-down, censorship-compliant Chinese version of Steam was launched. It offers few games and has hardly any users. But if the crackdown continues, Chinese gamers may soon find the local version is all that is available. ■

1784,"SINCE APRIL 28TH protesters have defied an 8pm curfew, and the risk of catching covid-19, to take to the streets of Bogotá, Colombia’s capital. They have burned buses and police stations and looted banks and shops. Protesters also blocked all the main roads leading to Cali, the country’s third-largest city, for several days, resulting in empty shelves in grocery shops and a shortage of medicine in hospitals. At least 24 people died and more than 800 civilians and police officers have been injured. On May 1st Iván Duque, the president, sent in the army to quell the violence.
The protests were triggered by a tax-reform bill the government sent to Congress on April 15th. On May 2nd Mr Duque withdrew the unpopular bill. The next day the finance minister, Alberto Carrasquilla, resigned. But resentment against the president, whose approval rating is 33%, means that the unrest is likely to continue.


Mr Duque’s reform was sorely needed. Because of the pandemic, Colombia’s deficit has tripled to nearly 8% of GDP. The reform would have removed many VAT exemptions and lowered the threshold for starting to pay income tax. (Income-tax revenues in Colombia are among the lowest as a share of GDP in the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries.) Pensions would have been taxed, too. Spending on social programmes would have increased, potentially benefiting 19m people. Mr Carrasquilla claims the bill could have reduced the share of Colombians who are extremely poor (earning less than 145,000 pesos a month, or $38) by six percentage points.
Most Colombians, however, saw it as unfair. One of the longest lockdowns in the world has emptied wallets and sapped morale. Last year 2.8m people fell into extreme poverty. More than 500,000 businesses have closed. Even though the tax increases would hit the wealthiest hardest, 80% of people, when surveyed, opposed the bill.
The bill was not the protesters’ only grievance. Colombians are frustrated, particularly with Mr Duque. The president promised to make the country safer. But violence is getting worse. Colombia is exporting record amounts of cocaine and illegal armed groups are growing stronger. Since 2016, the year a peace deal was signed with the FARC, the country’s biggest rebel army, other armed groups have driven a growing number of rural people from their homes and murdered hundreds of local leaders. Colombians also blame the government for mishandling the pandemic.
Indeed after Mr Duque withdrew the reform, the protests became far more violent. The government has been chided for its excessive use of force. An armoured vehicle was filmed in Bogotá firing live ammunition in a residential neighbourhood. The ombudsman is investigating the disappearance of around 40 people.
On May 4th Mr Duque said he would set up a “forum for national dialogue”, where the government will meet protesters and other civil groups. As The Economist went to press, it seemed that some of the protesters would meet with the government on May 10th. But as their list of demands has grown longer—to include withdrawing a health-reform bill, introducing a guaranteed minimum income and an end to the forced eradication of coca crops, among other grievances—so too has the likelihood that they will not leave the streets.
All this will make Mr Duque weaker. Unlike his predecessors, he does not have a stable majority coalition in Congress. Even his mentor, Álvaro Uribe, a former president, has distanced himself from Mr Duque; he was one of the first to speak out against the bill.
Gustavo Petro, a left-winger, is gaining momentum in the polls. He lost against Mr Duque in the presidential elections of 2018, but is planning to run again next year. He has proposed that the central bank print more money to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, and has praised the late Hugo Chávez, the despotic socialist who set Venezuela on the path to ruin. Instead of a bold tax reform, Mr Duque’s legacy may instead turn out to be ensuring that Colombia gets its first socialist president. ■

1785,"“WE WILL BE the guinea pig,” said Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s president, before trade talks with America opened last year. A deal would make Kenya only the second African country after Morocco to sign a free-trade agreement with the United States. Officials in the Trump administration called the proposed deal “a model” for future ones. But such bilateral talks jar with Africa’s push for regional integration and with President Joe Biden’s emphasis on multilateralism. Negotiations are now on hold while America works out what to do next.
The pause reflects a sense of drift in Africa’s trade relations with the West, as both America and Europe rethink how they do business with the continent. In the past they granted concessions, such as lower tariffs on African exports, without requiring African countries to reciprocate. Now they are increasingly looking to negotiate two-way agreements which will open up African markets, too. The old approach was paternalistic and gave Africans little say. But the new one, handled badly, could put Africa’s own integration at risk.

Since 2000 American policy has been built around the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which grants duty-free access to thousands of products exported from around 40 eligible countries. It was a law passed by Congress, not a treaty negotiated between governments, so African countries have no control over the eligibility criteria. That creates friction. Rwanda, for example, was partially suspended in 2018 because its ban on imported second-hand clothes, intended to boost local production, irked the American firms that export them.
Now African countries must wait anxiously to see if Congress will extend AGOA beyond its current expiry date in 2025. The uncertainty makes business “too unpredictable”, sighs a Ugandan technocrat. Kenya’s push for a fully fledged trade deal with America is an attempt to seize the initiative. It also draws on the promise of AGOA itself, which was always envisaged as a stepping stone towards negotiated pacts.
But there is a snag. Kenya is part of the East African Community, which is, on paper, a customs union. If Kenya were to lower barriers to American products, then the other five countries in the bloc would either have to let those products leak into their own markets or tighten border checks to keep them out. Negotiating with countries as a group, rather than individually, would be a less divisive way forward.
Whoever is at the table, many American businesses now favour moving away from AGOA-like trade concessions and towards reciprocal agreements. They do not want to “lose out” while other countries strike deals, says Witney Schneidman, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs. For instance, a refrigerator made in America enters South Africa with a far higher tariff than one made in the EU, notes Mr Schneidman.
Meanwhile European countries are stuck in a quagmire of their own. They once gave preferential access to exports from their former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. That clashed with World Trade Organisation rules. So in 2000 the EU started touting reciprocal deals called “economic partnership agreements”, negotiated with regional blocs. Britain is adopting a similar model in its post-Brexit trade with Africa.
A southern African pact with the EU came into force in 2016. But countries such as Nigeria (in the west African bloc) and Tanzania (in the east) have refused to sign deals in their respective regions. They worry, with some justification, that dropping tariffs would expose nascent industries to a flood of European competition.
The incentive to cut a deal with Europe is also undermined by existing systems of trade preferences, which overlap like onion skins. Peel off one layer, as the EU is doing, and countries like Kenya lose access to European markets—unless they sign up for an economic partnership agreement. But poorer countries such as Tanzania can export duty-free without a deal, thanks to a different layer of benefits. Unsurprisingly the two neighbours in the same east African bloc find themselves at odds.
Yet the whole continent is supposed to be pursuing its own ambitious agenda for integration. This year 37 countries started the gradual process of trading under an African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). They want to kick-start Africa’s stalled industrialisation by selling manufactured goods to each other, rather than raw materials to distant continents. Kenya’s solo negotiations with America “may undermine the AfCFTA”, says Prudence Sebahizi, the African Union’s chief technical adviser on the pact. He fears that American goods may displace African ones in Kenya’s market.
Influential voices urge a rethink. “Rich countries should not be picking African integration apart,” says David Luke of the London School of Economics. Carlos Lopes, the African Union’s representative on future relations with Europe, suggests trade talks with the rest of the world could wait until the AfCFTA is embedded and Africa is ready to negotiate as a single bloc.
Others think that strategy unrealistic. An EU official says Europe shares the vision of an Africa that “can speak with one voice”. But the best way to get there, he says, is to build on existing deals. The AfCFTA is still being assembled. “It’s only when we get an African customs union that Africa can negotiate as a bloc,” says Trudi Hartzenberg of the Trade Law Centre, a South African think-tank, “and that’s a long way off.” Free-trade areas can, and do, overlap.
African countries are caught in a contradiction. Politically they demand to be treated as equal partners, but the economic order remains profoundly unequal. “A Goliath is negotiating with a David,” says Africa Kiiza of SEATINI, a Uganda-based campaign group. “Reciprocity between unequals can’t work.” ■",2
1786,"A bird flu outbreak has been confirmed in Dorset today with officials culling 39 domestic ducks after a case of the 'highly pathogenic' H5N1 strain was found.
The strain of avian influenza was detected at a premises in Southbourne, Bournemouth.
To contain its spread, Government and local health officials are doing door-to-door testing in the area to check for any further cases. 
They have also constructed a 3km temporary exclusion zone to prevent animal movements.
Elsa Hatton, of Southbourne, said a case of the avian influenza H5N1 strain had been found in her flock of 39 domestic ducks. 
The domestic ducks were kept to sell eggs to the local community and have since been culled. 
Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus. 

Bird flu is unique in that it can be transmitted directly from birds to humans. 
There are 15 different strains of the virus. It is the H5N1 strain which is infecting humans and causing high death rates. 
Humans can catch bird flu directly through close contact with live infected birds and those who work with infected chickens are most at risk. 


'We sold eggs to local people for five years in Christchurch and have made many new connections and forged some wonderful friendships through selling eggs here in Southbourne for five years,' she told Dorset Live.
'We are truly heartbroken as ducks are such happy characters and were very much a part of our family.
'We’ll get some more ducks in due course, probably in the Spring.'
Mrs Hatton has shared a tribute to the ducks along with a photo before they were culled. 
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirmed the case in birds at the premises and the area is currently undergoing testing.
Other birds that pose a direct risk will be culled.
A BCP Council spokesperson said: 'Trading Standards Officers from BCP Council are working alongside officers from the Government’s Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) with measures to prevent the spread of the disease. 
'These measures include a cull of the birds who pose a direct risk, as well as further investigation over the weekend into premises in the area who are breeding or keeping birds.
'Please be advised that a 3km Temporary Control Zone has been constructed around an area centred on Castlemain Avenue at this time with regard to animal movements. 
'APHA and BCP Council officers will be knocking on doors in the zone from tomorrow to check for potential further cases. Please note that these officers will be carrying ID.'
Peter Haikin, Regulatory Services Manager, said: 'Avian Influenza predominantly affects only birds and is not considered to be an illness which poses a risk to the general public.' 
All bird keepers in Great Britain are now required by law to undergo certain biosecurity procedures following an outbreak of Avian Flu being declared to help prevent further spread.
Bird flu cases have also been reported in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Essex, Lancashire, North Yorkshire and Derbyshire. 
Last week, people in Lancashire were warned not to pick up any sick or dying birds after an outbreak of bird flu was confirmed at a poultry farm.
A temporary control zone was declared around the affected site in Salwick, near Preston.
Elsewhere, a protection zone was also set up in North Yorkshire after birds there were identified to have the H5N1 virus, the BBC reported.
Defra confirmed the strain of bird flu was found at a property near Leeming Bar, Hambleton, and that testing was underway. 
Earlier this month, a bird flu prevention zone was declared across the country after a number of cases of the virus were detected in captive and wild birds in England, Wales and Scotland.
Farms and bird keepers were ordered to toughen their biosecurity measures after the avian influenza was spotted in poultry at multiple sites across the UK.
The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) will see keepers with more than 500 birds have to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites.",-2
1787,"AT A CRAFT fair in a rich neighbourhood of La Paz, Bolivia’s administrative capital, Paula Maceda, a 22-year-old selling home-made rucksacks, sighs as the topic of the government comes up. “We are sick of politics,” she says. “We want jobs, vaccines, food.” In 2019 she was at university when signs of fraud in an election apparently won by the leftist president, Evo Morales, led to weeks of protests. After the police and army withdrew their support, Mr Morales resigned and fled to Mexico. In El Alto, a poor city of 1m people on the frigid plain above La Paz, Ms Maceda’s family shut themselves indoors as pro-Morales mobs torched police stations. Across Bolivia 36 people were killed. In the final days of 2019 her class debated the crisis: “Some of us thought there had been fraud, others thought it was a coup.”
Nearly two years later, the quarrel about what happened still dominates Bolivian politics. In March the government of Luis Arce, a former finance minister under Mr Morales and the winner of a new election last year, jailed his predecessor, the right-wing interim president, Jeanine Áñez, on charges of having carried out a coup.

Further unrest looms. On July 28th the attorney-general announced that he would end an investigation into the alleged fraud. Opposition groups in La Paz and Santa Cruz, a city brought to a standstill by the earlier protests, called for new demonstrations in the first week of August, as The Economist went to press. Following Mr Arce’s election, Mr Morales returned to Bolivia late last year, and appears to be keen to get back into politics.
Despite all the talk of fraud or coup, what occurred in 2019 was hardly clear-cut. After a 24-hour pause in the rapid count of votes sparked the first protests, audits by the Organisation of American States (OAS) and the European Union (EU) found grave irregularities, such as a hidden server used to send tally sheets that was not reported to electoral authorities. Following Mr Morales’s forced resignation, the vice-president and heads of Congress also resigned, which led to a power vacuum. In talks mediated by the Catholic Church and the EU, opposition leaders and some legislators from Mr Morales’s Movement to Socialism (MAS) decided that Ms Áñez, the second vice-president of the senate and the next in line according to the constitution, would fill it. Later that day, however, the legislators refused to swear her in. More protests erupted, this time against Ms Áñez.
MAS leaders now accuse the opposition, the OAS and half a dozen foreign ambassadors of conspiring to spark a civilian uprising to oust Mr Morales. The attorney-general confirmed many of the irregularities found by the OAS but concluded they were due to “negligence”, not fraud. The opposition denies taking part in a coup. It argues that the origins of the uprising and the rupture of democracy lay not in 2019 but in 2016, when Mr Morales ignored constitutional term limits and a referendum in which 51% of Bolivians said he should not be allowed to run again.
Since 2019 such rows have been routine. Under Ms Áñez, the attorney-general’s office rushed to open cases against Mr Morales for fraud, corruption, terrorism and sedition. The same office closed most of them as soon as Mr Arce won and filed cases against 60 officials from Ms Áñez’s government. Human Rights Watch, an international monitor, says both sides have resorted to “revenge justice”. Even Mr Arce’s justice minister, Iván Lima, calls prosecutors’ timeline “imprecise” and the crimes of which Ms Áñez is accused (terrorism and sedition) “unconstitutional”.
Part of the problem is that the line between the executive and judicial branches has long been blurry. In 2011 Bolivia began to elect judges by popular vote. Although the move was presented as a way to democratise the courts, it facilitated political control instead. Candidates are selected by the MAS-dominated Congress, which prizes loyalty over experience. Short mandates (two to six years) also make judges vulnerable to pressure. Well over half are interim nominees who can be kicked out at any time. “There is a problem with judges’ independence,” Mr Lima admits.
A plan for judicial reform was set aside earlier this year as the MAS focused on the coup case. According to Jorge Richter, Mr Arce’s spokesman, this case is needed to restore democracy. The government is “unwilling to turn the page on impunity”, he says, adding that the MAS’s return to politics will also restore prosperity, by reintroducing an economic model the “coup” thwarted: public investment, import substitution and wealth redistribution.
But for many economists this model is woefully outdated. Growth has been slowing since 2014 when commodity prices fell and the MAS began dipping into foreign reserves to fund spending. Reserves are down to $4.7bn (12% of GDP) from a peak of $15bn in 2014. Although cheques to the poor, low-interest loans to businesses and cash to state firms are expected to push growth to 5% this year, Bolivia will struggle to service its debts. The pandemic caused the mostly informal economy to shrink by 9% last year.
The MAS’s obsessive focus on talking about a coup could help rehabilitate Mr Morales. So could its strategy of blaming Ms Áñez for the covid-19 crisis, even though she inherited a creaking health system from Mr Morales. Three-fifths of people think Mr Arce is doing a good or average job and more than half expect their livelihoods to improve soon. According to Mr Richter, Mr Arce occasionally meets Mr Morales in order to “assess threats from political enemies”.
To critics this sounds like an attempt to stifle the opposition. “They recovered power and vowed never to give it up again,” says María Teresa Zegada, a sociologist. In the final hours of the outgoing Congress, MAS legislators changed the rules so that many nominations, including that of the head of the police, no longer need a two-thirds majority. Cecilia Requena, a senator from Comunidad Ciudadana, the largest opposition party, says that her party is not told what will be discussed in each legislative session. Congress is merely a funnel for Mr Arce’s orders, she claims.
But the MAS is not as unified as it would like people to think. The coup narrative “masks an enormous frustration” about cronyism, corruption and unfulfilled social promises under Mr Morales, argues Magali Vianca, a lawyer who worked in several MAS administrations before leaving the party. After losing its two-thirds majority in Congress last year for the first time since 2009, the MAS also lost ground in regional elections in March.
Although 75% of people in El Alto voted for Mr Arce last October, the mayoral candidate backed by Mr Morales got just 20% of the vote. The winner was Eva Copa, a 34-year-old former MAS senator. In her earlier role Ms Copa negotiated with Ms Áñez; photos of the senator and the interim president fuelled hope for reconciliation in Bolivian politics. It was fleeting. In December the MAS accused Ms Copa of aiding the “coup” and forced her out of the party.
How Ms Copa manages as mayor (in a fortress-like office, built after protesters razed the previous two) will be a test for left-wing alternatives to the MAS. So far, she says, she is squeezed “in the middle like a sandwich”. The same goes for many people in El Alto. Relatives of the protesters who were killed in the chaos after Ms Áñez took office, possibly by soldiers she sent in, complain that the MAS is using their deaths as a “political flag”.
Many people no longer care whether what occurred in 2019 was fraud or a coup. Ms Maceda says she is too busy trying to earn enough to feed her siblings. As for Mr Morales, people will protest if he tries to run for president again, she thinks. “We won’t trip over the same stone twice.”■",2
1788,"UNLIKE THEIR terrestrial cousins, sea slugs are widely regarded as among the most beautiful animals on Earth. In some cases, part of that beauty comes from subcellular structures called chloroplasts, which they extract intact from the algae they eat and then sequester in gut diverticula for purposes of their own.
Chloroplasts are the distant descendants of photosynthetic bacteria that became symbiotic, a bit less than 2bn years ago, with an organism ancestral to today’s algae and plants. From their hosts’ point of view, their purpose is to use energy from sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and then react the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to form molecular precursors of glucose. Further reactions turn these basic materials into other biochemicals, too. Rearranging the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms and adding nitrogen, for example, results in amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.

The best guess, therefore, was that slugs sequester chloroplasts in their diverticula in order that they might continue photosynthesising there. But the details were obscure. So, to shed more light, as it were, Sónia Cruz of the University of Aveiro, in Portugal, and her colleagues collected some sea slugs and ran a few experiments.
As they write in a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, they supplied the slugs with simple chemicals (sodium bicarbonate and ammonia) containing unusual carbon and nitrogen atoms. Instead of normal carbon, which has six neutrons, the bicarbonate contained seven-neutron carbon. Similarly, the ammonia contained nitrogen with eight neutrons instead of the regular seven. Molecules with these rare isotopes can be detected using a technique called mass spectrometry, so the fates of the atoms involved are easy to follow.
Having thus treated their slugs, the team exposed half of them to light for 36 continuous hours and kept the other half in the dark. As they expected, they saw the unusual isotopes of carbon and nitrogen enter the chloroplasts of slugs exposed to light. By contrast, little of the heavy nitrogen and none of the heavy carbon entered the chloroplasts of slugs kept in the dark. What intrigued them, though, was the subsequent fate of those isotopes.
A naive assumption would be that the products of the captured chloroplasts would be scattered around a slug’s body, and thus made available to all of its organs. In fact, most of them ended up in a structure called the albumen gland, which produces nutrients that are then incorporated in the animal’s eggs (the species concerned, Elysia timida, is a hermaphrodite, so all individuals bear eggs). The rest migrated directly into the slugs’ gonads.
This result suggested that, rather than helping with an animal’s general weal, chloroplasts have been co-opted by Elysia for a specific role in reproduction. To check that idea, the team conducted a further experiment. They kept pairs of slugs for 28 days either in normal light or in conditions of greatly reduced illumination and counted the number of eggs laid.
Pairs exposed to normal light averaged 238 eggs per week over the course of the experiment. Those kept almost in the dark averaged 129. This pretty-much clinched the idea that the ingested chloroplasts have, somehow, become extensions of Elysia’s reproductive system, and that chloroplasts, those superbly adapted symbionts of algae and plants, have been able to adjust, too, to life as part of a very different host indeed. ■

1789,"It was another roller-coaster week for energy prices. After OPEC and its allies resisted calls to increase output, the price of Brent crude surpassed $80 per barrel and reached its highest level in three years. The cartel said it would stick to the gradual increases in output it agreed to over the summer. The energy shortage rattled other financial markets too, as investors worried about the fallout. In America and Europe government bond yields climbed. In Britain the yield on ten-year gilts jumped to its highest since May 2019.

In Europe the price of natural gas front-month futures jumped by more than 60% in two days. But prices soon reversed when Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, hinted that his country could supply additional gas to Europe.

In Asia the coal shortage dragged on. Power cuts have been reported across China. Authorities there have told miners to increase production. India is braced for power shortages. Half of its coal-fired power plants are on alert for blackouts.
In the euro area rising energy prices contributed to high inflation. In September the euro area’s inflation rate rose to 3.4%, the highest level in 13 years. In Germany consumer prices rose by 4.1% in the same month, a 29-year high.
America’s trade deficit in goods and services grew to a record $73bn in August, up 4.3% from the previous month. Imports rose by $4bn from July, because of an increase in consumer demand. But trade in vehicles and car parts fell, as a result of the semiconductor shortage.
Leaks and outages
Facebook users experienced a long outage this week. The social-media platform and its subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, were down for several hours. The firm’s share price fell by 4.9% on Monday. It blamed an internal malfunction and said there was no evidence that users’ data had been compromised.
Meanwhile, Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee who is now a whistleblower, testified before a Senate subcommittee. She claimed that Facebook’s products “harm children, stoke division [and] weaken...democracy”, and that documents she leaked to the Wall Street Journal showed the company is aware of this. In a statement Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, said that the firm’s work and motives have been mischaracterised.
Tesco, Britain’s biggest food retailer, announced a share buyback worth £500m ($678m). Operating profits in the first half of the year reached £1.3bn, a 29% increase on a year earlier. Last year the covid-19 pandemic hurt the supermarket’s wholesale arm, which sells to restaurants and pubs, and added to costs, such as extra cleaning in its stores.
The Hong Kong stock exchange suspended trading in shares of Evergrande, an indebted Chinese property developer, and Hopson Development, a rival. Chinese state-backed media suggested that Hopson is considering taking a majority stake in Evergrande’s property-services unit. Trading of the subsidiary’s shares was also suspended.
Volvo, a Swedish carmaker owned by Geely, a Chinese auto firm, said it will raise $2.9bn through an initial public offering on the Stockholm stock exchange. The listing will value the firm at around $30bn. Volvo was sold by Ford, a carmaker, to Geely in 2010. Since then it has raced ahead in electrification.
The European Medicines Agency, a regulator, endorsed covid-19 booster shots. It said that in most cases the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be given as a booster to those aged 18 and over, at least six months after their second dose. In America Johnson  Johnson, a pharmaceutical firm, asked the Food and Drug Administration, another regulator, to authorise its booster.
Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm that assembles iPhones, bought an electric-vehicle manufacturing plant from Lordstown Motors, an Ohio-based carmaker. It is Foxconn’s first such plant in America and it comes as part of a deal that includes a minority stake in Lordstown.
Syniverse, a firm that processes hundreds of billions of SMS text messages every year for firms including Verizon, Vodafone and China Mobile, revealed to American regulators that hackers had access to its systems for five years, beginning in 2016. It was not clear whether the text messages themselves had been compromised by the hack.
Cleaning the cesspool
Later in the week Twitch, an online video platform owned by Amazon, was hit by an attack that leaked a full copy of the site’s source code as well as payment records for its broadcasters. The hacker claimed that the aim of this act was to inject more competition into the online streaming industry, which he described as a “disgusting toxic cesspool”.",2
1790,"TWENTY YEARS ago America set out to reshape the world order after the attacks of September 11th. Today it is easy to conclude that its foreign policy has been abandoned on a runway at Kabul airport. President Joe Biden says the exit from Afghanistan was about “ending an era” of distant wars, but it has left America’s allies distraught and its enemies gleeful. Most Americans are tired of it all: roughly two-thirds say the war wasn’t worth it. Yet the national mood of fatigue and apathy is a poor guide to America’s future role in the world. Its capabilities remain formidable and its strategy can be retooled for the 21st century, provided the right lessons are drawn from the post-9/11 era.
The murder of 3,000 people on American soil provoked a reaction that highlighted America’s “unipolar moment”. For a while, it appeared to have uncontested power. President George W. Bush declared that the world was either with America or against it. NATO said the assault on the twin towers was an attack on all its members. Vladimir Putin pledged Russian military co-operation; Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, called this the real end of the cold war. The ease with which American-led forces routed the Taliban seemed to augur a new kind of light-touch warfare: 63 days after September 11th, Kabul fell. There have been enduring achievements since then. Counter-terrorism efforts have improved: Osama bin Laden is dead and no remotely comparable attack on America has succeeded. Lower Manhattan has been rebuilt in style.

But for the most part the legacy of the response to September 11th has been a bitter one. The mission to crush al-Qaeda morphed into a desire for regime change and nation-building that delivered unconvincing results in Afghanistan and Iraq, at a huge human and fiscal cost. Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction were a mirage. America broke its taboo on torture and lost the moral high ground. The initial, illusory, sense of clarity about when it should intervene militarily faded into indecision, for example over Syria’s use of chemical weapons in 2013. At home the spirit of unity quickly evaporated and America’s toxic divisions mocked its claim to have a superior form of government. The mire in the Middle East has been a distraction from the real story of the early 21st century, the rise of China.

Mr Biden’s debacle in Kabul makes a grim epilogue. Some will see in it proof not only of American incompetence, but also of decline. That is going too far. The fall of Saigon did not lead to the West losing the cold war. And for all America’s flaws—its divisions, debts and decrepit infrastructure—many facets of its power are intact. Its share of global GDP, at 25%, is roughly what it was in the 1990s. It is still technologically and militarily pre-eminent. Although public opinion has turned inwards, America’s interests are far more global than during its isolationist phase in the 1930s. With 9m citizens abroad, 39m jobs supported by trade and $33trn of foreign assets, it has a strong interest in an open world.
Its foreign policy shifted under Barack Obama, who tried a “pivot” to Asia and to scale back the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Donald Trump’s detour into bombast and transactional dealmaking was a disaster, though he helped end America’s illusions about China. Mr Biden is well qualified to pick up the pieces, with long experience in foreign affairs and advisers who are crafting a Biden doctrine. Its goals are to end the forever wars, complete the pivot to Asia, tackle new spheres such as cyber-security and rebuild global alliances.
The Economist supports much of this agenda, not least the emphasis on 21st-century priorities such as climate change. The administration’s attitude to women’s rights is better than its predecessor’s, and that could affect geopolitics more than most people realise. But important elements of the Biden doctrine are worryingly fuzzy. The abandoning of Afghanistan has angered allies, who were barely consulted. A confrontational approach to China may blur the focus on climate change.
Overarching the doctrine is an insistence that foreign policy must serve America’s middle class. “Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind,” he has said. Trade, climate and China are simultaneously domestic and foreign concerns. In one sense this is obvious: all countries act in their long-run self-interest, and strength at home is a prerequisite of strength abroad. However, the impulse to make decisions about the world to please a domestic audience is already causing problems.

In Afghanistan an artificial deadline for withdrawal (by September 11th) was fixed to please voters at home, and a decision to remove all troops ignored the reality that a modest American garrison could have stopped the Taliban from taking over. On covid-19, America has missed the chance to lead a global vaccination campaign that would have won it gratitude and goodwill and demonstrated American prowess.
The risk is that Mr Biden’s domestic bias could make his foreign policy less effective. America needs to find a new way to co-exist with China, with rivalry and co-operation in different areas. Yet Mr Biden’s China policy is remarkably like Mr Trump’s, with an ad-hoc array of tariffs in place and rhetoric about a zero-sum contest. He knows that hostility to China is one of the few things that unites Congress and the public: 45% of Americans view China as America’s greatest enemy, up from 14% in 2001.
America still needs to be prepared to use military power to protect human rights abroad. Mr Biden has come close to ruling this out. The world’s despots may have noticed. Mr Biden rightly aims to revive America’s alliances, which multiply its influence. Yet his protectionism hurts allies, from America-first public contracts to $50bn of semiconductor subsidies. His administration shows little interest in a comprehensive Asian trade deal that would counter China.
Foreign policy is guided by events as much as by strategy: Mr Bush ran on a platform of compassionate conservatism, not a war on terror. Mr Biden must improvise in response to an unruly age. But he should not imagine that a foreign policy subordinate to fraught domestic politics will revitalise America’s claim to lead the world.■",2
1791,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",3
1792,"THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE has not had the greatest few years. In 2019, to great fanfare, it was given to Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, for his role in bringing about a peace deal with Eritrea, Ethiopia’s tiny neighbour. It was hailed as a landmark for the country. “We must plant seeds of love, forgiveness and reconciliation in the hearts and minds of our citizens”, said Mr Abiy, that December, in his lecture on receiving the prize. Sadly, Mr Abiy’s seed-planting phase did not last very long. Last year, disaffected soldiers in Tigray, a northern region of the country with a long history of controlling Ethiopia, rebelled. Mr Abiy launched a brutal police action in retaliation. Last month, the prime minister and Nobel laureate toured the battlefield in what has become a new Ethiopian civil war, promising to use rebels as “target practice.” 
The Nobel peace prize committee has been embarrassed before. Henry Kissinger won in 1973—while the United States, following his strategy, was carpet-bombing Cambodia. Among the bookies’ favourites this year were Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenage environmentalist; the World Health Organisation, for its work in helping to get the world vaccinated; and Alexei Navalny, an imprisoned Russian dissident who last year was poisoned with novichok, a nerve agent, and almost died. Instead the gongs have gone to two journalists: Dmitry Muratov, who edits Novaya Gazeta, a liberal Russian newspaper; and Maria Ressa, a former CNN anchor who founded and is the chief executive of Rappler, a website critical of the Philippine government.
Both journalists have done remarkable work in difficult times. Mr Muratov and his newspaper have long toiled to investigate and expose wrongdoing, even as the net has tightened on critics in Russia. In 2014 Novaya broke stories about the shooting down of MH17, a Malaysian Airlines flight, by Russian-backed militants in Ukraine, and then published an apology on behalf of Russia on its front page at a time when Russia’s government was insisting it had nothing to do with the plane going down. Six of the newspaper’s journalists have been murdered in the past three decades. In March noxious substances were sprayed into the newspapers’ offices in an attempt at intimidation. Dozens of Russian journalists have been designated as “foreign agents” by the state. “We’ve been experiencing enormous pressure, of a sort we never experienced before,” says Pavel Kanygin, one of the paper’s reporters.
Ms Ressa’s news organisation, Rappler, which started as a Facebook page in 2011, has been one of very few Philippine news organisations to openly criticise President Rodrigo Duterte’s government, publishing investigations into extrajudicial killings undertaken by the police as part of his war on drugs. It has been targeted by malicious tax investigations, as well as libel cases. Ms Ressa, who along with several other journalists was named a Time magazine person of the year in 2018, has been fighting several libel cases, which in the Philippines can result in prison sentences. Last year she was convicted of one case of “cyber libel”, which she is appealing, but which could put her in prison for up to six years. In 2016, Mr Duterte, then the president elect, responded to a question about media killings with the claim that “just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you’re a son of a bitch”.
Yet in Russia at least, many are disappointed with the committee’s choice not to give the prize to somebody higher profile, such as Mr Navalny, or Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who stood in the Belarussian election last year. Alexander Etkind, a Russian historian, said he believed Mr Muratov deserved his award, but he had nominated Mr Navalny and he was sorry “that the Nobel committee did not have courage to do the right thing.” Indeed the Kremlin seemed delighted it had not done so. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s press officer, congratulated Mr Muratov for his “talent” and “bravery”. With Mr Navalny still in prison and in poor health, a Nobel would have been deeply embarrassing to Mr Putin in a way that Mr Muratov’s is not. 
Both editors have accepted their awards graciously, speaking up for other journalists and victims of oppression. “I am laughing. I didn’t expect it at all. It’s madness over here right now,” Mr Muratov said, on a Telegram channel, promising to do more to represent independent Russian journalism. He dedicated the prize to the six Novaya journalists who have been murdered, and said he said he hoped it would help people who are critical of Russia’s government, particularly journalists and other news organisations accused of being foreign agents. He also said he thought Mr Navalny deserved it. Ms Ressa learned of her prize while taking part in an online panel on press freedom, and said that she was “in shock…I think it’s a recognition of how tough it is”.
The need to speak out for journalists is undeniable. In 2020, more than twice as many were murdered for doing their jobs as in 2019, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an NGO based in New York. At the end of 2020 over 270 journalists were imprisoned, according to the same organisation. That was the highest figure ever recorded by their annual census, which has been going for almost three decades. Highlighting the perils of being a journalist in repressive countries is no bad thing. Yet some will wonder if the Nobel Committee could not have been a little bolder. ■",2
1793,"CARBON PRICES are the most cost-effective way to fight climate change—but for them to work properly, emissions must be priced everywhere. On July 14th the European Commission unveiled its plan to levy what would, in effect, be a tariff on some carbon-intensive imports which, by virtue of having been produced outside the EU, are not subject to its cap-and-trade carbon-pricing scheme. The idea is to stop European firms from responding to the carbon price by moving production to parts of the world where they can pollute without penalty, to shield them from being undercut by rivals from such places and to encourage foreign firms who want to sell to Europe to go green.
There are sound reasons for applying carbon prices to imports. But working out how to go about it without causing a cycle of damaging protectionism is a conundrum.

Were carbon prices global, the costs of fulfilling the Paris agreement on climate change could fall by 79%, according to the Environmental Defence Fund, a think-tank. Market forces would find the cheapest ways to cut emissions. Yet a worldwide carbon market is a pipe dream. (China is due to launch the world’s largest emissions-trading system on July 16th, after we go to press, but permits will be far too cheap.) Carbon tariffs are a fallback measure.

Free traders like The Economist typically reject tariffs on principle. Cheap imports bring lower prices, more choice, higher productivity and incentives to innovate. Firms and workers constantly plead for protection from foreign competitors, alleging that jobs and profits must be shielded from unfair foreign competition. Liberals respond that the harm done to incumbents by the free operation of markets—what economists call “pecuniary externalities”—do not, unlike other types of harm, justify government intervention. “Society admits no right, legal or moral, in the disappointed competitors, to immunity from this kind of suffering,” wrote John Stuart Mill in 1859, 16 years after The Economist was founded to oppose the Corn Laws, which kept cheap food out of Britain to the benefit of its incumbent landowners.
Carbon tariffs, however, would not be inherently protectionist. They are an attempt to expand the reach of market forces rather than to limit them. The opportunity to pollute the atmosphere without penalty is itself a kind of distorting subsidy; more so if it exists unevenly across borders. Preventing climate change is a global public good, meaning every country’s citizens have a direct interest in reducing emissions wherever they happen. Pricing carbon at the border should therefore be viewed as a special case, and not as a precedent for using tariffs as a bludgeon with which to impose local regulations or standards abroad.
The problems with carbon tariffs are thus not moral or economic but practical and political. Implementing the policy fairly would mean ascertaining how much carbon has been emitted in the production of a given import, and to what extent foreign governments had already taxed those emissions. In 2018 the European Commission said that would be “clearly unmanageable”. Not much has changed since.
The EU’s new plan applies only to select industries which at present are protected using subsidies. The products involved, such as cement and fertiliser, are commonplace. Even so, the plan relies on arbitrary rules. Where the carbon intensity of a foreign producer’s processes cannot be estimated they will be assumed to be as dirty as the worst 10% of European companies.
Incumbents are rubbing their hands at the prospect of outsiders drowning in paperwork. Some members of the European Parliament are trying to amend the plan to favour local firms. John Kerry, America’s climate envoy, has said that the United States is also looking at carbon border taxes. That is indefensible unless America implements a proper carbon price at home.
The IMF has an alternative idea to tariffs: a globally negotiated minimum carbon tax which varies according to GDP. But it is not clear that it is achievable. William Nordhaus, a Nobel-prizewinning environmental economist, thinks willing countries should form a climate club within which carbon is priced and then simply levy flat punitive tariffs on those countries which refuse to join.
It is just about possible to imagine a successful path to a global carbon price that involves tariffs. But any such plan is fraught with the risk of capture and protectionism. Governments must tread with care—while also recognising that failing to price carbon adequately may be the greatest danger of all. ■

1795,"Police have been on a recruitment drive discussing the vetting process for new officers not far from where Sarah Everard was abducted.
Around six officers with clipboards chatted to the public, along with around three civilian staff in a bid to get more applicants to join the Met Police.
Officers handed out leaflets about the new policing degree and encouraged passers by to join the force at the stand outside Tooting Broadway station in south London today.
Signs around the stand read 'a career like no other' and 'what is the vetting process?'
Staff involved in the vetting process also talked about how the checks are carried out.
One said a new measure would see an applicant with a domestic abuse conviction flagged up now facing a string of extra interviews.
These include meetings with management and unions to discuss the allegations and decide if the application should be refused.
But some women did not think the force is doing enough to protect the public from rogue officers in the wake of the shocking murder of Ms Everard at the hands of serving cop Wayne Couzens in March this year.
Alana Nikanorova, 31, from Streatham, south London, said: 'I don't think they have done enough to address the institutional problems at the heart of the police.
'They [the police] can tweak the vetting process, but it's not enough. They have to do a lot more to regain so many women's trust.
'The advice they gave after Wayne Couzens was convicted was absolutely ridiculous and the way they policed the [Sarah Everard] vigil was even worse. And that attitude comes from the very top so it's needs wholesale changes.
'It'll take a lot more to put right all those problems.'
After Couzens was sentencend to a whole life term before Met advised women to flag down a bus if they felt unsafe being stopped by a male officer.
Sara Maleaux, 27, from Tooting, added: 'I never had a problem with the police before, but after what happened this year and how the Met reacted to the protest, I've found myself looking at the police in a different way.
'I fell much less safe walking around at night. The police are supposed to be there to protect us, but now we have to be wary of them as well.
'It was bad enough before Sarah Everard was murdered but now it's a thousand times worse because who do we go to for help?'
At an vigil on Clapham Common not long after Ms Everard's death, Met were cricised for arresting women at the demonstration.
Angela Nabong, 49, from West Norwood in south London, said: 'I do trust the police because I know the majority are there to help, but I do find myself feeling less safe and I take more precautions when I'm on my own at night.'
Other women said they still have faith in officers but believe the Met Police bosses need to do more to change the institution's attitudes.
Olivia Lesscombe, 41, from Balham, south London, said: 'It's tough because the police have a really hard job to do.
'They have to carry out all the right checks but what can they do if someone lies to them?
'I feel like the majority of officers are trustworthy, but they do have a problem with how they are perceived by the public at the moment. I hope it can be resolved because it can't go on like this.'
Shazza Shah, 29, from Tooting, said: 'It's not that I don't trust the police. He [Couzens] was just one officer, I wouldn't distrust the whole of the police because of one horrendous incident.
'Yes, there have been mistakes, but overall I still mostly trust the police.'
Jackie Corbett, 58, of Tooting Bec, added: 'I think as a whole the police can be trusted, we have to have faith the majority of officers are good people, trying to do their best.
'You get bad people in every job, but the police are more noticeable when one does something awful.
'They have a great access to people and have a lot of power, so it is so terrible if that is used to commit a crime.
'But generally I think the individual officers are doing the job because they want to help people.'
Couzens abducted and murdered Ms Everard as she walked from Clapham Common towards Brixton, using his warant to stop and talk to her.
In the wake of his conviction, questions were raised over why allegations of indecent exposure wee not investigated or flagged up when he moved to work as an armed protection officer.
Today's recruitment stand was placed around two and a half miles from the scene of the 33-year-old marketing executive's dissappearance.
Leaflets handed out by staff today state the vetting process will look into applicants' finances, family ties and any criminal history.
Their identity, social media accounts and address are also checked out.
A criminal conviction or caution will not automatically bar someone from joining, but prison time is likely to halt the application.
Investigators would have to look into the type of conviction, when it was committed and if it showed a 'pattern of behaviour'.
People who are bankrupt and have been given a County Court Judgement are also likely to be barred, the documents state.
Danielle Macken, from Norbury, added: 'I think its important that the police are out in the community talking to people about the process.
'I think it needs to be transparent and hopefully they'll get some good feedback to take back with them because there's a lot of bad feeling in the community.
'There needs to be better engagement between the police and the public because there's a big divide right now.'
According to one officer manning the stand, the Met is hiring some 6,000 new officers as part of the recruitment drive.
Leaflets about the new Police Degree Apprenticeship (PCDA) were also being handed out.
It details the three-year programme in which rookie cops can earn around £30,000 a year and patrol the streets from day one of the course.
The only requirement to join the degree course is GCSE C grade or above in English and Maths.",-2
1796,"SOME LEADERS, when they come into office, have a powerful economic vision for transforming how their country creates wealth and distributes it. Others approach power as pragmatists whose goal is to subtly shape the political and economic forces they inherit. Joe Biden is firmly in the second camp. He is a lifelong centrist whose most enduring economic belief is his admiration for hard-working Americans and who has shifted with the centre of gravity in his party. But Mr Biden’s ability to go with the flow means that, at the moment, both the left and the right are anxious about the prospect of Bidenomics.
Indeed, if Mr Biden wins the election in November and enters the Oval Office in January 2021 he will confront an extraordinary set of circumstances that will put a huge amount of pressure on him. The economy is clawing its way back from the sharpest slump in living memory following covid-19. The legacy of the pandemic will include millions of long-term unemployed, public debts that will soon exceed their all-time high of 106% of GDP, more bankruptcies and accelerated digital disruption in many industries.

At the same time Mr Biden will head up a party that has indeed shifted more to the left and that has a more radical wing that, while not dominant, is influential and thinks America’s economic model is broken and that the answer is a vastly bigger state. Combined with this, the public is bitterly divided and many people are wary of globalisation. Under President Donald Trump, America’s standing in the world has slumped.
Because of this chaotic backdrop and Mr Biden’s own lack of a fixed economic doctrine, the range of outcomes attributed to a Biden presidency is bewildering and not always benign. To some Republicans on Wall Street and in boardrooms he would enable a hostile takeover by the radical left. “The country is running the risk of structural changes under the guise of social justice which would take the US into a place where it won’t know how to function,” claims one. To the left Mr Biden is a timid figure whose moderation means he would be crushed by an obstructive Congress and conservative courts.
Born to run
Neither view is especially convincing once you consider Mr Biden’s goals. He says he will seek to tilt the balance of American capitalism in favour of workers, not the rich. He will offer competent administration; he is no fan of social experiments or trampling on institutions. His priority would be a stimulus bill to revive growth, though he is likely to pull America somewhat further to the left than either of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton (see chart 1). He would leave the economy greener, with a more active industrial policy, somewhat higher public spending and borders open to skilled migrants. He would not reverse America’s new protectionism, nor does he have a plan to resolve the country’s long-term fiscal problems.

Mr Biden’s long career does not exactly suggest much enthusiasm for economics. During his 36 years in the Senate his main passions were the justice system and foreign policy. By instinct he is an admirer of the middle-class more than the country’s glittering plutocratic elite or its downtrodden. He grew up in, and later represented, Delaware, a diminutive state which relies on big business to make its crust. Over two-thirds of Fortune 500 firms are legally registered there thanks to its shareholder-friendly laws and tax rules. The Diamond State is home to the headquarters of some icons of 20th-century industry, including DuPont, some of whose workers lived in the suburb Mr Biden spent his teens in. His exposure to such folk may help explain his fondness for manufacturing and a more paternalistic capitalism.
As vice-president in 2009-17 Mr Biden helped implement the stimulus package of 2009 and strike budget deals. But his strength was as a negotiator with Congress, not as a visionary. Allies from his Senate and White House years make up a big share of his advisers and entourage now, with additional advice coming from centre-left economists such as Jared Bernstein, Heather Boushey and Ben Harris. Unlike Mr Obama, he has not appointed a dominant economic figure to his team so far.
Jack of all trades
As a result, in order to understand where a Biden presidency might take the economy it is necessary to consider the three external forces that he will have to deal with, each of which could in theory push him down a more radical path. The first is the covid-19-induced recession. America has bounced back faster than was originally feared. GDP is now expected to shrink by 4% this year; at one point a decline of 7% had seemed likely. But the recovery could stumble, not least because Congress has so far failed to agree on a further stimulus bill.
What is already clear, however, is that the slump has hit the poor worst, amplifying inequality. Many business figures warn of a surge in defaults among small firms which have found it hard to secure government help: less than 1% of the misfiring $600bn Main Street lending scheme backed by the Federal Reserve and Treasury has been disbursed. State and local governments face a funding crunch. The disruption is not simply a matter of a temporary downturn. Whole industries, including travel and retail, will be transformed.
And the normal laws of economics have been upended. Interest rates are at rock-bottom levels, making borrowing almost free for now. America will run a fiscal deficit of 16% of GDP this year. Asset prices, meanwhile, are sky-high with the stockmarket at its most expensive level since the dotcom bubble of 2000, based on its ratio of price to cyclically adjusted profits.
As he grapples with this topsy-turvy economy, Mr Biden will have to deal with a second force in the form of the left wing of his party. Over a third of voters in the Democratic primaries supported Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, whose plans involved a giant expansion in annual government spending. Since then Mr Biden has skillfully flattered the more radical left while ignoring their more ambitious proposals, such as nationalised health care and the “Green New Deal”, a package promoted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswomen, among others, which includes a guaranteed job for all. In July a joint Biden-Sanders task force agreed on watered-down policy recommendations. Some of these Mr Biden then further diluted into his own proposals. Even so, the left will still demand jobs in any administration. And the centre of the party remains to the left of public opinion. Opinion polls suggest the typical American is more worried about climate change and China than they used to be, and more relaxed about government borrowing (see chart 2). But 87% of them still believe in free enterprise.

The final external force Mr Biden would face is Congress. The Economist’s election model gives the Democrats a 98% chance of holding control of the House of Representatives and 69% chance of winning the Senate, with any swing bringing new moderate Democrats in. Assuming the normal rules are in play the Senate will limit what can be done. If Mr Biden’s party ends up with between 50 and 59 seats and sticks to normal Senate protocol over the use of the filibuster, it will only be able to get through tax and spending legislation that either has bipartisan support or can be passed using a process known as reconciliation. This typically limits the number of bills to three a year (one each on spending, tax and debt-limits), does not permit changes to social security and normally requires that the impact on the deficit is neutral within ten years, either because the spending measures expire or are balanced by tax rises. But the Democrats could ditch procedural rules over the filibuster so that they can pass major bills with only 50 votes (plus one from the vice-president who can cast a deciding vote). This might also allow them to pursue other goals including expanding the number of Supreme Court judges.
Faced with these external influences, what would Mr Biden do? He would have three main ways to exercise power: through legislation, job appointments and executive action including regulation. Start with legislation, where Mr Biden has proposals that would raise spending by $7trn over a decade. Congress will almost certainly act as a constraint on this. The Democratic Party’s centre of gravity in the House is still centrist: the largest caucus, with over 100 members, is the moderate New Democrat Coalition. Most new seats won would probably be occupied by moderates, and they also hold key jobs, including the head of the Ways and Means committee, which controls tax legislation.
In the Senate, meanwhile, even if the Democrats won a big enough majority to try to ditch the filibuster, which is unlikely (a rough yardstick is they would need 55 seats), Mr Biden might well resist: his affection for the institution is such that he kept a Senate gym locker when he was vice-president, and any change in the filibuster rules would be a dramatic constitutional escalation in the war between the two parties. Any Democratic swing will see moderates win seats.
Land of hope and dreams
All this means Mr Biden will have to compromise and might only get two big priorities passed through Congress. That suggests that any increase in the size of the state would be limited. Ms Warren and Mr Sanders proposed spending increases equivalent to 16-23% of GDP, taking it towards Swedish levels seen in the 1970s. Mr Biden’s formal proposals amount to just a 3% increase and in all probability he might get only half of that passed: so a spending increase of $3trn-4trn over ten years, worth 1-2% of GDP.
The burning priority will be a jumbo “recovery” bill of perhaps $2trn-3trn aimed at revving up the economy and meeting a key strategic priority, more green-tinged infrastructure spending (see chart 3). The latter could command some Republican support because it creates jobs, while also pleasing Mr Biden’s more climate-aware base. Short-term stimulus measures may include cash for state and local governments, a boost to unemployment benefits, a rise in the minimum wage to $15 an hour and further support for small companies.

The green infrastructure element might include upgrades to electricity grids and charging stations for electric cars. In order to cut emissions Mr Biden’s plan aims for power generation to be carbon neutral by the mid-2030s. He is keen to spend tens of billions of dollars a year on research and development into renewable-energy technologies and other areas such as 5G, with the aim of establishing an American edge to rival China’s.
If the jumbo recovery bill goes well, there may be room for a Biden administration to pursue one other big legislative priority. One possibility is immigration reform. Another candidate is boosting middle-class social mobility, where Mr Biden proposes universal pre-school education, tax-credits for child care and free public-university education for families earning less than $125,000 a year. In total spending on an ambitious social-mobility agenda might amount to another $1trn over a decade.

Congress has only limited capacity so Mr Biden will also need to decide what not to do. He does not seem to have a burning appetite to reinvent Obamacare, which was not his first priority when vice-president (although like most politicians he wants to push down drug prices). He will have to hope that the Supreme Court does not force his hand: on November 10th it will begin considering the legality of Obamacare, which could unwind a system millions of people use. Were this to happen Mr Biden might be forced to try to legislate for a replacement. A push to modernise America’s decrepit antitrust apparatus, meanwhile, is on the backburner. Without new legislation, it will be hard to do much about the rising concentration of business or the big tech monopolies, given the courts are reluctant to take action. Kamala Harris, Mr Biden’s running-mate, was friendly towards tech as California’s attorney-general in 2011-17.
Tougher than the rest
Mr Biden’s proposals suggest that roughly half of his spending might be covered by tax rises. Once again the formal plan points to tax hikes of $4trn, but as with spending, in reality a figure half that size or less, of $1.5trn-2trn, is more likely. Big changes to social-security levies are probably off the cards since they are not eligible for the reconciliation process in the Senate. Many Democrats in Congress are wary of raising capital-gains tax too high. So business-tax rises will do much of the work with a partial reversal of the 2017 Trump tax cuts.
Mr Biden would raise the headline rate on corporate income from 21% to up to 28%, levy minimum taxes on foreign earnings and remove tax perks for real-estate and private-equity firms. Individuals earning more than $400,000 would see the top band of income tax rise to up to 39.6%, and those earning more than $1m might have to pay a capital-gains rate that is nearer the one they pay on their income.
A second way Mr Biden could influence the economy, and give licence to his party’s more radical impulses, is through job appointments. Yet it seems unlikely that he will appoint Ms Warren as treasury secretary, or even attorney-general. That would send an alarming signal to the business community when the economy is fragile. It would also trigger a special election to fill her Senate seat in Massachusetts. Instead the front-runners to become treasury secretary are centrists. They include Lael Brainard, a centre-left member of the Federal Reserve Board; Jeff Zients, a co-head of Mr Biden’s transition team; Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a former Obama official and Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor and treasury official. If a business figure is needed then Ruth Porat, the finance chief of Alphabet, a tech giant, is also thought to be a contender.
Based on Mr Biden’s own experience as vice-president, in which he acted as a key counsellor to Mr Obama, Ms Harris would have an important voice in his administration. She sits to the left of him on tax and spending, although she is within the mainstream. And having rejected its signature policies and outmanoeuvred its star figures, Mr Biden might try to placate the left of his party by giving it lots of jobs in the regulatory apparatus where they would emit a cacophony of left-sounding signals.

The final tool Mr Biden has to get his way is executive orders, which Mr Trump and Mr Obama both used. Yet here, too, Mr Biden will be restricted by the courts which have become substantially more conservative than they were in the Obama era. Mr Biden would try to use this power to reverse some of Mr Trump’s own executive orders. Top of this list is probably the ban on some migrants and the president’s clampdown on refugees and undocumented workers that has intensified this year. The rules for visas for skilled workers would be eased. Yet despite his support for immigration, his stance on protectionism is more ambiguous, and here the president has sway and discretion. Mr Biden has been a free trader in the past and would certainly be politer to China than Mr Trump has been. He would rally America’s allies to put in place a co-ordinated response to deal with China’s economic model under Xi Jinping in which even notionally private Chinese firms are often acting under the strategic direction of the Communist Party.
But he will only go so far. This reflects a shift in public opinion. According to the Pew Research Centre, fully 73% of Americans now have an unfavourable view of China, a new high. Mr Biden would not quickly withdraw the tariffs that are now in place (the average tariff on goods imported from China is about 19%). While he has been critical of the Trump administration’s botched effort to rein in TikTok, a Chinese social-media app, he would probably stick with the embargo on Huawei and be wary of high-tech trade with China.
Similarly, new trade deals will not be a priority even though Mr Biden supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership and USMCA, the revised US-Mexico-Canada deal passed in 2020. (Ms Harris was opposed to both.) Mr Biden’s industrial strategy is laced with soft protectionism, including promises to bring supply chains back to home, adopt a “buy American” government-procurement policy, tighten rules on the labelling of products, use American steel for transport projects and singing the praises of the Jones Act which requires that only American-flagged ships carry goods between domestic ports.
A Biden presidency therefore promises moderately higher taxes and more spending, especially on green infrastructure, more industrial policy and not much change to trade policy. Who would benefit? In terms of individuals his policies are aimed squarely at the middle classes and lower paid who would benefit from a raft of measures such as cheaper education, perks to get on the housing ladder and a higher minimum wage. Mr Biden’s tax rises are squarely levied on the richest Americans: if fully enacted they would mean the income of the top 1% of earners would drop by 14%, and the income of the top 0.1% by 18%, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. In reality these proposals will not be passed in their entirety. Either way, the impact of the tax changes on the 99% would be minimal (see chart 4).

What about business? Which firms would gain and which would suffer? One estimate suggests corporate profits would fall by about 12% because of the tax rises. Investors have already begun to discount this and to bid up the shares of renewable-energy firms and construction and infrastructure companies which might benefit from a Biden presidency. The shares of fossil-fuel energy firms which might suffer under a Biden presidency have dropped. Tech stocks have soared this year even as the odds of a Biden win have risen, suggesting investors don’t worry about antitrust action against Silicon Valley. The stockmarket has risen by 4.5% this year despite the recession; hardly a sign of an imminent lurch towards big-state socialism.
Even so, there would be risks to the economy from a Biden presidency. One is that he loses control of the party and there is a lurch even further to the left, spooking the business world. Were the Democrats to abandon the Senate filibuster, a path might be open to an expansion in the size of the Supreme Court or, some bosses fear, more radical legislation. But Mr Biden would probably resist this.
More likely is that a regulatory apparatus stuffed with left-wing appointees ends up damaging his relationship with business. Many of the Trump administration’s most reckless regulatory decisions, for example its push since 2017 to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from limiting the use of coal, need to be reversed. The danger is that new rules are churned out in unco-ordinated fashion on unions, inequality and the like, accompanied by volleys of confrontational rhetoric. Democrats tend to think that business is just crying wolf. But small firms consistently complain about regulation, and badly designed rules after the financial crisis of 2008-09 helped cause serious problems in the mortgage market.

The second danger is fading dynamism. Some of Mr Biden’s agenda, including infrastructure and more research and development, will boost America’s long-term competitiveness. But a lack of antitrust policy and more red tape could continue to give too much power to large, incumbent companies, which have seen their market share rise in two-thirds of industries over the past two decades, creating oligopolies in industries from mobile telecoms to credit cards. The undercurrent of protectionism in Mr Biden’s plans could insulate the economy from competition abroad, sapping its vitality. Ultimately there exists a tension between Mr Biden’s desire to build new infrastructure quickly and cheaply and his plan to favour domestic workers and supply chains, that is likely to become far more acute over time.
The final risk is America’s long-term fiscal position (see chart 5). Even after the covid-19 stimulus fades, and before any deficit-widening steps that the next president makes, America’s deficit was projected to soar above 5% of GDP in perpetuity, with public debt reaching about 200% of GDP by 2050. Today the Federal Reserve is buying much of the net new debt issuance by the government, as fiscal and monetary policy begin to merge.

For now this strange new fiscal regime seems sustainable. But over time the risk of the politicisation of the Fed will increase. And the economy and financial system will become vulnerable to any eventual rise in inflation. A debate over these risks looks likely to occur when the first term of Jay Powell, the Fed’s chairman, finishes in early 2022. But so far Mr Biden has no major plan for redesigning the macroeconomic architecture or for getting America’s long-term finances on a stable footing.
Better days
Mr Biden, a life-long pragmatist, looks likely to govern as one. Stylistically that means getting sensible advice, behaving consistently and working with America’s institutions. While he may lack a formal economic doctrine, his goal will be to get the economy out of its covid-19 slump, improve social mobility and build a better safety net. He will place his biggest bet on giving a long-term boost in infrastructure and climate policy, and then try to moderate the wilder forces swirling around America’s electorate and polity, including the more socialist ideas of the hard left, chauvinistic protectionism and the indifference of the right towards America’s social fabric. The claim that a Biden presidency would destroy American capitalism is silly. If he can restore competent management and make the economy work better for ordinary people Mr Biden’s last job in politics will be done. ■

1797,"IF THE PROPAGANDISTS of the Taliban had scripted the collapse of America’s 20-year mission to reshape Afghanistan, they could not have come up with more harrowing images. As insurgents swept into Kabul, desperate Afghans, terrified about what the victorious zealots might do, chased departing American cargo planes down the runway, trying to clamber into the landing gear and inevitably falling to their deaths. The American-backed government had surrendered without a fight—something that American officials were insisting would not happen only days before. Afghans were left in such a horrifying bind that clinging to the wheels of a hurtling aircraft seemed their best option.
America has spent $2trn in Afghanistan; more than 2,000 American lives have been lost, not to mention countless Afghan ones. And yet, even if Afghans are more prosperous now than when America invaded, Afghanistan is back to square one. The Taliban control more of the country than they did when they lost power, they are better armed, having seized the weapons America showered on the Afghan army, and they have now won the ultimate affirmation: defeating a superpower.

The insurgents have made a show of magnanimity, pledging that they will not take revenge on those who worked for the toppled government and insisting that they will respect women’s rights, within their interpretation of Islamic law. But that interpretation kept most girls out of school and most women confined to their homes when the group was last in power, in the 1990s. Brutal punishments—floggings, stonings, amputations—were common. The freedoms that urban Afghans took for granted over the past 20 years have just gone up in smoke. It is an appalling outcome for Afghanistan’s 39m people, and deeply damaging for America.
It is not surprising that America failed to turn Afghanistan into a democracy. Nation-building is difficult, and few imagined that it could become Switzerland. Nor was it unreasonable for Joe Biden, America’s president, to want to draw the conflict to a close. America has spent 20 years in a place of only modest strategic importance about which most American voters have long since ceased to care. The original reason for the invasion—to dismantle al-Qaeda’s main base of operations—was largely achieved, though that achievement could now be reversed.
The claim that America is showing itself to be a fickle ally by allowing the Afghan government to fall is also overblown, given the duration, scale and expense of the American deployment. The defunct regime in Kabul was not an ally in the way that Germany or Japan is. It was far weaker, more corrupt and completely dependent on America for its survival.
But none of that absolved America of the responsibility to withdraw in an orderly fashion. Mr Biden failed to show even a modicum of care for the welfare of ordinary Afghans. The irony is that America had a plan to do just that, which had been in the works for several years. It had hugely scaled down its garrison, from around 100,000 troops in 2011 to fewer than 10,000 by 2017, along with a similar number from other NATO countries. They were not supposed to defeat the Taliban, but prevent the Afghan army’s collapse, largely through air power, and so force the Taliban to the negotiating table.

Apologists for Mr Biden argue that his predecessor, Donald Trump, had already scuppered this plan by trying to rush it to a conclusion before last year’s presidential election in America. It is true that Mr Trump was so desperate to strike a quick deal that he accepted preposterous terms, agreeing to end America’s deployment without even securing a ceasefire, let alone a clear plan to end the civil war. He had already reduced the American presence to little more than 2,000 soldiers by the time Mr Biden took office, and had promised to get the rest out by May 1st.
But Mr Biden did not have to stick to this agreement. In fact, he didn’t entirely, refusing to keep to the original timetable. The Taliban were clearly not holding up their end of the bargain, pressing their advantage on the battlefield instead of negotiating in good faith with the Afghan government. That could have been grounds to halt or reverse the American withdrawal. There was little political pressure within America to bring the war to a speedy conclusion. Yet Mr Biden was working to an arbitrary and flippant deadline of his own, seeking to end the war by the 20th anniversary of 9/11. Although the speed of the Afghan government’s implosion surprised most observers, including this newspaper, America’s soldiers and politicians were among the most naively optimistic, insisting that a total collapse was a vanishingly remote prospect. And when it became clear that the Afghan army was melting away, Mr Biden pressed on intransigently, despite the likely consequences.
As a result, America’s power to deter its enemies and reassure its friends has diminished. Its intelligence was flawed, its planning rigid, its leaders capricious and its concern for allies minimal. That is likely to embolden jihadists everywhere, who will take the Taliban’s victory as evidence that God is on their side. It will also encourage adventurism on the part of hostile governments such as Russia’s or China’s, and worry America’s friends. Mr Biden has defended the withdrawal by arguing that Afghanistan was a distraction from more pressing problems, such as America’s rivalry with China. But by leaving Afghanistan in such a chaotic fashion, Mr Biden will have made those other problems harder to deal with.

After the fall
The shambolic withdrawal does not reduce the obligation of America and its allies to ordinary Afghans, but increases it. They should use what leverage they still have to urge moderation on the Taliban, especially in their treatment of women. The displaced will need humanitarian aid. Western countries should also admit more Afghan refugees, the ranks of whom are likely to swell, and provide generous assistance to Afghanistan’s neighbours to look after those who remain in the region. The haste of European leaders to declare that they cannot take in many persecuted Afghans even as violent zealots seize control is almost as lamentable as America’s botched exit. It is too late to save Afghanistan, but there is still time to help its people. ■

1798,"TO PREVENT THE next pandemic, it would help to know how this one started. However, the answer to that question might embarrass China’s rulers. So they have obstructed investigations into how the virus emerged, and promoted far-fetched theories about it having originated somewhere else. The world thus has only a shaky understanding of what happened in Hubei province in the second half of 2019.
American spooks are about to finish a 90-day review of covid-19’s possible origins, on President Joe Biden’s orders. It is unlikely to reach a firm conclusion. Yet it is clear that the answer China least wants to hear—that the virus could have leaked from a lab in Wuhan, or been picked up by a researcher collecting samples in the field—is plausible. And it would not be the first time this has happened. The flu pandemic of 1977, which killed 700,000 people, is now believed to have begun with a lab leak in north-east Asia—possibly in China, possibly in the Soviet Union. With new laboratories being built all the time to handle dangerous pathogens, and with the era of synthetic biology just around the corner, the task of tightening lab biosafety has become urgent.

People who work with deadly pathogens do so with scandalously little transparency or supervision. Rules in some places are not legally binding or subject to independent oversight. That has to change. The world needs to know who is working with which pathogens, where, and under what sort of safety protocols. (Intelligence agencies do not see this as part of their remit, but they should.) International standards are needed, and a global body to advise on the most dangerous kinds of work. This will be hard to accomplish, but there is a precedent. A committee of the World Health Organisation (WHO) monitors and inspects the two labs that hold smallpox, a deadly virus that was eradicated in the wild through vaccination, and reviews proposed research.
America, which could be leading the way, is not. Researchers who receive federal grants to study pathogens have to follow federal rules. Private labs are not so constrained. This will not do. Ideally there would be an agreed set of basic rules, enforced by a watchdog that is independent of the bodies that fund research. The backers of a project cannot be neutral arbiters of its safety.
Many other countries follow America’s lead on biosafety. So if it improves its rules and procedures, others will, too. That could be a step towards a proper set of global norms. And it would be in every country’s interest, even China’s, to abide by such norms. Meetings this year to discuss a pandemic treaty offer a chance to harmonise rules on lab biosafety. Organisations such as the WHO, the G7 and the OECD could also do more to promote transparency and security.
Governments need to ask whether certain kinds of research are too risky to be allowed. Gain-of-function research, which genetically alters organisms such as viruses in ways that can make them more dangerous, deserves special scrutiny. So does viral collection in the wild.
New tools are needed as well as new rules. Real-time genomic surveillance at border crossings could catch novel pathogens as they emerge. Sewage and air could be sampled more widely. Ways to create vaccines even faster should be explored.
And if some scientists complain that all this will make their work costlier and harder, there is an obvious rejoinder. Perhaps 15m people have died directly of covid-19, and the resulting economic damage has impoverished many millions more. If better biosafety reduces the chance of another pandemic even slightly, it will be cheap at the price. ■

1799,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Media entrepreneur Byron Allen has raised $10 billion in preferred equity and debt for his bid for U.S. regional TV station operator Tegna Inc (TGNA.N), hoping to prevail over a rival offer from investment firms Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) and Standard General LP, people familiar with the matter said.
The financing is backed by a consortium of 14 banks and 10 investors, including Ares Management Corp (ARES.N), Fortress Investment Group, Oaktree Capital Management and Michael Milken's family office, one of the sources said.
Ares is leading a $2.2 billion preferred equity investment in support of Allen's financing package, another of the sources added.
Tegna could choose a winning bidder as early as this month, the sources said.
Spokespeople for Tegna, Apollo, Oaktree and Michael Milken declined to comment.
Allen, who acquired the Weather Channel TV network for $300 million in 2018, made a $23 per share offer for Tegna in September, while Apollo and Standard General offered $22 per share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tegna wants both bidders to raise their offers, one of the sources said. It also expects assurances from both bidders that they will entertain all regulatory demands necessary to complete the acquisition, and views the Apollo/Standard General bid as most likely to raise antitrust concerns, the source added.
Apollo owns 33 TV stations in 20 markets through its portfolio company Cox Media Group, while Standard General owns four TV stations, according to their websites.
Tegna reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday and said on a call with analysts it was still evaluating acquisition proposals versus its stand-alone prospects.

1800,"ON OCTOBER 17TH Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who now runs a private research consultancy, appeared on ABC News. Mr Steele was being interviewed about a dossier that he had provided to the Democratic Party and to the FBI in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. It reported on Donald Trump’s business interests in Russia and his team’s relationships there. But most explosively, it also alleged he had possibly been captured on video indulging curious sexual tastes in the presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Moscow in 2013. Mr Steele, asked whether he believes that this video exists, said, “I think it probably does.”
That seems less and less likely. On November 4th John Durham, the special counsel for the Department of Justice, who was appointed by William Barr in 2019 to investigate the FBI investigation into Mr Trump’s supposed links with Russia, indicted Igor Danchenko, a Russian national and professional Russia expert based in America. Mr Danchenko is alleged to have lied about how he collected information for the Steele dossier (knowingly lying to FBI agents is a crime). According to the indictment, Mr Danchenko got some of the rumours he sent to Mr Steele from a Russophile American PR executive, named by the New York Times as Charles Dolan, who previously worked on Clinton campaigns. Mr Danchenko allegedly hid this from the FBI when he was interviewed (he denies it).

Right-wing media in America have turned this into a storm. Kimberley Strassel, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, wrote that the indictments show that the Steele dossier ought to be called the “Clinton Dossier”, and argued in effect that Mr Trump was a victim of a giant orchestrated conspiracy to make out that he was in (a rather damp) bed with Russia. Others, such as Fox News, have made much of Mr Danchenko’s work from 2005 to 2010 for the Brookings Institution, a centrist think-tank in Washington, DC. Many also suggest that the Mueller investigation, a federal probe which looked into Mr Trump’s team’s links with Russia, began with the Steele dossier. Mr Trump himself said in a TV interview that the findings are “only going to get deeper and deeper”—and would implicate Democrats.
In reality, the conspiracy is not so deep. An earlier investigation by Michael Horowitz, the Inspector-General of the Department of Justice, revealed many of the shortcomings of the Steele dossier. But it also showed that it was not what sparked the FBI’s investigation into the former president’s Russian links. A tip-off from the Australian government in July 2016 did that. The Mueller investigation, which emerged from the original FBI investigation, made almost no mention of the allegations from the Steele dossier. Instead, it focused on the activities of various of Mr Trump’s associates, who certainly did meet Russian officials, and also communicated with WikiLeaks over the release of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee by the Russian state. A bipartisan Senate report released last year assessed that Mr Trump was aware of this. In April, the Treasury department sanctioned an associate of Paul Manafort, one of Mr Trump’s campaign managers, for feeding information to Russian intelligence.
So Mr Durham has very much not exonerated Mr Trump from having shady dealings with Russia. But he has underlined that the most lurid allegations were, at best, unsubstantiated rumour. That is embarrassing to the FBI, which used the Steele dossier in part to justify a wiretap on one Trump adviser, Carter Page.
But it is also damning of many journalists and Democrats. The Steele dossier was presented by many in the more left-leaning media as a highly credible investigation by a highly respected British former spook, involving “deep cover sources inside Russia” (in the words of one MSNBC anchor). In fact it was outsourced to people outside Russia such as Mr Danchenko, who seemingly gathered information by reading newspapers and drinking with pals.
What happens next? Mr Durham’s investigation has been going on for over two years and, so far, has produced only three indictments: as well as Mr Danchenko, there is Michael Sussmann, a cyber-security lawyer also alleged to have made false statements to the FBI, and a junior FBI lawyer who has admitted altering a document to strengthen a wiretap request. There may well be more. Yet the main outcome of the investigation will be to help Mr Trump move the conversation about his Russian links on from his own actions to the tendency of liberal journalists to believe the absolute worst about him. For the former president, that is a pretty good result. ■

1801,"NEW DELHI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - India's financial crime fighting agency has ordered Future Group to submit documents related to its 2019 deal with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) as part of an investigation into possible breach of foreign investment laws, according to sources and a notice seen by Reuters.
The demand indicates heightened scrutiny of a deal which is at the heart of legal battles between Amazon and Future after the Indian company decided to sell its retail assets to rival Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) for $3.4 billion in 2020.
That transaction has been put on hold by an arbitrator and Indian courts after Amazon argued Future had violated its contracts with the U.S. company by entering into the sale. Future denies that, and says Amazon is illegally exerting control over the Indian firm's business decisions.
In a confidential notice dated Oct. 28, the Enforcement Directorate agency asked a Future unit to submit all correspondence including emails between Amazon and the Indian group in respect of the investment the U.S. firm made in Future two years ago. Reuters has reviewed a copy of the notice.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the notice was part of an ongoing investigation by the Indian agency to establish whether there were any violations of foreign investment law when Amazon made the $200 million investment in Future's gift voucher unit, Future Coupons.
The notice has not previously been reported and was sent to Future Coupons, which was given 15 days to respond.
The Enforcement Directorate, which typically does not make details of its investigations public, did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon and Future also did not respond.
'RELEVANT FOR INVESTIGATION'
The dispute centres around three commercial agreements signed between Future and Amazon entities in 2019, which a Singapore arbitration panel - also hearing the dispute - has said must be read together while reviewing the transaction, and not separately as Future argues.
But Future contends conflating the commercial agreements would effectively mean its 2019 Amazon deal violated Indian law which prohibits such foreign investments in the retail sector without government approvals.
The Singapore panel has so far backed Amazon's contentions, saying Future breached its agreements with the U.S. company and must not proceed with the Reliance deal while the proceedings are ongoing.
The Indian enforcement agency in its two-page notice also asked Future for copies of various legal filings and supporting documents submitted by Amazon and Future group representatives to Indian courts and the Singapore arbitration panel.
The Enforcement Directorate ""considers that information/documents specified ... would be useful for and relevant to the investigation being conducted,"" the notice added.
Future is India's second largest retailer with more than 1,700 retail outlets, including popular chain Big Bazaar. Before the Reliance deal, Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's assets itself if regulations changed to allow that.",3
1802,"FOR A DEMOCRACY to survive, it needs democrats. When large parts of opposing political camps start to see each other as enemies to be crushed, rather than mere adversaries with whom to compete peacefully, then democracy comes under grave threat. That was the case in Spain in the 1930s, on the eve of its civil war, and in Brazil and Chile in the run-up to military coups in 1964 and 1973 respectively. In the past few weeks Peru has seemed worryingly unstable, after a polarised election campaign split the country down the middle.
The official count gave victory in a run-off on June 6th to Pedro Castillo, a teacher and union leader running for a far-left party, by just 44,000 votes (out of 17.6m) over his conservative opponent, Keiko Fujimori. Ms Fujimori’s supporters have spent the past month crying fraud. They want to annul 200,000 of Mr Castillo’s votes, alleging they were falsified. But on election day international observers found no serious irregularities. The United States and the European Union have praised the conduct of the election. Ms Fujimori’s lawyers have produced no proof of fraud. Nobody has come forward to back up their claims that signatures were forged. The electoral tribunal has so far rejected the allegations. It appears poised to declare Mr Castillo president.

Will the conservative camp accept defeat? Ms Fujimori has said she will respect the tribunal’s ruling, though when she narrowly lost in 2016 she set out to thwart the centrist who defeated her. Others have been cruder. In a bizarre development Vladimiro Montesinos, the corrupt spy chief when Ms Fujimori’s father ruled Peru as an autocrat in the 1990s, appeared in a taped phone call from his prison cell to a collaborator to be proposing to bribe members of the electoral tribunal. Scores of retired military officers last month signed a letter calling on the armed forces not to recognise an “illegitimate” president. A former presidential candidate has called for “a civilian-military alliance”. This smacks of trying to overthrow democracy in the name of its defence. “It’s very dangerous to start questioning the rules,” says Paula Muñoz, a political scientist at the Pacific University in Lima.
But there are legitimate reasons for democrats to worry about Mr Castillo, too—and pressing ones, since it is he who is set to become president on July 28th. His party is Marxist-Leninist. Its founder and leader, Vladimir Cerrón, spent a decade in Cuba. Its programme includes large-scale nationalisations. Mr Cerrón is being investigated over claims of illegal campaign financing (which he denies). Mr Castillo’s organised supporters include followers of a successor movement to the Shining Path, a terrorist group whose insurgency cost some 70,000 lives between 1980 and 1992.
Mr Castillo failed to use the run-off election to move convincingly to the centre. Instead of distancing himself from Mr Cerrón, at a meeting last month he agreed he would share power with him. Mr Castillo’s statements have been contradictory. “We are not communists, we are not going to take anybody’s property away,” he said before meeting business leaders. “We will respect this constitution.” Days later he said his first act as president would be to ask Congress to convoke a constituent assembly to write a new constitution “with the smell, colour and taste of the people”. This was the device used by leftist populists such as Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and Bolivia’s Evo Morales to concentrate power and try to rule indefinitely as autocrats.
Mr Castillo’s position is weaker than that of those leaders. He won only 15% of the vote in the election’s first round; his allies hold 42 of the 130 seats in the new Congress. He won only because many moderate Peruvians couldn’t bring themselves to vote for Ms Fujimori. But he can draw on the force of the teachers’ union and the ronderos (rural vigilantes). And he will have access to state resources.
At best the likely outcome is chaotic, poor governance. Mr Castillo has shown little ability to build alliances or a team capable of governing. He will take over a country still reeling from the pandemic and its associated recession. Peruvians want a government that deals with their problems, rather than embarking on a new constitution which polls show a majority do not want. In that case the question is how long the country will be able to tolerate an incompetent president. Congress has thrown out two presidents in the past five years. Before too long Peruvians could find themselves going back to the ballot box. Or they may face something far worse.",2

Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority published its report into the proposed takeover of Arm, a British chip designer, by Nvidia, America’s most valuable semiconductor manufacturer. The CMA concluded that the deal would result in less competition and called for an official investigation. The government has already voiced separate concerns about the takeover on national-security grounds.
Virgin Orbit said it would list on the Nasdaq stockmarket by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in a deal that includes an investment by Boeing.

1804,"ONCE UPON a time, no speech by Boris Johnson was complete without a promise to “defeat the coronavirus”. Yet his address on September 14th setting out his covid-19 plans for the winter ahead was a more modest affair. The best the prime minister could come up with was a vow to “turn jabs, jabs, jabs into jobs, jobs, jobs”.
Britain is no longer at war with the coronavirus. Instead, it is working out how best to manage its presence. Its aim is to keep the economy open while saving hospitals from being overwhelmed, which in recent months has meant accepting a high case rate (see chart).

That has been possible only because a quick and well-targeted vaccine roll-out has kept deaths at European rather than American levels, dampening public concern. According to Public Health England, immunisation has prevented nearly 25m infections and more than 110,000 deaths.

Despite the start of the autumn school term, and predictions that children mingling would increase infection, case numbers appear instead to be falling. But the worry is that they will rise once more during winter—just as the health service comes under the most pressure. Thus the government announced tweaks to its vaccination programme: first jabs will be offered to 12- to 15-year-olds, and boosters to the vulnerable and over-50s.
Both calls were made later than in many other rich countries. The government’s advisory committee on vaccination held off on recommending jabs for youngsters, arguing that although the health benefits were marginally greater than the known harms, the uncertainty was unacceptably high. On September 13th Britain’s chief medical officers advised the government to proceed nevertheless, because of covid-19’s impact on children’s education and mental health.
The decision to offer booster shots was made in response to evidence of waning protection, particularly among the elderly and vulnerable. In offering top-ups, Britain joined America, Germany and Israel in ignoring the World Health Organisation, which argues that the jabs would be better used in countries where vaccination rates are low. Early evidence from Israel suggests boosters are at least successful in increasing protection.
The hope is that these decisions will enable Britain to avoid future restrictions on behaviour. Sajid Javid, the secretary of state for health and social care, announced that the government had rethought plans to introduce vaccine passports. The U-turn was not because of changing evidence regarding their effectiveness, but because of party management. One backbencher argued that passports would set a “dangerous precedent for the advance of the bio-security state”. Others are simply tired of covid-19 impositions.
Ministers have, however, kept open the option of requiring passports in nightclubs and crowded stadiums, and of reintroducing compulsory masking and advisory working from home, should cases rise to dangerous levels in winter. These changes could be implemented “at short notice in response to concerning data”. But the government’s plans include no mention of the lockdowns that have plagued the past 18 months. ■

1805,"FOR FIFTY years the Scottish National Party (SNP) ran on oil. The discovery of deposits beneath the North Sea in 1969 transformed Britain’s public finances, and ignited the separatist movement. Before the independence referendum of 2014, Alex Salmond, the party’s leader, told Scots that Westminster had frittered away their riches, pointing to Norway’s sovereign wealth fund as an example to follow. Even after defeat, Nicola Sturgeon, his successor, charmed oil executives, stressing their shared ambition to suck the seabed dry.
These days the party is conflicted. Increasingly, the young and idealistic independence movement is stirred by climate change, an issue to which it argues Britain’s Conservative government pays insufficient attention. Yet the Scottish government, normally attentive to the desires of its supporters, is struggling to wean itself off the black stuff. Nationalism’s animating cause, and for decades its fiscal panacea, is not easy to give up.

The tension has become a headache for Ms Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister. Siccar Point Energy, a developer backed by the private-equity firms Blackstone and Bluewater, has applied for permission to start drilling in the Cambo oilfield off Shetland, which would fill as many as 800m barrels of oil over 25 years. The decision lies with the British government, a fact that would not normally stop Ms Sturgeon from expressing a view.
This time it has. On August 12th Ms Sturgeon wrote to Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, urging him to review whether drilling was compatible with the country’s emissions targets. Her own verdict was left unsaid. She acted after being confronted in her constituency by climate activists, to whom she also failed to give an answer. The SNP is negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party, which opposes the drilling and supports independence. If a deal is struck, it would cement a cross-party majority in the Scottish Parliament for a new referendum.
The SNP’s leadership knows the economics of resource nationalism are weaker than ever. Once, North Sea taxes went some way to fill the theoretical gap between public expenditure and tax receipts in an independent Scotland. Before the referendum, Mr Salmond declared the country to be on the cusp of a “second oil boom”, and said revenues could total £57bn ($90bn) in the next six years—nearly double the forecast of the British government’s fiscal watchdog.

Instead, they collapsed (see chart), repeatedly underperforming forecasts. Tax receipts came to just £414m last year, according to figures published on August 18th. Some 44bn barrels of oil (or the equivalent in gas) have been drawn from the ageing North Sea basin in the past 50 years; 10bn-20bn may remain, of which just 5bn have been confirmed or are reckoned to be extractable.
But the sector still employs tens of thousands of Scots, mostly in parliamentary seats in the north-east which teeter between the SNP and the pro-oil Conservatives. The nationalists’ ambition has been to replace oil jobs with new ones in green energy. Wind farms have proliferated, but they have been largely constructed abroad. A report by the Scottish Government’s “just-transition commission” published in March warned that the failure risks undermining the support of working-class Scots for decarbonisation.
Ms Sturgeon thus finds herself straddling two political constituencies, and two visions of independence: one green, the other black. She has happily opposed fracking and nuclear energy in Scotland, despite both strictly sitting under the control of the government in Westminster. On the Cambo oilfield, she is content for Mr Johnson to make the call. Once the SNP declared: “It’s Scotland’s oil.” These days it’s London’s problem. ■",2
1806,"AS ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russia’s leading opposition politician, was being hauled off to jail in January, four editors of “Doxa”, an online student magazine, posted a YouTube video. The two men and two women were students at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, generally considered to be Russia’s best liberal university. They spoke out about the intimidation being deployed by the staff of schools and universities in order to dissuade young people from joining a planned protest against Mr Navalny’s mistreatment.
The four appealed to universities across the country. “Expelling students for taking part in peaceful action is illegal. All you will achieve is to destroy science and education in Russia,” said Armen Aramyan, one of the four. But they also appealed to fellow students. “Don’t be scared and don’t abstain. It is our lawful right to express protest by any peaceful means. The state has declared war on youth, but the youth is us and we will certainly prevail,” said another of the quartet.

On April 14th, as part of that war, Russian prosecutors arrested Mr Aramyan and the three other “Doxa” editors and charged them with “encouraging minors to take part in illegal action”, by which they meant the protest in January. Their video has been taken down and they have been under house arrest ever since. The case has brought them recognition beyond anything they could have imagined when they recorded their video.
The unsuccessful attempt to kill Mr Navalny with poison on a plane a year ago marked the start of a new wave of repression in Russia. Other opposition politicians have been barred from public appearances, chased out of the country or even arrested. The few remaining independent media outlets have been barred as “undesirable” or stigmatised as “foreign agents”. The latest such “foreign agent” is TV Rain, an independent online channel that extensively covered the protests; the designation means that advertising will dry up, and the station may end up having to close.
But going after politicians and the media, and arresting students and activists, is no longer sufficient. The Kremlin is now trying to get a grip over schools and universities in a more systematic way. In the past nine months some 20 universities and institutes across Russia have had their deans replaced. In July the Kremlin “accepted” the resignation of Yaroslav Kuzminov, the head of the Higher School of Economics, better known as HSE, Russia’s first and most successful post-Soviet university.
In a parting note on social media Mr Kuzminov claimed he was stepping down to concentrate on his work as an economist. Few took this at face value. “He would never have left of his own volition. This was the Kremlin’s decision,” wrote Kirill Rogov, a political analyst.
Mr Kuzminov had long navigated his way around the Kremlin to carve out some space for his university while also providing advice to the government. That space has now shrunk and the advice is no longer needed. His departure marks the end of an era. He helped set up the HSE in the early 1990s, as Russians newly liberated from Soviet controls sought ways to connect with the West. At around the same time St Petersburg University, Russia’s oldest, teamed up with Bard College from America to set up Smolny College, Russia’s first liberal arts and science college. It was backed by Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister who is a rare liberal voice in Mr Putin’s entourage.
These institutions survived Russia’s turn towards authoritarianism in the 2000s. The Kremlin did not fear them, not least because young Russians in the 2000s and early 2010s were among Mr Putin’s most loyal supporters. It was also partly due to a centuries-long tradition in which autocratic rulers allowed a degree of freedom to a few exclusive institutions, says Andrei Zorin, a professor of Russian at Oxford University. The aim was to nurture a sophisticated cadre familiar with Western ideas and technology, who might then modernise and strengthen the state.
But now any Western influence is seen as a threat. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the Security Council of Russia and a key ideologue of Russia’s new isolationism, said in a recent interview that “the destructive liberal political forces [of the West] are paying particular attention to the educated and successful young people in prestigious universities.”
Less than a fortnight before Mr Kuzminov’s departure, prosecutors banned Bard College from Russia, designating it an “undesirable foreign organisation”. And a recently passed law put all educational activity in Russia, from popular science lectures to public discussion clubs, under tight state control.
Russian students and young people, once lauded by the Kremlin as part of Mr Putin’s base, are now seen as one of the biggest dangers to its power. The shift in young people’s sentiment first became visible in 2017, when Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption videos triggered protests that were dominated by students and high-school graduates. They were also angered by the Kremlin’s infringement of their personal freedoms and attempts to impose “patriotic” and “traditional” values on them. At around the same time, Mr Aramyan and his friends started publishing “Doxa”.
Over the past few years, Mr Putin and his circle have gradually become alienated from the young and the economically active. “In fact it is not the young cohort that is an outlier, but Putin’s own generation that is increasingly at odds with the rest of the population,” says Ekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political scientist. Surveys show that young people rarely watch television (the main vehicle for government propaganda). Instead they rely on social media and the internet, which the Kremlin is now targeting. They have a more positive view of the West, particularly Europe, and care more about human rights than they do about the greatness of the state or past victories, the staples of Mr Putin’s ideology.
With parliamentary elections due later this month, on September 19th, and a presidential one in 2024, Mr Aramyan says a crunch is approaching. “Either they will purge and suppress everything in sight, or we will deprive them of their majority.” Mr Putin, who will turn 70 next year, has plenty of repressive tools at his disposal. But the young have one crucial advantage. Time is on their side, not his. ■

1807,"NASA and the U.S. government are looking for proposals on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon with the goal of having energy on the moon that's not reliant on the sun by the end of the decade.
NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory formally put out a request for proposals from the public on Friday for a fission surface power system. 
In a collaboration between NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab, the two agencies are specifically looking to establish a source of power that does not rely on the sun or solar power for missions on the moon.
'Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,' Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. 
Should the lunar nuclear reactors be a success in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next stop would be Mars, according to the world's leading space agency.
NASA states that such fission surface power could likely provide long-term power for human lunar colonies, regardless of environmental conditions. 
'I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,' Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement.  
The reactor itself would be built on earth before being sent to the moon.
For those who wish to send a proposal, NASA says submitted plans for the fission surface power system will need to include a uranium-fueled reactor core, a thermal management system to keep the reactor at the proper temperature, a system to convert the nuclear power into usable energy, and a distribution system that provides no less than 40 kilowatts of electric power. 
Said power system proposals will need to supply continuous power for 10 years in the lunar environment.
The reactor must also be capable of turning itself on and off without human oversight, that it can operate from a lunar lander deck, and that it is mobile enough to be transported from the lander to a different lunar site for operation if necessary. 
Successful proposals for the reactor must weigh no more than 13,200 pounds, and be able to fit inside a 12-foot diameter cylinder that's 18 feet long when launched from earth to the moon. 
The deadline for proposal requests for an initial system design must be submitted by February 19, the outlet reports.  
This is not the first collaborative project between NASA and the Idaho National Laboratory, with the lab most recently helping build a radioisotope power system for the space agency's Mar's rover Perseverance, which converts heat that's generated from the decay or plutonium-238 into electrical power.
The rover landed on the Martian surface back in February and has remained active on the red planet ever since.  
The Energy Department has also recently been looking for private businesses to collaborate with on various nuclear power plans, most notably a new generation of smaller power plants ranging from small modular rectors to small mobile reactors that can quickly be set up in the field and be removed when no longer needed. ",-2
1808,"Editor’s note (April 29th 2021): This article has been updated to include denials that China’s population is shrinking
THE COMMUNIST PARTY has long known that, partly as the result of its brutal birth-control policies, China’s population would soon peak and start to shrink. It has been startled, however, by how rapidly that moment has drawn near. Now, it looks as if it might have arrived.
In November the country completed its ten-yearly census, and said it would announce the results in early April. As May arrives with no announcement, leaks suggest that the results have not been published because they are so shocking, and the party is in a flap about how to break the news. The Financial Times reported on April 27th that the census will show that the population has fallen below 1.4bn, still higher than the 1.34bn in the 2010 census, but lower than it was a year before.

Leaks are sometimes wrong, or reflect early estimates which are revised upwards. Global Times, a party newspaper, denied the report in the Financial Times, saying census results are “extremely unlikely” to indicate shrinkage starting last year. Oddly, it said a result showing a lower population in 2020 than in 2019 is likely to be “a statistical error”. The paper also acknowledged that a decline is likely to occur by next year. On April 29th, in a one-line statement, the National Bureau of Statistics said the population continued to grow in 2020. Either way, China’s demography is raising difficult questions for the party.
In 2015 the government relaxed the one-child policy, allowing most people to have a second child. The birth rate briefly rose, but soon fell again. In 2019 the number of new sprogs was the lowest since 1961, when a Mao-made famine killed millions and the population was half its present size.

A trickle of recent provincial data on birth numbers points in the same direction. Local figures on new birth registrations (separate from the census) offer a preview of what the census figures will probably show. For the first three quarters of 2020 the south-western city of Guiyang reported a 32% fall in births compared with the previous year. In the eastern city of Weifang births were down by 26% in the first half of the year. Hefty declines were reported elsewhere, unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.
There are also indications that China’s total fertility rate (the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime) has dropped faster and further than previously thought. Chinese planners have assumed a rate of 1.8, but some Chinese scholars (and the World Bank) say it is between 1.6 and 1.7. A working paper released in March by China’s central bank suggests the rate is no more than 1.5.

Such numbers make grim reading for the party. China’s working-age population, defined as those between 15 and 59 years old, has been falling since 2011. Meanwhile the share of people aged over 60 has risen from 10.4% in 2000 to 17.9% in 2018. The latest guess is that by 2050 one-third of Chinese will be in their 60s or older. Supporting them will put a huge burden on the young, unless the oldies can be persuaded to work longer. In a report published in 2019 the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warned that China’s main pension fund could run out of money by 2035.
A second demographic worry is the continued imbalance between men and women. Since the 1980s birth restrictions, combined with a preference for boys and easy access to prenatal scans, led to the widespread abortion of girls. In 2019 there were 30m more Chinese men than women and the disparity in the number of marriageable age will only grow. The government worries that young men who cannot find a mate may become a source of unrest.
Low birth rates will put more pressure on the party to abandon all its coercive birth-control policies. Fines still apply for having more than two babies, though enforcement varies. Lately the loudest calls for this have come from officials in the three provinces that comprise China’s north-eastern rustbelt. Birth rates in Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning are only about half the national average.
In February China’s National Health Commission said those three provinces could start allowing people to decide for themselves how many children to have. That is a right people in other countries take for granted. But it is unlikely to boost the region’s overall birth rate, or its flagging economy. A sociologist notes that local youngsters are fleeing to parts of China with better weather and more jobs.
“Most people want no baby or at most one baby, so even if you remove all the limits right now, it won’t have much effect,” says Zhang Xiaochen of Duke Kunshan University. Chinese have grown accustomed to the idea of a small family. High costs for housing, health and education further discourage fecundity.
Child-rearing out of wedlock is both socially unacceptable and officially discouraged, even as young Chinese are delaying getting married or shunning it entirely. Last year the number of nuptials fell by 12% to a little over 8m, the lowest since 2003 and well down on the peak of 13.5m in 2013. In 2005 almost half of those who got hitched did so between the age of 20 and 24; in 2019 only about one-fifth did so.
Officials are keen on policies such as cash payments to encourage parents to have a second child. But evidence from the 50 countries trying to boost birth rates suggests that this is hard. Providing cheap child care is perhaps the most effective policy. But that is much more costly and complex to deliver than handouts.
James Liang, an economist at Peking University, believes that China’s distorted demographics will limit the size of its market and talent pool and thus hinder its rise. China will never accept significant numbers of immigrants, he says, so America will have a big advantage. In the next ten or 20 years, China will continue to do well, but then America “will retake leadership and China will never catch up”.
The falling birth rate will bring forward another battle. A new five-year plan includes vague proposals to increase China’s retirement ages, which in cities is currently 60 for men and 55 or 50 for women, well below the rich-country average of 64. That will be deeply unpopular. And lengthening working lives also risks driving fertility down further, because many families rely on grandparents for child care. There are no easy ways out. ■

1809,"IN MARCH, WHEN Tashnuva Anan Shishir appeared on Bangladeshi television screens, she created history as the country’s first transgender news anchor. A few weeks later a madrassa exclusively for khwaja saras opened in Pakistan. In India “Phirki”, a television show that ran for 225 episodes last year, portrayed in unprecedented detail the lives of hijras.
South Asia has a plethora of terms for people who identify neither as male nor female. Apart from hijra (which is the best known) and khwaja sara (which is mostly used in Pakistan), they include aravani, kinnar, kothi and shiv-shakthi. Many advocacy groups and NGOs favour “transgender”, while governments prefer “third gender”. Estimates of the number of non-binary people in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan run from 500,000 to several million.

Since 2014 all three countries have recognised third gender as a legal category. In 2016 a small group of Muslim clerics in Pakistan set a precedent by ruling that hijras can marry and be buried with other Muslims. By 2019 India and Pakistan had both passed transgender protection acts. Bangladesh introduced a scheme to hire hijras for government jobs in 2015, and earlier this year started offering generous tax breaks to companies that employ them.
The creative and legislative energy has, however, also highlighted the problems inherent in naming and defining gender identities. Many of the people who ought to benefit from the new laws are riled by what they see as lawmakers’ perpetuation of long-held misconceptions, such as the idea that hijras are intersex (of indeterminate gender). Most hijras are deemed male at birth but feel female, and are usually attracted to men. Other critics find modern gender discourse troublesome. They object to the idea that “hijra” and “transgender” are synonymous, and worry that the foreign import risks lowering hijras’ status.
South Asia has a long history of gender diversity. Hijras feature in the mythology surrounding Ram, an important Hindu deity, who is said to have rewarded their devotion with spiritual gifts. Records from the 18th century describe effeminate men, dressed as women, who offered blessings at births and marriages in elite society. In some parts of the subcontinent, hijra communities led by gurus were granted rent-free land and the right to collect donations, says Jessica Hinchy of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, the author of a book on hijras in colonial India. Belief in their power to impart blessings (and curses) remains part of the culture in India, as well as in Muslim-majority Bangladesh and Pakistan.
In the 19th century, however, British colonial rule reversed their fortunes. Hijras were relabelled eunuchs, a term normally reserved for castrated men. By the 1850s hijras had lost their state patronage. They fell foul of new legislation, including Section 377 of the Indian penal code of 1861, which outlawed homosexuality, and various iterations of the Criminal Tribes Act, which forced “eunuchs”, along with other groups deemed hereditarily criminal, to register themselves. It also made it illegal for them to dance in public, dress in women’s clothes or reside with children.
The declining status of hijras continued well into the 20th century. Growing up in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Faraz Khan was used to seeing khwaja saras invited to offer blessings for marriages and births. Now they would not be welcome at a private party, says Mr Khan, whose investment firm, Seed Ventures, has a special focus on trans-owned businesses. It “wouldn’t be seen as classy enough”.
The region’s governments are keen to defend the rights of hijras, who remain a highly visible minority. It is also a politically palatable way for them to show off their progressive credentials, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan, where homosexuality remains illegal. Many South Asian Muslims believe that if God made the body a certain way, his followers must accept it. Being born intersex—unlike being gay—therefore breaks no religious codes. Unsurprisingly, some hijras are reluctant to debunk the intersex myth or to associate too closely with gay and lesbian groups. “We talk about LGBTQ,” says Zerine (not her real name), a Bangladeshi lesbian and activist, but the term “doesn’t mean much in reality: the situations of each community are completely separate.”
Steps like tax breaks are welcomed by hijras. Other efforts, however, are hobbled by the drafters’ limited understanding of the people they wish to help. To enjoy the protection offered by the new act, India’s third gender is required to register as trans, a process that, for some, requires medical proof of gender reassignment, which most hijras do not undergo. Bangladesh’s government-jobs scheme failed because hijras had to prove they were intersex.
Attempts to relabel hijras have also proved divisive. “Transgender” arrived in South Asia after the term gained currency globally, especially in recent years. Some local activists and organisations adopted it pragmatically: it was more appealing to international funders. Others have embraced it as a route to progress. Using a global term and being connected to a global movement is “empowering”, says Hochemin Islam, a transgender nurse and activist from Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital. Governments and the media, keen to be seen as on trend, increasingly use the term, too.
Yet transgender is also used to denote respectability. The “I am not a hijra” campaign, organised by an advocacy group in India in 2016, showed trans Indians holding placards with statements like “I earn a six-figure salary, I am not a hijra”. Whatever the intentions, it ended up stigmatising hijras, says Aniruddha Dutta of the University of Iowa. Adnan Hossain of Utrecht University notes that hijra, unlike “transgender” in the West, is also a class identity.
Many hijras also describe themselves as transgender, such as Saro Imran, who runs a skills-training centre for trans people in Multan, in the Pakistani state of Punjab. Some undergo sex-change operations, or aspire to. But many others, like Srabonti Srabon, a Bangladeshi hijra, shun both. Hijra is an identity unto itself: they come from poor families where they are not understood or accepted, she says. Leaving, or being kicked out, is a vital part of this identity. So is being initiated into a tightly knit clan of hijras and learning its traditions and rituals under the tutelage of aguru. “This culture is 2,000 years old. Trans is a fairly recent phenomenon,” says Ms Srabon. “They cannot be clubbed together.”■",2
1810,"MANY THINGS are simple for national governments but hard for the EU. That includes punishing people who steal from it, since the EU’s member states have mostly been wary of giving it the power to prosecute their citizens. The bloc’s main treaty requires its members to punish chicanery involving EU funds, and the European Commission has a detective agency—the European Anti-Fraud Office, or OLAF—to investigate. But until this year it was up to national authorities to take the culprits to court. If a country declined, there was no European body that could do so.
The new European Public Prosecutors’ Office (EPPO), which was launched on June 1st, aims to fix that. The EPPO can bring criminal charges for misuse of EU funds and for a number of other offences, such as VAT and customs fraud. It is headed by Laura Codruta Kovesi, a redoubtable prosecutor who from 2013 to 2018 ran Romania’s vigorous national anti-corruption agency, convicting thousands of bent officials and business people.

The EPPO’s significance goes beyond the criminals it can punish or the money it can recover. Corruption creates deep splits in the EU. Countries like Germany and the Netherlands fear that money they contribute to the EU budget will subsidise fraud in countries like Italy that are plagued by organised crime, or in those like Hungary where the courts are controlled by the very politicians who are on the take. Donor countries are reluctant to grant the EU bigger budgets unless they are confident the money will be spent honestly.
Yet five of the EU’s 27 members have not joined the EPPO. The holdouts include Denmark, which has opted out of all EU justice affairs, and Sweden, which says it will join soon. More worrying, they include Hungary and Poland. Both are big takers of EU aid, with governments that have made their justice systems subservient to politicians. Hungary has the highest fraud rate of any EU member.
The EPPO is based in Luxembourg, in one of the steel and glass towers that make many EU agencies feel like robotic limbs grafted onto Europe’s medieval bones. The European Court of Justice is next door. The agency seems far removed from the skulduggery it expects to prosecute. But the headquarters house only the EPPO’s central apparatus, including Ms Kovesi’s office and the college of 22 prosecutors, one from each participating country, who oversee the agency. Grouped into permanent chambers of three prosecutors each, they make the pivotal decisions on each case: whether to file charges or dismiss them. The investigation and prosecution itself are handled by teams of prosecutors in each country, nominated by their national governments but approved by the EPPO.
One benefit of the EPPO is centralisation, says Andrés Ritter, the German member of the college. Fraud tends to cross borders. In his former job as a prosecutor in Germany, Mr Ritter supervised a case in which €18m ($21m) of diesel was falsely imported as cleaning products to evade EU energy taxes, then re-exported and sold as fuel in the Czech Republic, Italy and Poland. Such cases used to require joint investigation teams from the countries concerned and Eurojust, the EU’s agency for judicial co-operation. Requests for information and European warrants for searches and arrests added time and complexity.
Many of the EPPO’s cases will be similar to those handled by OLAF and national prosecutors. These can be quite concrete, as with the Italian-Romanian consortium that won a contract to produce hovercraft but made no effort to do so, or the multinational Mafia ring that used EU agricultural funds to buy second-hand farm equipment instead of new kit.
Others are abstract financial crimes. Danilo Ceccarelli, the Italian member of the college, notes that on paper the EU runs a huge trade surplus with itself—over €300bn in 2018, according to one study. This is logically impossible, and probably an artefact of tax fraud: exporters overstate the value of goods in order to recover higher VAT rebates. The study estimates the total could run to over €60bn a year.
The most sensitive cases are those involving politicians. Anti-corruption advocates hope the EPPO’s independence from national governments will make it easier to prosecute elected officials. Czech authorities have reportedly forwarded to the EPPO their case against Andrej Babis, the prime minister. Mr Babis, one of the Czech Republic’s richest citizens, is accused of illegally profiting from EU subsidies to an agriculture company he formerly owned. He denies these charges.
But keeping clear of political influence is difficult. Janez Jansa, Slovenia’s prime minister, has refused to approve the prosecutors his country must delegate to the EPPO. Opponents claim that he fears his party will be unable to control them. In Bulgaria Boyko Borisov, the prime minister for most of the past decade, gained control of the body that appoints public prosecutors, who repeatedly exonerated government officials in scandals.
Furthermore, prosecutors must bring their cases in national courts. “It would be useful to have a European court of criminal procedure, no question,” says Mr Ritter, but that is a project for the distant future.
Yet the EPPO does not have to accept whomever national governments send it. Ms Kovesi rejected six of Bulgaria’s original ten proposed delegated prosecutors. And the body’s statutes are set up to protect independence. The 22 prosecutors in the college are barred from supervising cases involving their own country. The delegated prosecutors serve an initial five-year term that can be renewed indefinitely at the EPPO’s discretion. They cannot be recalled by their home countries.
Hundreds of cases have already been forwarded to the EPPO. Mr Ritter expects charges will be filed in some cases before the end of the year. To establish credibility it should seek to score some high-profile convictions quickly, says Laurent Pech, an expert on EU law at Middlesex University: “It’s a new, unelected body, so its legitimacy depends on output.” ■",2
1811,"IN THE PAST few years the Western-led infrastructure behind globalisation has fallen into disrepair even as China has been building credible alternatives. The World Trade Organisation is in tatters, the IMF and World Bank are struggling for relevance and tarnished by scandal, and no one can agree on global rules to govern technology.
There is an exception to this dismal picture: the global payments system that underpins the dominance of Western currencies, particularly the dollar. Over the past year one of its main networks, SWIFT, carried $140trn of transactions, a record level and the equivalent of about 150% of global GDP. It is an impressive sum but more must be done to modernise the payments architecture if its pre-eminence is to last.

The way money flows around the world is still overwhelmingly under the control of liberal democracies. Payments typically happen in the dollar and to a lesser extent the euro, pound and yen. This is, on balance, good for the world, providing a reliable system governed by law. It is certainly good for Western countries, bolstering their legal norms, firms and influence.

Behind it lie myriad institutions, from banks to New York’s clearing-houses. Despite its importance, SWIFT, owned by global banks and founded in the 1970s, is an obscure part of all this. It connects 11,000 banks in over 200 countries, providing a messaging system for transactions. Although it is based in Europe, it is an accidental linchpin of American influence, with JPMorgan Chase alone accounting for 24% of SWIFT dollar volumes.
The threat to SWIFT comes from several sides. Its own record is patchy. In 2016 North Korean hackers used stolen SWIFT credentials to steal $81m from the Bangladeshi central bank. America is complacent about the dollar system. It has used SWIFT to pursue politicised sanctions, giving countries an incentive to develop alternatives. In addition, America has been slow to upgrade payments systems at home or to develop a central-bank digital currency, and Congress is critical of the Federal Reserve’s stabilising global role.
Meanwhile big tech firms, credit-card networks and banks are keen to create alternatives. On October 19th Facebook launched its digital wallet. Innovation is welcome, but if only a few firms dominate, fees will rise and poorer countries suffer. And China is trying its own payments system, called CIPS, and a central-bank digital currency. It has just asked McDonald’s to adopt the e-yuan in its Chinese branches.
Rather than assume that the dominance of payments is their birthright, democracies should ensure their systems are faster, cheaper and safer so that they remain firms’ first choice on merit. SWIFT has upgraded its network and says that 92% of large transfers on its high-speed pipes happen within a day. Not all kinds of financial-market transactions need to be settled at once but SWIFT should aim for its payments to be instantaneous. Another goal should be to connect to more real-time domestic payments networks, which are live in 65 countries. This may cost money, but SWIFT’s capital expenditure in 2020 was $56m, less than a fifth of the budget of payments giants such as Ant Group and Visa.
The hardest task will be to reform SWIFT’s governance. Its board is packed with European banks, which was justifiable in the 1970s when they dominated cross-border finance, but now looks anachronistic. The board’s 25 seats include just two American firms and a single Chinese one. India and Brazil have none. America and Asia should be better represented, even as liberal democratic countries remain in control. When a house needs renovating a good place to start is the plumbing. ■

1812,"THE TECH industry recently appeared to be sitting on cloud nine. One record after another fell when quarterly results were reported three months ago. Revenues had grown by 40% on average compared with the same period a year ago and profits by 90% for the five Western technology titans—Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, collectively known as GAFAM. Indices of tech shares, such as the S 500 Information Technology benchmark, climbed to stratospheric heights.
If the latest round of quarterly earnings are any guide, the tech industry is coming back down to earth. Assuming that the pair meet analysts’ expectations, GAFAM’s revenues and profits will both have increased but by a more modest 26% and 39%, respectively. Share prices are languishing. The slowdown—or breather, if you will—provides additional evidence of the degree to which the pandemic has changed the tech industry. The question now is whether the sector is on a new trajectory or will revert to type over the next few years.

For starters, one of the first predictions when covid-19 hit in early 2020 was that it would make big tech even bigger. Those firms, ran the theory, would be best placed to benefit from an increased demand for digital offerings, whereas smaller firms, having fewer resources to get through the pandemic, would suffer most from its downsides. The first half of this prediction has come true: as the growth of the five firms’ market capitalisation shows. In January 2020 their combined value accounted for 17.5% of the S 500.Today their share hovers around 22%.

That said, many smaller companies have also grown in size and value. The pandemic has given rise to a group which could be called “tier-two tech”, the weight of which, measured by market capitalisation, has grown notably relative to the titans. In May we defined this group to include 42 firms with a market value then of no less than $20bn that were incorporated in 2000 or later. In February 2020 these had a joint market capitalisation of 22% of GAFAM’s. Today the figure stands at 31%
The reasons for this new strength are multiple. One is the large number of listings of late, particularly of tech startups: more than 100 since the start of the year, says Renaissance Capital, a data provider. Despite some high-value deals, a backlash against big tech’s acquisitiveness has slowed the pace of mergers and takeovers this year. Most importantly, the pandemic has shown that there are big digital markets that are not dominated by GAFAM. The group of tier-two firms, for instance, is led by PayPal, a payments provider, that boasts a market capitalisation of $276bn.
Yet the most intriguing shifts are qualitative. The first is that the tech industry has become far cloudier than previously. “We saw two years of digital transformation in two months,” said Satya Nadella, the boss of Microsoft, early in the pandemic, referring mostly to the growth of its cloud. Taken together, revenues of the three biggest clouds—Microsoft’s cloud business, Amazon’s AWS and Google Cloud Platform, which between them provide more than 60% of online-infrastructure services—have surged by two-fifths from $27bn in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $38bn in the third quarter of this year.
The gathering cloud’s bigger beneficiaries seem to be smaller firms, however. Taking a panel of 50-odd second-tier tech firms today, about four-fifths are providers of cloud services. Some are now forces to be reckoned with: Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform, is worth $104bn; Twilio, which provides corporate-communication services, some $61bn; and Okta, which manages employees’ digital identities, some $39bn.
Older tech firms are now also more firmly anchored in the cloud. Salesforce, a software giant, was one of its pioneers. Adobe, another software titan, has successfully reinvented itself for this new form of computing. Even the cloud’s laggards, Oracle and SAP, the world’s largest vendors of conventional corporate software, are at last making use of it. The biggest hardware-makers—Cisco, Dell and IBM—are also increasingly selling their wares “as-a-service”, accessed remotely through the cloud on a pay-per-use basis rather than installed on office computers.
The industry’s second shift is that lowly hardware has also made a comeback of sorts during the pandemic, despite the migration up into the computing skies. Most surprisingly, personal computers staged a revival as remote workers required better gear. In 2020 PCs saw their biggest growth in a decade, with more than 300m devices shipped, 13% more than in 2019, according to IDC, a market-research firm. Growth has since slowed, but mainly because shortages of chips and other components are holding back production. Dell, the world’s third-largest maker of PCs after Lenovo and HP, has done best, increasing shipments in the third quarter by nearly 27% compared with last year, according to IDC—almost guaranteeing good results when Dell reports on November 23rd.
Chipmakers give an even stronger signal of the return of hardware to the industry’s core. Although Intel disappointed investors when it released its quarterly results on October 21st, sending its share price down, sales were up by 5% to $19.2bn and profits by 60% to $6.8bn. Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest memory-chipmaker, which will also reported results on October 27th, saw its profits jump to the highest level in three years. And TSMC, the top contract manufacturer of semiconductors, for its part said on October 14th that sales had continued to grow at a rapid clip, reaching $14.9bn with net income coming in at $5.6bn, an increase of 16.3% and 13.8% respectively.

The big question is whether the three companies can profitably follow through on their record-breaking investment plans. These are meant to satisfy growing demand for chips not just from cloud providers, but from firms making gear for what is called the “edge”: devices connecting to the cloud or extending it, from smartphones to intelligent sensors. Intel, for instance, has said that it will invest up to $28bn in 2022. TSMC plans to spend $100bn over the next three years to expand its chip-fabrication capacity.
The third big change to the tech industry during the pandemic may be the most consequential: increased competition. Although members of GAFAM have yet to attack each other’s main franchises, such as online search in the case of Google and ecommerce for Amazon, rivalries have heated up. So far, vigorously competing clouds and changes in Apple’s privacy policies on the iPhone—which hurt Facebook’s ad revenues according to results released on October 25th—are the main examples. But on October 21st Google announced that it would lower the fee it charges providers of subscriptions in its app store to 15%, putting pressure on Apple to do the same. And with so many people now working remotely and probably continuing to do so, a platform battle has broken out between Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Zoom, a popular videoconferencing service, over which will dominate the virtual office.
Other firms are also picking more fights with GAFAM. Facebook’s social-media fortress looks a lot less safe now that it has at least two serious rivals: America’s Snapchat, a social network owned by Snap, and TikTok, the short-video app operated by ByteDance, a Chinese internet giant. According to data divulged in a recent wave of leaks, Facebook’s teenage users in America now spend two to three times longer on TikTok than on Instagram, which belongs to the American social-media conglomerate. Amazon also faces more competition, both in the form of incumbents that have at last embraced the digital world, including Walmart, and newcomers, such as Shopify, which helps merchants sell online and fulfil orders. PayPal’s attempt to buy Pinterest, another social network, now seems to have been abandoned, but it would have helped PayPal to move deeper into ecommerce.
After nearly two years of covid-19 the tech industry is cloudier, more tied to hardware and more turbulent. Of these trends, the first two are unlikely to last for ever, at least in their current form. Digital meteorologists argue that the cloud has already reached “peak centralisation”, meaning that it will henceforth grow not so much through football-pitch-sized data centres, but at the “edge”, where its digital services touch the physical world. And given the economics of the semiconductor industry—fabrication plants often cost over $10bn and take years to build—the chip shortage could eventually turn into a glut.
A more open question is how long the new phase of competition will last. Optimists argue that, after a long period of ossification, the pandemic has helped push the industry into a more dynamic period, in which the giants compete with each other as well as with smaller firms. Pessimists say that this phase will not last long—and that the industry’s leaders will sooner or later shore up their fortresses and buy out competitors. And that is why, more than ever before, trustbusters should not let down their guard.■

1813,"GLASGOW, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine, Fiji, Colombia, Kenya and Mali will be the first countries to participate in an investment program announced on Thursday that will help developing countries transform their power grids to carry growing levels of renewable energy.
The Climate Investment Funds (CIF), created by the world's biggest economies in 2008 to help developing countries accelerate their shift to a low-carbon economy, said its new initiative would help those countries bridge a huge gap in investments needed to integrate renewable energy sources.
Experts estimate that global infrastructure investments will have to ramp up to $820 billion annually by 2030 to facilitate the decarbonization of power systems and help refit or replace existing infrastructure so it can integrate alternative energy.
""Power systems in many, many developing countries are not equipped today to take on that much renewable energy capacity,"" CIF chief Mafalda Duarte told Reuters at the COP26 climatesummit.
""Our grids won't be ready for a clean energy future unless we can unlock significantly more investment in fit-for-purpose energy systems,"" Duarte added.
Duarte said investors viewed this issue as a major barrier to investments in renewables. ""If you can't integrate them into the power systems, there's no point in generating all that power,"" she said.
Duarte said Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia and Turkey were priority countries for subsequent phases of the Renewable Energy Integration (REI) program.
The REI program will work through multilateral development banks to offer participating countries a toolbox of financial instruments and technical assistance.
Plans for REI were endorsed earlier this year by the Group of Seven advanced economies, and are supported by financial pledges from the Netherlands, Britain and Switzerland.
The new program will support grid flexibility measures on both the supply and demand sides by scaling up renewable-energy enabling technologies and enhancing the readiness of energy infrastructure for renewables.
It will also support innovative business models and improve power system and market design.",3

AT THE NORTHERN edge of Lusaka, in Zambia, the 24-hectare Chunga landfill smoulders in the midday sun, its sour smoke scalding the nose and throat. Wesley Kambizi works nine-hour days on the dump with just a beanie and mismatched sneakers for protection: one slip-on, one lace-up, both caked in mud. Local authorities intermittently threaten to bar waste-pickers like him from the site. Worsening poverty in the city means both that more people are scavenging at the landfill and that fewer valuable scraps make it there in the first place.

The world’s cities produce over 2bn tonnes of solid waste every year. Even before the covid-19 pandemic local governments in poor countries struggled to keep their streets clean, clearing less than half the rubbish in urban areas and around a quarter in the countryside. Informal workers, who make up around 80% of the 19m-24m workers in the waste industry, have helped plug that gap. They both haul rubbish and scour municipal dumps and public spaces for things which can be re-used or sold, normally through middlemen, to recycling companies. In India waste-pickers divert over 40m tonnes of refuse away from landfills and into recycling every year, a task that would cost municipalities 15-20% of their annual budget. In South Africa they are responsible for recovering 80-90% of packaging.
Some, like Mr Kambizi, do the job full-time; others resort to waste-picking only when times are hard. The pandemic has enlarged their ranks. Birungi Hidaya lost her job as a teacher in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, soon after the pandemic struck. Now she works the Kiteezi landfill. She turns her nose up at the other scavengers on the dump, labelling them “ignorant” and “not civilised at all”.
The lay-offs that have come with the pandemic have seen more people like Ms Birungi eking out a living by collecting, sorting and selling rubbish. But the pandemic has also created new problems for waste-pickers.
The first is getting to the waste. South Africa failed to classify waste-picking as an essential service during this year’s lockdowns, leaving thousands stuck at home at risk of starvation. In Accra and Kumasi, cities in Ghana, those who live off the landfills worry that local governments will use the pandemic as an excuse to decommission the dumps, something they have long aspired to do.
Panicked citizens make matters worse. In Yangon, Myanmar’s commercial capital, Thiha used to make 500,000 kyat ($370) every month as an independent waste-collector in a working-class area. When a second wave of covid-19 hit in early September people began erecting makeshift barricades around their neighbourhoods, denying him access. His earnings fell by a third.
It is not just the people who are keeping Mr Thiha from the rubbish. The pandemic is producing a lot more medical waste. The amount of it produced in China’s Hubei province increased by 370% after the outbreak began. Manila and Jakarta are expected to produce an extra 280 and 210 tonnes every day, respectively. The Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC) is struggling to keep this sort of dangerous refuse away from the public in general and people like Mr Thiha in particular. It has been tasked with collecting, separating and burning the 50 tonnes of rubbish produced by hospitals and quarantine centres every day. (The sad duty of cremating victims of covid-19 has also fallen to the YCDC. “That’s a different job and also a stressful job for my people,” sighs Aung Myint Maw, deputy director of the sanitation department.)
Such care reflects a genuine concern. Some of the proliferation of pandemic-associated waste has been a benefit to litterpickers—think of all those tiddly little bottles of hand sanitiser. But in poor cities that lack the infrastructure to segregate medical waste it can be a real problem.
Scientists believe covid-19 is transmitted via tiny droplets that people exhale as they breathe, talk and cough. These virus particles can remain infective after a day spent on cardboard, at least two days on steel and three on plastic. Rifling through rubbish is never particularly safe from a health point of view; this year’s influx of infected material makes the business even riskier, particularly for those without personal protective equipment (PPE) and little understanding of how the disease spreads.

The falling price of recyclables presents a third problem. The formal recycling industry ground to a halt when countries closed their borders, making it impossible to ferry waste to the big plants which process it. There are fewer end-buyers for the plastic, paper and metal that scavengers collect. Data from the city of Pune in India show the price of polyethylene terephthalate, the plastic used to make water bottles, has dropped to as little as 10 rupees ($0.01) per kilogram from 22 rupees before the pandemic (see chart). Cardboard is two rupees per kilogram, half what it was.
That has been devastating for Rani Shivsharan, who has been collecting waste in Pune for over 25 years. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s signature Swachh Bharat, or Clean India, mission, the local authority does not recognise her work. Ms Shivsharan has not received any cash transfers or food rations since covid struck. There are days when she survives on tea. “I am scared, but what can I do?” she asks.
Brothers and sisters
Organised waste-pickers are better off on all three counts. A survey of 140 waste-picking associations in Brazil found that after serious disruption in the first weeks and months of the pandemic, three-quarters were back in operation by May. Almost all of them were using PPE, almost 80% had sent vulnerable members into isolation and 45% were quarantining scrap before sorting it. In Belo Horizonte, in south-eastern Brazil, a waste-pickers’ co-operative successfully lobbied the mayor’s office for food baskets and hygiene kits to see them through the pandemic.
The Belo Horizonte association had learned to fight for its members well before the pandemic. It has been almost 20 years since a group of single mothers in the city started collecting plastic bottles. The co-operative has since won a contract with the local authorities, which pays 265 reais ($52) for each tonne of material they sort. Similar stories can be told all round the continent. Waste-workers in Latin American cities like Buenos Aires, Bogotá and São Paulo often operate in co-operatives. The fact that Latin America’s litter-pickers are better organised and better treated is not just a by-product of increased regional prosperity. It is also the result of pressure brought by the waste-pickers themselves and a strong social-justice movement supported by the Roman Catholic church.

This has seen waste-pickers achieve a formal recognition they lack in many cities in Africa. Brazil has been gathering data on the sector for almost 20 years, from the time when waste-picking became an occupation listed in the national registry. Argentina legalised waste-picking in 2002 and has since created a government agency dedicated to the sector: it has a multimillion-dollar budget. Working together, waste-pickers can lobby for contracts or invest in sheds where they sort the day’s harvest and store it until traders offer a good price. The many local names for collectors reflect a sometimes sophisticated division of labour. Cirujas, cartoneros, recicladores and chatarreros may each differ in responsibility and status city by city. By no means all of those who work on the dumps are in associations. But the successes of those who are often help those who are not, too.
None of this has been easy, says Martha Chen, a Harvard lecturer who advises Wiego, a non-profit focused on women in informal work. “Someone from the public or the government doesn’t wake up one morning and think: ‘Let’s think about the waste-pickers’,” she says. “These gains come from years and years of struggle.”
Other regions aren’t going to integrate informal workers into their waste-management systems overnight. But there is one way in which covid-19 might help them do their work and do it safely. In the midst of a public-health emergency, city folk across the globe have begun to appreciate those who put themselves at risk to keep the streets clean. India, with its entrenched caste system, has treated its waste-workers particularly badly in the past. But this year households in Pune have been handing out food packages and cash bonuses to the people who collect their rubbish. It is the same story on the streets of London, where children have adorned their windows with notes of thanks. Rainbows, hearts and smiley faces are dedicated to doctors, postal workers and binmen. ■",2
1815,"THE TEA was highly caffeinated, but the mood was dour. As the night wore on, the sound of artillery could be heard in the distance. Fifteen or so Sahrawi soldiers had set up camp under one of the rare thickets in the Western Saharan desert. The youngest among them, looking no older than teenagers, scoured the sky for surveillance drones. “War is the only way,” said one. A little before midnight a radio operator received news that Moroccan batteries were opening fire. Then came the thunderous echo of falling missiles.
The decades-old conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a nationalist movement seeking independence for Western Sahara, is heating up again. Over the past year Morocco has logged with the UN more than 1,000 “incidents” of Polisario firing on its units, though Polisario says it has staged more attacks than that. The fighting has mostly involved artillery duels along the world’s longest frontline—a 2,700km (1,700-mile) wall of sand, or berm, built by the Moroccan army and sown with mines. Polisario commanders say a dozen of their soldiers and as many civilians have been killed. Morocco officially denies that the war has resumed.

But the war is affecting the wider region in ways that are undeniable—most notably by feeding the rivalry between Morocco and Algeria, which supports Polisario. The conflict in Western Sahara contributed to Algeria’s decision to cut diplomatic ties with Morocco in August. Algeria has since stopped supplying natural gas to the kingdom through the Maghreb-Europe pipeline. That may hurt Spain too, which also receives gas from the pipeline and is in the midst of an energy crisis. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been tied in knots by Donald Trump’s decision in 2020 to break the international consensus and recognise Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. Decades after the fate of the disputed territory was to have been decided, it is still causing no end of trouble.
Broken promises
Morocco and Polisario began fighting around the time Spain, the colonial power, withdrew from Western Sahara and Morocco annexed the territory in 1975. In 1991 the two sides agreed to a ceasefire and a UN-sponsored peace process designed to conclude with a referendum on independence in the territory. But the vote never happened, thanks in large part to Moroccan obstructionism. The kingdom wants to use a vague offer of autonomy as the basis for new negotiations. Polisario dismisses that suggestion and says the ceasefire is over. As things stand, Morocco controls nearly 80% of Western Sahara. Polisario runs the remaining part (see map).

The feud between Morocco and Algeria goes back even further. They fought a brief war over their border after Algeria’s independence from France in 1962. Algeria’s support for revolutionary movements around the world has always made Morocco’s monarchy uncomfortable. But Algerian officials claim Morocco is fomenting unrest in their country by backing armed groups, such as Islamists during Algeria’s civil war. That prompted Algeria to close the border in 1994 (it remains closed). This year it was reported that Morocco had targeted the phones of Algerian officials with spyware. Algeria also said the kingdom supported groups allegedly involved in starting fires in northern Algeria, and blamed it for a bombing that killed three Algerian truck drivers on November 3rd.
Polisario’s actions come with the blessing of Algeria, which hosts the group’s leaders and many humbler Sahrawi refugees. “We are facing a war situation,” says an Algerian diplomat. The country has a habit of backing guerrilla movements. Algeria hosted Che Guevara, trained a young Nelson Mandela and invited Yasser Arafat to address the UN in 1974, shining a spotlight on the Palestinian cause. Last year Algeria railed against Morocco for establishing diplomatic ties with Israel as part of the deal that saw America recognise Moroccan control of Western Sahara.
Algeria’s motivations are also strategic, though. If Polisario controlled Western Sahara, Algeria would gain access to the Atlantic and easier routes into west Africa, while Morocco would be hemmed into the north-west corner of the continent. Instead it has watched Morocco exploit the territory. The kingdom’s portion of Western Sahara comes with phosphates, oil and fishing rights. It has sought to cement its hold on the territory, offering Moroccans who move there generous subsidies. This policy may also help to sway the vote if Morocco is ever forced to hold a referendum on Western Saharan independence.
The kingdom has spent billions of dollars fixing up Western Sahara. Many of the buildings in Laayoune, the capital, look as if they have been built rather recently, including the consulates opened by a growing number of African countries. The city of Dakhla, on the coast, was a fishing hamlet four decades ago. Now it is a burgeoning resort, packed with kite-surfers. A large port, aimed at supplying west Africa, is being built. Lorries ply the coastal road connecting Western Sahara—and thus Morocco—to the wider region. The kingdom’s deployment of troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone to clear the road of protesters last year helped spark the current fighting.
Morocco has long been a low-cost manufacturing hub for European firms. Lately it has tried to cultivate allies and trade links in sub-Saharan Africa. After boycotting the African Union for 32 years over its inclusion of Western Sahara, Morocco returned in 2017. King Mohammed VI has opened dozens of new embassies and consulates on the continent; most of Morocco’s foreign investment goes to sub-Saharan Africa. This has paid off: less than half the AU’s members now recognise Western Sahara. In general, Morocco’s influence in Africa is growing—as Algeria’s wanes. When two Moroccan truck drivers were killed crossing the Sahara earlier this year, jihadists were blamed. But Western diplomats suspect Algeria, trying to thwart Morocco’s push south, played a role.
The situation in Western Sahara complicates Morocco’s foreign relations elsewhere. In September the General Court of the European Union annulled fishing and agriculture agreements between the EU and Morocco because they included the territory. (An appeal is pending.) Earlier this year the kingdom allowed thousands of would-be migrants to descend on Ceuta, a Spanish enclave, because Spain had admitted Brahim Ghali, the leader of Polisario, for treatment for covid-19. Morocco also fell out with Germany over its “negative attitude” towards Western Sahara.
In October the UN Security Council extended MINURSO, the UN‘s peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, and called for the resumption of talks. A new UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has been appointed for the territory. But America’s position is confusing matters. The resolution extending MINURSO called for “self-determination of the people of Western Sahara”, a phrase added by America, reportedly at the request of Russia. That would seem to conflict with America’s official position of recognising Moroccan control. President Joe Biden has yet to say whether he will maintain that stance, which critics argue sets a dangerous precedent.
Channelling their anger
Polisario leaders, based in refugee camps near the Algerian city of Tindouf, say that Morocco’s manoeuvring left them no choice but to break the ceasefire. But they were also under pressure at home. The 173,000 Sahrawi refugees in Algeria are growing restless. They say it hasn’t rained in Tindouf in years and that their herds have been struck by disease. International aid has fallen. Yet Algeria seems intent on keeping the Sahrawis in the camps so that they don’t abandon the struggle. Polisario worries that the frustration could boil over or lead to radicalisation. “The situation is like a volcano which could erupt,” says a Sahrawi journalist.
The fighting has bought the leadership time. But young Sahrawis now want to escalate. “They don’t feel that we are in a true war yet,” says Bachir Mustapha, an adviser to Mr Ghali. Malainin Lakhal, a Sahrawi diplomat, agrees. Young Sahrawis “want attacks”, he says. “They want prisoners. They want to see big operations like in the 1970s and 1980s.” Many of them have signed up for military training. Sahrawis living abroad have made gruelling ten-day trips through the Mauritanian desert to link up with Sahrawi forces and skirt Algeria’s covid-related travel restrictions.
The war has put wind in Polisario’s sails for the first time in years. What comes next, though, is not clear. Mr Mustapha promises a “second phase” of fighting. “All the leadership is for this,” he says. But Polisario’s military capacity declined during the ceasefire and is nowhere near that of Morocco. It is normal to see Sahrawi officers well into their 70s commanding soldiers in their early 20s. Algeria’s support would be essential if things were really to kick off. Polisario hopes Algeria will see the war as a chance to revitalise the country’s drifting foreign policy.
Some in Polisario want to pursue other tactics, such as attacking deeper in Moroccan-occupied territory. It is “much more than a possibility”, says Mohamed Wali Akeik, who was recently named chief of staff of the Sahrawi army. “Companies and consulates, airlines and other sectors” are all potential targets, he says. Much of this may be bluster. Polisario likes to claim that its artillery barrages and raids are undermining Moroccan morale. It hopes any escalation will make Morocco uncomfortable enough to make concessions.
Morocco’s troops, though, are digging in along the frontline. Its surveillance drones patrol the skies over Western Sahara; in September it received a first batch of Turkish combat drones. Morocco’s military spending rose by 29% last year. Algeria fears it will work with Israel to impose its will on the region. Moroccan officials voice support for Algeria’s Berber separatists and suggest that its ruling generals should return to the barracks. Algeria, in turn, has moved troops to the border. Diplomats say it is working with the Wagner Group, a controversial Russian security firm.
There is little chance that Polisario will achieve its dream of independence for Western Sahara. Some observers think that is for the best. Without the support of Morocco, an independent Sahrawi state might struggle. It would have help from Algeria, which is richer than Morocco thanks to abundant hydrocarbons. But Algeria itself is in turmoil. Efforts to wean the economy off oil and gas have faltered. Big protests in 2019 led to the president’s resignation. The public, though, sees the new one as a puppet of the army. The state is preoccupied with cracking down on groups associated with the pro-democracy Hirak movement.
Nae to autonomy
Morocco is better prepared for the future. It is home to Africa’s largest car and plane manufacturers and its fastest trains. Over 60% of Moroccans have received two jabs of covid-19 vaccine, compared with 10% of Algerians. More than a third of the country’s energy comes from renewables. Yet Sahrawis on the Moroccan side have plenty to be unhappy about. Those who talk of independence say they are denied jobs. Activists are hounded by the police. As for Morocco’s offer of autonomy, Sahrawis point to the repressive monarchy. It would not be like Scotland in Britain, they say.
Of course things are worse on the other side of the berm, where many Sahrawis have spent their whole lives in dusty camps. Some took part in the Hirak—and have thoughts about Polisario’s leadership. Mr Ghali is 72. Yet Polisario’s greying leaders seem disinclined to hand over to a new generation. For now, anyway, the focus is on the war. No one trusts the UN to find a just peace. In the Boujdour refugee camp a young Sahrawi woman says renewing the old ceasefire is out of the question: “We would not allow that.” The mood is the same on the frontline, where a fighter called Omar stands armed and ready. “If there are negotiations in the future, it will be under the sound of guns,” he says. ■",2
1816,"SANJAY TICKOO fidgets in a small, yellow-walled room at a secret location surrounded by concertina wire and military patrols. The security forces tell Mr Tickoo that his confinement is for his own good, and he believes them. He is a Pandit, born to one of the 800-odd Hindu families in Kashmir who stayed on through a generation of deadly insurgency. This month unidentified militants have shot and killed at least 11 civilians—Pandits, Sikhs and non-Kashmiri migrants from elsewhere in India—for the apparent purpose of terrorising those minorities who still live alongside the Kashmiri Muslim majority.
India and Pakistan have been fighting over the state of Jammu  Kashmir since 1947. Each administers a part and claims the whole. But the region’s centre of gravity, the Kashmir valley, has always been held by India. It has been gripped by separatist fevers since 1989. Roughly half a million Indian troops have become a permanent presence. Tens of thousands of Kashmiris have been killed in the process. Millions more are angry about living in what has come to resemble occupied territory.

This was all supposed to change on August 5th 2019. Fresh into his second term, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, pushed two bills through parliament that cleaved the state in two and scrapped what autonomy it still enjoyed. Under the new regime, Kashmir is ruled directly from Delhi, the national capital. The reorganisation promised to replace corrupt politicians, to attract investment and prosperity and to bring lasting peace.
Two years on, none of these aims has been realised. No new political class has been mustered to represent the Kashmiri people at home or in Delhi; unemployment, at 21%, is the highest in India; and killings of all kinds rattle Srinagar, the former state’s capital. The pandemic could be blamed for some of these problems. Instead the central government pretends they do not exist. On October 12th the head of its human-rights commission praised the home minister for blessing Kashmir with “a new era of peace, and law and order”. A week earlier, a Hindu businessman named Makhan Lal Bindroo (pictured) had been shot point-blank at his pharmacy.
Not all bloodshed in Kashmir garners coverage. It is barely news when troops are ambushed—nine died on October 11th—or when Kashmiri Muslims are killed, as when paramilitary forces gunned down a young nomad named Parvez Ahmed Khan for failing to stop at a checkpoint, two days after Mr Bindroo’s death. But the current wave of assassinations targeting victims on the basis of religious and ethnic identity has reminded Kashmiris of old wounds.
Most Pandits fled during a grim insurgency in 1990s. There are also some 80,000 Sikhs, some of whom are now being murdered too. But by far the largest, most vulnerable group of potential targets are the migrant workers who have come from the rest of India, mainly the poor states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, over the past two decades. Some are Muslim; most are Hindu. None speaks the local language and almost all relocated to escape penury. There may be 300,000-400,000, including many now scrambling to flee.
An outfit calling itself the Resistance Front (TRF), which Indian security forces say has links to Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the killings. Most Kashmiris of all religions are appalled at the violence aimed at the defenceless. It may be that TRF or other groups are attacking civilians around Srinagar because their forces have been worn down from the fight against armed forces in the countryside and are finding softer targets.
Or it may be that the terrorists are trying to pre-empt an influx of Indian settlers into the valley. Their actions betray a broader obsession with demography in the territory, one in which Muslims are the majority. When Kashmir’s special protections were abrogated, Kashmiris were most alarmed to be losing a constitutional assurance that purchases of land would never be opened to outsiders, who could overwhelm them with sheer numbers. Mr Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government has hardly allayed those fears. Instead it has tested ways to minimise the demographic strength of the valley’s Muslims. First it made 400,000 Hindus displaced from Pakistan in 1947 eligible for permanent residency. Then it liberalised the criteria for more recent immigrants to settle. It also seems to be gerrymandering Kashmir’s future constituencies to the disadvantage of Muslims.
The government’s priority is to thwart the terrorists from provoking another exodus. In response to the murder of three Bihari workers, the territory’s police chief this week ushered vulnerable migrants into military camps for their protection. That will not be enough. Sandeep Koul, a young Pandit hunkering down at his mother’s home in Srinagar, complains, “We have done nothing to deserve this fate.” Mr Koul is 29 years old; he has lived under the shadow of militancy his whole life. “If the attacks continue,” he laments, “my family, too, will have to leave Kashmir.” ■",2
1817,"CHIEF EXECUTIVES are not, it goes without saying, the world’s most natural writers. They do not rise to the top without laserlike ambition, a trait that rarely leads to literary reflection. To achieve success, they have to murder their straight-talking selves and master corporate twaddle instead. They need neither fame nor fortune—the main reasons writers go through the agonies that they do. And when they do write, as a business publisher admits, you often “weep for the trees”. Think only of Jack Welch’s paean to great (ie, his own) leadership called “Winning”. Its first pearl of wisdom is: “Winning in business is great, because when companies win, people thrive and grow.”
So it is with trepidation that Schumpeter celebrates the flourishing of a genre at which most book-lovers would shudder: the CEO memoir. True, it has its drawbacks. The authors are mostly white, male and middle-class. They are neither Hemingways nor Dostoevskys. There is no sex, drugs and only middle-of-the-road rock ’n’ roll. And they can afford the best ghostwriters so it is hard to tell how much is their work anyway.

That said, the genre has many things going for it—especially when the authors are founders of successful firms who, by definition, have mastered the art of telling a good story. It has recently hit its stride with books by Phil Knight, who co-founded Nike, in 2016 and Stephen Schwarzman, co-creator of Blackstone, in 2019. Its newest addition is “Play Nice but Win”, the story of how Michael Dell built the PC company named after him that would eventually change the way computers were made and sold. Ignore the boy-scout title. The book is acidly funny, nail-biting and fast-paced. It is also blessed with a villain from central casting: Carl Icahn, activist investor and publicity hound, whose sparring with Mr Dell gives the story its bite.
Moreover, for those interested in business, such accounts provide a ringside seat for observing some of the big dilemmas of recent decades: staying private or going public; prioritising shareholders or stakeholders; building hardware or software. In a world of unreadable business books and overpriced business schools, it is worth taking CEO memoirs seriously. If nothing else they help expose what most self-styled business gurus get wrong.
The first trait the books celebrate is competitiveness. The memoirs bristle with it. These are not win-win firms created to make the world a better place. Business, as Mr Knight puts it, is “war without the bullets”, fought one sale at a time, which someone inevitably has to lose. In 1988, when Mr Dell was 23 years old and Compaq was his biggest rival, he placed a billboard outside its headquarters in Houston, Texas, with an arrow pointing west towards Austin, where his own four-year-old company was based. “158 miles to opportunity”, it read. In “Shoe Dog”, Nike’s former boss writes about the importance of being first into China to gain an advantage over its competitors. “What a coup that would be,” he writes. “One billion people. Two. Billion. Feet.”
The second factor is how character affects business. In most such books, personality is overshadowed by bloodless abstractions: visions, narratives, missions. In reality, businesses are built by people with flesh-and-blood strengths and weaknesses. Of course, all entrepreneurs crave success. But part of Mr Dell’s genius lay in realising that his triumph would come from complementing his cocky young self with colourful elder statesmen who understood the pitfalls of building a business at lightning speed. The laconic Mr Knight’s sidekick was Jeff Johnson, an oddball so enthusiastic about selling trainers that he wrote endless letters to his exasperated boss. He never got a response, yet the affection between the two men helped make Nike what it is. A cast of Wall Street characters brightens Mr Schwarzman’s book. One of the most memorable is Jimmy Cayne, boss of Bear Stearns, who pigheadedly refused to write a cheque that could years later have saved the bank from collapse.
Third comes candour. Be honest about failure as well as success. Founding a business always comes with what Mr Schwarzman calls “the moment of despair”: when you think you are a master of the universe, but no one else does. In Mr Knight’s case it was the word uttered by his banker that ran through his head as he punched his pillow at night: “equity”, ie, cold, hard cash he needed to inject into his firm. He had none. For Mr Dell, it was the frustration of having Mr Icahn, a master of the soundbite, accusing him of grossly undervaluing Dell when attempting to take it private in 2013. He likens it to being “smacked in the face with a flounder”.
Finally, context. The books all channel the cacophony that surrounds business, coming from employees, customers, competitors, lenders, investors and regulators. This makes keeping a single-minded focus on success so hard. When Dell temporarily goes private in 2013, Mr Dell silently waves goodbye to the “legions of whiners, back-seat drivers, kerbside experts, rear-view-mirror thinkers, and second guessers”. Mr Knight takes issue with what he calls the “bland, generic banner” of business itself. “What we were doing felt like so much more. Each new day brought 50 new problems, 50 tough decisions…and we were always acutely aware that one rash move, one wrong decision, could be the end.”
Over to you, Jeff Bezos
The lure of self-aggrandisement remains. Mr Schwarzman ends his book with pages of name-dropping. Mr Dell descends into pieties about doing good for the world. Refreshingly, Mr Knight, who in later life studied creative writing, finishes before his tale becomes a dull one of Nike’s success. And the genre has room to develop. Soon, the west coast’s middle-aged tech barons will be itching to tell their stories. The world may wince less if the CEO scribes remember the four Cs: competitiveness, character, candour and context. And if they need a ghostwriter, remember the business hacks who, unlike superstar bosses, toil in obscurity. ■

1818,"THAT VIKINGS crossed the Atlantic long before Christopher Columbus is well established. Their sagas told of expeditions to the coast of today’s Canada: to Helluland, which scholars have identified as Baffin Island or Labrador; Markland (Labrador or Newfoundland) and Vinland (Newfoundland or a territory farther south). In 1960 the remains of Norse buildings were found on Newfoundland.
But there was no evidence to prove that anyone outside northern Europe had heard of America until Columbus’s voyage in 1492. Until now. A paper for the academic journal Terrae Incognitae by Paolo Chiesa, a professor of Medieval Latin Literature at Milan University, reveals that an Italian monk referred to the continent in a book he wrote in the early 14th century. Setting aside the scholarly reserve that otherwise characterises his monograph, Mr Chiesa describes the mention of Markland (Latinised to Marckalada) as “astonishing”.

In 2015 Mr Chiesa traced to a private collection in New York the only known copy of the Cronica universalis, originally written by a Dominican, Galvano Fiamma, between around 1339 and 1345. The book once belonged to the library of the basilica of Sant’Ambrogio in Milan. In Napoleonic times, the monastery was suppressed and its contents scattered. The owner of the Cronica let Mr Chiesa photograph the entire book and, on his return to Milan, the professor gave the photographs to his graduate students to transcribe. Towards the end of the project one of the students, Giulia Greco, found a passage in which Galvano, after describing Iceland and Greenland, writes: “Farther westwards there is another land, named Marckalada, where giants live; in this land, there are buildings with such huge slabs of stone that nobody could build them, except huge giants. There are also green trees, animals and a great quantity of birds.”
Mr Chiesa says that giants were a standard embellishment of faraway places in Norse folklore and, indeed, Galvano cautioned that “no sailor was ever able to know anything for sure about this land or about its features.” The Dominican was scrupulous in citing his sources. Most were literary. But, unusually, he ascribed his description of Marckalada to the oral testimony of “sailors who frequent the seas of Denmark and Norway”.
Mr Chiesa believes their accounts were probably passed on to Galvano by seafarers in Genoa, the nearest port to Milan and the city in which the Dominican monk is most likely to have studied for his doctorate.
His thesis raises a new question: why does the eastern seaboard of America not feature on any known Genoese map of the period? But it could help explain why Columbus, a Genoese, was prepared to set off across what most contemporaries considered a landless void.■",2
1819,"Seoul (CNN Business)Tim Sweeney is on a mission. The Epic Games CEO has been mounting a relentless attack on Apple, after the tech giant kicked his company's hugely popular video game Fortnite off the App Store. Apple said at the time that Epic flouted rules on digital payments by establishing its own system.Epic sued Apple in response, kicking off a highly public trial. Apple has argued that its rigid payments system exists to protect the security and privacy of its developers and customers, and that it's only a small part of the video game market — and therefore has no monopoly. Sweeney sees things differently. Companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL), he argues, wield enormous power over the app market. Their control prevents consumers and companies from choosing how they do business.The case is still working its way through US courts, but in September a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside its App Store. Still, the judge stopped short of calling Apple a monopoly, and the company has barred Fortnite from its devices until the legal battle finishes, which could delay the game's return to iPhones by several years.CNN Business caught up with Sweeney in Seoul, where he was attending the Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness — an event hosted by South Korean lawmaker Jo Seounglae. The country recently enacted a law that allows app developers to use alternative payment systems. We asked Sweeney questions about that law, as well as his ongoing fight with Apple, Fortnite's failed foray into China and his thoughts on the ""metaverse,"" the virtual world Facebook (FB) sees as its future. Our Q&A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.South Korea recently passed a bill banning mandatory in-app purchases and ordering tech companies to allow alternative payments. What did you think?I was very happy to see that Korea was taking the leadership role, initially. Korea is one of the leading technology powerhouses in the world, with Samsung (SSNLF) and all the great game developers around Korea. It's great to see Korea really defending developers, including all the Korean developers against these bad practices [by] Apple and Google. How much business and revenue has Epic Games lost as a result of getting kicked off Apple's ecosystem?Fortnite had made hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Fortnite being off of iOS, it's losing that much now. But fortunately, Fortnite is also successful on personal computers and game consoles. So the business continues to be strong, despite being off of iOS. But it just shows how much power Apple wields and is able to completely eliminate a game's existence on iOS. No platform company should have that power, right? Consumers should be free to install software. And developers should be free to create software, and the platform company should never stand in between them.Do you have any regrets about how the legal battles with Apple and Google have played out?We always knew it would be a slow and complex case. Both Apple and Epic realized from the beginning that whatever happened within the District Court ... the decision would be appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court in the United States, and, if possible, to the United States Supreme Court, to ultimately make the decision. And so, it was inevitable that this would take many years.Do you have anything to say to the people who have influence over this issue in the United States? Ultimately, this is a battle for consumer rights. Though the disputes are mostly between companies and governments, it's about the right of a smartphone owner to be able to install software from sources of their choosing, and to do business directly with developers without the platform company adding taxes and fees to every transaction. ... It's about the basic freedom of everybody to do business together directly if they choose. I think it's the most important fight for digital rights in the industry right now. Because more and more of our lives are moving online and becoming digital — all of our digital interactions are increasingly controlled by Google and Apple. If we allow the world's two most powerful corporations to control our online lives, it'll become a force that's more powerful than the government itself.Epic spent a long time working on Fortnite's launch in China, but it didn't happen. Was that time and effort worth it?I'm glad we tried. There's always been a lot of uncertainty about the future of US-China relations, and unfortunately, they've been strained for the past few years. And we just didn't see a realistic likelihood of being able to receive approval to launch in China. So we gave up trying, but I think it was a good effort.The team did a wonderful job, and I wish there had been a way, but I think there's just going to be a long period in which there's a separation between consumer services inside China and globally.What is the ""metaverse"" to you?It is real time 3D entertainment experiences that are social. It's you and your friends together in a 3D world, having fun in lots of different ways. You can be playing games like Fortnite Battle Royale, you can be going to concerts, you can be dancing, or you can just be standing around and chatting. It's all the sorts of social interactions we can have in real time 3D together with our group of friends.What kind of future do you envision in the metaverse? Is it really going to be a game changer, like the internet was when it was introduced?I think it will take a decade or more to really get to the end point, but I think that is happening. And it will be a better online experience than we're having today. It will succeed because it's better. The metaverse doesn't require fancy new hardware. It doesn't require all that reality hardware or [virtual reality] or things that haven't been invented yet. You can get online and start experiencing this right now.The next step of this metaverse evolution is to open up broader experiences to bring in the next billion users.What are some of the biggest hurdles to making it happen?The metaverse isn't going to be created by one company. It will be created by millions of developers each building out their part of it.Another challenge is building the economy. In order to have millions of developers building for the metaverse, you need to have a business where they can make as much or more money from that effort, developing software to support their businesses.We need to win the fight against platform monopolies, because Apple and Google currently have rules in place to prevent the metaverse from existing on the Google Play Store and on iOS. They have rules that prevent web browsers from existing — you're only allowed to use their web browser.They don't allow commerce to be done directly with users. They don't allow code to be run on your local device if it hasn't been reviewed by Apple and Google. The metaverse needs to support all of these things, so we really need to win this battle to open up platforms before the metaverse can truly exist.-- Rishi Iyengar and Jill Disis contributed to this report.",0
1820,"ONCE AMERICA announced that it would not save its client state, things unravelled quickly. As the enemy seized province after province, government soldiers shed their uniforms and ran. On paper the army had hundreds of thousands of well-equipped fighters. In reality its few loyal commanders had to buy ammunition from crooked supply officers and pay in cash for artillery support. The special forces fought well, but regular troops were often commanded by politicians’ incompetent relatives. Soldiers went unpaid as officials pilfered military budgets. Citizens stayed loyal to their families and clans, not to a corrupt government that was as likely to shake them down as to help them. The state was a Potemkin village constructed to please its American sponsors. When they left, it fell.
So it went in South Vietnam in 1975, and again last week in Afghanistan. The similarities between the two collapses are striking. They go beyond intelligence failures, mendacious speeches and abandoned allies. Ultimately, both states fell because they had been hollowed out by corruption, an ancient disease of governance to which America’s nation-building projects are prone. (Think also of Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia and Haiti.) Political scholars once considered corruption a minor issue, but many now see it as crucial to understanding not just why America’s proxies fail, but how states work in general.
Corruption is usually defined as the abuse of public office for private gain. Its simplest form is bribery, which is ubiquitous in Afghanistan. “From your birth certificate to your death certificate and whatever comes in between, somehow you have to bribe,” says Ahmad Shah Katawazai, a former Afghan diplomat. (He was pushed out of the service after writing an opinion piece denouncing government corruption.) Customs officials, police and clerks routinely demand baksheesh (a “tip”). As the Taliban advanced in recent weeks, the pay-off needed to get a passport rose to thousands of dollars.
But petty bribery is the least threatening type of corruption. More troublingly, getting government approval for big investments requires giving ministers or warlords a piece of the action. Worse yet, a government job with access to bribes is itself a valuable commodity. As Sarah Chayes, an expert on corruption, discovered while running an NGO in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2009, local officials often buy their posts. They must then extort kickbacks to pay off their investment, while sending their superiors some of the take. Mr Katawazai says it can cost $100,000 to become a district police chief.
Such corruption creates patronage networks that threaten the state’s integrity. Officials’ main goal is not carrying out their agency’s mission, but extorting revenue to distribute to their families and cronies. Even before America invaded, Afghanistan was partly run by patronage networks headed by regional warlords.
Yet instead of dismantling these networks, America strengthened them by paying warlords to keep the peace, according to reports by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), an American oversight authority. Afghans soon grew furious at government corruption and more welcoming towards the Taliban. A study in 2015 by Transparency International cited one policymaker’s epiphany: “The guys at the bottom are sending money to the top of the system and the guys at the top are sending protection downwards, which is how a mafia runs.”

Ms Chayes became an adviser to Stanley McChrystal, a reformist general who then headed ISAF, the coalition of NATO-led forces in the country. An ISAF investigation unit known as Shafafiyat (“transparency” in Pashto) was set up under H.R. McMaster, who later served as America’s national security adviser. It made progress in stopping procurement fraud. (The Afghan government’s own anti-corruption authorities mainly prosecuted political enemies.)
But under subsequent commanders the Shafafiyat was cut back. By the time of the Taliban’s final offensive the state had grown so corrupt that most of its governors cut deals with the jihadists to switch sides. The Afghan army was in poor shape to fight: its numbers were inflated by “ghost soldiers”—absentees listed on the payroll so that commanders could steal their salaries.
Americans of a certain age may remember the term “ghost soldiers” from Vietnam, where corrupt commanders used exactly the same system. Perhaps a quarter of the names on South Vietnamese army (ARVN) rosters in the Mekong Delta in 1975 were fictitious. Some ARVN officers were brilliant businessmen: one South Vietnamese colonel used to order aimless artillery barrages in order to hawk the spent shell casings as scrap metal. As in Afghanistan, police and military forces also profited from the heroin trade.
Indeed, the conclusions of a report in 1978 on the fall of South Vietnam by RAND, a security think-tank, foreshadow those in the last SIGAR report on Afghanistan, released on July 31st. South Vietnamese believed corruption was “a fundamental ill that was largely responsible for the ultimate collapse”, the RAND report found. The problem had already been diagnosed in Vietnam by forward-thinking officers in the early 1960s. So why did America refuse to treat it as a grave issue when it invaded Afghanistan decades later?
One answer is that this would require a shift in perspective. Over the past two decades many scholars have come to see corruption as a form of governance in itself. It resembles the pre-modern states that Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist, calls “personalistic” governments, where power is based on ties of family or friendship rather than impersonal institutions. Such states are mainly concerned with placating armed commanders by giving them a share of the economic spoils.
That description applies just as well to mafias, feudal systems such as those of medieval Europe, and the warlord regimes in South Vietnam and Afghanistan. States like these can be reasonably stable. But they lack the loyalty and cohesion needed to beat a disciplined ideological insurgency such as the Vietnamese communists or the Taliban.
Another problem is that American interventions were led by the armed forces, which are biased towards optimistic reporting and short-term thinking. Military officers “are hugely focused on actively doing things within the duration of their nine-month rotation, which is not well suited to solving corruption”, says Mark Pyman of CurbingCorruption, a watchdog. Mr Pyman, who led the Transparency International study, says officers early in the occupation boasted of having pacified their districts by paying off warlords. Aid agencies, meanwhile, have a dubious habit of judging success based on how much money they raise and whether they have spent it all.
This leads to a related problem: spending too much money in poor countries causes corruption. In both South Vietnam and Afghanistan, a vast influx of American dollars caused a surge in inflation, wiping out public-sector salaries. (Afghanistan, with a GDP of about $20bn in 2020, received $145bn in American aid between 2001 and 2021. Inflation averaged 17.5% in 2003-08.) Neither government had the capacity to collect enough taxes for the wages of soldiers and civil servants to keep pace. Even otherwise honest public servants were forced to demand kickbacks to support themselves.
Hence one recommendation of anti-corruption experts is that in countries like Afghanistan aid should be frugal and focus on achievements rather than grant sizes. That is easier said than done. America is simultaneously among the world’s richest and most idealistic nations, and at some point it will probably decide to save another suffering country. If it does not learn that dollars cannot build a real government, it may end up creating yet another fake one.

1821,"ON AUGUST 29th 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in southern Louisiana. As it travelled north, it overwhelmed the levee system designed to protect New Orleans. By August 30th, 80% of the city was underwater. More than 1,800 people died in what became the costliest natural disaster in American history. The Army Corps of Engineers, which designed the old network of floodwalls, called it “a system in name only”.
Precisely 16 years later, another fearsome storm, Hurricane Ida, gathered strength in the Gulf of Mexico’s warm waters. The quickly-formed storm cohered south of Cuba and had hardly acquired a name before she was threatening Louisiana’s coastline. A huge patch of unusually warm water provided fuel for Ida to intensify into a category-four storm (the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale goes from one to five, with anything above three considered “major”; after making landfall Ida was  downgraded to a tropical storm). Many feared that history was about to repeat itself. The preliminary good news is that it did not: the improved levee system built after Katrina to protect New Orleans and its environs, just nearing completion, appears to have held. But there was plenty of bad news, too.

Louisiana has more covid cases per 100,000 people than almost any other state. Its hospitals are jammed almost to capacity, making it all but impossible to move patients from the southern part of the state to other facilities farther inland. Consequently, hospitals directly in Ida’s path were not evacuated, though dozens of nursing homes were. At the time of writing, the consequences of those grim choices—moving older, vulnerable people around, and leaving the hospitalised in place—remain unclear. But the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported that hours into the storm, in Thibodaux, near to where Ida made landfall, one hospital’s intensive-care unit lost generator power, forcing doctors to manually ventilate patients as they were moved around within the building.

The hospital was not alone: the hardest hit parts of the city of New Orleans could be without power for weeks. In Kenner, a large suburb, officials told residents that they could be without water for five days and power for three weeks. The city’s sewer board warned, meanwhile, that the outage could affect a “very significant” number of its 84 pumping stations.
The worst impact may be felt by those outside of the levee system. New Orleans is flanked by vulnerable coastal communities already in danger of being wiped off the map by rising sea levels, and Ida looks to be hastening that job. The most endangered areas include Grand Isle, a popular barrier island two hours south of New Orleans, and Isle de Jean Charles, an eroding islet in Terrebonne Parish that has long been occupied by Native Americans. LaPlace, west of New Orleans along the Mississippi river, was swamped by floodwaters; rescue crews tried through the night to reach stranded residents. The most severely hit place may be Port Fourchon, near Grand Isle, where most ships that supply the Gulf of Mexico’s productive oil platforms and rigs dock.
Storms have long battered Louisiana, but climate change is likely to be making things worse. That is not because storms are growing more frequent. Whether climate change increases the frequency, as opposed to the intensity, of storms is not clear. At least one database of hurricanes that have affected America since 1900 shows no long-term increase in the frequency of storms that have made landfall. Some models suggest that the number of hurricanes in the north Atlantic could even decrease between now and the end of the century. That is less reassuring than it sounds.
Hurricanes draw their energy from heat in the oceans beneath them. Most of the heat gained by the planet as a result of climate change is stored in the oceans; it stands to reason that tropical cyclones (which are called hurricanes in the Atlantic ocean and typhoons in the Pacific) should become more intense as the climate warms. Data bear this out: the latest review carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deemed it “likely” that the share of storms classed between categories three and five has increased over the past 40 years. This trend is projected to increase as the planet warms.
That may prove particularly difficult for southern Louisiana. The earthen levees that protect New Orleans deprive the surrounding wetlands of necessary sediment. And man-made canals from a century of oil and gas exploration have made what remains of the coast even more vulnerable. Ida may not have been as destructive as Katrina was 16 years ago, but it is nonetheless a harbinger of a grim future.",2
1822,"A tech billionaire allegedly kept a spreadsheet of 5,000 women he has had sex with, one of them a teenager he paid off to keep quiet, despite losing his high-profile job over a sexual misconduct allegation in 2016.
Michael Goguen, 57, a former partner at Sequoia Capital who now heads his own firm, has been sued by four former employees who say they helped manage his 'harem' of women.
The explosive lawsuit claims the investor met with the women at various safe houses or at a 'boom boom' room in the basement of his bar in Whitefish, a small town in Montana where he now lives.
The married billionaire, who has two children, once asked his employee to arrange a hit on a former friend who knew too much about his personal life, according to the lawsuit. 
A retired Whitefish police chief now says that Goguen - whom he compared to serial predators Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein - 'has to be stopped.'
These are the latest allegations of sexual impropriety leveled against Goguen, who in 2016 was accused of 'countless hours of forced sodomy' by his former girlfriend, exotic dancer Amber Baptiste.
The latest 135-page lawsuit was filed in February by former employees of Goguen’s Amyntor Group LLC, a security contractor, according to the New York Post.
It lays out a complex operation headed by Goguen to protect his simultaneous affairs. The breakdown of the operation, and the employees who helped it run, can be traced through multiple guilty pleas by former employees and associates who threatened to speak out about the alleged scheme.
Among the plaintiffs is Matthew Marshall, the former head of Amyntor who quickly grew to become Goguen's 'right-hand man.' 
Marshall pled guilty to wire fraud and other charges earlier this month after he pretended to be an elite member of the Marine Corps and asked Goguen for money for 'off the books' missions, according to the Flathead Beacon.
But Marshall says Goguen, who is currently married to his fourth wife, allegedly kept a 'harem' of 'numerous women, including married women, strippers, and prostitutes,' who he bought homes for and used for 'illicit sexual activity.' 
Goguen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. 
The tech investor is worth more than $5 billion, according to the New York Post. 
He flew some of the women in his private $42 million jet. 
'Marshall was being asked to purchase, out of his personal accounts, vehicles, jewelry, earnest money deposits on properties, and to provide cash or other items for Goguen’s mistresses, or as hush-money payoffs to Goguen’s acquaintances and employees who had ""learned too much"" about Goguen’s sexual misconduct and crimes, and the Goguen Sexual Scheme,' the lawsuit states.
'Goguen informed Marshall it was best to have him pay the property expenses, especially any expenses that were solely for Goguen’s safe houses, out of his personal account to avoid his then wife Jordana from discovering that Goguen owned a number of properties that he used extensively for extramarital affairs because Jordana had visibility over Goguen’s accounts at that time.'
The lawsuit, which is asking for $800 million in damages, claims various violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) act. 
It accuses Goguen of offering 'gifts' to the women - including alcohol, travel, jewelry, cash and health care expenses - 'to perform other deviant sexual acts with him, and/or to maintain their silence as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.' 
He gave one woman a credit card and bought her a five-bedroom home after her husband, a prominent businessman, found out about their affair and began divorce proceedings, according to the Post. 
Goguen also allegedly gave Eric Payne, who did construction for Goguen, an office in the basement of Casey's Bar, an establishment that he owns in Whitefish.
The office 'was passcode protected, had a built-in full size stripper pole, and commonly referred to as the ""boom boom"" room where he and Payne could procure young women to engage in sexual acts with them for money, drugs or other items of value as part of the Goguen Sexual Enterprise.'
Goguen was vindictive against those who tried to put a stop to his nefarious activities, according to the lawsuit viewed by DailyMail.com.
His friend Bryan Nash called him a 'pedophile' after Goguen brought his two daughters to Nash's house but later absconded with their high-school-aged babysitter to have sex with her in a cottage on the property. 
The age of the babysitter is not clear. 
'Goguen threatened to kill Nash if he “said anything to anybody” about his “character flaw,” later telling Nash that he “owns Montana” and “supplies law enforcement,'"" the lawsuit states.
Goguen then began having sex with Nash's wife and paying for her divorce proceedings, allegedly costing Nash more money in a drawn out legal battle.
He used Marshall to investigate and harass Nash, who went to authorities 'to no avail,' the lawsuit states. 
In September 2014, Goguen texted Marshall using the encrypted texting service Wickr, writing: 'Nashf*** has pushed me too far and his occasional reminders he might help blow the lid off my personal life requires an extreme response. The cyber route isn't having the impact on him that I was hoping to achieve,' according to the lawsuit.
'Buddy, he’s f*****with my life, career, etc. and the potential for me being destroyed if he gets traction with the authorities or press is significant. This requires an extreme response. He will f***** destroy the ""bigger picture"" for us if he's not stopped. 
'He needs to be killed. I know that's a VERY big ask but we are in defcon 5. We can discuss details in person but we do NOT have conversations about this on our cell phones. Wickr only…'
Marshall did not try to have Nash killed, the lawsuit states.
In May 2020, Nash pled guilty to one count of blackmail after prosecutors say he threatened to release negative information about Goguen if he didn't pay him $250,000 to cover his divorce proceedings, according to the Flathead Beacon. 
Goguen is from Bedford, Massachusetts, according to the Post. 
He went to Cornell and Stanford universities, where he studied electrical engineering, and joined Sequoia Capital - an early investor in Google, YouTube and PayPal - in 1996, according to his LinkedIn.
He was let go from his job at Sequoia after Amber Baptiste accused him of physical and sexual assault over a 13-year period after he picked her up at a Texas strip club, according to the Post.
She said he sodomized her for 'six hours at a time' and forced her to call him 'king' and 'emperor' in a lawsuit asking for $40 million.
Goguen then told Marshall to act as his 'general 100x more aggressive than Patton was, to coordinate and make sure everything is happening that should be happening — PR firms, private investigators criminal side, local PR, everything,' according to February's lawsuit, emphasizing the lengths he was willing to go to, and the money he was wiling to spend, to punish those who hurt him. 
Back in 2016, Sequoia called Baptiste's allegations 'unproven and unrelated to Sequoia' but said that Goguen's departure 'was the appropriate course of action.'
In 2019, a judge dismissed Baptiste's lawsuit for failing to provide relevant documents or to submit to a medical examination, according to TechCrunch. 
A different judge then found that Baptiste committed fraud and extortion and granted Goguen a restraining order preventing her from repeating her claims, according to the Flathead Beacon.
The latest lawsuit does not name any of the allegedly 100 women in Goguen's 'harem.'
It does note, however, that he's bought some of them homes, including a multi-million dollar home in Santa Monica, California for a woman whom he allegedly got pregnant multiple times but paid to have abortions. 
Retired Whitefish Police chief Bill Dial, who is also suing Goguen, told the Post: 'This man has to be stopped. He’s a billionaire a la Harvey Weinstein and Epstein. There's a lot of people in this community who know what he’s about and they’re afraid of him.'
Goguen's employees say that a detective by the name of Shane Erickson was 'forced to resign' after failing to investigate sexual assault allegations against Goguen while 'improperly accepting gifts and other compensation' from him.
'Mr. Erickson was forced to resign from his position as a Police Detective with the Whitefish Police Department for failing to investigate the alleged conduct by Goguen and improperly accepting gifts and other compensation from Defendant Goguen while employed with the Whitefish Police Department,' the lawsuit states.
The teenager, identified only as Pam Doe, was given alcohol and cocaine by Goguen, Payne and a third individual, the lawsuit states.
In an email she wrote to her lawyer, she said she had been asked to pop out of a cake at a party when she was 17, wherein after she was 'roofied' and asked to be an 'escort,' to multiple men.
During the course of his investigation, Erickson told Marshall that Goguen admitted he paid her $1,200 to have sex with him. 
'During the course of April, May and June 2018, Det. Erickson openly shared with Marshall the fact that he was spending time with Goguen, including having dinner at his house, spending time on Whitefish lake, going on a coyote hunt and doing other leisure activities with their families,' the lawsuit says, adding that Goguen took Erickson via private jet on his 'yearly week-long ~$20,000 elk hunt in Colorado with private guides.'
Pam Doe eventually recanted her allegations. She was allegedly 'forced to sign a non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreement' and paid off. 
Whitefish police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com. ",-2
1823,"A FATWA ISSUED by Ali al-Sistani, an influential Grand Ayatollah, was all it took to push Iraq’s Shia Muslims into risking death in battle with the jihadists of Islamic State in 2014. But his edicts seem to be having less success at persuading Iraqis to stroll sedately to the ballot booth to vote on October 10th. Although parliament bowed to the demands of young protesters for an early election, it now seems that most Iraqis will boycott the event. If that happens, sectarian and ethnic militias, especially those closest to Iran, will probably tighten their grip all the more.
Iraqis’ previous exercise in democracy was less than edifying. In 2018 only 44% of those eligible bothered to cast their ballots. Some compensated for the low turnout by voting again and again. Days after parliament ordered a recount, a warehouse storing a million ballots went up in flames. Since then Iraq has worked to make the coming vote more credible. It has increased the number of constituencies, which ought to benefit independent candidates. Some 70% of voters will have biometric cards, which should reduce fraud. And there will be five times as many foreign monitors as there were in 2018, including, for the first time, a contingent from the European Union.

Yet apathy and cynicism still prevail. Many of those in the vanguard of mass protests two years ago are calling for a boycott. “The politicians don’t respect us, so I don’t respect them,” says one of them, convinced that Iraq’s armed factions will never cede power at the ballot box.
The commonest worry is that, even if the election itself is fairer than usual, the horse-trading afterwards will result in yet another corrupt carve-up between the main factions. Ministries are still likely to be divided between the biggest parties, with oil revenues treated as a cash-cow to be shared out, including to party militias. “They sit in a closed room and choose a malleable fig-leaf to represent them,” says a businessman in Baghdad, referring to the present prime minister.
Shias, who make up the majority of Iraqis and live mainly in the centre and south, have lost the most faith in politics. Two years ago hundreds of thousands of them joined the protests, demanding free and early elections to break the militias’ hold. But the country’s armed groups have since grown in power, shooting hundreds dead with impunity, chasing the protesters off the streets and quashing their efforts to form a political movement by killing, kidnapping and intimidating them.
Moreover, lots of independent candidates who claim to represent the protesters are splitting the vote, with the result that few, if any, will win seats. “Each candidate feels he alone is king of the protest square,” says Yasser Mekki, a dentist who joined the protests in the city of Najaf. Some have looked to the West to help create a secular bloc, but America seems to have tired of its democratising mission.
Further dividing the country is the fractiousness of Iraq’s three main groups: Shia, Sunni and Kurd. The Shias sport an array of parties, many of which are armed. Sairoun, which is led by a podgy cleric-cum-militia-leader, Muqtada al-Sadr, won the biggest share of the vote in 2018. But his campaign in his old base—the shantytowns of Baghdad and the cities of the south—has flagged. This is perhaps because of his party’s failure to use its clout in parliament to improve the lot of its supporters. Other armed factions closer to Iran are bidding for his former voters. Qais al-Khazali, the leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a powerful chain of militias that broke away from Mr Sadr, now sings to the tune of Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader. Kataib Hizbullah, another armed Shia group known for firing rockets at America’s embassy, is standing for the first time. Several Shia militias have sought Iran’s guidance to save them from splitting their vote.
One consolation is that the election has been surprisingly free of violence. But its outcome will depend on whether people heed the experience of Sunnis, who lost out in earlier polls. “We’ve learnt our lesson,” says Nada Jabouri, a Sunni candidate in Baghdad. “Boycotts don’t work.” ■",2
1824,"PLUMES OF SMOKE rose above Kampala, Uganda’s capital, after a bomb blew up near the central police station on November 16th, followed minutes later by a blast on a road that runs past the parliament. Counter-terrorism police then shot dead a man who they said was carrying a device intended to set off a third explosion.
Police said that seven people, including three suicide-bombers, died in the blasts, which injured another 36 people. They were quick to blame “radicalised groups” linked to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel outfit based in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Islamic State (IS), which counts the ADF among its affiliates, later said that it was behind the attacks.

The bombings did not come out of the blue. Last month a waitress was killed by a blast in a Kampala bar, for which IS also claimed responsibility. Two days later a man detonated a bomb on a bus, killing only himself. More tenuously, the government has blamed the ADF for a string of attacks on public figures, including an assassination attempt in June on a government minister and former army commander. Those shootings, carried out by men on motorcycles, followed a different pattern from the recent bombings. The evidence linking them to the ADF seems shaky.
The ADF was born in the 1990s in a marriage of convenience between Islamist rebels and ethnic separatists from the Rwenzori mountains straddling the border with Congo. It mounted several bomb attacks in Uganda before decamping to lawless eastern Congo, pursued by Uganda’s army. It found a niche there among a patchwork of rival militias, looting villages and smuggling timber. At one point it had shrunk to just a few dozen fighters.
The ADF is plainly making a comeback. Last year it killed at least 800 Congolese civilians and forced thousands to flee their homes. In one attack this month it massacred 38 people in the Congolese town of Beni, slitting their throats or burning them alive. It has been reinvigorated by a growing network of recruits across east Africa, who share bomb-making skills and may be inspired by wider Islamist influences. Last year Musa Seka Baluku, leader of one ADF faction, declared that his group was now the “Central Africa Province of Islamic State”. In March the American government designated it a foreign terrorist organisation and an IS affiliate.
It is not yet certain whether the ADF has operational links to IS. A report by UN experts in June found no conclusive evidence that IS had command over it, or provided “financial, human or material” support. But jihadist propaganda that links the two groups has raised the ADF’s profile and lets IS boast of an ever-wider global reach.
Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, also has an interest in playing up the threat. He has long positioned himself as an ally in the global war on terror, securing financial and military support from Western governments which has helped him prolong his authoritarian rule.
“The ADF originally grew out of a feeling of marginalisation among the Muslim community of Uganda,” says Kristof Titeca of the University of Antwerp, noting that the government has sometimes made that problem worse. A notorious anti-terrorism police unit has a record of abducting and torturing Muslims, some of whom have died in custody. After this week’s bombings Mr Museveni boasted of the recent extrajudicial killings of seven men who he says were linked to the ADF. Tellingly, he signed off with the nickname his supporters gave him in the civil war that brought him to power: Ssabalwanyi, meaning “Greatest of fighters”. ■",2

In a ruling with ramifications for the whole oil industry, a Dutch court sided with green campaigners and found that Shell was in part responsible for climate change, ordering it to cut its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell currently aims to lower emissions by 20% in 2030 and 45% in 2035 from 2016 levels. It is to appeal against the verdict.
Activist investors have increased their clout during this year’s shareholders’ meetings in a wide range of industries. This week Aston Martin faced down a mini revolt, when 18% of shareholders opposed its pay policy for directors and 17% went against the re-election of Lawrence Stroll as chairman. Mr Stroll is credited with rescuing the struggling sports-car maker with an injection of capital in 2020.
Germany’s two biggest property companies, Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen, agreed to merge, creating Europe’s largest residential real-estate group. The deal is controversial. Rents have soared in Berlin, producing a political backlash. The firms gave assurances that they would limit rent increases to 1% a year in Berlin for the next three years and provide flats for young families at below market rents.
Singapore’s first-quarter GDP figure was revised, revealing a much faster expansion than had been thought. The economy grew by 3.1% compared with the previous three months; manufacturing output was up by 10.8%.
Joe Biden confirmed that he would not impose sanctions on the corporation that built the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will transport gas from Russia to Germany. Critics contend the project’s main purpose is to increase European reliance on Russian energy, but Mr Biden said that sanctions would be counter-productive, given that the pipeline is almost complete. The decision is a win for the German government, and a blow to Ukraine, which will lose income from transit fees for Russian gas.
Turkey’s president sacked a deputy governor at the country’s central bank, the third defenestration of a senior official within two months. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has whittled away at the central bank’s independence over the years in his attempt to suppress interest rates, replacing the governor with a supporter in March. Since then the lira has slid by 15%.

1826,"INDIAN NUPTIALS can be garish affairs. The groom often rides to the venue on a horse, or a Royal Enfield motorcycle. Portable DJ sets, fired up by car batteries, blare out Bollywood hits. Traffic on busy streets is routinely blocked to accommodate wedding processions. Matrimony in India is also big business. KPMG, a consultancy, estimates the wedding industry’s revenues at roughly $50bn. Before the pandemic these were growing by 25% a year.
As elsewhere, covid-19 has forced many Indian couples to postpone tying the knot. It may also have changed the way they go about it. With big weddings on hold because of their superspreader potential, many informal caterers, coconut-water sellers, ice-cream shops, wedding-card printers and flower vendors are struggling as weddings are put off. Online services, by contrast, are thriving. Matrimony.com, one of the biggest, has reported a rise in revenues of at least 20%, year on year, in each of its past four quarters. Shaadi.com, among the oldest such sites in India, has seen a jump in subscribers. And wedding platforms that help families to organise and even conduct weddings online are popping up.

Digitisation even extends to courtship. Prospective brides and grooms can no longer introduce themselves in person, sometimes perform on stage, and sit for interviews with their pick’s parents across a desk, speed-dating style. But in India, where arranged marriages remain common, parents and matchmakers still have to be involved. And so now does Zoom.
Murugavel Janakiraman, boss of Matrimony.com, expects its new video-calling feature for introductions to persist—not least because it deals with the common grouse from customers that their chosen one’s profile picture embellishes reality. During nationwide lockdowns last year video calls also allowed couples to continue their wooing virtually. Jeevansathi.com, another big matchmaker, saw its number of video meetings rise more than 11-fold. Call duration rose by a factor of ten.
Pre-wedding functions are also increasingly online. Couples seek the blessing of elders by touching the laptop screen in lieu of their feet, says Kanika Subbiah, founder of WeddingWishList.com, a wedding platform. WedMeGood, an app, hosts vendors like makeup artists, photographers, caterers and priests (along with their vaccination status).
Some cautious families have arranged visits by health-care workers to guests’ homes to have them tested before they attend a wedding in person. Alternatively, you can celebrate remotely. WeddingWishList has hosted more than 100 weddings in its virtual rooms. And the business opportunity does not end when the last reveller runs out of steam. Ms Subbiah has extended her services to online baby showers. ■

1827,"Boris Johnson's refusal to declare his freebie family holiday to Spain on the parliamentary register has been approved by the Commons sleaze watchdog, No10 said today.
The PM's spokesman said standards commissioner Kathryn Stone had 'agreed with the approach' that listing it on the ministerial register was enough.
The apparent decision by Ms Stone means that Mr Johnson will never have to disclose how much the week at a luxury villa owned by the family of Lord Goldsmith was worth. 
However, the premier has included an estimated value for free use of the VIP departure suite at Heathrow in the the latest edition of the Commons register.  
The facilities at the Windsor Suite - including a personal butler - would have been £1,800 for Mr Johnson, wife Carrie and their son Wilfred had they paid personally.
Downing Street has previously claimed that because the Johnsons' holiday in Spain last month was provided by a minister it falls outside the remit of the House of Commons financial probity watchdog. 
The ministerial register of interests stated it was offered free of charge by Lord Goldsmith, a former MP and friend of Mrs Johnson who was handed a peerage by Mr Johnson after losing his Commons seat in 2019.
But an entry on the separate MPs' register would require revealing how much the benefit in kind was worth. 
A spokesman for the PM said today: ‘The parliamentary standards commissioner has agreed with the approach taken by the PM that the substantive family holiday in Spain does not require a separate Commons registration.
‘The PM took advice as well from (ministerial interest adviser) Lord Geidt and he registered it as per the rules.’  
The Torre Tramores estate, where the Johnson family stayed, is available for private rent at a cost of £25,000 per week for a secluded retreat with its own private helipad. 
Questions had been raised over Mr Johnson's declaration, not least because previous freebie holidays have been declared on the Commons register rather than the ministerial version. The latter is typically used for listing interests such as charity patron roles, and the fact that RAF Northolt is in Mr Johnson's constituency. 
There were also doubts over whether use of the villa could be classed as a gift solely from Lord Goldsmith, as it is owned by the wider Goldsmith faily. 
The standards commissioner's office refused to comment on an individual case. 
Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner declined to say whether the watchdog had informed her that her call for an investigation had been rejected. 
The Windsor Suite is close to Terminal 5 at the west of London airport.
According to its website, guests can await their flight in one of eight private lounges, adding: 'Meeting you at our private suite will be one of our doormen who will escort you inside where your personal butler is waiting.'
It also boasts a food menu from Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton and offers the use of a personal shopper in the main terminal building.
The facility has previously been used by VIPs including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the singer Adele. 
He was given hospitality for three people in the lounge on October 7, the register shows. 
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: 'It is utterly ludicrous that the only donation that Boris Johnson has declared related to his latest freebie luxury holiday is the hospitality he enjoyed in the lounge waiting for his plane.
'The Prime Minister was given a gift by someone that he gave a peerage and a ministerial job to and the Prime Minister needs to tell us the truth about his donations.' 
A No 10 spokesman said the holiday provided by 'a longstanding friend' had been registered correctly.
However, the ministerial code entry says the property was provided by 'the Goldsmiths', not just the minister.  
Labour has demanded a probe into the holiday by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. 
Goldsmith is the former MP for Richmond Park who was elevated to the peerage by Mr Johnson after losing his seat to the Liberal Democrats.
The move allowed the 46-year-old to remain in Government as an environment minister. He is currently Minister for the Pacific and the Environment having been given an additional role in a 2020 reshuffle.
The stay at the Torre Tramores in early October sparked fury as Mr Johnson left the UK amid a gas price crisis that struck businesses. ",-2
1828,"FOR KING ABDULLAH it is like old times. On July 19th he will be back in the White House, the first Arab leader to meet the new president. Gone are the cast of old antagonists, Donald Trump and his chum, Binyamin Netanyahu. President Joe Biden has ditched Mr Trump’s “deal-of-the-century” for Arab-Israeli peace, which had sidelined Jordan and its king. Naftali Bennett made Amman, Jordan’s capital, his first foreign destination as Israel’s new prime minister. Without Mr Trump’s support, Saudi Arabia has backed off from trying to supplant Jordan as the custodian of Jerusalem’s holy sites. Confident of this geopolitical realignment in Jordan’s favour, Abdullah and his queen, Rania, have taken a three-week jaunt around America.
Back home, though, Jordan is seething. Bedouin tribes, historically the regime’s bedrock, openly challenge the king, who has reigned for 22 years. “I’ve never seen such dissent,” says a former official. “It’s seeping into the heart of the system itself.”

On July 12th Jordan’s State Security Court sentenced two of the king’s former confidants, Bassem Awadallah and Sharif Hassan bin Zeid, to 15 years in prison for plotting against the monarch. The trial was quick, closed and devoid of key witnesses. No army officers were charged, casting doubt on the prosecution’s claim that a coup was being planned. Lawyers for the accused could not call as a witness the alleged chief protagonist, Prince Hamzah, the king’s half-brother, because he is under house arrest.
Instead of uniting Jordan behind the king, the case has inflamed tensions. Several Bedouin tribes, a minority who fear losing their dominance to the descendants of Palestinians, have pledged their allegiance to the prince. One of their parliamentarians led protests waving a sword. (He was subsequently jailed for threatening to shoot the king.) Protesters praise Hamzah’s fluent Arabic, deep tribal connections and facial resemblance to their beloved former king, Hussein, and deride Abdullah’s Western upbringing and ties by marriage to Jordan’s Palestinian majority. They call him an American lackey and chant in English—“so he’ll understand”.
In the past the king (pictured below) has bought off the tribes by offering them jobs in the security forces. But the country’s economic woes are stoking anger. Covid-19 has hit the mainstays of tourism and remittances. Oil-rich Gulf states have been cutting aid and investment. Debt is set to reach 118% of GDP this year. Almost two-thirds of young Jordanians are jobless.
With no vision for recovery, the king rarely addresses his nation. America already gives $1.5bn annually (making the country America’s second-largest recipient of aid). Israel has direct flights to the Gulf and no longer needs Jordan as a stepping stone to the Arab world and beyond. For appearances ahead of his visit to America, the king has appointed a commission stacked with toadies to consider political reform. But he prefers to stifle dissent than listen to it. He closes trade unions and curbs civil liberties. This year Freedom House, a think-tank in Washington, downgraded Jordan’s ranking from “Partly Free” to “Not Free”. The king’s meeting with Mr Biden may offer him a photo opportunity. It will not cure his country’s ills. ■",2
1829,"The former chief immigration officer has warned that migrants 'know they've won the jackpot' when they arrive in the UK as the number of Channel crossings hit a record 4,000 for the month yesterday.
Kevin Saunders, former chief immigration officer for the UK Border Force, said the UK was 'very attractive' to migrants adding, 'people know they're not going to be removed' once they arrive.
His comments came as dozens more migrants were pictured arriving into the UK today, escorted by Border Force at Folkestone Harbour this morning.
Photos from the scene show a dinghy full of people thought to be migrants being approached by a Border Force vessel which already appears to be carrying other migrants onboard. 
This comes after, Boris Johnson ordered a Whitehall review into the cross-Channel migrant crisis with the PM is said to be 'exasperated' by his Government's failure to reduce the number of migrants on small boats making the journey and wants ministers to 'redouble' efforts to 'fix' the crisis.
Ex immigration chief Kevin Saunders told Times Radio this morning: 'The problem is that the UK is just too attractive, so people will continue to come while we're very, very attractive.
'People know that they're not going to be removed, this is why they destroy all their documentation.
'It's a real worry because we don't know who people are, because they destroy all their documents, they don't give us their right names, where they come from, or anything along those lines.
'The biggest draw is these people know everything in the United Kingdom is free, they are going to get education, medical treatment, money, accommodation, it's all a big, big draw.'
Mr Saunders said people who arrive in the UK via the Channel must be processed offshore to enable officials to turn away failed asylum claims.
He told Times Radio: 'The most effective way would be to take all the people who have arrived in the UK to an offshore processing centre and deal with it offshore.
'That is the only way you will stop people from coming into the UK. We've seen trying to do it with the French on land, on the Channel, nothing works.'
When asked why it had to be offshore, he said: 'People will still come to the UK, because they know we are not going to be able to remove them from the United Kingdom when their asylum claim fails.
'How many was it that we removed this year, was it five? Some 30,000 arrived and we removed five - not very good really, is it?
'They know that once they're in the UK they've won the jackpot.' 
Yesterday, the number of migrants crossing the Channel to the UK surpassed 4,000 to hit a new monthly record with weeks still to go - as Emmanuel Macron accused the government of 'oscillating between partnership and provocation' over the crisis. 
Seven migrants have been killed and eight others injured after the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in lost control and crashed near a motorway toll station in northern Greece, authorities said.
Police said the vehicle carrying 15 people had been travelling on a motorway from the area of Greece's north-eastern border with Turkey towards the north's main city of Thessaloniki when it crashed just after midnight.
The vehicle had been travelling at high speed and the driver lost control as he tried to exit the motorway, hitting a toll booth and crashing into a nearby storage container, police said.
The injured were four men from Pakistan, one from Afghanistan and two from Nepal, as well as the 35-year-old Moldovan driver, who police suspect was acting as a smuggler.
They have been transported to hospitals in the north-eastern Greek towns of Xanthi and Komotini.
The seven people killed in the crash included one woman.
Their nationalities were not immediately known, authorities said.
Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
The most frequently used routes for clandestine entries into Greece are the short but dangerous sea crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands, or crossing the heavily guarded land border between Greece and Turkey.
A total of 78 people crossed the Channel by small boat yesterday, according to official Home Office figures. Border Force officials rescued or intercepted migrants making the perilous trip in four separate crossings, while French officials stopped 254 prior to departure. 
The new arrivals brought the total number to have made it to the UK this month to 4,019, exceeding the previous record of 3,879 in September.
Former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been put in charge of the review ordered by Boris Johnson, according to The Times.
It will seek to find solutions to the crisis and make sure all departments – not only the Home Office – are contributing.
The review follows a week of record migrant Channel crossings, with 1,000 reaching the British shores on Tuesday alone and around 24,000 making the journey this year. The figure is almost triple the number that arrived in 2020.
Mr Johnson's frustration comes after a series of promises made by Home Secretary Priti Patel to tackle the crisis.
They culminated this week with the suggestion that asylum seekers could be sent abroad for processing. Countries including Albania are being considered as possible destinations. 
Last night it emerged that Ms Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants which will see new restrictions imposed on asylum seekers, as well the construction of new purpose-built reception centres, according to The Daily Telegraph.
In Greece, migrants face regular checks on their movements which include curfews to stop them going off the radar.
Earlier this week, Mr Macron took a swipe at Home Secretary Priti Patel for her criticisms of France's handling of the issue, saying: 'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation… we must step up collaboration.'
The president - who did not provide specific examples of alleged UK provocations - also pledged to use Paris's rotating presidency of the EU to ramp up work to address the origins of the crisis. 
The intervention came amid increasing pressure on Ms Patel and Boris Johnson to find a way of stemming the numbers arriving illegally on British shores.
One senior MP told MailOnline it had been one of the most significant sources of unrest when the PM appeared before the Tory backbench 1922 committee earlier this week.
'Where most people's concerns were being addressed was illegal immigration,' they said. 'We have the constant drip drip drip of small groups but cumulatively large groups of illegal immigrants arriving on our shores. We need to do something about it.'

The number of migrants crossing the Channel to the UK yesterday surpassed 4,000 to hit a new monthly record with weeks still to go - as Emmanuel Macron accused the government of 'oscillating between partnership and provocation' over the crisis. 
A total of 78 people crossed the Channel by small boat yesterday, according to official Home Office figures. Border Force officials rescued or intercepted migrants making the perilous trip in four separate crossings, while French officials stopped 254 prior to departure. 
The new arrivals bring the total number to have made it to the UK this month to 4,019, exceeding the previous record of 3,879 in September. This year's total is 23,761. 
It came as Mr Macron took a swipe at Home Secretary Priti Patel for her criticisms of France's handling of the issue, saying: 'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation… we must step up collaboration'.
The president - who did not provide specific examples of alleged UK provocations - also pledged to use Paris's rotating presidency of the EU to ramp up work to address the origins of the crisis. 
The intervention came amid increasing pressure on Ms Patel and Boris Johnson to find a way of stemming the numbers arriving illegally on British shores.
One senior MP told MailOnline it had been one of the most significant sources of unrest when the PM appeared before the Tory backbench 1922 committee earlier this week.
'Where most people's concerns were being addressed was illegal immigration,' they said. 'We have the constant drip drip drip of small groups but cumulatively large groups of illegal immigrants arriving on our shores. We need to do something about it.'    
Ms Patel looks to be trying to take the heat out of the row with France, unleashing an excoriating attack last night on the broader EU's open borders policy.
The Home Secretary railed against Europe's lack of border checks – the so-called Schengen zone – which has allowed thousands of migrants to sweep across the continent.
She also announced that she had secured agreement with Mr Macron's government – once legal changes have been approved – to use drones and tracking technology against people smugglers.      
Yeesterday, the Home Office confirmed a migrant who got into difficulty off the Dover coast this morning had to be airlifted to safety by HM Coastguard.
Meanwhile, the French Coastguard rescued 28 migrants off the coast of Gravelines in northern France after their small boat got into difficulty.
They were escorted to Calais Port by officials, where they were met by police.
Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said: 'We are facing a global migration crisis and the number of people arriving on UK shores is unacceptable.
'We must work closely with our European and international partners to target the ruthless organised criminal gangs behind these deadly crossing and welcome the French Government's commitment to step up action to prevent crossings, including increased surveillance, greater intelligence sharing and deployment of frontline operations
'The New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken system, break the deadly business model of the people smugglers and prevent further loss of life.' 
France takes the rotating presidency of the EU in six weeks' time, with the bloc working out how to react to claims Belarus is engineering major migrant flows to destabilise the area.
In an interview with French newspaper la Voix du Nord, Mr Macron - who is facing a stern challenge from right-wing politicians at looming elections - called for a tougher response.
'We must take several actions: prevent the establishment of lasting camps, act to dismantle the smuggling networks and strengthen work with the countries of origin to prevent these flows,' he said. 'I will carry reforms under the French presidency of the EU.'
Mr Macron also hit out over tensions between London and Paris.
'We have the British, who oscillate between partnership and provocation. We need to further strengthen collaboration,' he said. 
'If those who want to join Britain have family there, it must be part of family reunification. If they are smuggled, we have to break this system.'
Downing Street said the UK was working 'extremely closely' with the French to prevent illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
A No 10 spokesman said there was a 'global migration crisis' which required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe.
'Our work to date has prevented more than 20,000 migrant attempts so far this year but we have been clear that we need to do more, both ourselves and the French, which is why we continue to work extremely closely with them,' the spokesman said.
'We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings.
'This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem, so we need shared solutions.'
Keir Starmer accused Mr Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
The Labour leader linked the increase in numbers making the dangerous journey to Government cuts in Britain's foreign aid budget.
'We have not had strong enough agreements with France on this and we haven't done the work upstream,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
'One of the reasons many Tory MPs were unhappy with the Government for cutting its foreign aid budget is because they knew that budget is used in part to deal with some of the problems that are driving the movement of people.
'You will never solve the immediate problem if you don't solve the upstream problem. The Home Secretary repeatedly says in strong language what she is going to do about the immediate problem and delivers absolutely nothing.
'You have got to do the work upstream otherwise you will never solve this problem.' 
Speaking on a trip to the US, Ms Patel said offshore processing centres remained 'on the table' but refused to discuss specific negotiations. There have been suggestions that migrants could be sent and held abroad while their cases are looked at.
'We keep everything on the table… and this is why the new Nationality and Borders Bill is just so important,' she said..
'I'm the only Home Secretary over a 20-year period that has taken on the challenge of reforming what is fundamentally a broken system of asylum and illegal migration.' She admitted for the first time that Britain was facing a 'mass migration crisis'.
In a marked a change of tone after months of friction with the French government, she said the flow of small boats must be treated as a 'Europe-wide problem'. She said France was 'overwhelmed' by asylum seekers heading for the UK.
And she blamed Brussels – which governs EU border policy – for failing to act. 'Let's not forget the real problem on illegal migration flows is [that] the EU has no border protections whatsoever,' she said.
'On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. Other countries have to do much more in terms of border protection.'
Seven out of ten migrants who attempt to cross the Channel have entered France through Belgium according to French officials, Miss Patel said.
She added: 'The EU's Schengen zone is free movement and open borders. They do not have border controls and border checks. There is no united position across EU member states in terms of how to tackle this issue. It's an EU competency issue.'
Deploying highly-charged language, the Home Secretary went on: 'There is a mass migration crisis. I've said this from day one – from the minute I walked into the Home Office. For everyone who complains about this – and no-one is more angry and frustrated about this than myself, alongside the British taxpayers – there isn't a silver bullet.
'There's no point saying, 'Well, you could just push boats back'. It will not stop it. There are all sorts of issues with criminal gangs, smugglers, etc.' Ms Patel said of the French: 'I think it's fair to say they are overwhelmed. That is a fact.
'We are constantly pressing France on this and we're asking them to be honest with us about where the gaps are because they can't be everywhere. We have a very, very professional working relationship, but no one country can fix this on their own.'

The Prime Minister has ordered a Whitehall review into the cross-Channel migrant crisis, it emerged last night.
Boris Johnson is said to be 'exasperated' by his Government's failure to reduce the number of migrants on small boats making the journey and wants ministers to 'redouble' efforts to 'fix' the crisis.
Former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been put in charge of the review, according to The Times.
It will seek to find solutions to the crisis and make sure all departments – not only the Home Office – are contributing.
The review follows a week of record migrant Channel crossings, with 1,000 reaching the British shores on Tuesday alone and around 24,000 making the journey this year. The figure is almost triple the number that arrived in 2020.
Mr Johnson's frustration comes after a series of promises made by Home Secretary Priti Patel to tackle the crisis.
They culminated this week with the suggestion that asylum seekers could be sent abroad for processing. Countries including Albania are being considered as possible destinations. 
Last night it emerged that Ms Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants which will see new restrictions imposed on asylum seekers, as well the construction of new purpose-built reception centres, according to The Daily Telegraph.
In Greece, migrants face regular checks on their movements which include curfews to stop them going off the radar.
Speaking of Mr Johnson's frustration that the migrant crisis has not yet been solved, a senior government source said the PM saw it as one of his biggest priorities and he was concerned that 'after two years there are still no viable solutions'.
Germany is becoming a hub for migrants attempting to reach Britain, it emerged last night.
Asylum seekers are massing in the country as a new staging post for Channel crossings masterminded by people-smuggling gangs.
Organised crime groups are also using German sites to store dinghies and other small boats used to attempt crossings, sources said.
Six out of ten migrants arrive in France only on the day they attempt their crossing, travelling there through Belgium and the Netherlands.
A UK government source described Germany as 'the established hub for criminal trafficking gangs' in Europe. 
It is also a key location in the criminals' supply chains, where boats, life jackets and other equipment is sourced for Channel crossings, they added.
'Boris is exasperated. He's told ministers to redouble efforts to fix this, no matter how difficult it is,' they said.
'If it looks bad now, it's going to look much worse in spring when it's warmer.'
In new plans being drawn up by the Home Office, migrants will have asylum claims thrown out if they abscond or misbehave.
The changes – which will require legislation – will be crucial in the operation of the new processing centres, which will house asylum seekers while their cases are scrutinised.
Migrants could also be issued with 'asylum apps' to track the progress of their applications on smartphones or computers in the centres.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has been impressed by the way Greece has digitised its asylum application process to track cases, sped up decisions and cut down on unnecessary paperwork.
Speaking to The Telegraph, Miss Patel said Greece had decided 'not to sit behind the EU block of competency'.
Ministers are also keen to avoid a repeat of riots at asylum centres.
'If they breach the rules, it will affect their asylum claim,' a source said.
'They would be told they have to be back in by a certain time, and so on. Terms would include preventing absconding.'
Some previously reported plans to tackle crossings have included the use of giant wave machines, nets to snare boat propellers and floating walls in the sea.
However, Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, told the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week that they were never considered'.
He added that the wave machine idea is 'bizarre'.
But the move to bring in Mr Barclay could be seen as an admission that the Home Secretary has not managed to tackle the issue.
It comes after Sir Keir Starmer accused Ms Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
The Labour leader said Ms Patel has not secured strong enough agreements with the French government to prevent migrants making the dangerous sea journey.
He said the Home Secretary repeatedly used 'strong language' to say how she would tackle the problem, but delivered 'absolutely nothing'.
October 15, 2019
Priti Patel vows to halve migrant crossings – then a tenth of the current level – by the end of the month and make them an 'infrequent phenomenon' by the spring of 2020.
'I am absolutely committed to doing everything in my power to stop these dangerous Channel crossings which are putting vulnerable lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Migrant numbers hit a record 1,185 in a day last week.
August 7, 2020
The Home Secretary backs sending Royal Navy patrols into the Channel.
'The number of illegal small boat crossings is appalling and unacceptably high.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Within hours, Ministry of Defence sources suggested the proposals were unworkable.
July 6, 2021
Miss Patel unveils powers for UK Border Force to turn back migrant boats and reduce asylum rights for people who arrive in Britain illegally.
'Access to the UK's asylum system should be based on need, not the ability to pay people smugglers.'
WHAT HAPPENED? The tactics have yet to be used amid opposition from France and even the UK Border Force over legal concerns.
July 20
She agrees to give France another £54million to tackle the crisis.
'The public are rightly angry that small boats are arriving on our shores, facilitated by appalling criminal gangs who profit from human misery and put lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? In October France accused the UK of withholding the money amid a row over whether Paris was doing enough to stop the boats. The first instalment of UK cash was later paid – but numbers coming over the Channel continue to rocket.
November 15
Miss Patel and French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, vow they will deliver on their pledge to prevent '100 per cent' of illegal crossings.
JOINT STATEMENT: 'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings... and make this deadly route unviable.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Days later the French embassy in London said 100 per cent 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
November 18
The Home Secretary launches an attack on the EU's open borders policy, blaming Brussels for the crisis.
'The real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – open borders. On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. They simply can't.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Free movement for people between member states in the so-called Schengen area is a fundamental EU principle and there is no prospect of it being changed. 
His attack came as Ms Patel blamed the EU's open borders – established by the Schengen Agreement – for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc.
Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was 'constantly pressing' the French on the issue, but that they were 'overwhelmed'.
'Let's not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – Schengen open borders,' she was quoted as saying.
It is thought at least 10 migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing.
It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British 'oscillate between partnership and provocation' when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: 'We need to further strengthen collaboration.'
Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensified recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where canisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants.
Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work 'extremely closely' with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe.
'We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings,' a No 10 spokesman said.
'This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions.'
Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britain's 'busted' asylum system.
Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a 'dysfunctional' system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in 2015.
Sir Keir said: 'My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted.
'This Government has been in power for 11 years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch.
'Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at.
'So if the asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.'
Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador to Britain flatly denied reports his country has been in discussions with the Government about hosting a processing centre for migrants who arrive in the UK.
Qirjako Qirko told LBC radio that there had been 'zero talks' between the two countries on the issue.
'It's absolutely fake news because as my prime minister stated yesterday – the foreign minister also tweeted yesterday – that doesn't exist, any negotiations between Albania and the UK regarding these processing centres,' he said.
'It will not be changed because my prime minister was crystal clear yesterday when he said that Albania… will never be a processing centre for illegal immigrants.'
Speaking on a trip this week, Ms Patel said offshore processing centres remained 'on the table' but refused to discuss specific negotiations. 
There have been suggestions that migrants could be sent and held abroad - such as in Albania - while their cases are looked at. 
'We keep everything on the table… and this is why the new Nationality and Borders Bill is just so important,' she said.
'I'm the only Home Secretary over a 20-year period that has taken on the challenge of reforming what is fundamentally a broken system of asylum and illegal migration.' She admitted for the first time that Britain was facing a 'mass migration crisis'.
And, after months of friction with the French government, Ms Patel appeared to change her tone when she said the flow of small boats needs to be treated as a 'Europe-wide problem'. 
She said France was 'overwhelmed' by asylum seekers heading for the UK.
And she blamed Brussels – which governs EU border policy – for failing to act. 'Let's not forget the real problem on illegal migration flows is [that] the EU has no border protections whatsoever,' she said.

1830," (CNN)House Democrats have finally passed President Joe Biden's sweeping social spending and climate change bill after months of feuding -- but that triumph is tempered by new questions over whether the $1.9 trillion measure can survive the Senate and then offer the short-term jolt of political energy Biden's wobbling presidency needs.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi drove through the legislation, which had caused fierce battles between progressive and moderate Democrats, only after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy staged one more delay -- with a histrionic filibuster-style speech that broke records and lasted more than eight hours overnight. Democrats hit back by postponing the vote until breakfast time, saying they wanted Americans to be awake to see them passing life-changing legislation.The Build Back Better bill represents one of the broadest reforms of education and health care in decades as part of a bill that also includes more than $500 billion for fighting climate change. But a bill that has already faced brushes with extinction and unleashed extraordinary bitterness between Democratic factions probably has its most perilous days ahead given deep skepticism of much of its text, including from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has not yet said he is even ready to vote to bring it up for debate. And the House isn't done with the measure either. A significantly pared down version is likely to reemerge from the Senate with provisions on paid family leave and immigration, which are cherished by liberals, expected to be cut. That could provoke a progressive backlash when an amended version returns to the House for final passage. So Biden's legacy achievement is far from assured.And it's unclear whether the massive bill will be a political winner in the short-term. While it would validate a core premise of Biden's case to voters last year that his years of Capitol Hill experience would help him pass big, serious, reform legislation, the bill may not address factors dragging down his presidency. Biden's approval ratings tumbled after a rough summer that included the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, a wave of Covid-19 infections from the Delta variant after the President said the pandemic was mostly over, and the inflation spike and a surge in gas prices that is leaving many voters disgruntled. It's also possible Democrats have overreached by trying to pass massive, liberal, social reform bills despite not having been given a wide mandate during the 2020 elections.Still, Pelosi hailed the measure as a victory in line with generations of legislation designed to improve peoples' lives by forging social progress.""For centuries, members of Congress (have) stood exactly where we stand to pass legislation of extraordinary consequence in our nation's history and for our nation's future,"" Pelosi said, after arriving in the House chamber shortly after 8 a.m. ET.""We, this democratic Congress are taking our place in the long and honorable heritage of our democracy, with legislation that will be the pillar of health and financial security in America.""The bitterness and chaos of the final hours before the vote epitomized the turmoil that has raged around the Build Back Better bill for months. In fact, the spectacle of Democrats squabbling over its size has obscured for the public much of what's in the package. And while it represents a cornerstone of Biden's agenda and is intended to ease economic troubles facing millions of Americans, polls show that many voters believe the President is not addressing the nation's most important issues. McCarthy's speech was in essence a lengthy preview of the Republican argument for next year's midterm elections, as he lambasted Biden over the high gas prices and inflation that are making Thanksgiving more expensive this year. He roasted the President's leadership in Afghanistan. His speech was also deeply repetitive and sometimes misleading about what was in the bill. It meandered into trivial matters with McCarthy running out of material -- he repeated several stories about his son's move to crime-plagued San Francisco and his visits to the southern border. At one point he digressed into musing about the size of carrots.McCarthy may also have had motives other than the bill at hand. He is facing increased pressure from allies of ex-President Donald Trump, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who suggested on Thursday that Trump should be elected speaker if the GOP wins the House next year. McCarthy has done everything he can to shield the ex-President from the consequences of his coup attempt and to turn his party into a compliant tool in Trump's political arsenal. But leading the charge with an hourslong speech that frustrated Democrats will certainly guarantee McCarthy plenty of coverage on social media -- and may garner praise from Trump himself.Uncertain fate in the Senate The Build Back Better bill has threatened at times to rip the Democratic Party apart and may still doom some threatened lawmakers in the midterm elections if it passes into law. Its fate in the Senate remains unclear. Manchin, in particular, wary of its cost, is still uncertain about the scale of many of its programs and the impact of the sprawling bill on inflation. The West Virginian's reservations, as well as those of Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, will present Biden with a test of his authority and stature since he had pledged to progressives that he would finally be able to get both behind the bill, and assure its passage through the Senate. Some progressives who wanted a much larger package are likely to be disappointed. But Manchin has huge leverage since Democrats cannot afford to lose a single member of their caucus in the 50-50 Senate.Still, the House passage of the bill after months of Democratic infighting, which at one point threatened to also scupper the bipartisan infrastructure plan, represents a genuine victory for the President, coming the same week that he signed that infrastructure bill into law. It could boost enthusiasm for his administration among grassroots Democrats he needs to stave off a disaster in next November's midterm elections. And while it has been roughly halved in size to win the support of moderate Democrats, the measure includes many programs on which the party has campaigned in successive elections. It would provide two years of free pre-K education and vastly expand home health care for sick and elderly Americans. The bill extends for one year a child tax credit that supporters say lifted millions out of poverty, expands Affordable Care Act subsidies, provides a Medicare hearing benefit, and provides tens of billions of dollars for affordable housing. If it eventually makes it through the Senate, where Democratic leaders are targeting a final vote before the end of the year, the measure will enhance Biden's claim for a place alongside some of his party's most significant social reformers. It would also be a signature achievement for Pelosi, potentially even outranking her successful push to pass the Affordable Care Act during the Obama administration, and could also be a career capstone for the country's first female speaker if Democrats lose control of the House next year.Dramatic final hours McCarthy played into such concerns in his marathon speech, warning that the measure's ""destructive policies"" would hammer American workers and families and could help doom the Democrats in the midterm elections.""It will crush American industries, it will destroy countless American jobs,"" he said, comparing the bill to the passage of Obamacare in 2010, when he said he saw Pelosi ""walk the Democratic members right down here and pass Obamacare and lose 63 seats."" The dramatic final hours ahead of the bill's likely passage underscored the perilous vote that some endangered lawmakers took to send it to the Senate. Moderate Democrats had waited until the Congressional Budget Office released its assessment of the impact of the measure on the deficit before agreeing to pass it. The CBO estimated that the measure would result in a net increase of $367 billion to the deficit between 2022 and 2031. The White House, however, insists that the bill will be fully paid for. It says it can make up the shortfall because the bill includes funding for better enforcement of Internal Revenue Service tax collecting. But the CBO score represents a huge opening for Republicans who will target vulnerable House members next year with their claims that Democrats are on a ""socialist"" spending spree that will bankrupt future generations ---  notwithstanding the fact the Republican Party cared little for the deficit when Trump was President. Republican leaders and allied groups were already seizing on the deficit question Thursday night. ""Representatives Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05), Ed Case (HI-01), Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), Kurt Schrader (OR-05), and Kathleen Rice (NY-04) promised their constituents that they would not raise the deficit. If they break their word and vote for this bill, they're betraying their constituents,"" Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement, for instance.In another twist, the bill's supporters must also overcome a wrangle over a provision that would expand a state and local tax deduction that critics -- including one of the bill's authors, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- have said is wrong and bad politics. Lifting the cap on state and local tax deductions has been a priority for members from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, but progressives say that the plan is a giveaway to the rich. In an unusual reversal of normal political practice, some conservative Republicans are making the same argument, despite their own 2017 tax bill, which capped the deductions and gave the wealthy and corporations tax cuts.This story has updated with House passage of the bill.

1831,"OFFICIALS IN XINJIANG have always been suspicious of the distinctive cultural identity of ethnic Uyghurs. They worry that it may fuel separatist yearnings in the far-western region. But in 2014, as the authorities stepped up their campaign to crush terrorism there, the government still tolerated displays of pride in Uyghur culture. In October that year a new talent show, “The Voice of the Silk Road”, aired on state-owned Xinjiang Television. It featured songs in various styles, from pop and R to traditional muqam music with lyrics influenced by classical poetry. The judges mostly spoke in Uyghur.
When China began to open up in the late 1970s, after the death of Mao Zedong, Uyghur culture was allowed to flourish, as long as it avoided any hint of support for a separate Uyghur state. Uyghur writers produced poems and songs filled with universally familiar themes such as love and loss, but also conveying pride in their identity. They created innovative blends of muqam with rock and hip-hop that turned a few Uyghurs into household names in China. Songs in such styles were aired on “The Voice of the Silk Road”.

There was nothing politically edgy about the show. It was merely a regional adaptation of a national hit, “The Voice of China” (which is still running). But it fell victim to a security clampdown, launched in response to sporadic attacks by Uyghurs on Chinese belonging to the ethnic-Han majority. Since 2017 some of the show’s stars have disappeared into a vast new gulag in which more than 1m people, most of them Uyghurs, have been locked up.
Officials say the camps offer “vocational education” to help Uyghurs find better jobs and to curb their “extremist” tendencies. But many of those detained have shown no more sign of extremism than simply being devout Muslims. Often, as with those involved in “The Voice of the Silk Road”, their crime has been to show too much enthusiasm for Uyghur culture, not necessarily just Islam.
Those rounded up who were linked with the show include Zahirshah Ablimit, who came second in the competition of 2014, and Muhtar Bugra, a businessman and poet who was its financier and head producer. Both were eventually released. Still thought to be inside are Memetjan Abduqadir, another producer who is also an actor and singer, and Mekhmutjan Sidiq, the director of Xinjiang Television.
Uyghur groups in the West reckon that the four are among nearly 400 intellectuals and cultural figures who have been detained in the new camps, sent to regular prisons or who have otherwise disappeared since the clampdown began. Some are well known in the region: Perhat Tursun, a novelist and poet; Tashpolat Tiyip, the president of Xinjiang University; Rahile Dawut, a scholar of Uyghur folklore; and Ablajan Ayup, an actor and singer sometimes described as a Uyghur Justin Bieber. Others associated with Uyghur culture have been paraded on state television praising the virtues of the Communist Party or singing patriotic songs.
The chill had begun even before the airing of the first episode of “The Voice of the Silk Road”. In September 2014 Ilham Tohti, a revered academic with moderate political views, was sentenced to life in prison for separatism. Mr Tohti had maintained a website that hosted writing by Uyghur intellectuals on social and cultural issues. He had dared to call for more enlightened official treatment of his ethnic group.
Today the only Uyghur culture allowed in China is of a token kind, conforming to a stereotype endorsed by the party such as smiling Uyghurs wearing brightly coloured traditional costume, dancing in public squares and singing, often in Mandarin. On September 29th, at a side event during a meeting in New York of the UN General Assembly, Chinese diplomats showed a video of such performances. It was called “Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land”.
Uyghurs living in exile in the West have been waging a parallel campaign to keep their culture alive. It has involved airing the works of underground artists in Xinjiang whose songs and poems explore more politically risky themes such as oppression and alienation, says Mukaddas Mijit, a specialist in Uyghur music living in France. As repression has tightened, she says, the works of such musicians and poets have become increasingly suffused with lament and despair.
Some writing has even emerged from the camps, such as poetry by Abduqadir Jalalidin, an academic. His verses were memorised by other inmates who relayed them to the outside world. “In this forgotten place I have no lover’s touch”, one begins. “Each night brings darker dreams, I have no amulet / My life is all I ask, I have no other thirst / These silent thoughts torment, I have no way to hope.” The translation is by Joshua Freeman of Princeton University, a former student of his.
In 2022 a novel by Mr Tursun, one of the detained writers, will be published abroad in English. Called “The Backstreets”, it first appeared online, in Uyghur, in 2013. The surreal fable echoes Ralph Ellison’s classic novel “Invisible Man”, about a black American who does not feel fully seen (Mr Tursun was influenced by Ellison). On a street in Urumqi, Xinjiang’s capital, the narrator meets a man who vows to “chop” to death everyone in southern Xinjiang, a mostly Uyghur area. The man vanishes into the fog and the narrator muses: “I would always be the one he was going to chop, even though we didn’t know each other.”
Mr Tursun’s writings and links with other cultural personalities in Xinjiang may have led to his detention in 2018 and his reported jail term of 16 years. A public figure in Urumqi, his politics had once been officially acceptable. He had even criticised Uyghur ethno-nationalism.
But displays of loyalty to the party are no longer enough to keep people safe. In 2017 Shireli Eltekin, a famous singer, released “A Song for Leader Xi Jinping”, a paean to China’s president. It includes fawning lyrics such as: “You put light into the hearts of the people.” Uyghurs in exile were dismayed to hear a much-loved performer crooning for the regime. But one night in June he was taken away from his home in his pyjamas, says a family friend.
In 2018 “The Voice of the Silk Road” was discontinued.It returned last year, with changes. Introducing the new series, the host made approving remarks about building socialism in Xinjiang and loving the party. In this year’s competition, the first contestant to take to the stage sang a Uyghur-language song from the 1950s called “Leader Mao Zedong”. In the show’s early days, this would have been “unimaginable”, says Elise Anderson of the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington, an American ethnomusicologist who competed in the inaugural series of “The Voice of the Silk Road” in 2014.
Such popular entertainment used to suggest at least some official acceptance of Uyghur culture. Now it is evidence of its suppression. Ms Anderson worries that, inside China, “only a Potemkin version” may survive. ■

1832,"“MAN, NIGERIA has been a ride,” laughs Mawuli Gavor, a 32-year-old star in Nollywood, Nigeria’s booming film business. Mr Gavor does not fit the stereotype of an African migrant, struggling to cross the Mediterranean in a leaky boat. Born and raised in Ghana, he was working as an accountant when an admirer suggested he try for a modelling job. Soon, he was in Nigeria, making a fortune in films.
Many Africans are taking similar journeys, though most are less glamorous. In a market in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, Ibrahim Bary, a 25-year-old from Guinea, sells cows’ livers hanging from hooks. Work is easier to find in Senegal than back home.He makes around $4.50 a day and plans to send four days’ pay home to his family in Guinea this month. He previously worked as a taxi driver in Ivory Coast. “I will stay a while, earn some money, and then go home,” he says.

In the decade to 2020 the number of sub-Saharans living abroad jumped from about 20m to 28m. This causes conniptions in Europe, where many voters fear a flood of immigrants. Europe is indeed attractive to Africans. Average incomes are 11 times higher and, though African migrants often do menial jobs, they earn on average three times what they did back home.

But it has become very hard for Africans to move to Europe unless they have rare skills, such as treating sick people or scoring goals (though ageing Europe will soon be short of ordinary workers, too). New permits for sub-Saharan Africans to work there plummeted from 33,000 in 2008 to about half that number in 2018. European governments have lavished cash on border controls and done deals with north African countries to stop migrant boats from setting sail. They sometimes do this brutally. Arrivals have plummeted (see chart 1). A migrant who heads for Europe without permission must pay a fat sum to smugglers and faces a high risk of failure or even death.
Sub-Saharans with get-up-and-go have long been migrating closer to home. Only 18% of those living abroad are in Europe. About 70% are in other African countries (see map). Between 2010 and 2020 the UN says the number of sub-Saharan migrants within Africa rose by more than 40% to 19m (a figure many experts call an underestimate). The Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University analysed a survey by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) of 88,000 people on popular migration routes in west Africa. It found 90% planned to stay in Africa.

Africans are likely to become more mobile. Today, the continent has fewer migrants as a share of population (2%) than the world average (3.5%). Moving costs money: a migrant needs enough to cover at least a bus fare and a few nights’ accommodation while looking for a job. Many Africans cannot yet afford that, but one day they will be able to. Global research suggests that as poor countries grow richer, more of their people tend to emigrate, until average incomes reach around $10,000 a year. Income per head in sub-Saharan Africa is currently $3,800, so there is a lot of room for growth.
The population is increasing, too, at 2.7% per year, more than double the speed in South Asia. More people need not mean a higher rate of migration, but it obviously increases the absolute number of potential migrants. Estimates vary a lot, but there could be twice as many Africans by 2050, and many will be young men, the group most likely to move.
Climate change has not yet spurred large population movements, but it may do so. Large swathes of Africa will become harder to live in. A study in Burkina Faso finds that, because droughts make people poorer, they can reduce cross-border migration. Still, the World Bank says that by 2050 over 50m people in sub-Saharan Africa might move within their own countries because of climate. The authors do not focus on international migration but note that many parts of sub-Saharan Africa that are expected to be climate-migration hotspots are close to borders.
Some Africans are forced to flee their homes. There are 6m refugees on the continent who have crossed a border (and 18.5m displaced within their own countries). However, in most countries migrants are motivated largely by a desire to make a better living. Less than 1% of those in the Stanford analysis said conflict was their main reason for moving.
Migration presents an opportunity for Africa. Migrants’ skills and hard work boost productivity. The taxes they pay fund public services. They send billions home in remittances. And when they return, as many do, they bring back new ideas and valuable contacts. The question for African governments is whether they will make it easier for Africans to move around, or throw up more barriers. There are some signs that they are choosing the former.
Standing at the crossroads
African governments can co-operate, as they showed with a continent-wide free-trade agreement that became operational this year. The African Union, a body that is much looser than the European Union but has ambitions to promote more integration, has put forward a protocol that would allow free movement across Africa. So far, however, few governments have ratified it.
Some still see migrants as a problem (much as European governments do). Barriers to movement are still high. Border guards often hassle migrants, delay them and demand pay-offs. Qualifications from one African country are often not recognised in others, leaving nurses selling fruit in markets. Few states consider migrants in their urban planning. And sending money home is absurdly expensive: to transfer $200 costs about $16, more than in any other region.
Nonetheless, there are reasons to think some of these barriers will fall. Africa has a long history of mobility. Before colonisation, nomads crossed what are now international borders, trade caravans strode the Sahara, and many Africans migrated during the dry season before returning with the rains.When colonies became independent, some of their leaders, such as Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, pushed a pan-Africanist vision of a borderless continent. His ideals were neither universally shared nor consistently upheld by Nkrumah himself. In 1957 his government passed a deportation act and expelled Nigerians who were helping the Ghanaian opposition. Between 1958 and 1996 there were 23 mass expulsions of migrants by 16 African countries.
Still, the pan-African ideal helped create the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a group of former British, French and Portuguese colonies. In 1979 the bloc came to an agreement on visa-free movement and promised that, within 15 years, all its citizens would have the right to work and start a business in any member state. That right still exists, at least on paper. Mr Bary, the Guinean butcher in Senegal, did not need a visa. He just went. It has made “a huge difference”, agrees Mr Gavor, the film star. “If we had more of these unions that actually worked, just imagine the things we could do.”
The right to visa-free travel is mostly respected in all 15 ECOWAS states, but the right to do business is not. “Almost all member states are in violation,” says Franz Celestin of the IOM. Some states still try to reserve industries for locals.
Other regional blocs also allow a measure of free movement. The six countries of the East African Community (EAC) mostly offer visa-free entry to each other’s citizens. Half have eliminated fees for work permits, too. Regional blocs in southern and central Africa are trying to follow suit, but are further behind.
In South Africa many politicians are quick to blame migrants for problems at home. In 2019 mobs of armed men looted and torched shops owned by migrants. At least 18 foreigners were killed, says Human Rights Watch, an NGO.“There is xenophobia every day in South Africa,” says Timothy Sangweeni (not his real name), a Zimbabwean who moved in 2008. At police stations and clinics if “officials hear your voice and see your skin colour they are rude and unhelpful and tell you that you don’t belong,” he says. But, he concedes, “You are allowed to access services.”He first came without papers, but now has a permit, lives in a better neighbourhood, and is married to a South African.
Others are fed up. Aganze Bulonza, a waiter in KwaZulu-Natal, says he wants to go back to Congo. “Even though it is not stable, it’s better than being in a place where you are not wanted.”
An old gripe
The complaint that immigrants take jobs from locals, or drag down wages, is especially loud in South Africa, where wages are high by African standards and unemployment is rife. Yet the evidence is mixed. Migrants sometimes compete with locals for jobs, but they also spend money, which creates other jobs. Costanza Biavaschi of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and co-authors find that, at the local level, male migration reduces employment for native South Africans, but not their income (at the national level, it has a negative effect on South Africans’ total income, but not on employment rates). But a World Bank study, which includes female workers, finds that at the provincial level immigration increases both native employment and wages. And the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, finds new immigrants boost employment and wages of South Africans at the regional level.
In most measurable ways, migration benefits locals. In Africa, it increases manufacturing in both sending and receiving countries, finds the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). It reckons that a 1% increase in the number of migrants to a country is associated with a 0.2-0.4% increase in manufacturing output, possibly because they bring skills and ideas. The better educated the migrants, the bigger the impact.
In Ivory Coast migrants contribute about 19% of GDP despite only being 10% of the population. Migrants are more productive than natives because they are more likely to be of working age. And they often bring complementary skills. Some are hired to fill niches; some move to places where their skills are in demand.
Many also have contacts with their home countries that boost trade.Since 2014, Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda have allowed movement across their borders with just an identity card. Within two years this had increased cross-border trade by 50%, says the Rwanda Development Board, a state agency. Free movement is “essential” for Africa’s new free-trade agreement to succeed, says Paul Akiwumi of UNCTAD.
In Rwanda migrants pay on average three times more tax than locals. An OECD study of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Rwanda and South Africa found that migrants contribute much more in taxes than the cost of the extra public services they use.
The biggest winners from migration are migrants themselves. If they did not think moving would make them better off, they would not go. For obvious reasons, they are more likely to want to move to countries where they can earn more, such as South Africa. Wages there are five times higher than in Zimbabwe or Mozambique, which is one reason why 700,000 Zimbabweans and 350,000 Mozambicans live there. Some 1.4m migrants from Burkina Faso are in Ivory Coast, where income per head ($5,500) is twice as high.
Cosme, a 37-year-old chef in Lagos, had been looking for work for three years in Benin before coming to Nigeria. He found a job in a restaurant in a posh part of town. In Benin “there are no job opportunities like that,” he explains. Today he laments Nigeria’s high inflation but still advises friends to come. He now has a small nest-egg and sends $120 a month to his family.
Such remittances are vital. The World Bank estimates that in 2019 almost $50bn flowed into sub-Saharan Africa, easily topping the $31bn of foreign direct investment that year. About 40% of remittances are from other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, up from 29% in 2012—a larger share than comes from Europe (see chart 2). Those sent within Africa tend to reduce poverty more, says Dilip Ratha of the World Bank, because intra-African migrants have poorer families than do migrants who cross oceans.

Migrants who return provide another boost. Catia Batista of the Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon finds that those returning to Mozambique are 25 percentage points more likely to own a business than those who have not been abroad, even controlling for the possibility that more talented people may travel abroad.Ms Batista also found that people in Mozambique who live in the same village as families with a member who has gone abroad are almost 15 percentage points more likely to vote in elections.
Migration also spreads good ideas. Scientists and engineers who have worked abroad bring back cutting-edge techniques. They bring other things, too. “Any kind of African restaurant you want in Abidjan, you can find,” boasts Issiaka Konaté of the Ministry of African Integration and Diaspora in Ivory Coast. “It’s like London.”
Some African leaders have begun to push for freer movement. Benin, the Gambia and the Seychelles offer visa-free travel for all Africans. At least 34 countries have signed on to a plan to create a single air-transport market that would allow airlines to open up more direct routes. In 2018 the African Union drew up a “free-movement protocol”, which would allow visa-free entry across the continent and subsequently the right to work and to establish a business. By February this year, 33 African states had signed up, but just four had ratified it. Some fear it could bring insecurity or loss of sovereignty, though the protocol could bring some of the vast untaxed informal sector out of the shadows.
African leaders may find promoting migration more popular than they expect. In South Africa, one of the least welcoming places, 29% of people say they would dislike having foreigners as neighbours. Yet in Ivory Coast, just 4% hold that view. Of the 20 most accepting countries in the world for migrants, nine are in sub-Saharan Africa, says Gallup, a pollster. In west Africa 60% of people would like migrant flows to stay the same or increase. In Africa as a whole more people would like to increase or maintain immigration than reduce it.

One obstacle, says Mohammed Abdiker of the IOM, is that migration policy in Africa often reflects European priorities. “A lot of European money” tries to persuade African governments to halt migrant flows north, says Loren Landau of the University of Oxford. This “legitimises a whole lot of really nasty things that can be done to migrants” within Africa, he says. “It also works against any kind of sensible discussion about what countries could be doing.”
The EU funds and advises countries to add more border security and conduct more frequent checks. European-funded anti-migration campaigns tell Africans harrowing stories of death and disaster; that if they move to Europe they will end up begging, and “everyone will hate you for it,” says Mr Landau. All this can stigmatise migration within Africa, increase the chances of police harassment, and make regional migration harder.
Give me your unskilled masses
Some countries, such as Ivory Coast, are trying to include migrants in their planning. “We must say it clearly: migration is an opportunity for Ivory Coast,” says Alcide Djédjé, the minister for African integration. “Ivory Coast applies the ECOWAS free-movement protocol better than anyone,” he boasts. Migrants have the same access to health care and education at the same cost, he adds. Indeed, surveys find they are more likely to go to health centres than locals (though, struggling to pay costs, they are less likely to use local schools).
Migration policy is hard to get right. African governments could start by punishing police who abuse migrants. West African governments should uphold the deal they made long ago: that any ECOWAS citizen can work and open a business in any ECOWAS country. Other regional groups could do likewise. And African governments should ratify the continent-wide free movement protocol, which is a remarkable step on the path to a more integrated and prosperous continent.
All this would make life easier for migrants, most of whom just want to earn a living. Peter Adoa (not his real name), a Ugandan, learnt Swahili on arriving in Kenya seven years ago, got a work permit, opened a nail salon and is engaged to a Kenyan.Yet he is constantly harassed by the police. Recently he was forced to pay $90 to a cop who was threatening him. Not even that can deter him. “That experience fatigues me, but nothing else does,” he smiles. “Everything else is great.” ■",2
1833,"Editor’s note: On November 19th, this article was updated to reflect the verdict in Kyle Rittenhouse's trial.
WHEN CAN you use a gun to defend yourself? A jury in the small Wisconsin city of Kenosha decided on a rather expansive answer when they rendered their verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse on November 19th. After three-and-a-half days of deliberation, with much of the American media camped outside the grand courthouse, they acquitted Mr Rittenhouse, who killed two people and injured a third with his gun during protests last August, on all counts.
The 18-year-old, who has become a darling of the American right, and whose defence was funded by well-wishers, will go free. Those on the left, including a congresswoman who called Mr Rittenhouse a “domestic terrorist”, and even Joe Biden, who implied he was a “white supremacist” will find themselves wondering why 12 ordinary men and women in the courtroom did not agree.

The acquittal could not be predicted, because the trial did not rest on the facts. Most of those were well known long before any witness took the stand. After a night of rioting that followed the shooting by police of a black man, Jacob Blake, Mr Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, travelled to Kenosha to volunteer to defend businesses from looters. He took with him an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle he had paid a friend, Dominick Black, to purchase for him (he was too young to buy it himself). A little before midnight, he became separated from the group he had joined and ended up being chased by Joseph Rosenbaum, a troubled 36-year-old, who he shot four times. He then tried to flee and, having fallen over, shot two more people who ran after him, killing one, Anthony Huber, who had been hitting him with a skateboard, and injuring another, Gaige Grosskreutz, who had been approaching him with a gun in hand.
Rather, the case relied on the jury’s assessment of Mr Rittenhouse’s mind at the moment of the shootings. Was he, as alleged by the prosecution, a naive “chaos tourist” who went to Kenosha to play at being a vigilante and then shot his way out of a scary but not actually life-threatening confrontation? Or was he, as the defence argued, a well-meaning young man who set out to help and was ambushed by unhinged, criminal rioters, who he was forced to shoot? “If I would have let Mr Rosenbaum take my firearm from me, he would have used it and killed me with it and probably killed more people,” claimed Mr Rittenhouse on the stand. Thomas Binger, the lead prosecutor, argued that Mr Rosenbaum was in fact the one threatened by the rifle. The jury clearly preferred the version of Mark Richards, who led the defence, or at least felt that Mr Binger’s argument was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.
Earlier in the trial, Bruce Schroeder, the judge, had stressed that the decision was “not a political trial”. Yet in his jury instructions, he also specifically told them to “pay no heed to the opinions of anyone—even the president of the United States or the president before him”. In contrast to Mr Biden’s intervention, Donald Trump had suggested he was only defending himself.
Ultimately, politics is hard to avoid in cases like this, because the law asks a jury to decide what is a “reasonable” use of a gun, says Samuel Buell of Duke University. That is not something most Americans agree on. In the past decade or so, the “open carry” of weapons, particularly to sensitive events such as protests, has burgeoned, led by right-wing pro-gun activists. Generally it is legal. And yet in most states, pointing a gun at somebody also constitutes an assault. The rules on what is acceptable conduct and what is dangerous are deeply unclear. America finds itself “looking to specific high profile trials as a way of trying to settle contestable social issues that the political system has failed to grapple with”, says Mr Buell.
Sadly, such trials seem sure to proliferate. Even as the jury weighed Mr Rittenhouse’s fate, lawyers in Georgia were busy fighting another case, of three white men accused of killing a black man, Ahmaud Arbery, in February last year. Like Mr Rittenhouse’s victims, Mr Arbery was also shot at close range during a physical struggle. As in Kenosha, it was filmed. And like Mr Rittenhouse, his killers also claimed that their guns could have been used against them. Whatever the verdict in that case, no single court case will provide a good answer to the question of when shooting a person is acceptable. That is something more than 12 Americans at a time must answer.■

1834,"Editor’s note: This story has been updated since first publication on August 8th
ZARANJ, IN NIMRUZ province, was the first to fall, on August 6th. Sheberghan, capital of Jawzjan province, followed a day later. Kunduz, Sar-e-Pol and Taloqan went on August 8th. Aibak was taken on the 9th. Farah and Pul-e-Khumri collapsed on the 10th, Faizabad on the 11th and Ghazni on the 12th. In just one week, the Taliban have captured nearly a third of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals.
The Taliban’s gains had previously been confined mostly to rural districts. The government in Kabul believed that the insurgents lacked the firepower or numbers to seize towns. That proved optimistic. The fall of the Afghanistan’s biggest cities—Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif—is not inevitable, but the mood is grim. “We will overcome this. We will come out stronger and wiser... We will come out like a phoenix,” the vice-president, Amrullah Saleh, said on August 6th, trying to exhort his nation to defiance. Yet morale is low, and the Taliban’s slick propaganda machine is in overdrive.

Many Afghans, however, have responded with defiance. In recent days thousands of people have gathered in the streets and on the rooftops of big cities, including Kabul, to wave the nation’s black, red and green tricolour, chanting “God is Greatest!” The displays began in the western city of Herat, close to the border with Iran. What started as a suggestion on social media was taken up by Ismail Khan, a local warlord who has remobilised his militia to defend the city. Kabul followed Herat’s example the following evening. Similar displays have followed since in many cities.

The chants are both a direct challenge to the Taliban and a vow of support for the Afghan forces, says Saddaf Yarmal, a 20-year-old student who took part. “We have to support our own country,” says Mahjabin Siddiqi, a 23-year-old student, adding, “For 20 years the Americans have been here, but we haven’t seen good results. It has to be us.”
The choice of the phrase “Allahu akbar!” as a rallying cry is pointed. Not only did the same shout form the soundtrack to the resistance to Soviet occupation in the 1980s, but it also directly challenges the Taliban’s claim of a religious mandate to rule. The jihadists assert a direct link to the insurgency that forced out the Russians, portraying their struggle as the latest battle against an un-Islamic regime in Kabul.
A spokesman for the Taliban therefore reacted angrily online to the use of the slogan, claiming ownership of it even though the phrase appears on the flag of Afghanistan. He said that the militants had waged jihad with those words for 20 years and that they should not be used by “American slaves and secularists”.
The defiance on display in Afghanistan’s big cities is directed not only at the Taliban, but also at neighbouring Pakistan, where much of the Taliban’s leadership lives and where their fighters have at times found havens. As the security situation has worsened, anti-Pakistan feeling has grown. “Day by day it’s getting more clear that Pakistan is interfering in our internal issues,” says Javid Safi, a lawmaker from Kunar province, which borders Pakistan.
Both Afghan and withdrawing Western military commanders maintain that the Taliban are not an unstoppable juggernaut. A couple of government victories, or even battles that end in stalemate, could change the dynamic. But the insurgents are on the front foot. The ten towns just lost to them are unlikely to be the last.■",2
1835,"SOME 1,500 years before the birth of Christ, when the chariots of Ahmose I, the first pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, had brought all of Egypt back under the rule of Thebes, the level of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere was about 277 parts per million (ppm). When the Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree a millennium later, and when Socrates drained his cup of hemlock a century after that, the level of CO2 had hardly changed at all. It was barely different when the Tang dynasty in China and the first Muslim caliphate arose in the 7th century AD, or when the Aztec empire fell to the conquistadors nine centuries later on the other side of the world. For most of history the composition of Earth’s atmosphere has been as unchanging a backdrop to the human drama as the arrangement of its continents, or the face of its Moon.
In the middle of the 19th century that changed. Very quickly by historical standards, and instantaneously by geological ones, the CO2 level began to rise. Having stayed between 275ppm and 285ppm for millennia, by the 1910s it had reached 300ppm. By 2020 it was 412ppm (see chart). In a century or so a crucial aspect of Earth’s workings had undergone a change 100 times greater than had previously been seen in a millennium.

An equally sudden shift in the background arrangement of the continents would have been a lot more noticeable. But it might not have been much more consequential. Although the way in which the atmosphere’s carbon-dioxide level affects the planet’s biology, chemistry, and physics does not in itself shuffle the tectonic plates, it changes the world in which they sit.

More carbon dioxide means more plant growth. In the 30 years from 1980 to 2009 satellite observations revealed that between a quarter and a half of the plant-covered surface of Earth—an area between those of Africa and of Asia and Europe combined—grew noticeably greener. Plants were flourishing on the CO2-enriched air, adding tens of billions of tonnes to the planet’s biomass. The oceans, for their part, have grown more acidic after absorbing some of the atmosphere’s sudden CO2 surplus. It is as though ten rivers of pure battery acid the size of the Thames have emptied themselves into the seas.
And then there is the physics. Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation. It is by emitting infrared radiation that the surface of Earth cools itself down. More CO2 in the atmosphere makes this process harder, so it means a warmer Earth. The increase in CO2 since the mid-19th century has, in concert with industrial and agricultural production and the release of other greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and industrial gases like CFCs and HCFCs, increased the planet’s average surface temperature by between 1.1°C and 1.2°C.
This has already had an adverse effect on crop yields which outstrips any of the benefits from a higher level of CO2. It is increasing the frequency, intensity and duration of droughts and heat waves. It has made large tracts of permafrost impermanent, gobbled up mountain glaciers and reduced the area of multiyear ice on the Arctic Ocean by 90%. It is destabilising the great ice sheets of Greenland and western Antarctica and making it easier for midsized hurricanes to intensify into the most powerful of storms. It is also making it harder for nutrients at depth to get to the living things that depend on them close to the surface and reducing oxygen levels. Sea levels are rising by a centimetre every three years or so.
If this were a continental rearrangement, it would be a global tectonic spasm which moved all the continents and their hapless inhabitants away from the poles and towards the equator while, at the same time, pushing once-cool mountain heights down towards sweltering plains and once-stable coastlines beneath the waves. And it would be picking up speed.
There is no doubt that the change in the CO2 level was brought about by humankind—mainly through the burning of fossil fuels, but also through conversion of forests and other natural ecosystems to farmland. As long as those activities continue in their current form, the CO2 level will continue to rise, and the world will move further and more damagingly away from its historical state.
In 1992, when the CO2 level had reached 356ppm and evidence of anthropogenic warming was, if not overwhelming, definitely discernible, the leaders of the world agreed to do something about the potentially catastrophic course they had more or less unwittingly embarked on. In the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed upon at a summit in Rio de Janeiro that year, they committed themselves to the “stabilisation of greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. This was to be done in a “time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner”.
This was, by far, the most ambitious international agreement of all time. There is no way of stabilising the climate without stopping the increase in the levels of long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although it did not say so in so many words—many might not have signed up if it had—the UNFCCC had, in effect, committed its signatories to ending the fossil-fuel age.
A new era
Fossil fuels have been crucial to the development of the economy for two centuries. They played an intimate part in the most important transformation in the human condition since the development of agriculture, a transformation that saw a huge growth both in the world’s population and in people’s wealth. But their use also gave the CO2 level, previously part of the background against which the human drama played out, a potentially show-stealing, or even show-ending, role. It had to be brought under control. It had to be stabilised.
While these remarkable aspirations floated free of specific targets, the sheer magnitude of the task could be ignored, and ignored it largely was. In 2015 in Paris, the same group of countries tethered their aspirations to a set of specific goals, thereby revealing the brutal size of the undertaking. “Preventing dangerous anthropogenic change”, said the Paris agreement, meant in practice, “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”. As to the time frame, the peak in greenhouse-gas emissions should come about “as soon as possible”, there should be “rapid reductions thereafter”, and “a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases” (net-zero emissions) should be achieved by “the second half of this century”—ie, in considerably less than a human lifespan.

As the parties to the UNFCCC converge on Glasgow for the COP 26 summit, this special report looks at what those commitments mean. It is not a guide to the specifics of carbon-cutting policies and technologies, nor to the particular ways in which national commitments made in Glasgow will fall short of the ambition needed. It is a survey of the scale of action required, the battleground on which it will be fought and the fundamental novelty of undertaking to stabilise the climate.
The moment when the CO2 level, so flat for so long, began to rise was the inadvertent beginning of a new era in which the industrial economy and the forces of nature became conjoined. The moment when the now perilously steep curve rounds the corner to a new plateau, or even a steady decline, will be as consequential. But the agreements in Rio and Paris say that this time it will not be inadvertent. The curve-flattening climate stabilisation will be the result of deliberate interventions in both the economy and nature on a global scale. And it will be maintained, if it is maintained, by human institutions with the astonishing, and possibly hubristic, mandate of long-term atmospheric management.■

1836,"“YOU ARE a twenty-first century American hero,” Ed Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said on October 5th. He was not addressing the founder of one of the country’s largest companies, Facebook, but the woman who found fault with it. Frances Haugen, who previously worked at the social-media giant before becoming a whistleblower, testified in front of a Senate subcommittee for over three hours, highlighting Facebook’s “moral bankruptcy” and the firm’s downplaying of its harmful impact, including fanning teenage depression and ethnic violence.
The public has long suspected Facebook of two-faced toxicity but lacked fresh internal communiqués to prove it. That changed when Ms Haugen released a trove of corporate documents to regulators and the Wall Street Journal. Facebook’s own private research, for example, found that its photo-sharing site, Instagram, worsened teens’ suicidal thoughts and eating disorders, yet it still prioritised sending young users engaging content that stoked their anxiety, all while proceeding to develop a version of its site for those under the age of 13. (Facebook has since paused those plans, due to public pressure.)

Senators, who cannot agree on such uncontroversial things as paying for the government’s expenses, united against a common enemy and promised Ms Haugen that they would hold Facebook to account. Could that happen at last?
Facebook has survived scandals before. Congress has repeatedly called in tech bosses for angry questioning and public shaming without taking direct action afterward. Congressional hearings “have become like ‘Groundhog Day’ and haven’t really mattered”, is how Paul Gallant of Cowen Washington Research Group, which tracks tech policy, bluntly puts it. In 2018 a different whistleblower outed Facebook for its sketchy collaboration with a research organisation, Cambridge Analytica, which allowed users’ data to be collected without their consent and used for political profiling by Donald Trump’s campaign. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, went to Washington to apologise, and in 2019 America’s consumer-protection agency, the Federal Trade Commission, agreed to a $5bn settlement with Facebook. That is the largest fine ever levied against a tech firm. However, no laws were ever changed to rein in the company’s misbehaviour.
This new whistleblowing incident could be a turning point, says Blair Levin, a former chief-of-staff to the Federal Communications Commission and now of New Street Research, a private company. Social media’s harmful effects on children and teenagers is a concern that transcends partisanship and is easier to understand than sneaky data-gathering, viral misinformation and other social-networking sins.
If Congress does follow through with legislation, it is likely to focus narrowly on protecting children online, as opposed to broader reforms, for which there is still no political consensus. For example, Congress could update and strengthen the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which was passed in 1998 and bars data-collection of children under the age of 13. Some want to extend protections to teenagers over the age of 13, as well. Other legislative proposals take aim at marketing and design features that make social media so addictive for the young.
However, Ms Haugen’s most significant impact on big tech may be inspiring others to come forward and blow the whistle on their employers’ practices. Whistleblower Aid, a legal support group that has helped Ms Haugen’s case, has seen more inbound calls since her revelations were made public. “A case like this one opens the floodgates and will trigger hundreds more cases,” predicts Steve Kohn, a lawyer who has represented several high-profile whistleblowers. Just look at Swiss banking or pharma to understand the viral spread of whistleblowing, he says. According to Siri Nelson of the National Whistleblower Centre, a legal defence firm, whistleblowers do not just change companies: they “change whole industries.”
There are several factors that make tech ripe for whistleblowing. One is the industry’s culture of flouting rules. Another is a legal framework that makes whistleblowing less intimidating than it used to be. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in 2010, gives greater protections to whistleblowers by preventing retaliation from employers and by offering monetary rewards to successful cases of up to 30% of the money collected from sanctions against a firm. To date, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paid out $1bn to 207 whistleblowers, including more than $500m in its 2021 fiscal year.
If the threat of public shaming encourages corporate accountability, that is a good thing. But it could also make tech less inclusive and transparent, predicts Matt Perault, a former Facebook executive who is director of the Centre for Technology Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People may become less willing to share ideas if they worry about public leaks; companies may become less open with their staff; and executives could start including only a handful of trusted senior staff in meetings that might have otherwise been less restricted.
Executives are going to have to get used to more leaks. Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice-president of policy and global affairs, has defended the company and pushed back against Ms Haugen’s allegations in a memo to the company’s staff, in which he pointed out that last year the company removed 30m posts that violated its policies on terrorism and 19m posts that crossed company lines for inciting hatred. It was barely any time at all before the memo was shared with journalists. Facebook and other big tech firms, which have been criticised for violating people’s privacy online, can no longer count on any privacy either. ■

1837,"ISAABDUL KARIM, aged 42, was the 11th person to die on Rikers Island, New York’s penal colony, this year. “He shouldn’t have there in the first place,” says Corey Stoughton of the Legal Aid Society, which provides free legal assistance to the poor. Mr Karim was sent to New York City’s biggest jail in August for a minor parole violation, despite his parole ending in June. He was held in the “intake unit” for ten days. He slept in his wheelchair and contracted covid-19 in a crowded space. The city’s department of correction said his death appeared to be natural. Since then, another inmate has died on Rikers.
The death toll from covid-19 continues to mount—our excess mortality tracker shows that daily deaths from the virus in America are greater than in all other rich countries combined. Prisons, which are often crowded, poorly ventilated and where the value placed on a life is low, have been hit particularly badly. Yet Rikers is something else. It stands out as an example of how some institutions are unreformable.

Jessica González-Rojas, a member of the state assembly, saw an inmate attempt suicide during a recent visit. She also saw uncollected rubbish and vermin and had to step over faeces and urine. The incarcerated told her of not being fed and of not receiving medical care. This is not exactly news: the island has been poorly managed for a very long time, says Jullian Harris-Calvin, of the Vera Institute of Justice, a think-tank. The city council voted in 2019 to close Rikers permanently by 2027. Bail reform meant fewer people were sent to the island. In April 2020, in part because of covid, fewer than 4,000 were incarcerated there, a drop from the 11,000 when Bill de Blasio, the mayor, took office in 2014.
Rikers seemed to be an ex-problem, and was even sometimes presented as a model of how the prison population could be managed down. More recently, numbers have increased again, to 6,000. At the same time correction officers have stopped going to work. New York City’s guards are permitted to take unlimited sick days, and as many as a third call in sick on a given day, forcing those on duty to work double and triple shifts. There are not enough guards to transport the incarcerated to court hearings, further extending stays at Rikers.
The misery at Rikers is not for lack of resources. The jail’s population fell by half between 2012 and 2020, yet its budget grew by 24%. It costs $438,000 to jail one person there for one year. Of this $379,216 goes to personnel costs; less than 5% goes to services like substance-abuse treatment. The average salary for guards, after five and half years on the job, is $92,073. In 2012, the ratio of inmates to officers in the city was 7:5. In 2020 it was 1.6 officers per inmate.
And yet, the island’s chief medical officer said he is seeing “a collapse in basic jail operations”. On September 29th a federal judge issued an emergency order to safeguard inmates’ wellbeing. Ms Harris-Calvin says the only way to fix Rikers is to “get people off that island”. New York’s politicians and prosecutors seem to agree. Manhattan’s DA suspended bail for non-violent crime. Kathy Hochul, New York’s new governor, issued an executive order allowing virtual court hearings on Rikers. She also signed a bill which will remove minor bail infractions, such as missing curfew, as reasons to be locked up. It does not take effect until next year, but 191 people were released immediately. Mr Karim was eligible, but he missed the cut-off date by a day. ■",2
1838,"While the liberal media was busy prosecuting Kyle Rittenhouse of murder before the juror found him not guilty on all counts, DailyMail.com continued to dig deeper, breaking stories to get to the bottom of the events of August 25, 2020.
Over the course of the trial, DailyMail.com revealed how the prosecution withheld evidence, the chilling content of the death threats received by the judge and the true character of the state's 'star witness' who they tried to paint as a hero.   
And while many are surprised at the verdict, those watching the trial closely will see that the prosecution was doomed from the start, with DailyMail.com revealing that even the Kenosha District Attorney passed the case off to his ADA Thomas Binger because he knew it was a losing proposition.
Below are DailyMail.com's top exclusive stories from the trial that help tell the story of the high-profile Kenosha shooter case that has divided the nation and sparked days of protests.  
Prosecution withheld evidence 
Prosecutors in the Kenosha shooter trial withheld evidence from the defense that was 'at the center of their case,' only sharing the high-definition drone video footage on which they have hung their prosecution after the trial had concluded, DailyMail.com revealed.
Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger played the enhanced drone footage to the jury during his closing statements and claimed that it showed Rittenhouse 'pointing his gun' at people – an assertion that opened the door to the state claiming Rittenhouse provoked the violence of the night of August 25, 2020.
But in the motion obtained by DailyMail.com, Rittenhouse's defense insisted that the state only shared it with the defense after evidence had closed on Saturday November 13.
This is one just one of the grounds on which they made a motion for a mistrial with prejudice filed by Kyle Rittenhouse's defense Monday afternoon.
According to the motion, 'On November 5, 2021, the fifth day of trial on this case, the prosecution turned over to the defense footage of a drone video which captured some of the incident from August 25, 2020.
'The problem is the prosecution gave the defense a compressed version of the video. What that means is the video provided to the defense was not as clear as the video kept by the state.'
The motion goes onto explain that the file size of the defense video is just 3.6MB while the prosecution's is 11.2MB.
The motion states that this larger file was not provided to the defense 'until after the trial concluded'
It reads, 'During the jury instructions conference, the defense played their version of the video for the court to review. The state indicated their version was much clearer and had their tech person come into court to have the court review their clearer video. The video is the same, the resolution of that video, however, was not.' 
The motion states, 'As it relates to the compressed drone footage. The prosecution should be required to explain to the court why they did not copy the footage for the defendant with the same quality as their copy
'The video footage has been at the center of this case. The idea that the state would provide lesser quality footage and then use that footage as a linchpin in their case is the very reason they requested and were granted the provocation instruction by the Court.'
Prosecution's  star witness is a career criminal 
The prosecution's star witness in the Kyle Rittenhouse case had a criminal charge dismissed just six days before the trial's start, meaning the jury had no insight into his extensive criminal record nor his history of lying to police, DailyMail.com revealed.
Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger was well aware of this when he paraded Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, the third man shot on the night of August 25, 2020, as a paragon of selfless virtue. He was a paramedic, the court heard, just there that evening to provide medical aid, as he claimed to have done at countless other protests across the country.
In fact, DailyMail.com learned, he is a violent career criminal with a laundry list of prior offenses and convictions stretching back more than a decade.
These include domestic abuse, prowling, trespass, two DUIs, felony burglary and two charges of carrying a firearm while intoxicated - one of which took place when he was banned as a felon from carrying a firearm.
He also has a history of showing disdain for the law by lying to, and failing to co-operate with, police.
But the Rittenhouse jury heard none of this.
Because just six days before he took the stand, Grosskreutz was before a judge himself at a hearing at which a pending DUI charge – a second offense that saw him three times over the legal limit – was dismissed on a technicality.
Grosskreutz's attorney successfully filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence on the basis that the traffic stop from which it had been obtained had been unlawful.
Police pulled Grosskreutz over on October 6, 2020, for failure to use a signal but under Wisconsin law if there is no other vehicle present a signal is not necessary.
Vile emails sent to judge include threats to 'spit directly into his face' and 'payback' against his children
The judge presiding over the Kyle Rittenhouse trial was slammed as a racist and had his life threatened in a torrent of abusive and menacing emails, letters, postcards and faxes received by Kenosha County Courthouse and seen by DailyMail.com
DailyMail.com reviewed the hundreds of offensive communications sent to Judge Bruce Schroeder, and today we can reveal the extraordinary outpouring of vitriol that the high-profile trial has inspired.
One email, sent last week, reads simply, 'Wow way to name a white skinhead hot head to be a judge. No wonder they burn down your city.'
Others calls for the 'racist' judge, the longest serving in the county, to be dismissed and disbarred.
One addressed to 'Your Honor' reads, 'I didn't know that under your black robes of justice you wear a white robe of the klan. There is no way a fair trial can be heard under your supervision. Better yet, resign.'
Among the most disturbing messages to the judge was one that threatens the lives of the judge's children, promises 'pay back,' and states that Rittenhouse 'won't live long' if acquitted.
The email, much of which is too offensive to reproduce, states the hope that one day Judge Schroeder's 'kids become victims to the most heinous homicide known to man so he feels the pain an [sic]we will call his kids not victims but b******s.'
It is one of a deluge of hate-filled missives that were sent as a direct response to the judge's ruling last month that prosecutors could not refer to Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz - the men shot by Rittenhouse - as 'victims.'
Meanwhile he permitted the defense to use the terms 'looters' and 'rioters' when describing the events of the night of August 25, 2020, when Rittenhouse shot the three men during a night of BLM protests and rioting.
The unrest flared last summer in the wake of a Kenosha police shooting of black man, Jacob Blake. It was in Blake's name that some of the people present marched across three nights that descended into violence during which Kenosha burned.
Another sinister email sent in reaction to the October ruling reads, 'This is outrageous…What fresh hell is this???? Rittenhouse is a murderous thug and trying to protect him says a LOT about this judge.
'We are watching.'
It continues, 'Enjoy your term, judge, it's going to be your LAST. If I ever meet you in person, I fully intend to spit directly into your face, regardless the cost. You're disgusting.'
The emailer signs off, as many do, using his full name.  
'Jump-kick man' who kicked Rittenhouse in the face is a career criminal
A career criminal and convicted felon with an open domestic violence charge has claimed to be the unidentified male at whom Kyle Rittenhouse shot twice at close range but missed, on the night of August 25, 2020.
Rittenhouse was charged with First Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety of the man known in trial only as 'jump-kick man,' for the flying kick he took at the teenager's head as Rittenhouse was attacked minutes after he shot Joseph Rosenbaum dead. 
Maurice Freeland, 39, admitted that he was the one who kicked Rittenhouse in the head and narrowly avoided being shot as a result, after the then 17-year-old stumbled to the ground as he attempted to flee. 
The state has painted all these actors, including those Rittenhouse killed and injured, as heroes attempting to take down an 'active shooter.'  
It emerged that the same is true of 'jump-kick man' who was on bond that night for an alleged assault on his girlfriend that included kicking her in the ribcage having thrown her to the floor.
DailyMail.com already revealed that both Huber and Grosskreutz have lengthy and violent criminal histories, with the latter having a history of lying to police. 
DailyMail.com revealed that the man he painted a hero was out on bond having been charged with Battery Domestic Abuse, Criminal Damage to Property Domestic Abuse and Disorderly Conduct Domestic Abuse for an incident that took place on March 23, 2020.
Court records obtained by DailyMail.com detail the night in question – a night during which Freeland and his partner Monalisa N McDuffie had both been drinking.
Police responded to a call about 'family trouble,' at approximately 12.19am.
Kenosha District Attorney knew the case was a losing proposition and passed the buck to his ADA Thomas Binger
Mike Graveley, the Kenosha County DA would normally have taken the case himself, but instead handed it down to assistant DA Thomas Binger, whose presentation of the case in Wisconsin has been marked with missteps and clashes with Judge Bruce Schroeder.
'Binger was set up for failure,' one Kenosha legal insider told Dailymail.com. 'Graveley is the superstar and he knew this one was sure to tarnish it.'
According to conservative outlet Milwaukee Right Now, Graveley 'pawned the case off to his unfortunate assistant district attorney, Thomas Binger, who was left to spin gold out of a pile of self-defense straw.' 
'He has said things in court that have been ruled out of order, but once they have been said, you can't unring that bell,' Kevin Mathewson, a criminal defense investigator and former Kenosha City alderman told DailyMail.com.
'This is how Binger has always operated. He pushes the envelope as far as he possibly can — but this time the whole world is watching him.'
Mathewson, who was unsuccessfully sued over a Facebook page in which he asked for people to turn up with guns to defend property during the August 2020 Kenosha riots, has been a frequent critic of Graveley's office.
But he says he respects the DA's prosecuting skills. 'He is by far the best prosecutor in the office and he should be the one prosecuting the Rittenhouse trial — the most high-profile and difficult case his office is ever likely to handle.
'It's not that he hides from publicity. Earlier this year he prosecuted a teenager called Martice Fuller who killed his high school sweetheart and shot at her mother.
'That was a high-profile case, but it wasn't a difficult case to prosecute,' added Mathewson. 'There was video of the shooting.
'Just about any prosecutor could have got a conviction.'
Mathewson is not the only one who is hammering Graveley for his absence from the Rittenhouse case. Graveley himself said he would not lead the prosecution as he was investigating the case against the cop who shot Joseph Blake, leading to the unrest in Kenosha during which Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber.
Gravely — who was named Wisconsin's prosecutor of the year earlier this month — decided way back in January that the officer should not be prosecuted for the shooting which left Blake paralyzed. The DA also said he has to prosecute another case which will likely start before the Rittenhouse case is over.
But those excuses are getting short shrift from some, who believe Rittenhouse either should never have been prosecuted or should have faced lesser charges.
'It's time to put DA Mike Graveley's picture on a milk carton,' wrote Milwaukee Right Now. 
Anti Kyle Rittenhouse protestor was once charged with making terrorist threats against his former high school 
The young man arrested after scuffling with a Kyle Rittenhouse supporter outside the courthouse was once charged with making terrorist threats against his former high school.
Anthony Chacon, 20, is now facing charges of battery, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest following his latest run-in with the law.
But the day before school re-opened in September 2019 he posted a picture of himself pointing a gun on Snapshot, along with a message threatening Westosha Central High School in Paddock Lake, Wisconsin.
He used the N-word in his threat, according to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com.
'Young n***a gon hop ina gym shoot everything but the rim,' Chacon — who is white according to his police booking details — allegedly wrote. The words come from Till The End, a rap song by YNW Melly.
The case was eventually dismissed and Chacon pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct.
Chacon, who now lives in Kenosha, was one of two people arrested Wednesday as tempers frayed outside the city's courthouse. The second, Shaquita Cornelious, 34, whose Facebook page describes her as the co-chairman of Black Lives Matter of Lake County, Illinois, was charged with disorderly conduct.
Video taken by DailyMail.com showed Chacon, wearing a F**k Kyle T-shirt, Simpsons backpack, and Chicago Bulls beanie, clashing with prominent Rittenhouse supporter Emily Cahill on the courthouse steps.
The two traded X-rated insults before Chacon threw a sign at Cahill. He and fellow anti-Rittenhouse protestors tried to wrestle the sign back and as he was being pulled off Cahill, he sucker-punched a reporter in the jaw.
Other protestors tried unsuccessfully to lead Chacon away and calm him down, but he then went on to strike several other people — including a DailyMail.com photographer — before being pinned to the ground and hauled away in a paddywagon.
He was heard calling for his mom as the vehicle pulled away.
The flurry of violence came after supporters of both sides had been sharing pizza as they awaited the verdict for the second day.
Chacon is no stranger to the courts. He has a record of being charged with minor offences. In September last year, he and his girlfriend Rachael Randle got in a fight at their Kenosha apartment that spilled out into the street.
A woman flagged down two cops to tell them that Chacon and Randle were 'holding knives and attempting to stab one another.
The witness said Randle ran up the staircase but Chacon caught her and threw her down the stairs. Randle told police the fight started after she tried to evict Chacon from her apartment.
'Ms. Randle stated that (Chacon) yelled at her with his fists clenched in an aggressive manner,' the police report said. The only visible injury that Randle received was 'a small cut on her forehead along the hairline.'
That case has not yet been resolved.
In another case also still to be resolved, he was charged with battery in December last year after allegedly getting involved in a fight between two cousins over a woman.
Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two of them and wounding the third, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. Rittenhouse has argued that he fired in self-defense after the men attacked him. 
Here's a look at the charges that prosecutors carried into court, as well as lesser charges that the judge could put before the jury in final instructions:
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot. Bystander video shows Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse through a parking lot and throwing a plastic bag at him. Rittenhouse flees behind a car and Rosenbaum follows. Video introduced at trial showed Rittenhouse wheeling around and firing as Rosenbaum chased him. Richie McGinniss, a reporter who was trailing Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for Rittenhouse's gun.
Reckless homicide differs from intentional homicide in that prosecutors aren't alleging Rittenhouse intended to murder Rosenbaum. Instead, they're alleging Rittenhouse caused Rosenbaum's death in circumstances showing an utter disregard for human life.
Former Waukesha County District Attorney Paul Bucher said prosecutors' decision to charge reckless instead of intentional homicide shows they don't know what happened between Rittenhouse and Rosenbaum and what might have been going through Rittenhouse's mind when he pulled the trigger.
The charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The dangerous weapon modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Judge Bruce Schroeder to let the jury also consider a lesser charge, second-degree reckless homicide, that does not require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. It's punishable by up to 25 years in prison. But after Rittenhouse's attorneys objected, Schroeder said he did not plan to give that instruction. He said he expected that a guilty verdict on that count would be overturned because the defense objected to adding it.
COUNT 2: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This felony charge is connected to the Rosenbaum shooting. McGinniss told investigators he was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. The charge is punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier carries an additional five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to let the jury consider a second-degree version of this charge. The difference is that the second-degree version doesn't require a finding that Rittenhouse acted with utter disregard for human life. Schroeder said he was inclined to allow that instruction, though he didn't make a final ruling. The charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
COUNT 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
Video shows an unknown man leaping at Rittenhouse and trying to kick him seconds before Anthony Huber moves his skateboard toward him. Rittenhouse appears to fire two rounds at the man but apparently misses as the man runs away.
This charge is a felony punishable by 12 1/2 years in prison. The weapons modifier again would add up to five more years.
Schroeder said he would decline prosecutors' request that jurors be allowed to consider this charge in the second degree.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This charge is connected to Huber's death. Video shows Rittenhouse running down the street after shooting Rosenbaum when he falls to the street. Huber leaps at him and swings a skateboard at his head and neck and tries to grab Rittenhouse's gun before Rittenhouse fires. The criminal complaint alleges Rittenhouse aimed the weapon at Huber.
Intentional homicide means just that - a person killed someone and meant to do it. Bucher said that if Rittenhouse pointed the gun at Huber and pulled the trigger that would amount to intentional homicide. However, self-defense would trump the charge.
'Why I intended to kill this individual makes the difference,' Bucher said.
The count carries a mandatory life sentence. The weapons modifier would add up to five years.
Prosecutors asked Schroeder to give the jury the option of second-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide and second-degree reckless homicide in Huber's death. The defense objected only to the second-degree reckless homicide charge, and Schroeder said he 'embraced' that argument.
Second-degree intentional homicide is a fallback charge when a defendant believed he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that it was necessary to use force - but either belief was unreasonable. It's punishable by up to 60 years in prison.
The first-degree reckless homicide charge sought in Huber's death matches an original charge in Rosenbaum's death - it would require jurors to decide that Rittenhouse caused Huber's death with an utter disregard for human life - and is punishable by up to 60 years in prison.
COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE, USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON
This is the charge for Rittenhouse shooting Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm seconds after he shot Huber, and as Grosskreutz came toward him holding a pistol. Grosskreutz survived. Video shows Rittenhouse pointing his gun at Grosskreutz and firing a single round.
The charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 years. The weapons modifier would add up to five more years.
Prosecutors asked that the jury be allowed to consider lesser counts in the Grosskreutz shooting: second-degree attempted intentional homicide, first-degree reckless endangerment and second-degree reckless endangerment. Defense attorneys didn't oppose the first, but did oppose adding the reckless endangerment counts. Schroeder didn't rule but said he was inclined to side with prosecutors.
The possible punishment for attempted second-degree intentional homicide is 30 years.
DISMISSED - COUNT 6: POSSESSION OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON BY A PERSON UNDER 18
Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle. He was 17 years old on the night of the shootings. Wisconsin law prohibits minors from possessing firearms except for hunting. It was not clear on Friday what Schroeder intends to tell jurors about that charge.
The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.
Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed count 6 from Rittenhouse's rap sheet Monday morning. 
COUNT 7: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AN EMERGENCY ORDER FROM STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with being out on the streets after an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by the city, a minor offense that carries a fine of up to $200. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the charge during the second week of trial after the defense argued that prosecutors hadn't offered enough evidence to prove it",-2
1839,"THE JOBS numbers a year ago were grim. Unemployment across the rich world rose from 5% to 9% in April 2020. In America unemployment rose from 4% to nearly 15% in a month, such a rapid increase that some social-security computers broke. In its June 2020 forecasts, the OECD foresaw worse to come. If there were a second wave of covid-19 at the end of the year, it said, unemployment would reach 12.6% before inching downwards, but not falling below 10% until the second half of 2021.
There were good reasons to expect high unemployment to persist. Rather like the price of petrol, it tends to be quick to rise but slow to fall. Fifty years of data from America, Australia, Canada and Japan suggest that increases in unemployment happen 50% faster than declines. A worker can clear her desk in minutes, but searching, applying and interviewing for a job takes time. After recessions bosses are cautious about hiring new workers, as they want to be sure that business has genuinely recovered. Moreover, the pandemic turned out to be even more malevolent than the OECD predicted, with some countries experiencing three waves of infection. Yet unemployment across the club fell rapidly from a peak of 9% in the spring. By the end of 2020 it was 6.9%, half the level that the OECD had feared. 

Some pundits fret that unemployment is now a poor guide to the labour market, because large numbers of people have dropped out of the labour force. Correcting this by assuming that everyone who has left the labour force really wants a job raises “true” unemployment by 1.5 percentage points. That is a big difference, but not enough to change the story of a labour market performing better than expected.

Using official data is tricky for another reason. In many places, including Australia, Japan and especially Europe, governments launched furlough schemes, under which people were counted as employed even though they were not working. There have been efforts to correct for this, including one by UBS, a bank, that analyses economy-wide working hours to estimate a “shadow” unemployment rate. Yet there is evidence of a bounceback. The Economist has adapted UBS’s methodology and finds that Europe’s shadow unemployment rate rose from 7% in 2019 to 20% in the second quarter of 2020, but fell to 10% in the third quarter and has probably fallen further since. 
The idiosyncrasies of a pandemic-induced recession may explain why the labour-market recovery has been faster than expected. The rich world has got better at coping with lockdowns. Restaurants have found ways to offer takeaway and delivery services. Governments have allowed more low-risk activities, such as manufacturing and construction, to continue. Even under lockdown, demand for workers has been higher than it was when covid-19 arrived in early 2020. 

The type of unemployment matters. Last spring the vast majority of unemployed Americans said they were “on temporary layoff”, meaning that they had been told there was no work for them but there might be soon. Returning to an old job is easier than finding a new one, speeding recovery. A big majority of individuals who left unemployment in May and June of 2020 returned to work at their previous employers, according to a paper in February by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. That corporate bankruptcies have been far lower than many people expected also means more workers had jobs to go back to. For many people who had to leave their jobs for good, labour-market “reallocation” has found them new ones. Although demand in leisure, hospitality and travel has plunged, the pandemic has created new needs, from contact-tracers to Zoom trainers. The boom in online shopping has similarly boosted demand for warehouse workers and delivery drivers.
The upshot is that jobs are churning. A recent paper by José Maria Barrero of ITAM Business School and colleagues finds that the rate of employment reallocation (a calculation that accounts for some firms creating jobs and others destroying them) in America is running at twice its pre-pandemic level. In mid-March 2021 American job postings on Indeed, a website, were 9% above the previous baseline. Reallocation in Europe has been slower, in part because furlough schemes have kept workers tied longer to pre-pandemic jobs, but it is happening. In 11 European countries total advertised vacancies fell by 50% in the financial crisis of 2007-09, but by only 25% during the pandemic. In Australia, which locked down hard but is now bouncing back, vacancies are an astonishing 20% above their previous level. 
Extra demand for workers has in part been met by existing companies. But new firms have also entered the market to fill gaps. America has seen a burst of startups. In 2020, 1.5m firms that are likely to end up employing people were founded, according to official data, up by 16% on 2019. Other countries, such as Britain, Canada and France, saw a similarly big rise in business formation in the second half of 2020. A recovery with lots of startups tends to be more jobs-rich than one without, since young firms are typically quicker to expand.
Technology has smoothed reallocation. Compared with the recession after the financial crisis, job-search websites such as Indeed and Monster are now more widely used. This makes it easier for firms to find workers, and vice versa. Yong Kim of Wonolo, a platform for blue-collar workers based in San Francisco, says that in the early days of the pandemic many industries, including fulfilment centres for online deliveries, struggled with labour shortages, but his platform has helped people to fill the gaps. 
The rich world’s job-market recovery still has a way to go. During the northern hemisphere’s winter the fall in unemployment has slowed, reflecting rising covid-19 cases. And much of the remaining joblessness is concentrated among the poor. In America, over 25% fewer jobs paid less than $27,000 a year in January 2021 than in January 2020, even as higher-wage jobs recovered. In Europe unemployment among people with tertiary education is marginally higher than it was before the pandemic, but a lot higher among high-school dropouts. Will vaccines allow poorer folk to find work again—or might they find it hard for years to come?
Consumer habits will partly determine the fate of low-wage workers. Even if the covid-19 threat passes entirely, people may be more homebound than they were, either because they are more risk-averse or because they are more often working from home. As a result, demand for the sorts of low-wage jobs that help people outside their home—such as serving staff, hotel workers or flight attendants—might be lower than it was. 
Yet there is reason to hope that the pandemic will not turn people into hermits. In New Zealand attendance at restaurants, cafés, shopping centres and theme parks is higher than it was before the pandemic. According to OpenTable, a booking platform, in the first two months of 2021 the number of Australian restaurant diners was 65% higher than before the pandemic. Because borders are closed, Australians are spending more locally. “The martinis were so good,” reports one bon vivant in Sydney, “that we ended up not ordering wine with the meal. We just had seven martinis each.”
Even in Australia and New Zealand, though, employment is still somewhat lower than it should have been. And the jobless include many low-wage workers. The covid-19 shock elsewhere was larger, making it more likely that consumers’ preferences have permanently changed and some workers have lost habits that made them more employable. The coming wave of jobs will not catch everyone, at least not for a while. Yet it will be broader and more powerful than even optimistic pundits had predicted. ■

1840,"HUAWEI, A CHINESE firm emblematic of the breakdown in Sino-American relations, makes for a perfect business-school case study. Less than two years ago the company, based in the southern boom town of Shenzhen, had not only surpassed Nokia and Ericsson, its Nordic rivals, to become the world’s leading supplier of telecoms infrastructure. It had also overtaken Samsung to become the biggest seller of mobile phones. Like all good case studies, it has vivid characters, from its founder, Ren Zhengfei, a former army officer and engineer, to his daughter, Meng Wanzhou, just freed from a starring role in the first prisoner-exchange drama of the tech cold war. It is a groundbreaking firm. Like Japan’s Sony in the 1980s, it helped change the perception of its home country from one of cheap knock-offs to eye-catching innovation. And its very future may be in peril. With the long arm of American law enforcement around its neck, it is being throttled by a lack access to cutting-edge technology, such as 5G smartphone chips.
The question is what Huawei ought to do next. Should it tough out American sanctions and hope, as Victor Zhang, its global vice-president, puts it, that its research and development (R) budget, a whopping $21.8bn last year, can “fertilise” a new array of business activities that will redefine its future? Or should it instead quietly break itself up, dispersing a 105,000-strong army of engineers to seed a flurry of new ventures? In short, should it remain a tall poppy or let a hundred smaller flowers bloom?

It is a fairly safe bet that Huawei will take the first option. After all, it is an employee-owned company with a fierce self-belief. It has a never-say-die business culture; its salespeople are renowned for drinking anyone under the table in pursuit of a deal. It could become a national champion for President Xi Jinping’s mission to make the country more self-reliant in technology. And the government in Beijing would hate the idea of it wilting under pressure from Uncle Sam.
The tough-it-out approach is strewn with difficulties, though. Since America’s government branded Huawei’s 5G gear a national-security threat in 2019, and a year later curtailed the firm’s access to chips made with American equipment, its smartphone business, which in 2020 generated more than half of revenues, has cratered. Sales have tumbled from more than 60m units in the last three months of 2019 to about 15m units in the third quarter of 2021, according to Dan Wang of Gavekal Dragenomics, a research firm. In China its latest phones lack 5G connectivity.
Although Huawei remains the world’s number-one supplier of telecoms gear, its sales and market share are shrinking as America’s allies bar it from their 5G networks and other customers fret about its long-term viability. Huawei is putting on a brave face, nonetheless. It is in its “second startup phase”, in Mr Zhang’s words. Each year it pours at least a tenth of its revenues into R (in 2020 the share reached almost 16%). This, Mr Zhang adds, will help build up new core ventures. It is expanding in areas from making cars smarter and helping coal mines become semi-autonomous to infrastructure for cloud-computing and regulating power supply in energy markets. None of these opportunities depends on cutting-edge semiconductors.
Promoting that startup culture in-house may work. But the new endeavours do not generate anything like the revenues of Huawei’s smartphone and networks businesses. One analyst describes the coal venture as “a dying company meets a dying industry”. A better, bolder way forward would be to embrace the Schumpetarian creed of “creative destruction”: let the old firm die so that new ones could emerge, dispersing capital, ideas and talent.
Silicon Valley provides a striking precedent. In 1957 the so-called “traitorous eight” walked out of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to found Fairchild Semiconductor. The “Fairchildren” became the backbone of the area’s high-tech, risk-taking culture, establishing Intel, a chip giant, and scores of other firms, including venture-capital veterans like Kleiner Perkins. Huawei’s engineers at HiSilicon, its chip-design unit, could do something similar. That could advance China’s growing ambitions in the chip industry, illustrated by the unveiling on October 19th by Alibaba, a tech giant, of a new, custom-built, state-of-the-art server chip.
Huawei has no plans for a HiSilicon spin-off, Mr Zhang says. The firm’s tactical retreat in the smartphone business illustrates what it may and may not be able to do. Last year it sold Honor, a niche smartphone brand, to give it the freedom to evade American export controls. Honor’s new phones now have access to American chips and the software and services of Google, an American tech giant, that Huawei still does not. Despite the backing of Shenzhen’s government, which invites questions about just how entrepreneurial Honor will be, the industry’s reaction to the divestiture has been “really positive” both inside and outside China, reports Ben Stanton of Canalys, a telecoms-research firm. Moreover, he reckons, Huawei’s best smartphone engineers have moved to Honor, keeping alive the older firm’s engineering and sales culture.
Tall-poppy syndrome
Unsurprisingly, Honor has also attracted the attention of America’s foreign-policy hawks, including Marco Rubio, a Republican senator who on October 14th called it an “arm of the Chinese Communist Party” and a foreign-policy threat, and urged President Joe Biden’s administration to blacklist it. This is a reminder of how hard it will be for any firm in Huawei’s shadow to shake off such accusations, whether true or not. Better for its engineers to roam free instead. They are likely to be more creative within small groups than inside a corporation—all the more so if what Mr Wang calls “China’s Sputnik moment” engenders a burst of domestic innovation. Huawei’s liberated brain-boxes may then also teach America a lesson in how counterproductive knee-jerk technonationalism can be. ■

1841,"AS COP26 FINALLY came to a close on November 13th, more than 24 hours behind schedule, the mood inside the drab temporary buildings erected to house it on the banks of the River Clyde was a mix of celebration and frustration. The painful reality suffusing the conference was that the world is failing to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, despite promising to do so in the Paris agreement of 2015. Yet the summit put a series of new procedures in place that keep alive the possibility of reaching that goal, if countries suddenly find it within themselves to embrace drastic measures.
In an admission that the goals set in Paris were not being met, the summit sought to speed up the fight against climate change in a number of ways. There was an unexpected, and eventually unanimous, call for a faster phasing down (though not out) of the “unabated” (ie, polluting) use of coal and for the scrapping of subsidies for fossil fuels. In a departure from previous COPs, a number of countries joined assorted “coalitions of the willing” to do their part to eliminate coal power, reduce methane emissions, make financial services greener, protect forests and more.

Perhaps most important of all, governments agreed to beef up their national plans for reducing emissions over the coming decade before meeting for next November’s COP27 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. That means translating the promises made in Glasgow into policies and seeking new ways to hasten the transition away from fossil fuels by 2030.
One way to look at the 1.5°C challenge is in temperature terms. The global average in 2020 was 1.1-1.3°C warmer than pre-industrial levels, and that figure is rising by 0.1-0.3°C each decade. The pledges made at the time of the Paris agreement in 2015 led climate modellers to project a “best guess” of 2.7°C of warming by 2100. The more ambitious ones made in Glasgow reduced that by perhaps 0.3°C.
Another way of measuring the task ahead is in billions of tonnes of avoided greenhouse-gas emissions. Prior to Glasgow, there was a gap of 23bn-27bn tonnes between the emissions reductions needed by 2030 to avoid more than 1.5°C of eventual warming and the emissions foreseen between now and 2030 in countries’ climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs. The new NDCs for 2030 presented in the run-up to the summit narrowed the gap by a mere 4bn tonnes, according to Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a coalition of climate modellers. Pledges at the summit on methane, coal, electric vehicles and forestry shaved off roughly 2bn tonnes more. So, on top of current commitments, further cuts of approximately 17bn-20bn tonnes of greenhouse gases must be made before 2030 to meet the 1.5°C goal (see chart).

The past year has seen many countries promise to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. The next must focus on curtailing emissions in the coming decade. The 17bn-20bn tonnes of greenhouse gases that need to be cut by 2030 correspond to a 45% drop from 2010 levels. Even then, there would be only a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN-convened conclave of climate scientists. Yet current NDCs will result in a rise in emissions, not a drop, by 2030.
The yawning gap between ambition and reality, and the dwindling time to close it, are what drove attention in Glasgow to the Paris agreement’s “ratchet”: a clause stating that every five years parties to the agreement must lay out their plans for reducing emissions by the end of the subsequent decade. Glasgow in effect added an extra crank of the ratchet by requesting fresh pledges for 2030 be made by November next year, before decarbonisation plans for 2035 are presented in 2025.
Even these extra pledges are unlikely to be sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C. But the widespread view in Glasgow was that, even though the necessary cuts would be almost impossible or cripplingly expensive to meet, the 1.5°C goal should not be abandoned because each step towards it is beneficial. Every tenth of a degree of warming has consequences for human wellbeing and carries large financial costs. Extreme weather brought about by global warming has proliferated over the past decade. Counterfactual climate modelling has shown it contributing to all manner of calamities from fires to floods and deadly heatwaves.
Show me the money
Another focus in Glasgow was the need for more lending to help poor countries shift out of fossil energy, to build societies that are better adapted to the impacts of climate change, and to recover from the damage caused by extreme-weather events. Poor countries resent that they were promised $100bn annually by 2020 to deal with the first two needs, yet only $80bn a year has materialised. Eventual costs are likely to be in the trillions. Yet the only material concession that was made related to funding for adaptation, which was supposed to have made up half of the $100bn but so far has only amounted to some $20bn. Rich countries pledged in Glasgow to at least double the amount given by 2025.
The talks were marked by a perceptible change in the rhetoric around such financial assistance. In the 2010s, poor countries framed the $100bn figure partly as a show of solidarity from rich countries and partly as a charitable grant. The West had grown wealthy by burning fossil fuels, the argument ran, and so should help clean up the mess. In addition to this moral claim to assistance, another justification came to the fore in Glasgow. It frames the cash as an essential tool for energy transition, rather than as a form of aid. Without it, poor countries said they could not decarbonise, thus jeopardising the Paris goals—so more cash will need to be found.
One model for doing this will be closely watched over the coming year. America, Britain, the EU, France and Germany have agreed to raise a pot of $8.5bn from a mix of public and private sources for South Africa. In exchange it has agreed to decarbonise its electricity supply, currently derived almost entirely from coal, while protecting the livelihoods of the 120,000 people who work in the industry. If the results between now and COP27 are promising, it could become a model for other countries.
A host of other measures, taken together, could begin to narrow the emissions gap.More countries could sign up to the “sectoral pledges”, as the coalitions of the willing are known in climate jargon, or to adopt their own goals if, like China, they are reluctant to join the multilateral deals. As part of its renewed climate collaboration with America announced in Glasgow, China said it would draw up a national strategy for curbing methane emissions. That is important, since it spews out more of the stuff than any other country, and did not sign up to the sectoral pledge. John Kerry, America’s COP26 envoy, suggested the Chinese plan on methane would be unveiled before COP27.
CAT estimates that if all countries were to sign on to all four sectoral pledges on methane, coal, cars and forests, the 17bn-20bn tonnes in emissions cuts needed to reach 1.5°C could be narrowed by a further 6bn-9bn tonnes. That is large but hypothetical since the forest pledge, especially, is questionable, given the failure of previous efforts to curb deforestation and the fact that Indonesia, one of the worst culprits, has already withdrawn support.
Voluntary carbon markets could also contribute to emissions reductions, but only if their standards are improved. Although the volumes traded are not yet in the billions of tonnes, demand has grown and is receiving a boost from the increasing number of private companies with climate targets. Theoretically, these markets could help steer private funds towards the most effective carbon-reducing projects and accelerate decarbonisation. But the markets are poorly regulated and standards are variable.
Other avenues to narrow the emissions gap to 1.5°C include financial incentives for emerging economies to cut emissions with a mix of public and private funds, the threat of carbon border-adjustment mechanisms that will tax CO2-heavy imports, and more transparency and accountability in the private sector. Currently, there are hundreds of different standards for corporate disclosure of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data. Firms can therefore cherry-pick flattering numbers and investors struggle to compare different companies.
Regulators can also play a part in corporate transparency. António Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, intends to set up a body to examine net-zero pledges made by companies and to develop standards. Rishi Sunak, Britain’s chancellor, said that the country will “strengthen requirements’‘ from 2023—but not yet make it mandatory—for all British financial institutions and all companies listed on British stockmarkets to publish plans explaining how they will decarbonise operations, lending and investment. However, all these regulatory measures will take years to have much effect.
The next 12 months will be marked by a constant drumbeat to keep up the pressure on climate change. In April the 15th UN biodiversity summit will release new goals for protecting ecosystems. Some of these will seek to fight climate change as well by increasing the volumes of CO2 that are soaked up by vegetation and the oceans. In June the Swedish government will host a UN conference to mark the 50th anniversary of the first Earth summit. Throughout the year, a UN-sanctioned global stock-taking of progress towards the Paris agreement goals will get under way. Its conclusions are due in 2023.
And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish not one but three reports, the first of which will almost certainly conclude that the impacts of climate change are already at the high end of what previous reports had anticipated, and that future effects, even if warming could be limited to 1.5°C, are likely to be worse than previously thought in rich and poor countries alike.
That will also be a focus of the new COP presidency. The handover began in Glasgow, where Egyptian leaders hinted that adaptation and resilience would be high on the agenda for COP27. Sharm el-Sheikh, too, is likely to see frustration do battle with celebration. ■

1842," (CNN)A mother's depression and anxiety from conception through the first year of the baby's life is associated with negative developmental outcomes through adolescence, according to a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.That could affect a lot of women: About 15% to 23% of women worldwide experience anxiety during pregnancy, while 15% deal with anxiety after childbirth. Depression through pregnancy is estimated to affect 10% of women, and 15% face postpartum depression. The burden is greater for women who are experiencing poverty or are teen parents, according to Postpartum Support International. For the baby, the perinatal stage — which is defined as the time from conception through pregnancy (antenatal), birth and the first year of the baby's life (postnatal) — is ""a time of unprecedented growth and sensitivity,"" the study said. That's when exposures and early life experiences may modify development starting from when he or she is in the womb to that critical first year as a growing child and onward. A mother experiencing depression and anxiety before and after birth was moderately linked with her child's deficits in language and cognitive and motor development in infancy. All of these children were more likely to exhibit behaviors that either internalized negative feelings or targeted them toward others. These kids experienced and reacted with more negative emotions and were temperamentally difficult through adolescence as well. ""In light of the pandemic, these are particularly concerning results,"" said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University, who wasn't involved in the study. ""Since risk factors for perinatal depression include life stress and lack of social support, pregnant and postpartum women may be particularly vulnerable right now.""These data that suggest that this poses risks not just for the mother, but also for her child, not just now but into adolescence, is a stark reminder that the indirect effects of Covid-19 may be long-lasting,"" Jamieson added. Researchers have conducted reviews of studies on the relationship between a woman's mental health during this time and her child's development — but they hadn't previously evaluated the long-term effects of depression and anxiety at different stages of motherhood on a range of developmental functions from infancy through adolescence, the study said. The authors of the current study analyzed the association of perinatal depression and anxiety with social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor and adaptive behavior development in their offspring from infancy up to age 18. They also examined whether the timing of depression and anxiety, type of mental illness and offspring age affected the findings. Mental health before and after birthParticipants included 195,751 otherwise healthy mother-child pairs from 191 studies based in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Norway. These women had either reported their symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or had diagnoses, while later information about their children's development was also self-reported. Depression and anxiety in the perinatal period had small-to-moderate associations with deficits in social-emotional behavior development through adolescence, such as peer problems, a lack of prosocial behaviors and attachment and emotional dysregulation. How maternal mental health might influence a child's growth How a mother's mental health might influence her offspring's development could hinge on what happens to the baby while in the womb and interactions after birth. Anxiety and depression during pregnancy could expose the fetus to increased concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, leading to changes in brain function and reducing the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients, the study said. The neurocognitive changes that prepare mothers to be able to sensitively respond to their infants could also be hampered by experiencing depression and anxiety during pregnancy, the study said. A mentally taxed mother may be less able to quickly, carefully and thoughtfully respond to her baby's cues — potentially reducing the chances of attachment between a mother and her baby.""During the first year of life, infants are unable to sooth themselves when they become upset — they rely on sensitive caregivers to respond when they are distressed,"" said Dr. Alison Stuebe, a professor of maternal and child health at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, who wasn't involved in the study.""With support from these caregivers, infants gradually learn how to cope with fear and frustration,"" Stuebe, also a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the UNC School of Medicine, added.The authors lacked details about individual, family and social factors that could have affected the mothers' mental health and their children's development, said the study's senior author Delyse Hutchinson, an associate professor in the school of psychology at the Centre for Early Social and Emotional Development at Deakin University in Australia. Additional studies are necessary, Jamieson said, but ""the large numbers of studies in this systematic review begin to paint a fairly consistent pattern."" 'When parents struggle, kids struggle'For mothers to recover from birth and transition to their role as parents, and for growing families to thrive, they need support, Stuebe said. ""But in the United States, 23% of mothers are back at work within 10 days postpartum,"" Stuebe added. ""We are (the) only industrialized country without paid parental leave. Women lose pregnancy Medicaid coverage at 60 days after birth, losing access to psychotherapy and medical treatment for depression and anxiety."" If parents lack access to treatment because they're uninsured, can't take time off from work or face some other barrier, Stuebe continued, ""it's likely that their children will be exposed to food and housing insecurity, poorly funded schools, lack of safe spaces to play and other stressors.""When parents struggle, kids struggle."" Maintaining well-being through new chaptersSince families now ""have to balance the urgent need for hands-on help with deciding who can be part of their 'bubble' in the first weeks after birth,"" the pandemic has made building a village more challenging, Stuebe said. Some solutions can be found at New Mom Health, a resource for postpartum women. Expecting and new mothers concerned about their mood should seek help from their physician and/or psychologist early, Hutchinson said. ""Perinatal difficulties are often overlooked,"" Hutchinson said, ""and many women do not seek help because they think it is expected that mothers feel down, tired or worried or because they are concerned about the stigma related to mental health."" Staying connected with supportive family, friends and other mothers is also important, Hutchinson said — as is doing activities that bring you joy and regularly practicing self-care, ""whether it involves going for a walk or other exercise, reading a book, speaking to a friend, relaxation or simply catching up on some sleep."" While these tools alone may not prevent depression and anxiety, they can help mothers navigate challenges. If mothers are concerned that their children have any of the developmental deficits the study highlighted, they should talk with their pediatrician, Hutchinson said. ""If difficulties are recognised and help is sought,"" Hutchinson said via email, ""this risk may be reduced, potentially leading to improved health and wellbeing outcomes for both mother and child.""

1843,"The Liverpool suicide attacker who officials suspect converted to Christianity to aid his asylum application was in a mosque 'all day, every day' at the time he began building his bomb to blow up a maternity hospital, it emerged today.
Emad Al Swealmeen, who was baptised and confirmed at the city's Anglican cathedral in 2017, was seen worshipping during Ramadan and praying with a Muslim friend in the week before Sunday's attack, it is alleged. 
The revelation will further fuel suspicion that his conversion to Christianity four years ago was just an act to persuade the Home Office to grant him British citizenship and prevent them deporting him because he had found Jesus. 
Immigration sources said today that Al Swealmeen used a false identity and multiple appeals to 'frustrate' attempts to remove him from the UK before he tried to kill women and babies on Remembrance Sunday. 
Police believe Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months and began buying components online for his suicide vest after he began renting a flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, in April, which he then turned into a bomb factory.
Investigators are said to have admitted that the device would have caused 'damage, death and destruction' on a massive scale, but they were 'lucky' when the unstable device's detonator went off and killed him as he was 'jostled' when the taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.   
Police are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown.
But a security source told the Telegraph: 'Methodology wise this attack is entirely jihadist, but we have an open mind as to what precisely was motivating him. If he built a much more destructive device then the detonation looks accidental. It looks lucky'.
The Church of England was today accused of aiding asylum seekers to 'game' the immigration system by helping hundreds to convert from Islam and 'pray to stay' in the UK as it emerged people smugglers are using Instagram to urge migrants to follow Jesus to help them gain British citizenship. 
Emad Al Swealmeen lost his first bid to stay in Britain in 2014 but appealed again in 2017 after he worshipped at Liverpool Cathedral and his case was still outstanding when he blew himself up in a taxi on Sunday.
He was baptised and confirmed having apparently spoken 'endlessly and passionately about Jesus', but members of the city's largest Anglican church admitted they 'lost contact' with him within months of the ceremony. He was one of around 200 asylum seekers to adopt the faith there over a four-year period.
A clergyman at Liverpool Cathedral previously raised concerns about asylum seekers cynically posing as Christians to boost their chances of being awarded refugee status. Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian admitted in 2016 that 'plenty of people' were lying about their intentions after it emerged that the Church of England had christened hundreds of asylum seekers under a scheme dubbed 'pray to stay'. 
He said: 'There are many people abusing the system... I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault? And who are they deceiving? The Home Office, me as a pastor, or God?'  
MPs are to demand a ­formal Parliamentary probe into whether fake Christian converts are duping the Church of England to avoid being deported back to strict Muslim countries they came from. 
It came as new statistics revealed that between January 2020 and June this year, 29% of all migrants arriving by boat say they are from Iran and 20% say they are from Iraq. 91% of all migrants came from just 10 countries - including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and Yemen. These are also nations named in the top 20 countries where Christians are the most persecuted for following Jesus. 
Priti Patel said last night that Al Swealmeen, who changed his name to Enzo Almeni shortly after finding Jesus, exploited the UK's asylum 'merry-go-round' while a Home Office source said changing from Islam to Christianity is now 'standard practice' among asylum seekers 'to game the asylum system'. 
Pledging to overhaul the asylum system, Home Secretary Miss Patel declared: 'The case in Liverpool was a complete reflection of how dysfunctional, how broken, the system has been in the past, and why I want to bring changes forward. It's a complete merry-go-round and it's been exploited by a whole professional legal services industry which has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day in day out on legal aid at the expense of the taxpayers.'
The newspaper quoted the insider as claiming that the failed asylum seeker, who somehow remained in the UK for seven years, attended the mosque 'all day every day' during Ramadan - and was seen worshipping the week before the suicide attack. 
It also emerged that Al Swealmeen adopted a fake identity, Enzo Almeni, and made repeated asylum appeals and applications, including one in January.
The terrorist has been accused of trying to 'game' Britain's creaking immigration by finding Jesus after his first asylum application failed in November 2014 when the Home Office rejected his claims that he was from Syria saying they believed he was from Jordan. 
Adding to the picture that he was lying to the authorities, following his death his family abroad said that he was actually from Iraq. 
Al Swealmeen launched an appeal within the First Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber which was dismissed on April 16, 2015.
Later that year appeals to both that court and to the Upper Tier Tribunal were also refused.
It is understood that Al Swealmeen made a fresh asylum application to the Home Office in 2017 under his new name, but this was rejected two years later.
The 32-year-old then made a new application to the First Tier Tribunal on January 19 this year which was under review at the time he blew himself.  
Yesterday police found several 'suspicious packages' after raiding a pub and asylum hostel linked to the Poppy Day suicide bomber.
Officers said Emad Al Swealmeen, 32, had planned an attack for seven months but have not found any evidence that he conspired with or was inspired by a terror group.  
A Royal Logistics Corp bomb disposal vehicle was seen arriving in Sutcliffe Street, Liverpool along with a fire engine, and the cordon was slightly extended to Boaler Street before ending this evening. 
Residents who had been told to leave their homes have now been warned that they may see explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) officers on Thursday in case further 'suspicious' items are found.
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said several suspicious packages were found, and were examined by EOD officers before being recovered by forensic teams. 
Searches have also been carried out at a property in Rutland Avenue that had been rented by Al Swealmeen since April, and that is the main focus of the police investigation. 
Police earlier said Iraq-born Al Swealmeen had rented a property in Liverpool seven months ago and had started making 'relevant purchases' for his homemade bomb 'at least' since that time. 
Officers are yet to find any evidence that Al Swealmeen conspired with or was inspired by a terror group, suggesting he was a 'lone wolf' who became radicalised online during lockdown. 
One theory is that the bomber was suffering a mental health crisis having been devastated at his continued failure to gain asylum here because the Home Office refused to believe he was Syrian.  
In an update on the investigation ACC Jackson said that the pizza chef who converted from Islam to Christianity began renting his flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool at around Easter. 
ACC Jackson said: 'A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time'.
He added: 'At this time we are not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others'.  
Confirming the terrorist's cause of death he said: 'The post mortem on the deceased has taken place and the cause of death has been described as injuries sustained from the fire and explosion.' 
He also said that the 32-year-old asylum seeker had suffered from periods of mental illness that will 'form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand'.
Mr Jackson added: 'There is much comment in the media about Al Swealmeen and it is clear that he was known to many people. We continue to appeal for people who knew him, especially those who associated with him this year as we try and piece together the events leading up to this incident and the reasons for it'. 
The number of failed asylum seekers being deported from the UK fell to a record low of under 8,000 last year - down almost 40,000-a-year in eight years, MailOnline can reveal today.
Official Home Office figures show that tens of thousands of failed asylum seekers are still waiting to be sent back to the country of their birth - and cases are taking longer to complete because of the number of appeals.
In 2013 around 47,000 failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals were deported. This dropped to a low of 8,000 last year, with covid, in part, being blamed for the record low last year. 
UK Border figures from June show that there are currently 125,000 asylum cases outstanding in Britain. 
Of these 5,900 people, including Almeni until his death, were awaiting the outcome of an appeal. Some have been waiting for years.
Approximately 39,500 people are still waiting to be deported. 
There have between 19,000 and 35,000 new asylum applications a year for the past 17 years. In that period the number of applications rejected has dropped from 74% in 2004 to 46% in 2019. But this jumped back to 70% in 2020.
Around three-quarters of applicants refused asylum at initial decision lodged an appeal and almost one third of those appeals were allowed. 
There are calls for the Home Office to review their policies and practices in the wake of the attack after it emerged suicide bomber Enzo Almeni, 32, had been in the UK for seven years without gaining permanent residency.   

His 1lb bomb went off as his taxi pulled up at the Liverpool Women's Hospital just before the 11am national silence on Remembrance Sunday. 
There have been conflicting reports about what the device was made of. 
Some insiders claimed it was packed with ball bearings and made using homemade TATP explosives. TATP is unstable and known as a 'Mother of Satan' because it is liable to blow up accidentally. It was used by Islamist terrorist in the Paris suicide attacks of 2015, the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017 and the failed Parsons Green Underground station. 
But other experts believe he may have bought his explosives online or on the high street and may have even constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
Detectives are now trying to trace Al Swealmeen's movements to discover whether he bought his explosives online or on the high street. Experts now fear the bomber constructed his home-made improvised explosive device (IED) using seasonal fireworks.
A former counter-terror official told The Telegraph: 'The white smoke that can be seen billowing out of the cab could indicate the use of gunpowder and there is also a flash within the cab itself which could be powder burning.
'It is possible to construct homemade devices using fireworks, but it still requires a degree of expertise and planning.'
There are suspicions that he might have followed a recipe for the material used by the 7/7 bombers who targeted London in 2005. 
Worryingly, no one who knew him raised the alarm about his behaviour. His local mental health trust said he had previously been receiving help, but was no longer a patient. 
A Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We can confirm Emad Al Swealmeen had previously accessed our services but was not a service user at the time of the incident.'
Friends said Al Swealmeen had wrestled with depression and was sectioned in 2014 after he was rejected for asylum for the first time. 
They recalled how the bomber was so 'car mad' that he nicknamed himself 'GT' and had the initials tattooed on his arm along with a chequered flag. 
He changed his name to Enzo Almeni – after the Ferrari boss – and loved go-karting so much that that he bought his own helmet and got friends to sign it.
He was a regular at the TeamSport Go-karting track, on Liverpool's Brunswick docks, often going with his housemates or on his own to race laps.
Friends said they were astounded that the 'quiet and bashful' young man, who was also a big fan of country singer Johnny Cash, was behind the Poppy Day bomb.
One, who knew Al Swealmeen through his job at a pizza takeaway, said: 'He called himself GT because he loved cars, it was a little nickname he gave himself, he even had it tattooed on his arm.
'He was quiet, but not in a weird way, he was just really shy. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw his picture. Of all the people that worked in the takeaway he would have been bottom of my list to do something so sick.
'He was reserved, but not like he was hiding something, more like he was lacking in confidence. He did speak to me about feeling depressed one time, but didn't really go into it. At the time he lived in a shared house with a few others and all he cared about was go-karting.
'He showed me his helmet that he had bought, he was really excited about it. He went go-karting a few times on his own, he was so into it, and I remember him getting a tattoo and showing it off.
'He also loved Johnny Cash and he told me he wanted to get a Johnny Cash tattoo too.'
Malcolm Hitchcott, 77, a lay pastor and retired Army officer who gave Al Swealmeen a room in his home for eight months in 2017, remembered accompanying him on a trip to the track.
Pictures on social media show him in racing overalls at the karting venue, where he took part in 'Top Gun' marathon karting races and '50-lap' events. 'He got me to sign his helmet, rather like Lewis Hamilton signs helmets [for fans],' 
Mr Hitchcott added: 'He never spoke about a particular driver but he loved Ferrari, he was a Ferrari man. His email address was Ferrari-related too. He was very interested in motor racing.'
The indoor facility boasts 40mph karts and several of Liverpool's sporting greats such as Jamie Carragher, Sam Quek and Tony Bellew on its celebrity leaderboard.
But a source said Al Swealmeen had not been to the track for over a year. Last night the businessman who employed Al Swealmeen at his pizza takeaway for several months in around 2016 said he was a 'nice, polite guy'.
'I was shocked when I saw who it was,' the man, who did not want to be named, said.
'I still can't believe it. He was a nice, polite guy. He wasn't a practising Muslim, he told me he lived with a Christian family, and he definitely wasn't a fanatic.
'I've employed Muslims before, some of them don't like touching ham if it isn't Halal, but he didn't seem worried about that.
'He worked part-time for me, he had a visa and was legit. I paid him about £50 a day.
'Never in a million years would I think him capable of something like that.'
The friend agreed Al Swealmeen was not religious.
'He never really talked about religion,' he added. 
'I didn't think he practised any faith, although I do remember him telling me one time he had been to church and was trying to get to know people there.
'I would love to know what happened to him over the past few years. He must have been manipulated or corrupted. The man I knew and what he did on Sunday – they are like night and day.'",-2
1844,"FEW IN PAKISTAN would deny that something needs to be done to improve its education system. The country is well behind Bangladesh, India and Iran, and just barely above Afghanistan, in UN education rankings. Less than 60% of people over 15 can read and write, having attended school on average for 5.2 years. In Bangladesh, by contrast, the literacy rate is 74%, with 6.2 years of education.
The headline figures hide as much as they reveal. In the country’s elite schools, the children of the wealthy study in English for international exams and set their sights on the world’s best universities. At the other end of the spectrum, 23m children are not in school at all, with girls much less likely than boys to be enrolled. Government schools, where available, have a reputation for rote learning. Private schools of varying quality fill the gap. Many poor families send their children to madrasas, which tend to skip subjects like science and maths. Some are vehicles for extremist ideologies. Imran Khan, the prime minister, calls this divide “educational apartheid” and has vowed to get rid of it.

Such an aim is admirable, but the tool of choice has come in for criticism from academics, educators and parents. Earlier this year the government began rolling out a single national curriculum (SNC) for all schools, including madrasas. This set of minimum standards is meant to improve the quality of teaching and boost the prospects of pupils. But its ambitions are wider still. Among the objectives listed by the education ministry is to increase “social cohesion and national integration”.
The new curriculum has so far been rolled out only in primary schools, but already some of its dictates are causing a backlash. The SNC has increased the number of subjects, such as general knowledge, which must use textbooks in Urdu or other local languages rather than English. Mr Khan, himself an old boy of Aitchison College, the country’s most prestigious school, makes his case in punchy post-colonial terms. “When you acquire English-medium education, you adopt the entire culture,” he argues, adding that “you become [a] slave to that particular culture.”
Yet the resistance to the SNC’s imposition of local-language learning is not just an elite phenomenon. There have been reports of schools unwilling to implement it. And there is huge demand for English from parents who see it as a way for their children to stand out in the job market, according to teachers. Mariam Chughtai, the director of the national council drawing up the curriculum, says the aim is not to drop English but to elevate local languages. “When we think ‘multilingual’, we think French, German and English. But when you say bilingual in Urdu and English, the elites look down upon it,” she says. Still, “no one is denying the importance of English. It’s here to stay.”
A bigger complaint is that conservatives are using the curriculum to increase religious teaching in schools. Rather than turning madrasas into schools, it will turn schools into madrasas, charge critics. Indeed, the education ministry’s list of “key considerations” in drawing up the curriculum puts the teachings of the Koran at the very top. Non-Muslims need not take classes on Islam, but religious content is seeping into other subjects, such as Urdu-language lessons that include passages on Muslim caliphs. The government argues that there is nothing wrong with teaching religion in a religious country.
The third criticism may be the most pertinent. Pakistan’s abysmal learning outcomes are not so much the result of content as of access, says Jasir Shahbaz, an educationalist in Lahore. A new curriculum will do little to fix that. “The issue is not so much what the kids are studying, so much as how many kids are actually studying, or are actually understanding what they are studying,” he says.
The battles are likely to intensify as older pupils start the new curriculum next year. Ms Chughtai says it will take time for results to show. But the furore, she says, is because the changes affect even the elite: “Any time you try to bring a major policy change, for the small minority of people for whom even the broken system was working, they are going to get scared.”■",2
1845,"THE SCEPTICS have plenty of fodder. The earliest adopters of bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, used it to buy drugs, while cyber-hackers now demand their ransom in it. Hundreds of millions of dollars of ether, another digital money, were stolen this year after hackers found a bug in some code. Many “believers” are in reality trying to get rich quick from the global mania that has seen the value of cryptoassets reach $2.2trn. Others are freakishly devoted. The entrepreneur who announced in June that El Salvador was adopting bitcoin as an official currency sobbed on stage, claiming it would save the nation.
The crooks, fools and proselytisers are off-putting. Nevertheless, the rise of an ecosystem of financial services, known as decentralised finance, or “DeFi”, deserves sober consideration. It has the potential to rewire how the financial system works, with all the promise and perils that entails. The proliferation of innovation in DeFi is akin to the frenzy of invention in the early phase of the web. At a time when people live ever more of their lives online, the crypto-revolution could even remake the architecture of the digital economy.

DeFi is one of three tech trends disrupting finance. Tech “platform” firms are muscling in on payments and banks. Governments are launching digital currencies, or govcoins. DeFi offers an alternative path which aims to spread power, not concentrate it. To understand how, start with blockchains, vast networks of computers that keep an open, incorruptible common record and update it without the need for a central authority.
Bitcoin, the first big blockchain, created in 2009, is now a distraction. Instead, Ethereum, a blockchain network created in 2015, upon which most DeFi applications are built, is reaching critical mass. Its developers view finance as a juicy target. Conventional banking requires a huge infrastructure to maintain trust between strangers, from clearing houses and compliance to capital rules and courts. It is expensive and often captured by insiders: think of credit-card fees and bankers’ yachts. By contrast, transactions on a blockchain are trustworthy, cheap, transparent and quick—at least in theory.

Although the terminology is intimidating (fees are “gas”; the main currency is ether, and title deeds over digital assets are known as NFTs), the basic activities taking place on DeFi are familiar. These include trading on exchanges and issuing loans and taking deposits through self-executing agreements called smart contracts. One yardstick of activity is the value of digital instruments being used as collateral: from almost nothing in early 2018 it has reached $90bn. Another is the value of transactions that Ethereum is verifying. In the second quarter this reached $2.5trn, around the same sum as Visa processes and equivalent to a sixth of the activity on Nasdaq, a stock exchange.
The dream of a low-friction financial system is just the beginning. DeFi is spreading to more ambitious terrain. MetaMask, a DeFi wallet with more than 10m users, acts as a digital identity. To enter a decentralised “metaverse”, a looking-glass world with shops run by its users, you link your wallet to a cartoonish avatar who roams around. These digital worlds will become the subject of intensifying competition as more spending shifts online. Big tech firms could impose huge taxes on these mini-economies: imagine Apple’s App Store charging fees, or Facebook selling your avatar’s intimate secrets. A better alternative might be decentralised networks that host applications and are run mutually by users. DeFi could provide payments and property rights.
Crypto-enthusiasts see a Utopia. But there is a long way to go before DeFi is as reliable as, say, JPMorgan Chase or PayPal. Some problems are prosaic. A common criticism is that blockchain platforms do not scale easily and that the computers they harness consume wasteful amounts of electricity. But Ethereum is a self-improvement machine. When it is in high demand the fees it charges for verification can climb, encouraging developers to work on minimising the intensity with which they use it. There will be new versions of Ethereum; other, better blockchains could one day replace it.
Yet DeFi also raises questions about how a virtual economy with its own norms interacts with the real world. One worry is the lack of an external anchor of value. Cryptocurrencies are no different from the dollar, in that they rely on people having a shared expectation of their utility. However, conventional money is also backed by states with a monopoly on force and central banks that are lenders of last resort. Without these, DeFi will be vulnerable to panics. Contract enforcement outside the virtual world is also a concern. A blockchain contract may say you own a house but only the police can enforce an eviction.
Governance and accountability in DeFi-land are rudimentary. A sequence of large irrevocable transactions that humans cannot override could be dangerous, especially as coding errors are inevitable. Money-laundering has thrived in the ungoverned grey zone of services lying between Ethereum and the banking system. Despite the claims of decentralisation, some programmers and app owners hold disproportionate sway over the DeFi system. And a malign actor could even gain control over a majority of the computers that run a blockchain.
Alice’s adventures in DeFi-land
Digital libertarians would prefer that DeFi remain autonomous—imperfect but pure. Yet to succeed it must integrate with the conventional financial and legal systems, as Gary Gensler, a crypto-expert who is America’s financial watchdog, has outlined. Many DeFi applications are run by decentralised organisations which vote on some issues; these bodies should become subject to laws and regulations. The Bank for International Settlements, a club for central banks, has suggested that govcoins might be used in DeFi apps, providing stability.
Finance is entering a new era in which the three novel but flawed visions of tech platforms, big government and DeFi will compete and intermingle. Each embodies a technical architecture and an ideology about how the economy should be run. As with the internet in the 1990s, no one knows where the revolution will end. But it stands to transform how money works and, as it does so, the entire digital world. ■

1846,"CAPE TOWN, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Efforts to develop an African base for COVID-19 vaccine production will focus on trying to replicate Moderna's (MRNA.O) shot, but a lack of progress in talks with the U.S. company mean the project will take time, a senior WHO official told Reuters.
The drive to produce vaccines in Africa is designed to help more developing countries access COVID-19 shots after rich nations bought up most of this year's supply.
Moderna said last October it would not enforce patents related to its shot during the pandemic, raising hopes that other companies might be able to copy it and help boost COVID-19 vaccine production.
In practice, though, it is hard to replicate a vaccine without the information on how it is made, and the World Health Organization-backed tech transfer hub in South Africa - set up in June to give poorer nations the know-how to produce COVID-19 vaccines - has so far not reached a deal with the company.
""The talks have not yielded any results,"" Martin Friede, WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research coodinator, told Reuters.
Moderna did not respond to a request for comment.
The case highlights the challenges faced by the WHO as it battles to expand vaccine production to help address the glaring inequalities between rich and poor nations in the pandemic.
More than three quarters of the 5.5 billion COVID-19 shots administered worldwide have gone to high and upper-middle income countries, which make up just over a third of the world's population.  read more 
Currently only 3% of Africa is vaccinated, the African Union's top health official said last week, compared with more than half of the United States and three quarters of Spain.
Friede said Moderna's vaccine had been chosen as an abundance of public information and its pledge not to enforce patents made the shot slightly easier to copy than some rivals.
""We have to make a choice now. The deadline is upon us; time to start ordering chemicals. We've chosen Moderna,"" he said.
But even if the hub manages without Moderna's help, it could take more than a year to get a distributable vaccine as clinical trials would only begin in the latter half of 2022, he added.
TUSSLE OVER WAIVERS
In May, the United States said it would support waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines in order to help speed an end to the pandemic.
But the idea has faced opposition from pharmaceutical firms,  which argue they need to oversee any technology transfer due to the complexity of the manufacturing process.
Pfizer (PFE.N) and its partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE) separately struck a deal in July for South Africa's Biovac to help make around 100 million doses a year of their COVID-19 vaccine for Africa. Their shot, like Moderna's, uses so-called mRNA technology.
However, the deal is to ""fill and finish"" the vaccine, the final stages of production where the product is put into vials, sealed and packaged for shipping. It does not cover the complicated process of mRNA production, which Pfizer and BioNTech will do at their European plants.  read more 
Neither responded to requests for comment.
The WHO has been trying to persuade Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech to join forces with its African tech transfer hub.
But COVID-19 vaccine makers have warned that non-authorised producers would compete for vital raw materials and production gear that the established players - most of which have earned huge profits from vaccination - rely on.  read more 
Hub consortium partner Afrigen Biologics will produce the initial batch of doses, before transferring the skills and technology to local manufacturing partner, Biovac Institute - both are Cape Town-based - which will mass produce the vaccines.

1847,"JOHN STEENHUISEN’S office in South Africa’s parliament is the lair of a political animal. The leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA), the country’s main opposition party, has election memorabilia from around the world and two large photographs of John F. Kennedy. Smaller snaps show the 45-year-old alongside British politicians, including David Cameron. A book by the former prime minister is on Mr Steenhuisen’s desk.
In Britain works by Mr Cameron are perhaps more common in charity shops than in politicians’ offices. But Mr Steenhuisen is looking ahead to when the African National Congress (ANC) falls below 50% in a general election. Though the next one is not until 2024, local elections on November 1st may serve as a bellwether. Polls suggest the ANC will win less than half of the vote in a nationwide election for the first time. That would suggest it may soon need others in order to govern nationally under South Africa’s system of proportional representation. Hence the collected wisdom, such as it is, of the man who led a coalition government in Britain.

Mr Steenhuisen (pictured) wants to work with pragmatic ANC politicians. “South Africa is in such a deep crisis that it’s going to need the rational centre,” he says. The former chief whip says there have been “feelers from the ANC side”. But many in the ruling party would rather join with the second-largest opposition party, the hard-left and thuggish Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). If that were to happen, says Mr Steenhuisen, “that’s going to put South Africa on the fast burn towards Venezuela or Zimbabwe.”
Talk of coalition shows how far the DA has come. From 1961 to 1974 Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, one of the DA’s forerunners, was the lone anti-apartheid voice in the all-white parliament. In the first post-apartheid elections in 1994, the Democratic Party, as it was then, won 2%. Two decades later the DA won 22%. Its growth came mostly from winning over majorities of minorities: whites, “coloured” (ie, mixed-race) South Africans and those of Indian descent, who together are about a fifth of the population.
The DA does less well among the majority, though. It had a black leader, Mmusi Maimane, but he was unceremoniously ejected in 2019 after disappointing election results. It has also vacillated over whether to support race-based policies.

Newer recruits are generally more sympathetic to ANC laws on, say, affirmative action than classical liberals, who dislike policies that treat people primarily as members of a group rather than as individuals. “The DA says it wants to be colour-blind, but that means wanting to retain the status quo,” argues Mr Maimane, who has now left the party. Another former black politician in the DA says: “I reject this notion that liberalism is about the fetishisation of the individual. That’s very convenient for white people and for men.”
This muddle has hurt the party’s brand. It lost hundreds of thousands of Afrikaner voters in 2019 without adding many black ones. “The DA has a major trust issue,” says Dawie Scholtz, a psephologist. He notes that, in focus groups, voters often say they like certain policies but change their minds when they learn the proposals are from the DA. “The distrust is racial: it is based on distrust about whether the party actually wants to deliver for black people.”
Many in the DA feel that the party is treated unfairly. Tony Leon, a former leader, points out that it has the country’s most racially diverse parliamentary caucus. In South Africa, he adds, voters make choices based on identity, which makes it hard for the DA, a party that he says tries to appeal to the nation as a whole, rather than to any particular racial or ethnic group.
Others in the party point out that its divisions are minor compared with those of the ANC, whose factional battles sparked mass civil unrest in July. They feel that their position on inequality is simple. Rather than race-based policies that have enriched a black elite, better to target help on the basis of need. “You don’t need a proxy for poverty,” argues Mr Steenhuisen.
Moreover, given the ANC’s decline, the DA has only to hang on to its support to become more relevant. But would its voters stomach a coalition with the ANC? Mr Steenhuisen says he would avoid the error of the Liberal Democrats in the British coalition of 2010-15, when that party lost votes by reneging on its key pledge to scrap university tuition fees. The DA would stick to its “core principles”, such as a market economy, respect for the rule of law and policies that do not target a particular race. But Mr Steenhuisen adds that the state of the country demands hard-headedness: “If the house is burning then it doesn’t matter if you’re a Marxist or a classical liberal. Your life is going to get worse.” ■",2
1848,"ON JULY 16TH Royal Dutch Shell, an oil and gas company, and Scottish Power, a subsidiary of Iberdrola, a Spanish electricity utility, made an announcement. They were, they said, jointly submitting proposals to the British authorities to build, off the coast of Scotland, the first large-scale set of floating wind farms in the world. At the moment, the largest floating farm is a six-turbine, 50MW array which is due for completion next month in the North Sea, 15km from Aberdeen. The consortium, by contrast, has said it is thinking in gigawatts (GW).
Offshore wind farms with foundations in the seabed are now part of the energy mix in several places. In the past four years their capacity has nearly doubled, from 19GW to 35GW, and amortised costs have dropped by a third, from $120 per MW-hour to $80. They are, however, of limited deployability, being restricted to waters shallower than about 60 metres.

Unfortunately, 80% of the world’s offshore wind blows over places deeper than that. Making these accessible, says the International Energy Agency, an offshoot of the OECD, would unlock enough power to meet the world’s probable electrical needs in 2040 11 times over. The trick is to build turbines which, though moored to the seabed, will float. If Shell and Scottish Power can pull this trick off, it will be a big step towards tapping that potential.
Blowing in the wind
A decade ago, floating-turbine technology was a fringe affair. The difficulty was not the turbines themselves, but making them float. The oil and gas industry had, since the 1960s, developed a range of floating foundations that could keep titanic objects like drilling rigs stable at sea. But transferring that know-how to wind power was hardly straightforward. First, unlike an oil rig, a wind turbine is lanky and top-heavy, making it prone to tip over. Second, turbines generate powerful gyroscopic forces that would further destabilise a floating machine. It was hard, in those days, to see how these problems could be solved cheaply enough to compete with turbines bolted to the ocean floor—much less with conventional power sources.
No longer. A decade of development has yielded two things: proof that turbines can float and clarity as to how these floating units might look. Engineers achieved this through patient prototyping. They took designs previously tested in university wave pools and scaled them up into small demonstration units off the coasts of Norway, Portugal and Japan.
Each unit, bedecked with sensors, gathered data on variables such as pitch, wind speed and wave height. These data were then folded into designs, for bigger, more stable units. The results, visible today in newer models off the Norwegian and Portuguese coasts, can safely float turbines four times as powerful as their predecessors. Engineers therefore consider the flotation problem solved. “The turbines function nicely. They don’t flip. It can be done,” said Alla Weinstein, a pioneer of the field who is now pursuing permits for a floating wind farm off the coast of California.
Four approaches to flotation have emerged (see diagram). The commonest is a semisubmersible. Principle Power, an American company, is one firm pursuing this. Semisubmersibles come in various designs. Principle’s uses a buoyant steel triangle that has water-filled cans at two of the vertices. These ballast tanks balance the weight of a turbine at the third vertex, with water pumped around inside the triangle to trim its stability.

A second tack, pursued by, among others, Equinor, a Norwegian firm, is to stick a turbine on a bottle called a spar that is filled with heavy ballast, to make it float upright. Equinor does this by placing the turbine on top of an 80-metre-high concrete tube containing water, rocks or some other cheap and heavy material.
Two other approaches are less developed, but may prove useful. Glosten, an American engineering firm that has formed a partnership with General Electric, uses a tension-leg platform. This is a starfish-shaped steel structure with a turbine at its hub. The starfish is submerged and yoked to the ocean floor with cables. This arrangement, similar to that for the ultra-deep-water Magnolia rig, drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, holds the turbine upright. And BW Ideol, a Norwegian firm, erects the turbine on a flat concrete or steel barge that resembles an empty picture frame. When the turbine sways, water sloshes within the frame, dampening its movement. The company claims its prototype, off the coast of Japan, has already survived three typhoons.
Just do it
Project developers have seen enough to convince them. Though the Shell-Scottish Power consortium’s proposals (which make no mention of a preferred technological approach) are the most ambitious so far, they are not the first. Besides the 50MW array off Aberdeen, which is owned by Grupo Cobra, a Spanish construction company that uses Principle’s design, Equinor has begun construction on an 11-unit, 88MW project which will power a group of North Sea drilling platforms. Total, a French oil and gas company, and Green Investment Group, a project-development arm of Macquarie, a bank, intend to start work on a 500MW floating wind project off the coast of South Korea by 2023—though they, too, have not yet specified which technology they plan to use.
Bigger farms obviously require more turbines. But they also, ideally, require bigger turbines. And the bigger a turbine is, the harder it is to maintain. Wind turbines occasionally need big parts, like blades or generators, replaced. That is challenging on terra firma. But on land, a crane can brace itself against the earth. At sea, “jackup” vessels achieve similar stability by dropping steel legs to the seabed. Floating turbines will, however, operate in waters too deep for jackup vessels to work, so any vessel servicing one will have, itself, to remain floating. “You have two structures that are moving, and you’re going to shift the load from one of these moving structures to another one,” said Olav-Bernt Haga, a project director at Equinor. This will be technically demanding and thus hard to do cheaply.
A group called the Floating Wind Joint Industry Project (FWJIP), the job of which is to flag up matters of collective interest, deems this an urgent problem. This group is made up of 17 project developers and the Carbon Trust, a not-for-profit consultancy based in Britain. In an analysis published last year the FWJIP said that wind turbines are nearing the physical limits of what can be handled at sea. The oil industry has a number of heavy-lift ships that work in deep water. But these are optimised for weight, not height, and are expensive to hire. The floating-wind industry needs new answers, or it could find itself stunted, both literally and metaphorically.
Fortunately, prospects are in development. They take two broad approaches to the problem: lifting and climbing. An example of the former is OWL Heavy Lift, a Dutch company, which has started work on the OWL-010, a vessel dedicated to offshore-wind maintenance. Anyone working on floating wind turbines must contend with waves. A gentle swell at the surface can cause a treacherous sweep up high. The OWL-010 will iron out the effect of this swaying by using motion-compensation software that steadies the position of the crane’s hook to within 5cm. This works even when that hook is 150 metres above sea level.
The price tags for such vessels, though, start at around $250m. The cost alone implies that the industry would have to share a small number of ships, presenting a bottleneck to growth. That is why some propose to stop reaching up to turbines, and to start climbing them, instead.
Reach for the sky
Climbing cranes, which scurry up the very object they are building, are often used to raise skyscrapers on land. They are unproven at sea, but several groups are developing versions that might suit floating wind power. SENSEWind, a firm in Cambridge, England, for example, suggests putting tracks on the sides of turbine towers. This would let a ship pull up alongside, place a maintenance car on the tracks, and thus move large parts up and down the tower.
Others propose to lift from the turbine itself. Most turbines have a small crane for light items. Liftra, a Danish company, uses this to raise progressively larger cranes. The biggest fits in a standard 40-foot (12.2 metre) shipping container. Once bolted on, the company claims, the arrangement is as powerful as a conventional external crane. Alternatively, as Conbit, a Dutch contractor, proposes, pulling a few metal parts and cables to the top of the tower would allow a heavy-duty crane to be fashioned temporarily on the turbine’s crown.
None of these technologies is beyond the prototype stage. But they may prove valuable for the mega-turbines of tomorrow, be they fixed or floating. For floating turbines, however, an alternative may exist. Unlike fixed turbines, they can be unplugged and dragged to shore. Recent analysis sponsored by the FWJIP suggests that what is best in individual circumstances may depend on location. If a floating turbine is near the shore, it may be easiest to tow it back to port for repair. If far away, exotic gadgets like the OWL-010 or climbing cranes may work better.
The upshot of all this is that it may soon be possible to extract a lot more electrical power from the wind, to do so without covering hillsides with turbines, and to make a profit while doing it. And that is enough to put wind in anyone’s sails. ■",2
1849,"LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates will require all gold refineries to undergo annual audits to ensure their suppliers are responsible, it told Reuters, in an effort to combat illicit trading.
Industry figures said this should raise standards in the UAE, one of the world's biggest bullion trade hubs, but may also shift flows of gold linked to crime or human rights abuses to other countries, for example in Africa, where the number of gold refineries is growing rapidly.
A Reuters investigation in 2019 found that UAE took in gold worth billions of dollars smuggled from Africa, some of it mined in grim and polluting conditions and countries in conflict.
Organisations including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental anti-money laundering monitor, are pressing the country to tighten rules and enforcement. UAE has said doing so is a national priority.
UAE's Economy Ministry told Reuters a UAE Good Delivery Standard would require refiners to properly scrutinize suppliers and prove to outside auditors they have done so.
""All gold refiners will be required to adhere to the responsible sourcing obligations,"" it said. ""The UAE Good Delivery Standard will also require annual compliance audits.""
The ministry said its goal was to bring the whole industry in line with responsible sourcing standards. It declined to comment further before an announcement at a precious metals industry conference in Dubai later this month.
CORE TO ECONOMY
Millions of people work in small scale gold mines that can be brutal on workers and leak toxic chemicals. The metal is often used to finance crime, conflict and terrorism.
The FATF last month placed Turkey on its ""grey list"" -- potentially eroding foreign investment -- due in part to ""serious issues of supervision"" in its gold trade.
Last year, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which runs the biggest responsible sourcing accreditation scheme for refineries, said it could stop refiners it certifies from taking gold from countries with inadequate controls.
UAE said it had taken numerous measures to combat illicit trading, including requirements for firms to register with anti-money laundering authorities and declare large cash transactions.
""The gold and precious metals industry is core to our economy,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi, who chairs a committee overseeing the gold trade, said in a statement to Reuters.
The good delivery standard ""will further strengthen the UAE's AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism) framework, which is a critical national priority and a central focus of the UAE leadership,"" Al Zeyoudi said.
SQUEEZING A BALLOON
UAE said its standard was an extension of the Dubai Good Delivery Standard, a voluntary accreditation scheme run by the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a UAE free trade zone.
DMCC accredits two of UAE's more than 10 refiners, requiring responsible sourcing policies and audits. Most UAE gold refiners and dealers lack accreditation or outside scrutiny of how and where they get their gold.
""This is the most significant thing the UAE government have done (to stop unethical trade),"" said Tyler Gillard, who advises governments and companies on responsible sourcing at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
But illicit trading will not disappear, he said. ""It's like squeezing a balloon ... there's still enough gaps and opportunities in other countries for gold to enter the market.""
Most countries do not require sourcing audits. Dozens of refineries are operating or under construction in sub-Saharan Africa, and India, a big importer of gold from small-scale mines, has many refiners not subject to scrutiny.",3
1850,"BARROW ISLAND, off the coast of Western Australia, is an unlikely place to find what will with luck become the high-water mark of the hubris of the West’s international oil companies (IOCs). It is a nature reserve dotted with termite mounds. Since it was severed from the mainland about 8,000 years ago, its local species, including golden bandicoots and spectacled hare-wallabies, have lived free from predators. Some call it Australia’s Galapagos. Yet a sliver of it is also home to one of the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments, mostly owned by Chevron (47%), ExxonMobil (25%) and Royal Dutch Shell (25%).
Gorgon, as it is called, has a pockmarked history. It cost $54bn to build, a whopping $20bn over budget. That was partly because the cost of manpower and material soared amid a $200bn Australian LNG investment binge during the past decade. To respect the sanctity of the island’s wildlife, Chevron enforced covid-like quarantining. On arrival, thousands of construction staff had to be inspected at the airport for stray seeds; bulldozers, diggers and trucks were fumigated and shrink-wrapped before shipment. Since production started in 2016, Gorgon has been dogged by unplanned outages. Tax filings suggest it has yet to make a profit. And its failure so far to sequester four-fifths of the carbon dioxide produced from its gas reservoirs has shredded the credibility of its environmental commitments. Carbon capture is considered crucial for the future of LNG on Barrow Island and elsewhere.

For all that, it is emblematic of the belief among IOCs that even if oil demand peaks as the world shifts to cleaner fuels, consumption of LNG will continue to grow for decades to come, especially in Asia. Gorgon alone hopes to produce and ship natural gas until the mid-2050s, one day for considerable profits. A sharp rise in LNG prices in recent months amid a surge in demand from China has fanned those hopes. Yet even as the majors double down on the fuel, they are running up against the reality that it is becoming harder to take controlling stakes in new megaprojects, and even those they can develop have rising risks. LNG is nothing like the relatively safe bet the oil industry portrays it as.
The immediate problem the majors face is a shift in the balance of power. The deep pockets and risk appetite of giants like ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies used to be essential for coping with the challenges of building frozen gas factories in inhospitable places. Now national champions in Qatar and Russia, home to the most promising resources, say they can largely make do without them. Qatar Energy, a gas giant, has taken the lead in developing the biggest LNG complex in history, a $30bn extension to its North Field site. The IOCs have been relegated to bidding for minority stakes in the project, mostly giving them the right to market a surge of Qatari gas that is expected to hit the market by mid-decade. Chinese oil companies may invest, too. The majors are squeezed, says Giles Farrer of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy.
Other opportunities have turned into nightmares. A jihadi conflict on the north-eastern coast of Mozambique has at least temporarily halted a $20bn offshore LNG project by Total, which declared force majeure in April. Neil Beveridge of Bernstein, an investment firm, quips that it is “the only LNG project to hit force majeure before it’s even started.” For the same reason, ExxonMobil’s $30bn LNG plan in Mozambique is in limbo. The firm has also been bogged down for years trying to strike a deal with the government of Papua New Guinea on a $13bn expansion. That leaves America’s Gulf Coast as the most likely domain outside Qatar and Russia’s Arctic to supply more LNG in the next five years. But operators there can secure gas to liquefy from producers across America, and engineering skills from domestic construction companies. That leaves the oil majors twiddling their thumbs.
They still have scope to build some projects. But for those a structural change in the LNG market poses a further challenge. As Alastair Syme of Citi, a bank, explains, for decades the majors reduced the risk of long-term investments by striking 20-year-plus contracts with big customers, such as Japanese utilities. However, a slide in the spot price of LNG in the second half of the 2010s caused a rethink. Buyers have shifted to shorter-term contracts (say ten years) or the spot market.
The recent spike in spot prices may change the mood once again. Nonetheless some buyers face such uncertainty about the future of natural gas because of the growth of renewables that they will remain loth to sign long-term contracts. For IOCs, the corollary is that shorter contracts increase the risk of LNG investments with long paybacks. This adds to the arguments for them to focus on short-cycle projects to reduce the danger that, as the world economy decarbonises, they will be left with stranded assets.
Trading places
There is a way out of the bind. The majors, particularly European ones, are turning from megaprojects towards trading cargoes of other producers’ fuel. It reduces the amount of capital they have tied up in heavy assets and dirty fuels. It also helps them keep their promises to become portfolio companies trading all sorts of energy sources in an era of mass electrification. But it’s a different business. The barriers to entry are lower. There is competition from trading houses such as Trafigura, Vitol, Gunvor and Glencore. And Chinese firms like Sinopec, which last month signed two long-term contracts with Venture Global LNG, an American exporter, are emerging as potential rivals.
It all adds up to uncertainty. The big investments, complex engineering and generation-spanning paybacks of projects such as Gorgon have long made the LNG business one of boom and bust. In an era of shorter-term contracts, amid all the question-marks associated with climate change, the future may be no less volatile. The world has changed since Gorgon was conceived. For the IOCs, the big bet on Barrow Island may soon belong to a bygone era. ■

1851,"ON NOVEMBER 6TH teams of medics dressed in full protective gear packed equipment into a Romanian military transport plane before pushing beds with two severely ill covid-19 patients up the ramp and inside. As the propellers began to whirr, the back door slowly closed and the plane lumbered up the runway heading for Denmark. “There is no secret,” says Raed Arafat, who is co-ordinating Romania’s fight against covid: the country’s hospitals are “overflowing”. About 90 patients have been evacuated to Denmark, Germany, Hungary and elsewhere. Teams of doctors are also flying in from all over Europe to help their beleaguered colleagues.
Across Europe the numbers of people infected with the highly contagious Delta variant are rising, and many governments are contemplating or imposing new restrictions. But this wave is affecting some countries far more than others. From the Balkans to the Baltics an arc of susceptibility has emerged, encompassing a swathe of countries with low vaccination rates.

In the past few weeks the death rate from covid-19 has hit record highs in Bulgaria, Latvia and Romania. In the week to November 8th there were 22.8 confirmed deaths in Bulgaria for every million people. In Romania the figure was 21.8 and in Latvia 18.8. Yet for the EU as a whole it was only 3.0. The number of cases is at last dropping in those three badly-hit countries, but it is now soaring in Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Ukraine.
All of the countries being clobbered are at the low end of the scale when it comes to vaccination. Only 23% of Bulgarians and 34% of Romanians have been double-jabbed. In Latvia the proportion is 57%, but it was much lower a month ago, when the current wave took hold. In the EU as a whole, 66% are double-vaccinated.
Low vaccination rates are not the result of a lack of vaccines. The countries of the arc have ample supply, but also loud anti-vaxxers. Distrust of government and medical staff is high. A Eurobarometer survey conducted earlier this year found that only 22% of Bulgarians and Croats, 26% of Latvians and 31% of Romanians tend to trust their governments. When asked if they trusted medical staff, 34% of Bulgarians said they did not, along with 32% of Croats, 31% of Latvians and 40% of Romanians.
It is ironic that relatively low levels of infection in the summer seem to have contributed to the scale of current outbreaks. Those with doubts about the vaccine saw little urgency in getting it, which left them vulnerable when the Delta variant hit. Of those now in hospital, says Dr Arafat, 92% are unvaccinated. The true share could be higher, as unknown numbers have bought fake vaccination certificates. He angrily denounces anti-vax disinformation, which is often propagated by rogue doctors, Orthodox priests and far-right nationalists, with the help of “Dr Facebook”.
Inga Springe, a journalist with Re:Baltica, a news website, says that in Latvia prominent doctors have given ambiguous signals about vaccinations and some politicians are promoting themselves via anti-vax sites. Bulgaria goes to the polls on November 14th for the third time this year, and politicians there may fear alienating anti-vax voters.
According to Oana Popescu, director of GlobalFocus, a Romanian think-tank, Romanians’ lack of enthusiasm for getting vaccinated is a direct result of what they perceive to be decades of neglect by the authorities. “When the government suddenly seems to care for you for the first time in 30 years, of course you become suspicious!” she explains. Alas, it is not just Romanians who feel that way. ■

1852,"HURRICANE MARIA killed about 3,000 people and left parts of Puerto Rico without electricity for 11 months after it made landfall in September 2017. For the past four years its inhabitants have endured frequent electricity blackouts. Then earthquakes then hit the island in late 2019-early 2020. So when the first covid case was documented two months later, Puerto Rico was still reeling from previous disasters. The hospital system was in disarray: about 15% of medical personnel fled for the mainland after Hurricane Maria, and the earthquakes forced many clinics to close. Some Puerto Ricans were living in tent shelters, where infectious diseases could spread easily. Many feared that covid would devastate the weakened island.
In fact Puerto Rico, an American territory of 3.3m people about 1,000 miles (1,600km) south-east of Florida, has fared much better than most of America. The island experienced lower infection rates per person than all American states (5,843 cases per 100,000 since January 21, 2020). Of course, low case rates could be the result of infrequent testing. The positivity rate (the percentage of covid tests that are positive) is used as an indicator of how widespread infection is and whether enough testing is being done. As of November 15th, Puerto Rico’s positivity rate was 5-7.9% for the entire pandemic, just slightly above the share at which the World Health Organisation thinks the virus is under control.

Since January 2020, Puerto Rico saw 3,258 deaths from covid-19 (102 deaths per 100,000 people). Of the American states, only Vermont (60), Hawaii (68) and Maine (92) had fewer deaths per person. This is despite the fact that the island’s demography does not work in its favour. Over one-fifth of Puerto Ricans are 65 or older, compared with 16% of Americans overall. Those with pre-existing conditions are also at greater risk of severe covid infection, and Puerto Rico is over-represented among these diseases. It is also four times poorer than the rest of America: 44% live in poverty.
Why has Puerto Rico done so well? Unlike much of America, the island enacted strict rules early. The government brought in a lockdown in March 2020, two days after its first confirmed covid case. Non-essential businesses were ordered to close, and a curfew was enforced from 9pm until 5am. Anyone who broke it faced a $5,000 fine or a six-month jail term. “Puerto Rico…enact[ed] some very intense and very stringent protocols when covid first came out,” explains Brice Acosta, formerly of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I think that really helped them control things in the beginning.” Variations of this lockdown continued for over a year. When all American states (except Hawaii) reopened over the summer, Puerto Rico did not and kept many restrictions in place.
Detachment from the mainland also allowed Puerto Rico to limit travel into the territory. Cruise-ship passengers were prohibited during the pandemic, and even fully vaccinated ones were not allowed to enter Puerto Rico until August this year. In March 2020 the Federal Aviation Administration granted Puerto Rico permission to require all commercial flights to land at the international airport in San Juan for health screening before heading to other destinations. Today, all passengers landing in Puerto Rico must show proof of vaccination or a recent negative covid-19 test.
Other American jurisdictions detached from the mainland also benefited from the distance. Alaska experienced relatively few deaths per person compared with the rest of America (109 per 100,000), as did the US Virgin Islands (79) and Hawaii (68). All three limited domestic and international travel. Hawaii’s rules were particularly stringent: some tourists were arrested for breaking quarantine rules, and domestic travellers must still present a negative covid test or vaccination card to avoid having to quarantine for a stretch before paddling out on the North Shore. But despite these restrictions, each of these jurisdictions has experienced covid surges over the past few months that have overwhelmed hospitals and caused patients to be turned away. Puerto Rico did not.
Widespread vaccination is the likeliest reason for this difference. Puerto Rico is the most vaccinated jurisdiction in America. As of November 16th, 74% of the island’s population was fully vaccinated (America’s average is 59%). Hawaii, Alaska and the Virgin Islands have struggled to vaccinate their populations, with 60%, 54%, and 47% of residents vaccinated respectively. Victor Ramos, a doctor who is president of Puerto Rico’s association of physicians and surgeons, credits a strong childhood-immunisation system for the successful covid-19 campaign. He is confident that Puerto Rico will also successfully vaccinate eligible children over the coming months. For America, it is a glimpse of what might have been. ■

1853,"IN THE MID-1990s outlines of bulbous heads, spray-painted with a single swipe, began to appear on Beijing’s walls. Next to them was written “AK-47”. This tag, as graffitied signatures are known, belonged to Zhang Dali, an art student who had spent time in Italy and discovered graffiti culture there. On his return to China, swathes of its cities were being razed to make way for development. Workers were daubing the character chai, meaning “demolish”, on buildings due to be torn down. Mr Zhang took his cans to the same walls in protest at this often brutal upheaval.
Mr Zhang is widely regarded as China’s first modern graffiti artist. More recent ones are influenced by skateboarding culture or rap music. The art form is still in its infancy in China—it is far less commonly seen than in the West. But Liu Yuansheng, co-author of “Beijing Graffiti”, published in 2020, reckons the number of practitioners in the capital has at times swelled to 200.

Cities are riddled with CCTV cameras and teeming with law-enforcement officers. But it is not the threat of punishment that deters people from becoming graffiti artists. Doodlers rarely face more than a fine of 500 yuan ($80) and a day in police custody. Those caught tagging often get away with a promise to paint over their work. Sometimes the public defends such art. Residents in the central city of Wuhan called on officers to remove advertisements that had been pasted over a work by Rui Huang, a local artist. They felt that the ads had defaced his graffiti.
It may simply be that few people even consider spraying walls without permission. There is no tradition of guerrilla art used by criminal gangs to mark their territory or by protesters to attack the government. Mr Zhang’s poke at developers was a rare kind of dissent. The ruins gave him cover—officials turned a blind eye, knowing his works would soon be bulldozed.
China does have a history of using walls to express dissent in written form, however. A famous example occurred during the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79 when people flocked to the brick wall of a bus station in Beijing to put up “big-character posters” demanding greater political freedom. A constitutional right to put up such posters was scrapped in 1980. These days mural self-expression rarely goes beyond unauthorised “throwies”, or two-tone tags in bubble-like writing, which can be seen on walls in Beijing.
Local governments sometimes even sponsor street art, regarding it as a sign of modernisation. In the run-up to the Olympic games that were held in Beijing in 2008, officials in the capital encouraged artists to paint a 300-metre-long “graffiti wall”. Designs were vetted first. A street in the south-western city of Chongqing is home to one of the world’s largest graffiti projects (pictured). It was created, with official approval, by 800 painters. This year Wuhan paid local crews to draw graffiti on a tram and several public buses.
There are others, however, who barely qualify as artists who scribble on walls. A Chinese citizen in Sydney, who goes by the name Lil Quacky, collects graffiti in an Instagram account called “chinesegraffitihub” (the app is blocked in China). Quacky began the project last year after noticing that someone had rewritten a roadside slogan in China that had urged people to carry away their rubbish. It had been changed to “Carry away your love.” Most graffiti submitted to Quacky consists of untidy spray-painted sentences. “Are they enough to shock passers-by, to make them think, to make them stay for a while?” are Quacky’s criteria for posting them online. Hundreds of examples have passed the test. ■",2
1854,"RAYMOND SHIEH’S “hell vaccine kit” includes three vials in green, blue and red, and a large syringe, all made from joss paper. The kit will be burnt as an offering to the dead, supplying them in the afterlife with something they could not receive in this one: a vaccine for covid-19. The vials’ colours represent Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac, the three main vaccines used in Malaysia, which has reported some 20,000 new cases every day in the past month. Though half of over-11s are now fully jabbed, the country’s death rate from covid is the highest in South-East Asia.

“It has been a hard year for Malaysians and many have died waiting to be vaccinated,” says Mr Shieh, who runs a shop selling prayer items in the southern state of Johor and spent two days crafting the new product last month as covid deaths surged. He says he has received more than 300 orders, at 23 ringgit ($5.50) apiece, from people in Malaysia as well as in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. “I want to keep the kits affordable,” he says. “I hope this item will give my clients some peace of mind.”

For many practitioners of traditional Chinese religions, such as Taoism, the burning of joss paper and other paper paraphernalia is a way to meet the unfulfilled needs of their deceased loved ones. Adherents believe that most spirits go through the ten courts of Diyu, or hell, before achieving salvation. Funerary rituals hasten the journey. Offerings help ease the spirits’ suffering along the way. These rites typically conclude with the burning of “hell money”, as well as any other items that the dead may need for a comfortable afterlife—clothes or houses, for example, but also iPhones and Ferraris—all made of joss paper. Mr Shieh sells a life-size replica of the latest iPhone for 350 ringgit.
Every year during “Hungry Ghost Festival”, which usually falls in August or September, believers across the region pay homage to their deceased ancestors, as well as to sundry spirits, who visit the living as the gates of hell are opened. In addition to burning various paper offerings, the devout leave out food to placate the hungry ghosts. Stage performances of Chinese operas and Getai, or live song-and-dance numbers, were common features to appease the spirits before the pandemic. These are often held outdoors, under a big tent, with at least a front row of empty seats for the ghosts-of-honour, while the living crowd on the back benches. Such performances have gone online in most countries after being cancelled entirely last year.
In normal times Taoist and Buddhist vigils for the dead usually last for several days before the body is cremated. Yet because of covid, bodies must be disposed of immediately. Many believers are pained by the thought of not having paid their respects to family and friends. “Without proper prayer and rites, how will he rest in peace?” says Eric Leong, who recently lost his father to covid. A vaccine for the dead is one way to ease the pain.",2
1855,"IT IS AN unfortunate fact that the ease of throwing things into a wheelie-bag and travelling far and wide helped spread covid-19 around the world. The effects on leisure travel and destinations that rely on tourism will be felt for years to come. But just as the way we travel may improve as a result, so the chance for countries to rethink tourism industries could turn a bruised and battered industry into a better one.
The pursuit of pleasure using cultural pursuits as cover goes back to the days of the grand tourists, who trawled Europe’s artistic heritage as well as indulging in more hedonistic activities. As souvenirs they returned with paintings, sculptures and sometimes syphilis. Travel was hard and expensive. The earl of Salisbury spent the equivalent of nearly £500,000 today on his grand tour in the 18th century, according to MBNA, a credit-card firm. Even 50 years ago foreign travel was a luxury pursuit. In 1970 a return flight from New York to London cost around $500 (equivalent to $3,500 today).

Lower fares and the rise of the internet have made holidays cheaper and easier to arrange. Airlines, hotel chains, car-hire firms and other businesses have moved online. Dedicated internet travel agents like Expedia and Booking.com have emerged. Online peer-to-peer review sites offer a mostly honest assessment of hotels, restaurants and tourist sites. Airbnb and its competitors have created a new class of accommodation. The frictional costs of travel have fallen sharply.

Such is the stunning growth of tourism that the 72% decline in trips in the first ten months of 2020 on a year earlier merely took international travel back to where it was in 1990. Leisure travel accounts for the biggest slice but the rest contributes too. Business travellers stay in hotels, eat at restaurants and hire cars. Some visits to relatives or friends may be barely distinguishable from a holiday.

Not only are there more trips, but the world is a bigger oyster. In 1950 the top 15 destinations—with America, France, Italy and Spain the most visited—claimed 97% of tourist arrivals. By 2015 that share had dropped to just over half. Europe, with it historic cities, countryside and beaches, still rules, taking just over half of all international travellers. That is twice the share of the Asia-Pacific region, the next most popular area. Europe rakes in the most receipts, around 37% of the global total, worth some $619bn in 2019. France and Spain are the most popular countries for a visit. The top spots may not have changed, but their arrivals have. Chinese visits overseas have grown from just 9m trips in 1999 to 150m in 2018.
Travellers’ preference for richer countries has created large industries. Spain relied on domestic and foreign visitors for 11.8% of GDP in 2019, France 7.4% and Mexico 8.7%. Poorer countries lean even more on tourist dollars. America is the biggest country for travel spending, some $1.8trn in 2019, but overseas visitors have put tourism at the heart of many economies. In Aruba it accounts for nearly three-quarters of GDP; in most other small Caribbean islands it is also the main economic activity. Other poorer countries are less reliant overall but have vast tourist industries. Thailand welcomed around 10m foreign tourists in 2001. By 2019 it had grown fourfold (with a quarter of the total coming from China), bringing in 1.9trn baht ($60bn) and contributing some 18% of GDP.
The emptying of tourist trails and resorts resembling ghost towns is causing massive upheaval. UNCTAD estimated that losses could amount to 2.8% of world output if international arrivals dropped by 66% in 2020. The OECD now reckons that the drop was more like 80%. And the expectation is that international arrivals will probably not recover to pre-covid levels until 2023.
Tourism is a resilient industry. But it faces a downturn like no other. Firms reliant on visitors may not be best placed to survive. According to the WTCC, around 80% of tourist businesses worldwide, from hotels to restaurants to tour guides, are small businesses. Large hotel chains may have the balance-sheets to weather the storm or the management skills to reconfigure their business to cater more to domestic travellers. Small businesses probably lack the cash to invest in equipment for contactless payments or better cleaning and hygiene to reassure returning tourists.
The uncertain path to recovery raises questions over what will remain. The UNWTO reckons that countries with a big share of domestic tourism—America, China and India have the largest home markets—will recover more quickly. Travel restrictions have kept China’s high-rollers at home, giving its fanciest hotels their best year ever. But even domestic tourism is far from a saviour. Britain and Spain, for example, reckon on a decrease in domestic tourism of 45-50% in 2020.
These problems have prompted various responses to keep businesses alive. Some countries such as France, which launched an $18bn bail-out in May, have aimed cash directly at tourist businesses. Others are trying to reassure tourists that their countries are safe by developing protocols and guidelines for tourism workers. Luís Araújo, president of the Portuguese National Tourism Authority, says his organisation has arranged training for 60,000 workers at restaurants, hotels and travel agents to create a safer travel experience. Finland and Greece are among countries with new training programmes aimed at improving the digital presence of tourist businesses.
Some parts of the tourist economy will do better than others. Travel firms have noted a rising preference for self-catering and private accommodation over hotels. Coastal and rural locations, far from crowds, will recover faster than cities. Cyril Ranque of Expedia notes that his customers are more inclined to drive to domestic locations but then to stay longer than before. But these trends, he believes, are “all temporary”.
Waiting for the rebound
The travel bug seems certain to outlast the virus. Its first manifestation may be “revenge tourism” as people get away after a year of lockdowns and quarantines. But some things will change for good. A preoccupation in previous centuries, health and hygiene will re-emerge as central to holiday planning. Guidebooks from Baedeker, a German publisher, were never reticent about warning travellers of the filth they faced in foreign climes even in the early 20th century, bemoaning the “evil sanitary reputation of Naples”. Destinations will continue to boast of their scenery, cuisine and beaches but safety and hygiene will become as important, says Ian Yeoman, a tourism academic at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. This may benefit longer-established destinations, tilting visitors away from poorer countries.
Those countries will not be deliberately trying to avoid tourists, even so. Some remote places have used the hiatus to build a better online presence, says Mr Ranque. He points to other innovations to make travel less of a bother. Flexibility, to cope with last-minute changes of plans, will endure. Late or even last-minute bookings are more common. Josh Belkin of Hotels.com reports that, because people are taking more staycations and travelling by car rather than plane, they are booking hotels later, on average 13 days before a trip rather than the 20 before covid-19.
Many travel companies and airlines have introduced more flexible rebooking policies. Faced by a wave of cancellations as covid-19 took hold, Expedia introduced “one-click cancellation” to deal with all elements from flights and hotels to car hire. Firms that use its platform can deploy new tools to add special offers to listings to encourage last-minute bookers and manage refunds. Gathering real-time data on searches, and sharing them with businesses that relied on information from previous years to set prices, could also lead to a better match between supply and demand and encourage more dynamic pricing. In future, personalised customer data should allow travel firms to recommend holidays in a more focused way.
Covid-19 presents a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to move towards more sustainable and resilient models of tourism development”, says the OECD. “Tourism was seen as unambiguously good 20 years ago...now it’s a double-edged sword,” says Paul Flatters of the Trajectory Partnership. Concerns about the impact of tourism on the environment predate the pandemic. But tourism also broadens awareness of different cultures and environmental issues and helps pay for wildlife conservation, as well as providing employment and economic development.
Many destinations failed to strike a balance between tourist numbers and local sensibilities. Venetians have long protested against vast cruise ships, prompting some firms to drop the city from their itineraries. Venice also plans to impose a levy on all visitors from 2022. Anti-tourist slogans daubed on walls have greeted visitors to Barcelona, which has clamped down on illegal holiday letting (as have Berlin and other places in which holiday lets have replaced rental properties, forcing up prices for residents). Amsterdam is considering a ban on non-residents buying cannabis in its notorious coffee shops, to encourage a better class of tourist. Machu Picchu, where trails were overrun, imposed a pre-covid limit of 5,000 visitors a day. That will be cut to 675 to ensure social distancing.
Covid-19 offers the chance not only to reset tourism to reduce the numbers who spend the least but also to spread them out. Barcelona has run a campaign to encourage people to venture away from the old city. Thailand has a scheme to promote 55 less visited parts of the country. Concentrating on attracting fewer tourists ready to spend more is one way to promote a healthier business. And sustainability may become a more important guide to choices as awareness of climate change and the less welcome effects of tourism grow. Getting the right balance between economic, environmental and social benefits and costs has seen a new emphasis on sustainability. Mexico thinks covid-19 will help with its “Mexico Reborn Sustainable” campaign, which aims in part to create new routes that spread tourist dollars more widely and promote destinations that tap into fast-growing nature tourism.
A dynamic tourism economy depends on the availability of a variety of services, from accommodation and good services to attractions, activities and events. Whether a critical mass of services will remain everywhere is less clear. Less choice and competition, if businesses go bust, may mean higher prices. The rapid growth of tourist economies in recent years suggests they can be rebuilt swiftly. But for all those governments that redesign their tourism strategies to keep down crowds and protect the environment, others may compete by racing to the bottom, using deep discounts to fill hotels and planes. Tourist numbers will recover and continue to grow either way. Greater efforts to manage them carefully should make for a better experience for everyone.■",2
1856,"HONG KONG, July 12 (Reuters) - China's antitrust regulator is set to order the music streaming arm of Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) to give up exclusive rights to music labels which it has used to compete with smaller rivals, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
The State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) will also fine it 500,000 yuan ($77,150) for lapses in reporting the acquisitions of apps Kuwo and Kugou, the people told Reuters - a milder penalty than the forced sale indicated earlier this year.
SAMR, Tencent Holdings and Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME.N) did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
The move is the latest in a clamp-down to curb the economic and social power of China's once-loosely regulated internet giants. The campaign, which began late last year, has included a record 18 billion yuan fine on e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  for abusing its market position.
In April, Reuters reported that SAMR aimed to fine Tencent Holdings at least 10 billion yuan, and that the social media leader was lobbying for leniency. Reuters also reported that SAMR had told Tencent Music it may have to sell Kuwo and Kugou.
Instead, SAMR will no longer require a sale but will impose the maximum 500,000 yuan fine for not properly flagging the 2016 app purchases for antitrust review, the people said on Monday.
""Personally, I think this punishment falls short and is even a boon for Tencent. The acquisitions obviously would restrict competition in the market, and should have been vetoed,"" said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Offices.
""It is too little a hit to Tencent Music's dominant position in the market,"" said You, a commentator on antitrust law.
Reuters could not determine whether Tencent Holdings faces any further antitrust penalty beyond the expected ruling on Tencent Music, China's dominant music streamer.
On Saturday, SAMR said it would block Tencent Holdings' plan to merge China's two biggest videogame streamers - Huya Inc (HUYA.N) and DouYu International Holdings Ltd  - on antitrust grounds, confirming an earlier Reuters report.  read more 
EXCLUSIVITY
Tencent Music, China's equivalent to Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), had been pursuing exclusive streaming rights with labels including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group and Warner Music Group Corp (WMG.O) to fend off competition.
It became the subject of a SAMR investigation in 2018 which stopped the following year after the company agreed not to renew some of its exclusive rights, which normally expire after three years, Reuters previously reported.
It nevertheless kept exclusive rights to music from some acts, including Jay Chou, one of the Chinese-speaking world's most influential artists.
After SAMR's latest ruling, Tencent Music will at least be able to retain rights to music from some domestic indie acts, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Losing exclusive rights means Tencent Music will likely have to redouble efforts to build a more interactive and lively community to engage with its users. The firm has also been diversifying its content through long-form shows and live talk shows to attract more paying users as well as advertisers.
Tencent Music is facing a mounting challenge from ByteDance, which is using its Douyin app - its Chinese version of TikTok - to promote music backed by sophisticated algorithms.

1857,"Children are quick to find nicknames for their teachers — the cheekier the better. But Kath Tregenna is thrilled with hers. And for good reason.
To her young pupils at the International School of London who clearly adore their smiley, vivacious teacher, Kath is quite simply the Bionic Woman.
It's testament not simply to the amazing pair of bionic arms Kath now sports, but to the extraordinary spirit which has seen her return to work despite having all four limbs amputated.
Just like TV's Bionic Woman — played by Lindsay Wagner and coincidentally also a teacher with superhuman powers — Kath's courage and determination are awe inspiring.
Almost exactly two years after her family were summoned to come and say their goodbyes to her in hospital, Kath is back doing what she loves best.
And thanks to her amazing arms, she does everything from driving herself to school to writing on the whiteboard and coming up with fun maths activities.
She's not only had to learn how to use the so-called Hero Arms, which have clever sensors that can detect the tiniest muscle signals and turn them into hand movements. 
She's also had to teach herself to walk again on prosthetic legs — and all while caring for her two children: Aaron, 12, and eight-year-old Emily.
'I know life can never be exactly the same,' says Kath, 47, who lives in Datchet, Berkshire with her partner, Alvin, 48, a carpenter, and their children. 'But I refuse to look back. After coming so close to losing everything, I am just so overwhelmingly grateful to be alive.'
Kath's old life was eviscerated over a single terrifying weekend in late November 2019, when sepsis tore through her body. 
A life-threatening reaction to an infection — in Kath's case pneumonia — sepsis occurs when the immune system overreacts and begins to damage the body's tissues and organs.
'It all started at school on Friday afternoon. I began feeling unwell — queasy and terribly hot,' recalls Kath. 'I know now I was developing pneumonia.
'I decided to leave early and go home for some rest. I walked out, leaving my papers on my desk expecting to be back fighting fit on Monday morning.
'I spent the weekend in bed — only dragging myself out with the kids to see the Christmas lights in Windsor.'
But far from feeling better, by Sunday afternoon Kath was physically sick and feeling so feverish that she rang 111. Mercifully, the call handler realised something was very wrong and, despite Kath's protests, ordered an ambulance.
'I owe her my life,' says Kath. 'I'd never felt this sick before but it never occurred to me that I could be dangerously ill.
'As they took me out to the ambulance, I even promised the kids I would be back for breakfast. I also rang my headteacher from my mobile and warned her I might be late into school.
'I never thought I wouldn't be back for two years.'
Kath's condition deteriorated at devastating speed. Within hours of arriving at Slough's Wexham Park Hospital and being diagnosed with sepsis, triggered by pneumonia, she suffered up to 11 cardiac arrests as well as multiple organ failure and had to be put into an induced coma.
At 1.30am on Monday morning, police arrived at the family home to summon Alvin and the children to say their goodbyes. Hospital staff also rang Kath's father, Keith, 78, a retired law lecturer in Cornwall and urged him to get to Kath's bedside.
'I can't begin to imagine what it was like for them,' says Kath who tragically lost her own mum, Sylvia, to cancer when she was just 13. 'One minute the kids were walking around Windsor with me, admiring the Christmas lights. The next they were being told Mummy was going to die.
'I looked unrecognisable. My body was bloated from the drugs and I was covered in wires. Emily was so terrified she couldn't even be persuaded to kiss me.
'Alvin managed to keep it together for the children but he must have been in total hell.'
Kath clung onto life by a thread that night. Over and over again during the next few days, the family were warned to get ready for the worst. A counsellor was assigned to the children to help prepare them for losing their mum.
'She told them in no uncertain terms that I was going to die,' shudders Kath. 'The doctors told Alvin and Dad that it would take a miracle to save me.'
Incredibly, that miracle came just in time for Christmas. One of the doctors remembered reading about a drug which had proved successful in boosting the effectiveness of the antibiotics they were already trying.
It had only been used on a handful of patients. But, with nothing to lose, it was administered to Kath.
Very slowly, over the next few days, the sepsis abated. Although Kath remained in a coma, two weeks after she arrived in hospital the family finally dared hope she would live.
But sepsis had wreaked terrible damage. When Kath regained consciousness in early January last year, she was faced with the terrible truth.
Sepsis had stopped the blood flowing properly to her extremities and gangrene had set in. Her hands, her feet and much of her legs were dying and only an amputation could stop the infection spreading further.
'It was too much to take in,' she says. 'I could see that my hands and feet were black. There was no sensation and I couldn't move them.
'But I couldn't understand why. My last memory was getting into the ambulance two months before. My family and the doctors had to explain over and over what had happened.
'At first I was numb with shock. But, when I understood there was no choice, it was an easy decision. Besides, these black, horrible limbs didn't feel part of me any more.'
She adds: 'I remember Alvin looking at me and saying: 'Kath, you've survived. This is such a small price to pay.'
'When I thought how close our kids had come to losing me, I realised he was right. I, above everyone, know the reality of losing a mum.'
Kath had both her hands amputated just above the wrist on January 10 last year.
'At first they were bandaged up so I couldn't see anything,' she says. 'My biggest concern was what the children would think. When they visited after the operation, I moved my arms from under the covers so they could see there was nothing to fear.
'I was determined to find the positives. I remember saying: 'Mummy will get some new arms made. They won't be exactly like my old ones but they will be great.'
'Of course, at that stage I was winging it — I hadn't even heard of Hero Arms.'
Two weeks later, on January 24, 2020, Kath had both her legs amputated. To her relief, doctors were able to save her knees which gave her the chance of more mobility.
Even so, adapting to her new normal was heartwrenching. 'I thought I'd prepared myself,' she says. 'But it's impossible to imagine what it's like to wake up with no legs.
'I would never be able to walk or stand again unaided. It was a victory when the physio got me to shuffle my bottom down the bed.'
Kath hoped to be transferred to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital to have prosthetic arms and legs fitted. But, when the pandemic hit, she was told she'd have to wait.
'It was a blow,' she says. 'But at least it meant I could get home sooner — even though it would be in a wheelchair. The kids were desperate to have me back.'
In April, her occupational therapist pushed Kath through her front door. Alvin, the children and her dad were there to greet her.
'That first day was pure joy,' she says. 'The kids made a huge fuss of me. Just being able to kiss and cuddle them in my own home was wonderful. I don't think I have ever been happier to be alive.
'Then the reality hit me. Inside I was the same but physically I was a totally different person. Everything was a challenge. I had no devices. I could only feed myself by balancing a spoon between my stumps and lifting it very carefully to my mouth. In those first few weeks, food went everywhere.
'I couldn't get up the stairs so we had to put a hospital bed in the sitting room. Aaron was really protective and was always ready to fetch me a glass of water or a snack. Emily loved to brush my hair.'
There was so much to re-learn, but in one area Kath discovered she still excelled — teaching. While many parents loathed homeschooling during the pandemic, for Kath it was a chance to reconnect with her old self.
'It was the old Kath coming back,' says Kath who's been teaching for more than 20 years in the UK, America and the Caribbean, where she met Alvin. 'I've always loved my job. I guess I'm a natural born teacher.
'Sitting with Emily and Aaron — doing all the things I'd normally do in the classroom — was magic. I felt needed and useful. For the first time I dared hope I might get back into the classroom.'
So she was thrilled when, in July last year, she was fitted for prosthetic legs and started learning to walk again with weekly physio sessions as an outpatient at the John Radcliffe Hospital.
'By the time I was allowed to take them home in October I was so excited, but still very cautious even when walking on a flat floor as bumps are a nightmare. But I could finally walk into the kitchen and pour a drink for myself. It was amazing.'
Kath was also fitted with prosthetic arms. However, these were much less satisfactory. 'They were like hooks — functional but ugly and heavy,' she says. 'I felt embarrassed wearing them.'
Kath had read about UK tech company Open Bionics and their pioneering Hero Arms. Made from tough nylon, Hero Arms use 'myoelectric sensors' to detect the electrical signals made by muscle movements in the existing arm.
They are much lighter than normal prosthetic arms and so clever they can even pick up an egg or hold a wine glass.
But the arms cost between £8,000 and £10,000 each. It's a tribute to Kath's popularity that friends and colleagues, as well as scores of parents past and present, raised £29,000 to help her.
Kath's first Hero Arm — to fit her right arm — arrived just in time for Christmas last year. Her second followed in January.
'It was the best early Christmas present,' she says. 'I'd promised the kids I would have cool new arms one day. And here they were.
'I had to practise like crazy. Basically, you have to imagine what you want to do — whether it's picking up a knife and fork or opening a door. There are three sensors on the inside of the bionic arm and three on the outside which pick up these minute muscle movements in my stumps and transfer them to finger movements.
Her old school pupils — aged from eight to 11 — were desperate to see Kath's bionic arms too. In June, 18 months after she went sick, Kath visited the school.
'The children had lived through the trauma too,' she says. 'I wanted to show them a happy outcome. They were transfixed by the arms.
'They bombarded me with questions and even came up with suggestions on how to improve them. One bright spark even asked: 'Can they shoot lasers?'
Buoyed by their reaction and the encouragement of her colleagues, Kath felt confident enough to return to work in September. 'I'm taking it very slowly and only doing a few hours a week for now because I tire easily,' she says.
'I'm also learning what I can and can't do. I can write on a whiteboard — I am still right-handed — but jumping down to the children's level is another matter.'
And beyond the curriculum she is a living example of some of life's most important lessons like resilience, fortitude and gratitude.
'I hope I can teach them to appreciate life. I certainly do,' she says simply.
'When I look at Aaron and Emily and remember how close they came to losing me, I feel overwhelmed by how lucky I am.'
It's a joy that will be all the more intense this Christmas. 'I can't wait to put the tree up,' she says. 'And this year — thanks to my bionic arms — I will be the one hanging the baubles and wrapping the presents.",-2
1858,"CHRISTIAN LINDNER, the leader of Germany’s pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), is likely to emerge as a crucial figure after the election. Polling suggests it will be hard to form a coalition without the FDP. The 42-year-old Mr Lindner will relish the chance to cap his rapid political ascent with a job inside Germany’s next government—ideally as finance minister. His enemies would see that as their worst nightmare.
The FDP advocates tax cuts, slashing red tape, pension reform and limits to European fiscal integration. More recently it has urged a faster easing of lockdown rules. The party has doubled its support in the past year, thanks in part to the collapse of the conservative CDU/CSU. A snappy dresser and charismatic performer who regularly tops “Germany’s hottest politician” lists, Mr Lindner dominates his party to the exclusion of its other talents. At a recent campaign event in Berlin he was swarmed by admirers after delivering a fiery speech in which he sniped viciously at the Greens’ plans for debt-funded investment.

For decades the FDP was the kingmaker of German politics, propping up coalitions led by the CDU/CSU or the SPD. But the next government will probably need three parties to make up the numbers. That could mean a choice between a right-leaning “Jamaica” coalition, with Armin Laschet as chancellor, or an SPD-run “traffic-light” grouping, led by Olaf Scholz. Both would include the FDP and the Greens as junior partners. In 2017 Mr Lindner aborted Angela Merkel’s attempts to form a Jamaica coalition, declaring it better not to govern at all than to govern badly. “The FDP didn’t give us a millimetre,” says Lisa Paus, a Green MP involved in the talks.
This year Mr Lindner will hope to give Jamaica another try. He gets on well with Mr Laschet, with whom he built a CDU-FDP coalition in North Rhine-Westphalia in 2017. But as the SPD’s prospects have grown, Mr Lindner has opened the door to Mr Scholz by quietly softening his stance on fiscal issues. His price for making possible a traffic-light government would be the finance ministry, a perch from which he would seek to rein in the spending plans of the SPD and Greens (and France’s aspirations to deepen euro-zone integration). Many Greens and Social Democrats detest Mr Lindner’s brand of politics, and the feelings are mutual. From this witches’ brew of resentment and mistrust, a government may somehow emerge.",2
1859,"LEUVEN IS PERHAPS best known to the general public as the birth place of Stella Artois. Among chipmakers the Belgian city’s biggest claim to fame sits in a squat building not far from the Leuven Institute for Beer Research. Metal banding lends its facade the glittering look of a silicon wafer etched with microcircuitry. Inside, its lower floors hum with the noise of $3bn-worth of some of the most complex equipment humanity has ever devised. The offices above house hundreds of the planet’s keenest semiconductor engineers dreaming up the future of chipmaking.
The building (pictured) is the headquarters of the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre. IMEC, as it is better known, does not design chips (like America’s Intel), manufacture them (like TSMC of Taiwan) or make any of the complicated gear in its basement (like ASML, a Dutch firm). Instead, it creates knowledge used by everyone in the $550bn chip business. Given chips’ centrality to the modern economy—highlighted by the havoc wrought by current shortages—and increasingly to modern geopolitics, too, that makes it one of the most essential industrial research-and-development (R) centres on the planet. Luc Van den hove, IMEC’s boss, calls it the “Switzerland of semiconductors”.

IMEC was founded in 1984 by a group of electronics engineers from the Catholic University of Leuven who wanted to focus on microprocessor research. In the early days it was bankrolled by the local Flemish government. Today IMEC maintains its neutrality thanks to a financial model in which no single firm or state controls a big share of its budget. The largest chunk comes from the Belgian government, which chips in some 16%. The top corporate contributors provide no more than 4% each. Keeping revenue sources diverse (partners span the length and breadth of the chip industry) and finite (its standard research contracts last three to five years) gives IMEC the incentive to focus on ideas that help advance chipmaking as a whole rather than any firm in particular.
A case in point is the development of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). EUV is a delicate process involving high-powered lasers, molten tin and ultra-smooth mirrors. The bus-sized machines that generate EUV are today all made by ASML and used by TSMC and Samsung, a South Korean chipmaker. It took 20 years of R to turn the idea into manufacturing reality. IMEC acted as a conduit in that process. That is because EUV must work seamlessly with kit made by other firms. Advanced toolmakers want a way to circulate their intellectual property (IP) without the large companies gaining sway over it. The large companies, meanwhile, do not want to place all their bets on any one experimental idea that is expensive (as chipmaking processes are) and could become obsolete.
IMEC’s neutrality allows both sides to get around this problem. It collects all the necessary gear in one place, allowing producers to develop their technology in tandem with others. And everyone gets rights to the IP the institute generates. Mr Van den hove says that progress in the chip industry has been driven by the free exchange of knowledge, with IMEC acting as a “funnel” for ideas from all over the world.
This model has lured ever more contributors. Today “several hundred” are active at IMEC at any one time, the institute says. They range from startups to the stars of the chipmaking firmament, from ASML to TSMC. Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s newish boss, is effusive in his praise for the outfit. Even as their number has grown, individual partners have also become more generous, in part to keep pace with the rising price of all the chipmaking equipment that IMEC must procure (even if it gets a lot of it from collaborators at reduced rates). As a result, IMEC’s revenues, which come from the research contracts and from prototyping and design services, doubled between 2010 and 2020, to €678m ($773m). Its annual takings are already on the order of those of giant charities such as the Ford Foundation or the American Cancer Society, and growing roughly in line with the booming chip business (see chart).

The deepening rift between America, home to some of the industry’s biggest firms, and China, which imported $378bn-worth of chips last year, threatens IMEC’s spirit of global comity. China’s chip industry is increasingly shielded by an overbearing Communist Party striving for self-sufficiency, and ever more ostracised by outsiders as a result of American and European export controls. All this limits the extent to which IMEC can work with Chinese semiconductor companies.
It is a matter of public record that IMEC has worked with Chinese firms in the past, including Huawei, a telecoms-gear giant with a chip division that has been hobbled by American sanctions, and SMIC, China’s biggest chipmaker. Chinese make up 3.5% of people working at IMEC, the fifth-largest group and ahead of Americans at 1.5%. IMEC has a unit in Shanghai. Still, no Chinese tools are visible in its basement. IMEC would not comment on individual partnerships but says it has “a few engagements with Chinese companies, however not on the most sensitive technologies, and always fully compliant with current European and US export regulations and directives”. Mr Van den hove adds that IMEC has no “major partnerships” with up-and-coming Chinese toolmakers.
Less chipmaking know-how flowing to China and less streaming out of it means that Chinese engineers’ ideas can no longer be integrated with the global technology base of which IMEC is the custodian. There is little that IMEC can do about the growing distance between the Western and Chinese techno-spheres. So it is focusing instead on what it does best: pushing the cutting-edge of chip manufacturing.
A hulking machine made by SUSS MicroTec, a German firm, scans chips to create a 3D image so that multiple processors can be aligned and affixed—fiddly business at nanometre scales. Elsewhere in the building Peter Peumans, who runs IMEC’s health-tech portfolio, hands over a prototype developed during the pandemic that uses a custom silicon chip to cut DNA-sequencing times from hours to minutes. Xavier Rottenberg is developing semiconductor-based ultrasound sensors that can be printed out using the technology to make flat-screen TVs, which may lead to scanners much larger than today’s handheld ones and able to capture the whole body at once at a higher resolution. Such work keeps IMEC’s neutral ideas factory awhir. Maintaining Swiss-like neutrality in chip geopolitics will be tougher. ■

1860,"PANIC HAS set in at the Konrad Adenauer House, the Berlin HQ of Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats (CDU). The long-ailing Social Democrats (SPD), under the steady hand of Olaf Scholz, their candidate for the chancellorship, have opened a clear polling lead, and Armin Laschet, the candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian CSU ally, is plumbing new depths of unpopularity. What to do? Mr Laschet’s answer was to unveil, on September 3rd, a group of obscure advisory “experts” to lend his floundering campaign intellectual heft. They spanned the CDU’s “Christian-social, liberal wings”, beamed Mr Laschet, meaning that they could not agree on a single thing. Observers detected desperation.
A second tactic has been to raise a red scare. Mr Scholz has not ruled out forming a coalition with the Greens and Die Linke, a small hard-left outfit partly derived from East Germany’s Communists. (Nor will he; to do so would reduce his leverage in post-election coalition talks.) The liveliest moment in an otherwise dull televised debate between the chancellor-candidates on August 29th came when Mr Laschet launched a broadside against Mr Scholz for holding the door open to Die Linke. Two days later even Angela Merkel, who has sought desperately to stay out of the campaign, repeated the charge. Mr Scholz, an ultra-moderate who is as likely to invite the Russophiles of Die Linke into government as he is to don a Karneval outfit and down a litre of Kölsch on the streets of Cologne, can probably take the blows. A poll on September 2nd, the first since the debate, gave the SPD a five-point lead over the CDU/CSU—the biggest yet.

To a Hoffest (roughly, a party in a courtyard) in Charlottenburg, a posh neighbourhood in west Berlin, where Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), is geeing up the party faithful at a campaign event. Mr Lindner takes potshots at Robert Habeck, the Greens’ co-leader and a possible rival of Mr Lindner’s for the finance minister’s job in the next coalition. Mr Habeck’s plans for debt-fuelled investment, declares Mr Lindner, run up against a linguistic problem: “debts” (Schulden) sound a lot like “guilt” (Schuld). So instead, howls Mr Lindner, Mr Habeck decides to rebrand it as “credit”! Cue much guffawing. Some years ago Mario Monti, a former Italian prime minister, said that Germans treated economics as a branch of moral philosophy. Perhaps he was right.

Almost 60 years ago Germany signed its first “guest-worker” agreement with Turkey, which kickstarted several waves of migration between the countries. This week Mrs Merkel held a ceremony at the chancellery to pay tribute to Germany’s guest workers and their descendants. “Integration cannot remain a seven-generation task that is never completed because your name is not Klaus or Erika,” she said. It was a laudable sentiment from a chancellor who, in her quiet way, helped usher in Germany's slow acknowledgment of its own diversity (more than one-quarter of the population have what Germans call a “migration background”). The sceptical outsider might wonder why, 60 years on, such a statement remains necessary.

The federal election is not Germany’s only vote on September 26th. Two of the 16 states will also be choosing their assemblies. And if the election in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, a sparsely populated north-eastern state, might struggle to set pulses racing, the Abgeordnetenhauswahl in Berlin, one of the three city-states, should be a livelier affair. A few months ago the Greens thought they were cruising to a victory that would double the tally of states they run. But as nationwide polls go, so, it seems, do metropolitan ones: the SPD has lately opened up a clear lead in the capital. In May Franziska Giffey, the SPD’s charismatic candidate for mayor, had to quit her job as federal families minister amid—what else?—a plagiarism scandal which saw Berlin’s Free University strip her of her doctorate. But Ms Giffey’s campaign is going from strength to strength—even if wags have taken to defacing election posters bearing her name with an artfully placed “Dr”.

In engineering-mad Germany there is a tool for everything—even voting. Thursday saw the launch of the “Wahl-o-Mat”, an online election guide which asks voters three dozen questions on matters like wind-energy subsidies and asylum policy, before telling them which of 40 parties have views that best match their own. Before the 2017 election a staggering 15.7m voters cranked up the Wahl-o-Mat. The number that based their votes on the result is perhaps a little smaller, but either way there is great sport in starting a questionnaire believing yourself to be a Green, social democrat or conservative—only to find that your views align perfectly with Die Urbane, the “hip-hop party”, or V-Party, which aims to advance the interests of vegetarians and vegans.

1861,"BRITAIN IS UNIQUELY exposed to the malign forces troubling the world economy. It gets two-fifths of its energy from natural gas, which is in short supply. Trade flows are worth more than half of its GDP, making bunged-up supply chains particularly painful. Brexit has exacerbated its labour shortage and disrupted trade further. It even has a high rate of covid-19 infections, posing a lingering threat to consumer confidence, though more than 90% of the population has antibodies against the disease.
Could a central-bank mistake soon be added to the list of problems? The Bank of England has encouraged markets to expect interest-rate rises sooner than in other big rich countries. In mid-September investors began betting that interest rates would start rising in December. This week comments by Andrew Bailey, the bank’s governor, led traders to place about an 80% chance on a rate increase on November 4th. Our reading of Mr Bailey’s remarks—which, admittedly, were imprecisely worded—suggests that the markets are getting ahead of themselves. The governor has promised only to be vigilant. And yet the bank has not disabused bond desks of the notion that a series of rate rises is imminent.

That is worrying. Inflation has risen to over 3% and will probably reach around 5% by the spring. But many of the forces pushing it up, such as energy-price increases, should prove temporary. The normal approach is to disregard inflation when it is caused by supply disruptions rather than by an overheating economy. The bank did this in 2011 when commodity prices rose and inflation reached 5.2%, and did so again after the Brexit referendum sent sterling tumbling in 2016, making imports more expensive. On both occasions high inflation subsided.

Those who worry that, in contrast to those episodes, the labour market is running too hot or supply could be permanently impaired should take comfort from the fact that the government is already turning off some stimulus. The furlough scheme, which helped pay the wages of staff who were temporarily laid off, finished at the end of September. A temporary boost to welfare benefits worth an annual £6bn (0.3% of GDP) lapsed at around the same time. The government has announced tax rises worth an annual £12bn, to take effect from April. Tighter fiscal policy gives policymakers time to see how the economy responds. The bank’s November meeting would be a poor time to jump the gun, because data on the jobs market’s response to the end of the furlough scheme will not yet be available.
The bank is troubled by the risk of inflation expectations rising, baking in persistent price increases as workers demand higher wages and firms’ costs rise. It is a reasonable concern. Several measures of inflation expectations have drifted upward and average wage growth is curiously strong. Britain, unlike America and the euro zone, did not have persistently below-target inflation before the pandemic, meaning the public may be more accustomed to price rises.
On present trends, the Old Lady would have to raise rates before other central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, in 2022. But tightening monetary policy to preserve long-term credibility, rather than because it is warranted by underlying economic conditions, is more typical of emerging markets than the rich world. That it may be necessary is a sign of Britain’s fragility.
Whatever policy they follow, rate-setters should communicate their intentions more clearly. One has even suggested that if markets price in higher rates, tightening financial conditions, that might slow the economy sufficiently to avoid monetary policymakers having to follow through—an approach that would create a credibility problem all of its own. ■",2
1862,"BRITAIN, PROCLAIMED Boris Johnson, the prime minister, is a country in transition, away from “the same old broken model” to a “high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity” economy. On October 6th, addressing the party faithful gathered in Manchester for the Conservatives’ annual conference, he promised that workers would soon begin to feel better off. Wages are indeed rising. But so too are prices. Moreover, payroll taxes are due to rise in the spring. And on the same day as Mr Johnson’s speech the main working-age benefit, universal credit, was cut by £20 ($27.10) a week. Britons look set to experience a tight squeeze on disposable incomes in the months ahead.

An analysis by The Economist based on government forecasts that predate some of these changes suggests that total household income, after tax and corrected for inflation, will fall in both 2022 and 2023 (see chart). After two years in which household incomes fell because of the pandemic and Brexit, the result will be the longest decline since the mid-1970s.

First to feel the squeeze will be the 5.5m low-income households in receipt of universal credit, which is both an out-of-work benefit and a supplement to the earnings of the low-paid. The loss of £1,040 a year is the biggest single cut to social security since the foundation of the modern welfare state. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity, estimates that more than 500,000 people, of whom 200,000 are children, will fall into poverty. More than a third of those affected are in work.
The cut to universal credit, which unwinds a temporary increase at the beginning of the pandemic, at least featured in projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an official forecaster, when it last ran the numbers for household income in March. Since then the government has announced a 1.25% rise in both employer and employee payroll taxes, to take effect next April, in order to pay for social care and help clear a post-pandemic health-care backlog. And the OBR, like the Bank of England, underestimated how quickly inflation would increase as the economy recovered.
Mr Johnson points to rising wages as evidence that voters will soon feel better off despite rising prices. And he has sought to draw a political dividing line with the Labour Party over the issue of immigration. In his speech he brushed aside concerns about stretched supply chains that have seen petrol pumps run dry and supermarkets struggle to fill shelves in recent weeks. This is part of a remarkable pivot: having previously said that staff shortages were nothing to do with Brexit, he now argues that these shortages are in fact among Brexit’s main benefits. The logic is that without an endless supply of European immigrants, firms will be forced to raise wages and improve working conditions in order to attract British workers.
Such claims helped the prime minister win good headlines from his party’s conference. But in the longer term he may come to regret making higher living standards so central a measure of his success. As he emphasised in conference-season interviews, recent data on real wages has indeed been strong. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), real wages grew by 5.1% in the year to July. Over the late spring and early summer, the annual rate of growth in real weekly earnings was the highest in two decades.
But the numbers require careful handling and the ONS has plastered its recent releases with more than the usual number of caveats. At the moment, annual figures are artificially boosted by “base effects” because current readings are being compared with those from mid-2020, when the economic hit from the pandemic was at its worst. This is compounded by a “compositional effect”: low-paid workers were the most likely to lose their jobs during the recession, meaning that average wages for those still in work increased automatically, even without anyone being paid more. Underlying growth, therefore, is surely weaker than the headline measures. Data from Indeed, an online-recruitment company, show that wages on advertisements posted on its website rose by an average of just 0.8% between February and July, not accounting for inflation.
In fact, the best period for real wages may already be past. The annual rate of inflation was 3% in August, up from 2.1% in July. Analysts now expect an annual pace of over 4% by the end of autumn, driven by surging energy prices and disrupted supply chains. Higher prices will eat into real wage growth. Meanwhile, underlying wage growth may also be set to slow. The government furlough scheme, which covered part or all of the wages of workers temporarily sent home, closed last month. More than a million people were still on the scheme at the start of September, and many will now be seeking work. Increased slack in the jobs market should restrain pay growth in the months ahead.
Despite rising energy bills, empty petrol stations and supermarket shortages, the Conservatives have enjoyed an upbeat party conference. They have sought to turn a crisis into an opportunity by recasting a shortage of drivers for heavy-goods vehicles as an omen of good things to come for all workers. For the moment, this seems to be working, with the government maintaining a decent lead in the polls. But the opposition Labour Party is beginning to spy an opportunity. One shadow cabinet member riffed off Mr Johnson’s former career as a journalist, dubbing his approach as “government by newspaper column”. The prime minister may have marshalled the facts to present a plausible story. But as households feel the squeeze, they may start to doubt its conclusion. ■",2
1863,"The Remembrance Sunday bomb was packed with shrapnel and could have caused many casualties had it exploded properly, sources said yesterday.
Emad Al Swealmeen loaded the homemade device with nails and bolts – but it failed to fully detonate when it went off in a taxi outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital just before 11am on Sunday.
Experts believe if it had functioned as intended, metal fragments would have been flung in all directions, shredding the car and cutting down passers-by.
Forensic tests are expected to reveal why it failed.
The taxi’s driver David Perry is thought to have escaped serious injury because the blast was largely confined to the back seat before the vehicle erupted in flames.
Yesterday it emerged that Al Swealmeen, 32, had spent months trawling the internet to buy chemicals and metal components in small quantities to avoid detection.
The failed asylum seeker, who arrived in Britain from Iraq, is said to have had online shopping packages constantly arriving at his rented flat in Liverpool.
Officers have recovered traces of chemicals from the bomb factory indicating that he experimented with various explosives.
One of the recipes he is understood to have followed was for hexamethylene triperoxide diamine – the same material used by the July 7 2005 London bombers.
In previous terror attacks such as the Manchester Arena bombing and the Parsons Green tube explosion, key ingredients were bought on Amazon.
Yesterday, the company said it was checking to see if Al Swealmeen had bought chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide.
An Amazon spokesman said: ‘We only sell products that comply with UK laws. In addition, we also continue to work closely with police and law enforcement agencies.’
The motive for the attack remains unclear because officers have yet to access the bomber’s computers.
Al Swealmeen had converted to Christianity in Liverpool Cathedral and attended services in the suburb of Fazakerley until 2019. But he later dropped out of sight, according to the leaders of his local church.
Yesterday there were reports suggesting that he had regularly attended a local mosque.
Far-Right extremism has for the first time overtaken Islamism as the main reason for referrals to the Government’s anti-radicalisation programme Prevent, say official figures.
It was behind 1,229 referrals, about a quarter of the 4,915 made from April 2020 to March this year.
There were 1,064 about Islamism – 22 per cent. Most of the rest were for individuals with mixed, unstable or unclear ideologies.
The impact of coronavirus curbs led to a 22 per cent drop in referrals to Prevent, the first since records began in 2016. Under-20s account for 48 per cent of cases – and men for 88 per cent.",-2
1864,"REFRIGERATORS AND air-conditioners are old and clunky technology, and represent a field ripe for disruption. They consume a lot of electricity. And they generally rely on chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons which, if they leak into the atmosphere, have a potent greenhouse-warming effect. Buildings’ central-heating systems, meanwhile, are often powered by methane in the form of natural gas, which releases carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas, when it is burned, and also has a tendency to leak from the pipes that deliver it—which is unfortunate, because methane, too, is a greenhouse gas, and one much more potent than CO2.
One potential way of getting around all this might be to exploit what is known as the thermoelectric effect, a means of carrying heat from place to place as an electric current. Thermoelectric circuits can be used either to cool things down, or to heat them up. And a firm called Phononic, based in Durham, North Carolina, has developed a chip which does just that.

The thermoelectric effect was discovered in 1834 by Jean Charles Peltier, a French physicist. It happens in an electrical circuit that includes two materials of different conductivity. A flow of electrons from the more conductive to the less conductive causes cooling. A flow in the other direction causes heating.

The reason for this is that electrons are able to vibrate more freely when pushed into a conductive material. They thereby transfer energy to their surroundings, warming them. When shunted into a less conductive one, electrons’ vibrations are constrained, and they absorb energy from their surroundings, cooling those surroundings down. An array of thermoelectric circuits built with all the high-conductivity materials facing in one direction and all the low conductivity ones in the other can thus move heat in either direction, by switching the polarity of the current. For reasons buried in the mathematics of quantum physics, the heat thus flowing does so in discrete packages, called phonons. Hence the name of the firm.
The thermoelectric effect works best when the conductors involved are actually semiconductors, with bismuth and tin being common choices. Fancy cameras contain simple cooling chips which use these, as do some scientific instruments. But Phononic’s boss, Tony Atti, thinks that is small beer. Using the good offices of Fabrinet, a chipmaker in Thailand, he has started making more sophisticated versions at high volume, using the set of tools and techniques normally employed to etch information-processing circuits onto wafers made of silicon. In this case, though, the wafers are made of bismuth.
The results are, admittedly, still a long way from something that could heat or cool a building. But they are already finding lucrative employment in applications where space is at a premium. At the moment, the fastest-growing market is cooling the infrared lasers used to fire information-encoding photons through fibre-optic cables, for the long-distance transmission of data. They are also being used, though, in the 5G mobile-phone base stations now starting to blanket street corners, to keep the batteries of electric vehicles at optimal operating temperatures, and as components of the optical-frequency radar-like systems known as LIDAR, that help guide autonomous vehicles.
The crucial question from Mr Atti’s point of view is whether semiconductor-based thermoelectronics can break out of these niches and become more mainstream, in the way that semiconductor-based electronics and lighting have done. In particular, he would like to incorporate heat-pumping chips into buildings, to provide them with integral thermoregulation.
In their current form, thermoelectric chips are unlikely to replace conventional air conditioning and central heating because they cannot move heat over the distances required to pump it in and out of a building in bulk. But they could nonetheless be used as regulators. Instead of turning a big air-conditioning system on or off, to lower or raise the temperature by the small amounts required to maintain comfort, with all the cost that entails, thermoelectric chips might tweak matters by moving heat around locally.
Phononic has already run trials of such local-temperature-tweaking chips in Singapore, in partnership with Temasek, that country’s state-run investment fund. In 2019 SP Group, Singapore’s utility company, installed eight of the firm’s heat pumps, which comprise an array of chips pointed down at people, pumping heat out of the air above them, on the boardwalk on Clarke Quay in the city. Phononic claims the devices lowered the temperature in their vicinity by up to 10°C and, as a bonus, consequently reduced humidity by 15%. If that can be scaled up, it would certainly be a cool result. ■",2
1865,"Civil rights activist and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has called Kyle Rittenhouse a 'white supremacist' after the 18-year-old was found not guilty at his murder trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Friday.
'We just witnessed a system built on white supremacy validate the terroristic acts of a white supremacist,' Kaepernick tweeted after the verdict was revealed. 'This only further validates the need to abolish our current system. White supremacy cannot be reformed.'
Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges after pleading self-defense in the deadly Kenosha shootings that became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the US. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26 were shot dead and a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, was wounded by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020, during protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of African-American man Jacob Blake. 
The verdict in the politically combustible case was met with anger and disappointment from those who saw Rittenhouse as a vigilante and a wannabe cop, and relief and vindication from those who regarded him as a patriot who wanted to stop lawlessness and exercised his Second Amendment right to carry a gun and to defend himself.
Kaepernick was not the only athlete to condemn the verdict.
Robert Griffin III, another free agent quarterback, referenced the case of Julius Jones, whose death sentence for murder was commuted in Oklahoma this week. Jones, an African-American inmate, was scheduled to be killed on Thursday for the 1999 shooting death of Paul Howell. His sentence was commuted to life in prison, although many still maintain that he has been falsely accused.
'Kyle Rittennhouse can kill without a sliver of doubt & walk free but Julius Jones is in jail for life without the chance for parole after being on death row for 20 years with all types of doubt in his case,' Griffin tweeted. 'What is Justice? God help us.' 
Chiney Ogwumike, a star player for the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, called on social justice advocates to continue to protest: 'Yet again, a necessary reminder that social justice is not a moment, it is a movement.'  
African-American NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace also weighed in: 'Ha, let the boy be black and it would've been life…hell he would've had his life taken before the bulls*** trial.. sad'
Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant wrote that he was 'not surprised at all.'
Kaepernick has been the face of athlete activism since 2016, when he famously began protesting racism and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games.
He has remained a free agent since March of 2017, sparking accusations that the NFL has colluded to blackball Kaepernick, who has since settled a grievance with the league for an undisclosed amount.
The former University of Nevada star continues to train in hope making a comeback.
Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering for killing two men and wounding a third with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle in the summer of 2020 during a tumultuous night of protests over the shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake, by a white Kenosha police officer. 
Rittenhouse, a then-17-year-old former police youth cadet, said he went to Kenosha to protect property from rioters. He is white, as were those he shot.
The anonymous jury, whose racial makeup was not disclosed by the court but appeared to be overwhelmingly white, deliberated for close to 3 1/2 days.
Rittenhouse could have gotten life in prison if found guilty on the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide, or what some other states call first-degree murder. Two other charges each carried over 60 years behind bars.
Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said his office respects the jury's decision, and he asked the public to 'accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.'",-2
1866,"“CALIFORNIA HAS always been a place for people with big ambitions and big dreams…We are proud to call California our home.” It is unclear why Tim Cook, Apple’s boss, prefaced the launch of the iPhone 13 on September 14th with a serenade to the Golden State. It was certainly not a reaction to the ruling handed down days earlier by federal judge there, Yvonne González Rogers. Her decision in a lawsuit brought against Apple by Epic Games, which owns “Fortnite”, a popular video game, will make Mr Cook’s life tougher.
On a skim of the 185-page decision, Apple can claim to be the winner. Broadly speaking, Epic had accused the iPhone-maker of abusing a monopoly over its App Store by, among other things, forcing developers to use Apple’s in-app payment system and to pay excessive commissions of up to 30%. Not so, the judge argued. In her view, the relevant market is not the iPhone or the App Store, but “digital mobile gaming transactions”, where Apple competes with Google’s Android operating system. Although Apple controls more than half of this market, that does not amount to wrongdoing. “Success is not illegal,” Ms González Rogers wrote, adding that no evidence was presented to suggest that Apple erected barriers to entry or engaged in conduct decreasing output or innovation.

Tim Sweeney, Epic’s boss, did not hide his disappointment. “Today’s ruling isn’t a win for developers or for consumers,” he tweeted, and vowed to fight on “for fair competition…for a billion consumers”. Apple did not hold back its glee. In a statement, Kate Adams, Apple’s general counsel, called it “a resounding victory”. “We’re extremely pleased with this decision.”
On closer inspection, the bag begins to look decidedly mixed for the tech giant. The court did not say it is impossible to show that Apple is an illegal monopolist—only that Epic had failed to do so. The judge also found that, contrary to Apple’s protestations, the App Store’s operating margins, which one of Epic’s expert witnesses put at 75%, are “extraordinarily high”.
Most important, Ms González Rogers ruled that although Apple did not violate federal antitrust law, it had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under California’s competition law. It did so by banning developers from including information in their apps that tells users how they can subscribe or buy digital wares outside the App Store. Such “anti-steering” provisions, the judge said, “hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice”.

The decision will take effect in 90 days, though Epic has already appealed and Apple may do so, too. The case could end up in America’s Supreme Court. Whatever its final outcome, it will pile more pressure onto Apple to loosen its tight control of the App Store. This could lower its margins and weaken Apple’s services business, which analysts expect to be a big source of growth and profits. Apple’s share price fell by more than 3% after the verdict was handed down, lopping $85bn off its market capitalisation, three times unlisted Epic’s private valuation.
Perhaps in anticipation of the verdict, Apple has recently made some concessions. On August 26th, in a settlement with app developers, it agreed to allow them to email users about payment methods outside the App Store. On September 2nd, in another settlement, this time with Japan’s Fair Trade Commission, it consented to letting apps that provide access to digital content, such as books and music, direct users to other ways to pay.
Apple will also have to comply with a new South Korean law banning app stores, including its own and Google’s, from requiring users to pay using the stores’ payment systems. The European Union and even America’s polarised Congress have similar laws in the works. Apple may, just about, be able to claim a victory in the courtroom battle against Epic. But the drawn-out regulatory world war is far from over. ■

1867,"JUST UNDER one year has passed since Suga Yoshihide became Japan’s prime minister. It was enough time for him to lose the confidence of both the public and his colleagues in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). On September 3rd he bowed out of the LDP leadership race that will take place later this month; his replacement will immediately become prime minister. Despite his flailing approval ratings, Mr Suga’s decision caught allies and critics alike by surprise. It seems to have been precipitated by two crucial missteps in the past week—threats to reshuffle the LDP’s leadership and to dissolve the Diet ahead of schedule—that left him too isolated within the party to continue. His departure leaves the LDP leadership race—and, by extension, Japan’s political future—in flux.
The LDP will vote for a new president on September 29th. The winner will lead the party in lower-house elections that must be held by late November. A handful of potential contenders stand out. Kishida Fumio, a former foreign minister, had already declared his intention to run against Mr Suga. He has good relationships within the party, but limited popular support. Kono Taro, a former foreign and defence minister and the current vaccine czar, now seems likely to enter the race too. Mr Kono, who is American-educated, social-media savvy, and, at 58, on the younger side by Japanese standards, has long been a public favourite, but his reputation as a maverick puts off many in the LDP’s old guard.

Ishiba Shigeru, another former defence minister, may enter the fray as well. He too has sizable public support but little amongst colleagues, and has failed to break through in previous LDP elections. Seiko Noda and Takaichi Sanae, two former internal-affairs ministers, both hope to become Japan’s first female prime minister, but may struggle to secure the backing of 20 lawmakers that they need to run. Some whisper that Abe Shinzo, who preceded Mr Suga as prime minister, may mount another comeback, though that seems unlikely given lingering concerns about the scandals and health issues that begat his resignation last year.
None of the main candidates represents radical change in policy terms. All are staunch supporters of the alliance with America, and favour shoring up Japan’s own defences in the face of Chinese expansionism. No one will move to reverse the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy or to impose fiscal austerity. Yet there are subtle differences. Mr Kishida favours more fiscal stimulus and more support for the economically vulnerable than Mr Suga did; he has pledged a big economic stimulus package to counteract the pandemic. Mr Kono has taken some heterodox stances in the past, such as phasing out the use of nuclear power, and would probably put more political capital into Japan’s shift toward renewable energy in the pursuit of carbon neutrality. Mr Ishiba might focus more on measures to revive Japan’s rural regions. Ms Takaichi has positioned herself as a face of the party’s right wing, taking up the cause of revising Japan’s post-war constitution.
As ever when it comes to LDP politics, the contest hinges mostly on personalities and internal power games. The main fault lines this time are stylistic and generational. In many ways, the choice is shaping up to be one between a predictable, old-style party man, such as Mr Kishida, and a younger, more charismatic leader, such as Mr Kono. The outcome will depend on backroom wheeling-and-dealing and inter-factional horse-trading, but also on how worried the party leadership is about the looming Diet elections and how much influence younger backbenchers can exert. Before Mr Abe’s eight-year-long premiership, Japan had cycled through six prime ministers in six years (including Mr Abe’s own failed first term in 2007). There is a risk that Mr Suga’s resignation will precipitate a similar spell of turmoil at the top of Japanese politics. But it may also open the door to a new era. The only certainty is that Japan has entered a period of uncertainty.",2
1868,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - CoreSite Realty Corp (COR.N), a U.S. data center operator with a market value of more than $8 billion, is working with an investment bank to explore its options after attracting acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said.
CoreSite has been approached by companies that include American Tower Corp (AMT.N) and Digital Realty Trust Corp (DLR.N), as well as private equity firms, the sources said.
There is no certainty that CoreSite will successfully negotiate a deal with any party, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
CoreSite and American Tower did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Digital Realty declined to comment.
CoreSite shares jumped as much as 8.6% on the news.
Based in Denver, CoreSite has more than 25 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started off as a company of private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and became publicly listed a decade ago.
CoreSite shares are up 28% year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 Index, as remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for more processing power and data storage in corporate networks.
CyrusOne Inc (CONE.O), a U.S. data center operator with a market capitalization of about $10 billion, has also been exploring strategic alternatives that include a potential sale of the company, Reuters reported in September.  read more ",3
1869,"A PILE OF fake corpses littered the heart of Bangkok. The bodies—white sacks stuffed with hay and spattered with red paint—symbolised Thai victims of covid-19. “They’re dead because of the failure of this government,” a protester bellowed into a megaphone. To underscore the point, protesters had laid the “corpses” across a giant portrait of the prime minister, which they then set ablaze.
In many countries around the world, from Brazil to Belarus, the pandemic is stirring unrest. People are angry about the economic hardships they face. They have seen how the rich and well-connected go to the front of the queue for vaccinations, medical treatment and government help. They are angry that their leaders have not done a better job of containing the coronavirus. At the same time, people’s suffering has created a sense of solidarity which is fanning grievances that smouldered long before anyone had heard of covid-19.

Thailand’s protests flared up on July 18th as the Delta variant was running amok, leading to the country’s worst wave of covid-19 so far. Hospitals are swamped. Just 5% of the Thai population is fully vaccinated. Thais had hoped for a swift economic rebound, after GDP shrank by 6.1% in 2020, but that now seems unlikely. The Bank of Thailand recently reduced its growth forecast for 2021 from 3% to 1.8%.
Many Thais berate their government for failing to secure enough vaccines soon enough, or for reopening the country too quickly to foreign tourists, which they fear may have contributed to the current wave. Some grumble that the government has relied too much on Chinese-made vaccines rather than Pfizer’s or Moderna’s which they believe offer more protection.
Globally, you might expect covid-19 to make unrest less common. Before the pandemic, big protest movements had been increasing around the world, growing 2.5 times between 2011 and 2019, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), a think-tank in Sydney. However, dense crowds of angry people, all shouting slogans and spraying each other with spittle, could easily transmit the virus. Sure enough, in the early weeks of the pandemic the number of protests around the world dwindled in such places as India, Pakistan, Chile, Iraq and Nicaragua.
It didn’t last. Discontent has once again bubbled up in countries including Colombia, South Africa and Myanmar, even as the virus has continued to do its worst. In Tunisia this week, amid violent mass demonstrations which were sparked by the government’s mishandling of the pandemic, the president sacked the prime minister and suspended parliament.
The IEP found that in 2020, civil unrest rose by 10%. It counted 5,000 instances of pandemic-related violence in 158 countries. Violent demonstrations are more common than at any time since 2008. A broader measure that includes peaceful protests also rose, according to the Armed Conflict Location  Event Data Project, an NGO. In the year to March 1st 2021, ACLED logged 51,549 demonstrations or riots. Counting only countries surveyed in both years, it detected a significant increase.
In this, the pandemic looks as if it is following the pattern set by earlier outbreaks of infectious disease. In a paper published last year, Tahsin Saadi Sedik and Rui Xu of the IMF analysed data from 133 countries between 2001 and 2018 and found that social unrest starts to increase 12-14 months after the onset of an epidemic, such as Zika, a mosquito-borne virus, and peaks after two years. The covid-19 pandemic has been incomparably more severe and longer-lasting than those epidemics in almost every country. The disruption it causes could well be, too.
One direct cause of protests, the IMF data suggested, is economic hardship. A good example is Cuba, where a vast network of secret police and informers usually spot and crush dissidents before they cause trouble. Yet on July 11th thousands marched in more than 50 towns and cities, risking the dictatorship’s wrath to chant “freedom!” and overturn a few police cars. It was perhaps the biggest display of anti-government fury in Cuba in six decades.
Cubans are angry because the shops are empty, they have nothing for dinner, the electricity keeps failing and they are not allowed to vote out the people in charge. Covid-19 has aggravated these perennial grievances by devastating the Cuban economy. Tourists, the main source of hard currency, have stopped coming. GDP shrank by 10.9% in 2020 and slid further this year.
Nothing to lose but their groceries
The closure of Cuba’s borders to keep out the virus has cut connections with the capitalist world that made life more bearable. Everyday things like soap and coffee are usually brought in by relatives who made it abroad or by mules who travel to places like Panama, Mexico, Russia or Miami to buy supplies and resell them on the black market. The severing of this supply chain has stoked inflation, lengthened queues and reminded Cubans of how poorly the government caters for their basic needs.
The collapse of tourism has had knock-on effects on the health system. Without the dollars holidaymakers used to splurge on hotel rooms and rum cocktails, the government is struggling to buy the ingredients it needs to make drugs. Painkillers, antibiotics, insulin, asthma medicine and diagnostic tests have become scarce, so people with easily treatable illnesses are forced to suffer. Good medical care is supposed to be one of the pillars of the revolution. “Many people in Cuba were once content to accept that, while they might never be able to take an extravagant holiday, they at least had the guarantee of good health care,” says a Cuban doctor.
Pandemic-aggravated unrest strikes rich and poor countries alike, but middle-income countries are most vulnerable both to the disease and its social effects. Rich countries are protected by vaccination—even if some of their citizens hesitate to be jabbed. In the poorest places, the coronavirus is one burden among many, states are often too weak to enforce lockdowns, and the population’s youth offers a high degree of protection from covid-19.

In middle-income countries, by contrast, vaccination is patchy and lockdowns are common (see charts). Many of their people are old enough and fat enough to be especially vulnerable to the virus. What’s more, people in middle-income countries have expectations of their governments.

Too often, as in South Africa, those expectations have been dashed. The protests there earlier this month were stirred up at first by supporters of a justly jailed ex-president, Jacob Zuma, in an attempt to secure his release. But one of the reasons they snowballed into mass looting and the burning of shops and businesses was that so many South Africans are poor, jobless and furious about the corruption and rotten government that keeps them that way.
Covid-19 has put all of that on display. Lockdowns have been exceptionally tough, and many South Africans find the rules irksome. A spray-painted slogan on a looted shop in Edendale, in KwaZulu-Natal, the worst-hit of South Africa’s nine provinces in the riots, read “Level 4 to hell”—a reference to the country’s second-highest level of pandemic alert, during which the government imposes “extreme precautions”.
A short-lived ban on buying open-toed sandals was baffling. Periodic bans on the sale of alcohol struck many as unfair. Rich people with wine cellars have carried on tippling behind their high walls, but the poor have been deprived of one of life’s pleasures, and harassed by police when they indulge. During the riots, liquor stores were among the first to be looted.
When covid-19 hit, “everything came to a stop; my business couldn't function,” says Patrick Dlamini, who fixes cars, which fewer people are driving because of covid-related curfews, and recycles bottles, which fewer people are draining because of the booze ban. “There’s no money,” he frets. The looting, he reckons, was caused by “a combination of Zuma and covid”.
The tensions in South Africa have been aggravated by inequality. Pandemics expose the gulf between the haves and have-nots. What is more, the IMF’s analysis shows that when pandemics impose economic hardship, the burden falls most heavily on the poor. At a time when everyone should be in it together, it rankles when ordinary people see how the privileged both escape hardship and enjoy special treatment into the bargain. It brings the angry into the streets.
Colombia shows how the sense of injustice can overwhelm the government’s efforts to help. One of the world’s most unequal places, it has also spent longer under lockdown than most countries. GDP dropped by 6.8% in 2020 and 2.8m people fell into destitution. A decade of progress in eradicating poverty was wiped out. The pain was shared unequally. Youth unemployment from May to July last year was 30%, compared with overall unemployment of 20%, and 12 percentage points higher than it had been a year earlier. In a place where half of the economy is off the books, informal workers had nothing to fall back on.
Sorry isn’t good enough
The government tried to make amends. It introduced a fund called Ingreso Solidario to help the poor survive during lockdowns, but many families still did not have enough money to get by. In April this year it introduced a tax reform that set out to redistribute money to the poorest half of Colombians, partly by eliminating VAT exemptions that help the rich and widening the net of income tax.
But Colombians, struggling to cope with the pandemic, assumed that the reform would load them up with more taxes. Coming at the start of April, just as the disease was mounting and most cities were reimposing lockdowns, the tax bill brought people onto the streets—especially the jobless young. Over several days in May, protesters manned barricades, attacked police stations and looted businesses in Cali, the country’s third-largest city.
Once protests have started to take hold, more tend to follow. Again, hardship is a factor. A paper published in May by Metodij Hadzi-Vaskov, Samuel Pienknagura and Luca Antonio Ricci, of the IMF, analysed an index of social upheaval in 130 countries. It concluded that unrest is followed by a fall in economic output of 0.2 percentage points after 18 months—and that the effect in emerging markets is twice that in advanced economies.
What’s more, the very act of protesting can generate a sense of solidarity. In Belarus, for example, the coronavirus inspired people to stand up to the regime. They got a taste for rebellion. The spark came in the spring of 2020 when Alexander Lukashenko, the country’s despotic leader, dismissed covid-19 as a “mass psychosis” and blamed his citizens for dying of it. The EU’s members advised citizens to stay at home and offered financial help. Mr Lukashenko told his to have a shot of liquor, indulge in a banya (steam bath) and ride a tractor.
Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, likes to portray himself as the father of the nation. He has boasted about the country’s broad system of social support, which harks back to the Soviet Union. When he stumbled over covid-19 Belarusian activists sensed a rare opening.
A team of IT specialists launched #ByCovid19, a social-media movement that stepped into the void left by the state. In a few weeks it attracted hundreds of thousands of volunteers across the country and supplied personal-protection gear for doctors and machinery for hospitals. Andrei Strizhak, one of its founders, says that it proved to Belarusians that they could act together. After Mr Lukashenko rigged an election in August, they did just that by taking to the streets in huge numbers.
Something similar may be starting in Brazil. Early in the pandemic, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro dominated the streets. Unmasked and dressed in green and yellow, thousands of bolsonaristas gathered roughly every two weeks to back the president’s denouncement of governors’ lockdowns. In August 2020, 37% of Brazilians approved of Mr Bolsonaro, according to Datafolha, a pollster, partly because the government was paying 600 reais ($110) per month in emergency aid to a third of the population.

Today the emergency aid has been slashed and big crowds are calling for his impeachment. In May a senate inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic revealed that Mr Bolsonaro had rebuffed offers to buy vaccines last year, and later ignored possible corruption. One in seven Brazilians is out of work and one in ten is going hungry. In recent polls less than 30% of Brazilians backed the president and a record 51% disapproved of his government.
Three times in just over a month starting in late May, all the states of the country were protesting at once, uniting thousands of people in many cities. Former allies of Mr Bolsonaro have joined the marches, spurred on by the death toll from covid-19, currently at more than 550,000. “The glass is almost full,” says Creomar de Souza of Dharma, a Brasília-based consultancy. “We will see what is the last drop that might make it overflow.”
Plenty of countries have avoided covid-related protests. India has been relatively quiet, in spite of its government’s mistakes. So has Malaysia, which coped well with covid-19 in 2020. But in these places, too, discontent is stirring. Critics of the Modi government in India have become louder, and now include fellow-travellers from his own Hindu-nationalist power-base. One example is the formation of a group of retired senior civil servants—some of them once very high-powered—that has taken to berating the government.
In recent weeks Malaysia has suffered a wave of infections, taking the total to over 1m. Poor ethnic Malays, unprotected by the country’s patchy social safety-net, have watched ministers and the business elites flout health rules that carry swingeing penalties for ordinary offenders. The factories of well-connected owners have been allowed to continue to operate—despite being superspreading venues for employees. Around 18% of the population have secured a jab, but among the well-connected the share is much higher.
Households have taken to hanging white flags from their windows as a call for help. Increasingly, black flags flutter beside them, hoisted mainly by younger, educated Malaysians signalling frustration at the government’s mistakes. The black-flag, or Bendera Hitam, movement has unnerved the authorities, who are probing it for evidence of sedition. Bridget Welsh of the University of Nottingham, Malaysia thinks this wider mobilisation highlights how a country proud to consider itself uniformly middle-class is in reality a country of haves and have-nots.
It ain’t over ’til it’s over
The pandemic is far from over. Covax, the global vaccine-sharing initiative, aims to provide developing countries with enough jabs to inoculate a fifth of their populations by the end of 2021, but that target is very unlikely to be met. So far, almost 4bn doses of vaccines have been put into arms. To get to 70% coverage, the world needs to give another 7bn—more, if booster shots are required. That is unlikely before 2022.
In the meantime, governments will attempt to control the disease with rules and regulations—including measures to restrict dissent. According to Freedom House, a watchdog, at least 158 out of 192 countries have placed new curbs on public protests. Some governments have done so impartially and temporarily, to protect public health. Others have seized on covid-19 as a pretext, locking up their opposition for supposedly violating social-distancing rules while letting the governing party hold huge rallies.
In the long run political repression is often a recipe for trouble. The pandemic suggests that people’s anger does not dissipate while they are cooped up indoors. It simmers like water in a saucepan, even as governments do their best to hold down the lid. In Thailand gatherings of more than five are banned, officially to reduce the spread of the virus. The protesters on July 18th were met with tear-gas and rubber bullets. But that only makes them angrier. “We just want to get vaccinated,” says one. “Covid-19 is breathing down our neck but the government is doing nothing at all.”

1870,"ON MAY 3RD a section of Mexico City’s metro collapsed into the street below. At least 25 people were killed; many more were injured. The accident occurred on Line 12, the newest part of the system, which has been plagued by problems since it opened in 2012. The political fallout could affect Claudia Sheinbaum, the mayor, and Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister, who was mayor during the construction of the line. Both are seen as potential successors to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.",2
1871,"THE LATEST news in the fight against covid-19 is encouraging. Two new antiviral drugs have been deemed so effective that clinical trials ended early. Data from these trials have not yet been published. However, regulators are moving swiftly to consider general use of the drugs. They will fill a large gap in the toolkit doctors are using to fight the virus, and could well help end the global pandemic.
The new drugs are molnupiravir (Lagevrio), developed by Merck, a pharmaceutical company, working with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, a biotech firm, and Paxlovid, which was developed by Pfizer. All three are American companies. Those most at risk from the serious effects of covid are far less likely to be hospitalised, or die, if they take a course of either of these pills in the five days after symptoms first appear.

Merck said in October that molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half, when given to patients with one risk factor for covid, such as obesity or heart disease. Regulators in America, Europe and at the World Health Organisation are assessing the drug. Britain has approved it and will start using the treatment next month. On November 5th Pfizer said its pill reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% if taken within three days. (In fact, during its trial no patient died at all when taking Paxlovid within five days of symptoms.)
Molnupiravir is what is known as a prodrug, which means that it is converted into its active form when it arrives inside cells. Once there, it is incorporated into the genetic material of the virus whereby it disrupts its ability to replicate. Errors accumulate in the virus’s genetic material, a process known as “error catastrophe”. Trials in animals have raised concerns that the drug might pose risks to unborn children, hence the British government has advised against its use during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding. Other regulators may issue similar warnings.
Paxlovid is in fact a combination of two drugs: an existing one called ritonavir, which is given alongside a novel protease inhibitor known asPF-07321332. The protease inhibitor was designed to bind and block the protease enzymes that SARS-COV-2 uses to replicate. Ritonavir prevents the protease inhibitor from being broken down too quickly in the body.
Molnupiravir and Paxlovid are also known as “small molecule” drugs. These are molecules that are easy to make. Both firms say the price of the drugs will vary according to the wealth of the nation buying them. That will likely mean that rich countries will pay $700 for a five-day course of pills, while poorer ones might pay around $20, and maybe less as the cost of manufacturing comes down.
Although both firms have said they intend to make these drugs widely accessible around the world, Merck already has an edge. It has signed a number of licences which allow other manufacturers to produce the drug, and it has reserved 3m doses for low- and middle-income countries. This is to ensure that rich countries do not monopolise the supply of the new medicines as they have done for vaccines. Merck expects to make 10m doses this year, and 20m next year. Generic manufacturers will make many more. Pfizer, which has not yet received any regulatory authorisations, expects 180,000 packs of pills to be produced by the end of this year, and 21m in the first half of 2022.
These drugs herald a second big turning point in the pandemic (the first being vaccines). Rising case numbers across Europe suggest there will be a strong demand for such medicines to keep people out of hospital. While patients wait for them to arrive, it is also possible that doctors might consider the use of fluvoxamine, an antidepressant medicine which also appears to lower the risks from covid.
As the new treatments roll out for use, there will be concern among some scientists and doctors about the virus developing resistance, particularly if patients do not complete their course. Keeping one step ahead of SARS-COV-2 will require planning for such an eventuality. That means deducing which antiviral drugs can be given in combinations to create a therapy that the virus will struggle to defeat. ■
