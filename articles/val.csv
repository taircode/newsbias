1497,"Left-leaning celebrities took to Twitter to voice their outrage over Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal on murder charges, with legendary performer Bette Midler calling it a ‘tragic day’ and others bemoaning a perceived miscarriage of justice.
Midler fumed at Friday’s verdict to her 2 million followers, saying: ‘#kylerittenhouse found not guilty tho we SAW HIM kill two.
‘Fundamentally stupid, I predict he will go on to a big career on #Fox and in #RadicalRightWing circles, which counts as a plus with them. A tragic, tragic day for decent, THINKING, feeling, ethical people everywhere.’
 Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted by jurors on all charges - two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety - after killing two people during protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.     
Donald Trump was one of the few voices in Rittenhouse's camp as he congratulated Rittenhouse, a supporter of the former president, for beating the rap.  
 'Congratulations to Kyle Rittenhouse for being found INNOCENT of all charges,' said Trump in an emailed statement.
‘It’s called being found NOT GUILTY - And by the way, if that’s not self defense, nothing is!' 
 However, his voice was drowned out by a slew of TV and movie stars expressing outrage over Rittenhouse’s vindication. 
Talk show house Andy Cohen summed up his thoughts in five words, tweeting: ‘What in the actual f***.’
Actress Sophia Bush – who is not related to the political dynasty – was as succinct.
‘No words,’ she tweeted to her 1.2 million followers. ‘Just fury.’
She included an illustration that depicted Rittenhouse bragging about the killings to his bar pals and later appearing to sob over his actions in court.
Actress Rosanna Arquette said the ruling prompted her to lose faith in the legal process.
‘I have no faith in the justice system In America today,’ she tweeted. ‘I don’t want to live in a country that is ruled by violent ignorant racists.’
Rittenhouse could be seen smiling in the backseat of an SUV as he was driven away from the Kenosha courthouse Friday afternoon after being cleared of all charges.
Rittenhouse faced life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge for using an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill two men - Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum - and wound a third, Gaige Grosskreutz.
Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, reacted to the verdict in a series of tweets.
‘I know so many are weary and tired,’ she tweeted. ‘But justice is not just about verdicts.
‘It is a continuum. We can galvanize around changing our culture, including challenging the difference in how a Black male teen would have been engaged in Kenosha.’
She later added: ‘I believe that it’s extremely important that we get back to the reason why people were even protesting in Kenosha - Police Brutality.’
Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly was one of the few luminaries that said the jury got it right.
‘Justice was done,’ she tweeted. ‘Kyle Rittenhouse was unfairly maligned by a dishonest press, and politicians who used him to advance their own fortunes.
‘If there are riots, these smear merchants will shoulder much of the blame.’  ",-2
1498,"As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
A SAGE adviser has moved to reassure Britons the UK will not see a spike in Covid-19 cases like Austria and Germany - but warned Europe's soaring infection rate and lockdown riots should act as a 'warning' as he urged people to get their booster jabs.  
Professor John Edmunds said today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'. 
'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmunds told Sky. 
This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections.
Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.
But Mr Edmunds said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position'.
This comes amid a fresh wave of Covid infections on the continent that has sent nations back into draconian restrictions and could see excess deaths start to rise again.
Italy is considering a lockdown of the unvaccinated, it emerged yesterday, which would make it the latest country to impose the controversial intervention after Austria announced lockdown would return on Monday.
And Germany's incoming government has said that it wants unvaccinated people to be barred from going to work and travelling on public transport amid what Angela Merkel calls 'dramatic' infection levels. The Netherlands has also introduced a 7pm curfew for pubs and restaurants amid rising cases there.
Both Austria and the Czech Republic have announced the return of lockdowns from Monday, with Germany poised to follow suit after health officials warned they cannot rule out a full shutdown. 
Meanwhile, Slovakia intends to bring in harsher restrictions if its current lockdown of unvaccinated people does not curb the rise in cases. 
The reintroduction of restrictions across Europe have sparked a fierce backlash and fevered protests broke out in cities including Rotterdam overnight, where riot police fired warning shots - injuring protestors marching against the Covid measures.
Today, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Vienna with the far-right opposition Freedom Party among those who have called for the protest and vowed to combat the new restrictions.
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy. 
The British Government has repeatedly rejected pleas to implement its Plan B, which would see similar measures to what are being levied on Ireland. But Boris Johnson has admitted a full-blown lockdown could still be on the cards if cases spike. 
The United Kingdom on Saturday recorded 40,941 daily COVID-19 cases, a decrease of seven percent on last week's cases, government data showed.
The figures also showed 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test - versus 157 seven days earlier - bringing the country's total deaths to 143,866. 
On a day of heightened tension across the continent; 
He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on.
'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane.
'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.'
Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmunds told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step.
'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.'
Last week the WHO warned the continent was now the epicentre of the pandemic and said the surge in infection was 'alarming'.
Speaking to the BBC, regional director Dr Hans Kluge predicted 500,000 more deaths could be recorded on the continent by March unless urgent action is taken. 
He said: 'Covid-19 has become once again the number one cause of mortality in our region.'
Dr Kluge said mandatory vaccination measures should be seen as a 'last resort', adding: 'Before that there are other means like the Covid pass.
He said this is 'not a restriction of liberty, rather it is a tool to keep our individual freedom', according to the BBC.
It comes as ten thousand people are expected to protest against Covid-19 restrictions in Vienna today after the Austrian government announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the rapidly rising coronavirus infections in the country.
Meanwhile, at least two people were shot and five others injured in Rotterdam last night as Dutch riot police opened fire on protesters as anti-lockdown demonstrations turned into an 'orgy of violence'.
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. 
The violent scenes came amid a rising anger at coronavirus measures across Europe, with Austria introducing a full lockdown from Monday, and German ministers not ruling out following its neighbour's lockdown lead. 
Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Austria on Friday became the first EU country to announce it would make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory and will next week impose a partial lockdown in the face of spiralling infections.
The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance.
Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said.
Schools will remain open, although parents have been asked to keep their children at home if possible. Working from home is also recommended.
Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. 
Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so.
But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people.
The Dutch government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 — that would exclude people who test negative. 
Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired.
'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she said. 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.' 
 Late on Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. Organisers of a planned protest Saturday in Amsterdam against the coronavirus measures said they had canceled the event after Friday's violence.   
A musical protest called by DJs in the southern city of Breda against current Covid-19 measures, which include the 8pm closure of bars, restaurants and clubs, will go ahead. Organisers say they expect several thousand people. 
The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, Britain's daily Covid cases rose by another 10 per cent yesterday and deaths ticked upwards — but hospitalisations plunged 17 per cent.
Government dashboard data showed 44,242 positive tests were registered in the last 24 hours yesterday, a slight uptick from 40,375 last Friday.
Infections trended upwards every day since November 11 except for one blip, with data suggesting cases are now rising in children following the return of schools from half-term.
Another 157 Covid deaths were also announced by health chiefs, in an eight per cent rise from the same time the previous week. Latest hospitalisation figures showed 827 admissions were recorded on November 15, which was down 17 per cent. 
Fears of another Christmas lockdown were sparked this week when Boris Johnson admitted that the drastic action was not completely off the cards at a Downing Street press conference. 
But the Prime Minister also said there was still nothing to suggest England needed to ramp up its Covid restrictions. 
He urged people to get their booster vaccines and warned of Europe's spiralling crisis, which saw Austria become the first country to impose another lockdown.
Prof Edmunds yesterday told BBC Radio 4's the World at One programme: 'I think there's a risk because of waning immunity in older individuals - and that's all adults, not just the elderly - that cases could really take off.
'It's really important that we boost immunity in older individuals and then we might be able to avoid any significant fourth wave.
'We're going to have high levels of infection for many months, so I think the NHS will unfortunately be under significant strain. It may not get to breaking point, where we were close to before, but significant strain for a very long period of time is certainly on the cards.'
As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
Violence today broke out in Vienna after 10,000 protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against a new Covid-19 lockdown and mandatory vaccinations. 
It comes after two people were shot and six others injured in Rotterdam last night after activists clashed with Dutch riot police in a demonstration condemned as an 'orgy of violence'. 
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy - the latest in rising anger at the re-introduction of restrictions amid soaring cases on the continent. 
Last week, the World Health Organisation warned Europe was the epicentre of the pandemic and said the rise in cases was 'alarming', nudging governments to reimpose measures ahead of the Christmas period.  
As the march kicked off on Vienna's Heldenplatz, thousands of protesters gathered on the massive square. About 1,300 police officers were on duty. They used loudspeakers to tell protesters masks were required, but most did not wear them.
Chanting 'resistance!' and blowing whistles, protesters began to move slowly down the city's inner ring road. Many waved Austrian flags and carried signs mocking government leaders like Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein.
Some wore doctor's scrubs; others donned tinfoil hats. Most of the signs focused on the newly announced vaccine mandate: 'My Body, My Choice,' read one. 'We're Standing Up for Our Kids!' said another.  
Police were pictured arrested two protesters but have not yet confirmed how many people have been detained at the Vienna demonstration. 
Last night, thousands of anti-lockdown protesters gathered in one of Rotterdam's main shopping streets last night, one week after the government imposed a partial shutdown.     
Dutch police fired water canons, 'warning shots' and bullets at protesters to disperse the crowd who had lit fires and set off fireworks. 
Police confirmed seven injuries, including officers, in the violence but did not say if live ammunition or rubber bullets were fired.
The Netherlands re-imposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of coronavirus contagion, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. 
The Dutch government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 — that would exclude people who test negative.   
The violent scenes in Rotterdam mirror much of the continent's reaction to similar schemes announced by Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia - with Italy and Greece also reportedly considering moves to restrict the movements of unvaccinated people.  

Austria on Friday became the first EU country to announce it would make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory and will next week impose a partial lockdown in the face of spiralling infections.
The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance.
Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said. 
Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate.
The World Health Organization continues to favour policies that 'demonstrate the benefit and safety of vaccines for the greatest possible acceptance of vaccines, rather than imposed mandatory vaccination,' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters in Geneva. 
Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so.
But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people.

Austrians are protesting against a new national lockdown and mandatory vaccinations, which the government said yesterday would be rolled out on February 1.   
Vaccinations in Austria have plateaued at one of the lowest rates in Western Europe - under 66 per cent - and hospitals in heavily hit states have warned that their intensive care units are reaching capacity.  
Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said yesterday the country would go in lockdown for 10 days. 
The shutdown will then reevaluated and could be extended for a further 10 days.  
Most stores will close, and cultural events will be canceled. 
People will be able to leave their homes only for certain specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. 
Average daily deaths have tripled in recent weeks and its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people. 
'We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,' Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference.
'It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.'
Schallenberg also apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday night saying it was not fair they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions when they had done everything to help contain the virus.
'I'm sorry to take this drastic step,' he said on public broadcaster ORF. 
Meanwhile organisers of a planned protest Saturday in Amsterdam against the coronavirus measures said they had canceled the event after Friday's violence. 
A musical protest called by DJs in the southern city of Breda against current Covid-19 measures, which include the 8 pm closure of bars, restaurants and clubs, will go ahead. 
Organisers say they expect several thousand people to attend.  
Coronavirus infection rates in the Czech Republic have hit a new record for the second time this week, the Health Ministry said.
It announced that the daily tally jumped to 22,936 on Friday, almost 500 more than the previous record set on Tuesday.
The country's infection rate has risen to 929 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days.
In a worrying sign, 110 people died on Thursday, the ministry said, with the daily death toll surpassing 100 for the first time since April.
The government has approved new restrictions to tackle the surge, targeting the unvaccinated in an effort to increase a vaccination rate that is below the European Union average.
Starting on Monday, most unvaccinated people will no longer be allowed to show negative coronavirus tests in order to attend public events, go to bars and restaurants, visit hairdressers, museums and similar facilities or use hotels.
Only people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 will remain eligible. Overall, the nation of 10.7 million has registered almost two million cases with 32,005 deaths.
 

Footage from the Rotterdam violence showed burnt out police cars and rioters throwing fireworks and rocks at police, while photos in Dutch media showed at least one police car ablaze and another with a bicycle smashed through the windshield.
Local news outlet NL Times reported that a journalist was attacked of the street, while local broadcaster Rijnmond said the reporter was beaten and his camera was destroyed. Local media also reported gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. 
One eyewitness - a press photographer – told local media they saw shell casings 'everywhere on the floor'. 
Cops also said it was 'unclear how or by whom' two people were shot during the chaos. Video from social media on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show the person being hit in Rotterdam, but there was no explanation on what happened. 
Officers arrested dozens of protesters last night and were expected to detain several more after studying video footage from security cameras.  
Late on Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets. 
Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that 'on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves' as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers.
'They shot at protesters, people were injured,' Aboutaleb said, adding that several officers were injured in the violence.
Police spokesperson Patricia Wessels confirmed that police fired shots, though it was not immediately clear what type of rounds were fired.
'We fired warning shots and there were also direct shots fired because the situation was life-threatening,' she said. 'We know that at least two people were wounded, probably as a result of the warning shots, but we need to investigate the exact causes further.' 
Police said that riot police later launched charges at the demonstrators, adding: 'The water launcher has been deployed.' 
The situation had largely calmed late on Friday but the smoking wreckage of a burned-out police car and dozens of smashed bicycles littered the scene, an AFP reporter said.
Riot police carrying shields and batons were directing groups of people away from the area. Officers on horseback and in police vans patrolled the streets.
Police also cordoned off several scenes to comb for evidence, with a human finger visible on the ground at one of them, the AFP correspondent said.
'Most of the demonstrators are now gone. There only remain a few groups in a few places,' police spokesman Jesse Brobbel told AFP. 
A SAGE adviser has moved to reassure Britons the UK will not see a spike in Covid-19 cases like Austria and Germany - but warned Europe's lockdown riots should act as a 'warning' and urged people to get their booster jabs.  
Professor John Edmund said today that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'.    
'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmund told Sky.

'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.'

Dutch justice minister Ferd Grapperhaus said in a statement that the 'extreme violence' against police and fire fighters in Rotterdam was 'repulsive'.
'The right to protest is very important in our society but what we saw last night was simply criminal behaviour,' Grapperhaus said.  
Dutch police said units from around the country were brought in to 'restore order' to Rotterdam.
'Dozens of arrests have now been made, it is expected that more arrests will follow. Around seven people have been injured, including on the side of the police,' a police statement said.  
At least one police car was set on fire during the protest, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP. The spokesperson could not confirm the number of people injured. 
Several electric scooters and other items were also torched, with several hundred protesters involved in the riots, images on Dutch media and social media showed. 
Local authorities issued an emergency order banning people from gathering in the area in a bid to prevent further violence, and the authorities also called on bystanders and people who recorded images of the riots to send the footage to police for further investigation.
Police tweeted that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city's main railway station.  
The several hundred people had gathered to voice opposition to government plans to restrict access to indoor venues to people who have a 'corona pass' showing they have been vaccinated or already recovered from an infection.
The pass is also available to people who have not been vaccinated, but have proof of a negative test. 
'This is a very serious situation which requires action with the highest priority,' said the emergency order by the Rotterdam municipality. 'It is therefore necessary to issue this emergency order so as to maintain public order and to protect the safety of persons.' 
Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet. 'The centre of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,' it said. 'Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.' 
Like much of the rest of Europe, the Netherlands has seen Covid cases soar to record levels in recent days, with more than 21,000 new infections reported on Friday.
The latest restrictions were announced on November 12, and sparked clashes between demonstrators and police outside the justice ministry in The Hague. 
The restrictions came into force the following day, shuttering bars, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets at 8:00 pm daily, while non-essential shops must shut at 6:00 pm.
People are limited to having four visitors at home and have been advised to work at home unless absolutely necessary. Public events have been scrapped while football matches must be played behind closed doors. 
Schools however remain open, and people are allowed to leave their homes without restrictions. The Dutch government has said it will review the situation on December 3.
It is considering excluding the unvaccinated from bars and restaurants, limiting admittance to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the disease, but there was significant opposition to the plan during a debate in parliament this week. 
The Netherlands suffered its worst riots in four decades in January after a night-time Covid curfew, the country's first since World War II, came into force. 
Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended 'to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,' the government said Friday. 
The riots in Rotterdam come after Austria said on Friday that it will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown, while neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout. 
Restrictions have also been placed on the unvaccinated in Germany – where they have been banned from restaurants – as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  
The German states of Bavaria and Saxony on Friday cancelled all their Christmas markets and unveiled drastic curbs on public life as the country scrambles to contain soaring coronavirus infections.
'The situation is very, very serious and difficult,' Markus Soeder, premier of the southern state of Bavaria, said as he also announced a shutdown of clubs, bars and night service at restaurants.
The eastern state of Saxony unveiled similar measures and went even further by closing all sporting and cultural venues, banning tourism, public consumption of alcohol and barring the unvaccinated from non-essential shops and hairdressers.
Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer - whose state has Germany's lowest vaccination rate at just under 60 percent of the population - admitted that many of the restrictions would affect the vaccinated as well.
But he said tough action was needed to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and called for 'solidarity' from all citizens. 'We need more 'we' and less 'I' in this pandemic,' he told reporters.
Bavaria and Saxony are among the hardest hit regions in the ferocious fourth Covid wave sweeping Germany. 
Reporting by AFP 
Following the announcement, Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with the inscription: 'As of today Austria is a dictatorship.' 
The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days.
Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths, the WHO said. 
A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said, warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers. 
Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament.  
Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: 'We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out. 'We are in a national emergency,' he told a news conference.  
Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar.
'We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,' Oxford Economics analysts said in a note.
'And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.' 
As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. 
The country- which dodged a lockdown unlike most other nations -  also has next to no Covid restrictions in place.
It dropped its final measures recommending people to work from home where possible on September 29.
And advice for people to wear face masks on public transport was abandoned on July. Unlike in other countries the coverings were never compulsory.
On November 11 Swedish health authorities went even further telling double-vaccinated people they no longer needed to swab themselves for the virus.
But this move has now been reversed after critics said it left the country in a dangerous position just before winter. 
Some travel restrictions are still in place for people coming to the country from non-EU nations and Britain.
All arrivals are required to show a certificate they have been double-vaccinated.
When this is not possible they are asked to show a negative Covid test result from to come to the country from non-EU countries.
All arrivals are also required to prove they up to 48 hours before they travelled. 
Sweden will impose further restrictions from December 1 requiring everyone attending events of more than 100 people to show proof they are double-vaccinated.
Officials have warned more Covid restrictions may be needed this winter.  
Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available.
Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets.
The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony's cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. 
Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets.
In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers' industry association.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns.
Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. 
While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts say they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas.
A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however.
'With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,' said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
'Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.' The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn said, urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. 
'How Christmas will turn out, I dare not say. I can only say it's up to us,' he added.
The European Union's drug regulator has issued advice on using Merck's COVID-19 pill for adults and began a review of a rival tablet from Pfizer to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval.
In two separate statements on Friday, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) detailed efforts to advance use of the experimental but promising options, as infections and COVID-related deaths are rapidly rising in the region and forcing renewed lockdowns. 
Merck's COVID-19 tablet, Lagevrio, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, should be given early and within five days of first symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of their disease worsening.
It advised against treatment during pregnancy and for women who plan to or could get pregnant, while adding that breastfeeding must also be stopped around the time of using the pill, which is to be taken twice a day for five days.
Drugs in the same class as Merck's Lagevrio have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. The drugmaker, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has said animal testing shows its pill is safe, but the data have not been made public. 
EMA said it was studying available data on the Pfizer pill Paxlovid, days after the drugmaker sought U.S. approval, adding that a more comprehensive rolling review was expected to start ahead of any approval. It did not specify when that review would be.
The EMA last month began a rolling review of the Merck pill and expects to conclude that evaluation by the end of the year. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness.
'It's clear from our experience in England and from what's happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,' said Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.
'Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.'  
Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don't have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms.
The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data.
By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe's current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday.
Sweden's infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). 
And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150).
But critics say Sweden has been left 'in the dark' over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed.
Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. 
But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs.
Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe.
The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus.
On Friday, the EU drug regulator said it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. 
Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shots.
With a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics.",-2
1499,"FOR FIFTY years the Scottish National Party (SNP) ran on oil. The discovery of deposits beneath the North Sea in 1969 transformed Britain’s public finances, and ignited the separatist movement. Before the independence referendum of 2014, Alex Salmond, the party’s leader, told Scots that Westminster had frittered away their riches, pointing to Norway’s sovereign wealth fund as an example to follow. Even after defeat, Nicola Sturgeon, his successor, charmed oil executives, stressing their shared ambition to suck the seabed dry.
These days the party is conflicted. Increasingly, the young and idealistic independence movement is stirred by climate change, an issue to which it argues Britain’s Conservative government pays insufficient attention. Yet the Scottish government, normally attentive to the desires of its supporters, is struggling to wean itself off the black stuff. Nationalism’s animating cause, and for decades its fiscal panacea, is not easy to give up.

The tension has become a headache for Ms Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister. Siccar Point Energy, a developer backed by the private-equity firms Blackstone and Bluewater, has applied for permission to start drilling in the Cambo oilfield off Shetland, which would fill as many as 800m barrels of oil over 25 years. The decision lies with the British government, a fact that would not normally stop Ms Sturgeon from expressing a view.
This time it has. On August 12th Ms Sturgeon wrote to Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, urging him to review whether drilling was compatible with the country’s emissions targets. Her own verdict was left unsaid. She acted after being confronted in her constituency by climate activists, to whom she also failed to give an answer. The SNP is negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party, which opposes the drilling and supports independence. If a deal is struck, it would cement a cross-party majority in the Scottish Parliament for a new referendum.
The SNP’s leadership knows the economics of resource nationalism are weaker than ever. Once, North Sea taxes went some way to fill the theoretical gap between public expenditure and tax receipts in an independent Scotland. Before the referendum, Mr Salmond declared the country to be on the cusp of a “second oil boom”, and said revenues could total £57bn ($90bn) in the next six years—nearly double the forecast of the British government’s fiscal watchdog.

Instead, they collapsed (see chart), repeatedly underperforming forecasts. Tax receipts came to just £414m last year, according to figures published on August 18th. Some 44bn barrels of oil (or the equivalent in gas) have been drawn from the ageing North Sea basin in the past 50 years; 10bn-20bn may remain, of which just 5bn have been confirmed or are reckoned to be extractable.
But the sector still employs tens of thousands of Scots, mostly in parliamentary seats in the north-east which teeter between the SNP and the pro-oil Conservatives. The nationalists’ ambition has been to replace oil jobs with new ones in green energy. Wind farms have proliferated, but they have been largely constructed abroad. A report by the Scottish Government’s “just-transition commission” published in March warned that the failure risks undermining the support of working-class Scots for decarbonisation.
Ms Sturgeon thus finds herself straddling two political constituencies, and two visions of independence: one green, the other black. She has happily opposed fracking and nuclear energy in Scotland, despite both strictly sitting under the control of the government in Westminster. On the Cambo oilfield, she is content for Mr Johnson to make the call. Once the SNP declared: “It’s Scotland’s oil.” These days it’s London’s problem. ■",2
1500,"PEOPLE WERE hungry during lockdown. So Francis Zaake, a Ugandan member of parliament, bought some rice and sugar and had it delivered to his neediest constituents. For this charitable act, he was arrested. Mr Zaake is a member of the opposition, and Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has ordered that only the government may hand out food aid. Anyone else who does so can be charged with murder, Mr Museveni has threatened, since they might do it in a disorderly way, attract crowds and thereby spread the coronavirus.
Mr Zaake had been careful not to put his constituents at risk. Rather than having crowds converge on one place to pick up the food parcels, he had them delivered to people’s doors by motorbike-taxi. Nonetheless, the next day police and soldiers jumped over his fence while he was showering and broke into his house. They dragged him into a van and threw him in a cell. He says they beat, kicked and cut him, crushed his testicles, sprayed a blinding chemical into his eyes, called him a dog and told him to quit politics. He claims that one sneered: “We can do whatever we want to you or even kill you...No one will demonstrate for you because they are under lockdown.” The police say he inflicted the injuries on himself and is fishing for sympathy with foreign donors.

The charges against him were eventually dropped, but the message was clear. “The president doesn’t want the opposition to give out food,” says Mr Zaake, who walks with crutches and wears sunglasses to protect his eyes. “He knows that people will like us [if we do].”
The pandemic has been terrible not only for the human body but also for the body politic. Freedom House, a think-tank in Washington, counts 80 countries where the quality of democracy and respect for human rights have deteriorated since the pandemic began. The list includes both dictatorships that have grown nastier and democracies where standards have slipped. Only one country, Malawi, has improved (see map). Covid-19 “has fuelled a crisis for democracy around the world,” argue Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz of Freedom House. Global freedom has been declining since just before the financial crisis of 2007-08, by their reckoning. Covid-19 has accelerated this pre-existing trend in several ways.

The disease poses a grave and fast-moving threat to every nation. Governments have, quite reasonably, assumed emergency powers to counter it. But such powers can be abused. Governments have selectively banned protests on the grounds that they might spread the virus, silenced critics and scapegoated minorities. They have used emergency measures to harass dissidents. And they have taken advantage of a general atmosphere of alarm. With everyone’s attention on covid-19, autocrats and would-be autocrats in many countries can do all sorts of bad things, safe in the knowledge that the rest of the world will barely notice, let alone object.
Measuring the pandemic’s effect on democracy and human rights is hard. Without covid-19, would China’s rulers still have inflicted such horrors on Muslim Uyghurs this year? Would Thailand’s king have grabbed nearly absolute powers? Would Egypt have executed 15 political prisoners in a single weekend this month? Perhaps. But these outrages would surely have faced stronger opposition, both at home and abroad. Granted, the current American administration makes less fuss about human rights than previous ones have and covid-19 has not changed that. But the voice from the White House is not the only one that counts.
Last year was a year of mass protests, which swept six continents, brought down five governments (Algeria, Bolivia, Iraq, Lebanon and Sudan) and forced others to rethink unpopular policies, as in Chile, France and Hong Kong. This year, by contrast, governments have banned mass gatherings to enforce social distancing. For many, this is wonderfully convenient.
For example, in India, the world’s largest democracy, the biggest campaign of civil resistance for decades erupted shortly before the pandemic. For 100 days protesters raged against proposed changes to citizenship laws that would discriminate against Muslims and potentially render millions of them stateless. These protests petered out after a curfew was imposed in response to covid-19, since it was no longer possible to occupy the streets.
Later, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government began imposing strict local lockdowns, it singled out neighbourhoods which had held protests, many of which were Muslim. Heavy police barricades locked in residents for weeks.
In early September the government declared that in the upcoming parliamentary session there would be no Question Hour for the opposition and no private members’ bills—long-standing institutions that allow opposition MPs to query the government directly. The excuse: the health risks of covid-19, along with assertions that in a crisis, legislative time was too precious to waste on noisy debate. The opposition walked out, allowing Mr Modi to ram through 25 bills in three days. He then suspended the session eight days early, having apparently forgotten the earlier excuse that time was short.
At the outset of the crisis Mr Modi, who has a knack for the theatrics of power, called on citizens to bang on pots, and later to light sacred lamps, in a show of solidarity to fight the pandemic. These displays, taken up by his supporters with glee, were not spontaneous expressions of support for doctors and nurses, like similar displays in Italy, Spain or Britain. Rather, they were a demonstration of Mr Modi’s power.
H.L. Mencken, an American journalist, once wrote that “the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.” He could have added that when people have real cause for alarm, they are even keener to be led to safety. Some put their trust in the sober calculations of evidence-driven experts. Others put their faith in strongmen.
Mr Modi has racked up colossal approval ratings this year, even as he presides over a double catastrophe of mass death and economic slump. So has Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, despite the largest reported caseload in South-East Asia. Mr Duterte’s poll numbers may be coloured by fear; he has had thousands of people, supposedly criminal suspects, killed without trial, a campaign that appears to have intensified during the pandemic. But many Filipinos admire his grim style—extending a “state of calamity” for another year last month, temporarily banning many nurses from going to work overseas and vowing to try the first covid-19 vaccine himself to show it is safe.
Popular, you’re gonna be popular
Admiration for Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s militaristic president, is as high as ever, despite over 5m covid-19 cases and more than 150,000 deaths. This is partly because he has handed out emergency aid to 67m hard-up Brazilians, but his macho posturing also appeals to many voters. He caught covid-19 and recovered, crediting his background as an athlete. He declared: “We have to face [the virus] like a man, damn it, not like a little boy.” He blames state governors for being so scared of the disease that they wreck people’s livelihoods unnecessarily.
That strikes a chord with some. When São Paulo’s lockdown was at its tightest, a clothing shop was illegally letting customers in through a tiny metal shutter door. “The governors shut things down to hurt the economy and make Bolsonaro look bad,” grumbled the owner, who shared his president’s dismissive attitude towards covid-19. “The death numbers are a lie,” he said: “I’m only wearing this mask out of respect for our clients. I don’t need it.”
Strongmen find it easier to impress the masses when they control the news. In April Reporters Without Borders, a watchdog, counted 38 countries using the coronavirus as an excuse to harass critical media. That number has now more than doubled, to 91, says Freedom House.
Many governments have criminalised “fake news” about the pandemic. Often, this means commentary that displeases the ruling party. Nicaragua’s regime plans to ban news that “causes alarm, fear or anxiety”. El Salvador has relaunched a state television outlet, having purged 70 journalists since President Nayib Bukele came to power last year. “I am watching a very balanced newscast,” grinned Mr Bukele. “I don’t know what the opposition will see.”

Anyone in Zimbabwe who publishes or disseminates “false” information about an official, or that impedes the response to the pandemic, faces up to 20 years in prison. Two journalists were arrested when they tried to visit in hospital three opposition activists, including an MP, who had been abducted, tortured and forced to drink urine by ruling-party thugs.
All around the world, ordinary people are being gagged, too. Some 116 citizen journalists are currently imprisoned, says Reporters Without Borders. In Uzbekistan people entering quarantine facilities have had to hand over their phones, supposedly to prevent the devices from spreading the virus but actually so they cannot take photos of the woeful conditions inside.
Medics, who see covid-19 fiascos close up, face extra pressure to shut up. China’s rulers silenced the doctors in Wuhan who first sounded the alarm about the new virus. Censorship can be lethal. Had China listened to doctors and acted faster to curb the disease, it would not have spread so fast around the world.
Still, other regimes have copied China’s example. In September the Turkish Medical Association accused Turkey’s government of downplaying the outbreak. A ruling-party ally called for the group to be shut down and its leaders investigated for stoking “panic”. Yet the doctors were right. The health ministry later admitted that its daily figures did not include asymptomatic patients. An opposition lawmaker shared a document suggesting that the true number of cases in a single day in September was 19 times the official tally.
Egypt’s government says it is coping admirably with the pandemic. A dozen doctors have been arrested for suggesting otherwise, as have several journalists. One, Mohamed Monir, died of covid-19 contracted during detention.
Of the 24 countries that had national elections scheduled between January and August, nine were disrupted by the pandemic. Some delays were justified. But as South Korea showed, a ballot can be held safely if suitable precautions are taken. Some other governments were in no hurry. Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament in March and did not allow fresh elections until August. In the meantime, he ran the country without lawmakers to check him.
In Hong Kong pro-democracy candidates were expected to do well in elections in September. Citing the risk of covid-19, the territory’s pro-communist leaders delayed them for a year.
Burundi’s election in May was probably never going to be clean, but the virus supplied the perfect excuse to exclude pesky foreign observers. Twelve days before the election they were told that they would have to quarantine on arrival in the country for 14 days, thus missing the vote.
In Russia Vladimir Putin has turned the virus to his advantage. He shifted responsibility for a strict lockdown to regional governors, but then took credit for easing it. In the summer he held a constitutional pseudo-referendum to allow himself to stay in office until 2036. Citing public health, he extended the vote to a week and allowed people to vote at home, in courtyards, in playgrounds and on tree stumps. The vote was impossible to observe or verify. Mr Putin declared a resounding victory. Parliament voted to change the voting procedure permanently.
In countries with too few checks and balances, rules to curb the virus can be used for other ends. On a dark road in Senegal, a policeman recently stopped a taxi and detained the driver for wearing his anti-covid mask on his chin. After 45 minutes, shaking with fury, the driver returned to his vehicle. The cop had threatened him with dire punishments unless he handed over some cash, he explained to his passenger, a reporter for The Economist. He drove off as fast as he could, cursing.
While petty officials abuse the rules to pad their wages, strongmen typically abuse them to crush dissent. Police assaulted civilians in 59 countries and detained them in 66 for reasons linked to the pandemic. Violence was most common in countries Freedom House classifies as “partly free”, where people are not yet too scared to protest, but their rulers would like them to be.
In Zimbabwe, for example, many of the 34 new regulations passed during a national lockdown are still in place, and have been used as a pretext for myriad abuses. In September the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, an umbrella group, released a report listing 920 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, unlawful arrests and assaults on citizens by the security services in the first 180 days of lockdown. One man was forced to roll around in raw sewage. Many had dogs set on them. Dozens of opposition activists have been arrested or beaten, including a former finance minister. There were too many everyday cases of intimidation and harassment to count.
Many strongmen are also chipping away at pre-pandemic checks on their power. Nicaragua has borrowed an idea from Mr Putin: a law will require NGOs that receive foreign funding to register as “foreign agents”. India used similar rules to shut down the local arm of Amnesty International, which closed in September after its bank accounts were frozen.
In Kazakhstan trials are taking place on Zoom, leading some defendants in politically charged cases to complain that this makes it easy for judges to have selective hearing. Alnur Ilyashev, a pro-democracy campaigner who was sentenced to three years of restricted movement for “disseminating false information”, said he could not always hear his own trial.
Nothing spreads like fear
Panic about a contagious disease makes people irrational and xenophobic. A study in 2015 by Huggy Rao of Stanford University and Sunasir Dutta of the University of Minnesota found that people were less likely to favour legalising irregular immigrants if told about a new strain of flu. Many autocrats, even if they have not read the academic literature, grasp that blaming out-groups is a good way to win support.
Mr Modi’s government tars Muslims as superspreaders. Bulgaria imposed harsher lockdowns on Romany neighbourhoods than on others. Turkey’s religious authorities blame gay people. Malaysian officials blame migrant workers, some of whom have been caned and deported.
Minorities have had an especially grim time in Myanmar. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto president, threatened severe penalties for residents who re-enter the country illegally. People understood this to refer to the Rohingyas, a persecuted Muslim group, roughly 1m of whom have fled into neighbouring countries. The rumour that Rohingyas were infecting the nation spread rapidly. A cartoon circulating online showed a Rohingya man, labelled as an “illegal interloper”, crossing the border, carrying covid-19.
Meanwhile, a UN rapporteur warns that the pandemic has “emboldened” Myanmar’s army, which has stepped up its war on secessionists. The Arakan Army, a rebel group, offered ceasefires in April, June and September; all were rebuffed. In May and June the army bombed civilians, razed villages and tortured non-combatants, says Amnesty International. Some 200,000 have fled to camps for displaced people, according to a local NGO, the Rakhine Ethnics Congress. Since covid-19 struck, donations have declined and supplies of food to the camps have dwindled.
Abusers and autocrats have not had it all their own way this year. The pandemic has drained their treasuries. Their finances will still be wobbly even when a vaccine is found and the public-health excuse for curbs on freedom is no longer plausible.
And people are pushing back. Although 158 countries have imposed restrictions on demonstrations, big protests have erupted in at least 90 since the pandemic began. Furious crowds in Kyrgyzstan this month forced the government to order a re-run of a tainted election. Protests in Nigeria prompted the government to disband a notoriously torture-and-murder-prone police unit on October 11th. Mass rallies in Belarus have so far failed to reverse a rigged election there, but have made it clear that the dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, has lost the consent of his people.
Institutions are pushing back, too. A court in Lesotho barred the prime minister from using the virus as an excuse to close parliament. Russia’s opposition parties refuse to be cowed even by the poisoning of their main leader, Alexei Navalny.
With luck, when covid-19 eventually recedes, the global atmosphere of fear will recede with it. People may find the capacity to care a bit more about abuses that occur far away, or to people unlike themselves. They may even elect leaders who speak up for universal values. But for the time being, the outlook is grim.■

1501,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",3
1502,"MICROSOFT EXCEL’S zeal for autocorrection has long irritated casual users. Lists of numbers preceded by dashes are misread as instructions to subtract. Phone numbers lose their leading zeroes. Credit-card numbers get re-expressed in scientific notation.
Geneticists struggle with a particular version of this problem. A gene called Membrane Associated Ring-CH-type finger 1, commonly known as MARCH1, is, for instance, frequently re-encoded as the date March 1. Something similar happens to genes in the Septin family, of which SEPT1 is a member, and to Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Family Member E41, often known as DEC2.

This problem was first noticed in 2004, but was brought to wider attention in 2016 by Mark Ziemann of Deakin University, in Australia. In July Dr Ziemann followed up with a paper in PLOS Computational Biology entitled “Gene name errors: Lessons not learned”. By surveying 166,000 genomics-related papers published between 2014 and 2020, he and his co-authors showed that the number of papers using Excel has steadily increased, and the proportion plagued with autocorrect errors continues to hover at around 30%.
Errors have also been flagged by researchers in other languages. In Portuguese, for instance, AGO2 (Argonaute RISC Catalytic Component 2) rebrands itself as Agosto 2. Dutch users experience problems with MEI1 (Meiotic Double-Stranded Break Formation Protein 1), “Mei” being the Dutch for “May”. And geneticists in Finland, where the first month of the year is called Tammikuu, find TAMM41 (Mitochondrial Translocator Assembly And Maintenance Protein) encoding itself as the 41st of January.
This continuing state of affairs is surprising. In August 2020, aware they were playing David to Microsoft’s Goliath, the committee which standardises gene names renamed those beginning MARC, MARCH and SEPT to begin MTARC, MARCHF and SEPTIN, and rebranded DEC1 as DELEC1. Other problematic gene names remained, but this was widely seen as a step in the right direction. Dr Ziemann’s latest paper, though, suggests that few researchers have taken it.
Such errors often seem amusing rather than dangerous. But they reflect a deeper problem, which is that spreadsheets allow such silent errors, too well camouflaged for authors or their editors to spot, to go undetected for years. To stop this, Dr Ziemann recommends researchers abandon software like Excel in favour of bespoke code written with scientific applications in mind. Such programs are less susceptible to erroneous autocorrections and easier to audit. Whether his advice will be heeded this time round remains to be seen.■

1503,"PERHAPS THE most remarkable characteristic of General Electric (GE) over its 129-year history has been how thoroughly it reflected the dominant characteristics of big American business. Most of its history was a chronicle of boisterous expansion, then globalisation—followed by painful restructuring away from the now-unloved conglomerate model. On November 9th Lawrence Culp, its chief executive, announced that GE would split its remaining operations into three public companies.
Each of these entities will be large, essential and very modern. One will make jet engines, which GE reckons already power two-thirds of all commercial flights. Its power business will provide the systems and turbines generating one-third of the world’s electricity. The health-care division will continue to be the backbone of modern hospitals. Yet it speaks to GE’s remarkable role that this is a modest reach given its past sprawl. From the late-19th to the late-20th century its products lit dark streets; provided the toasters, fans, refrigerators, and televisions (along with the stations beamed to them), which transformed homes; delivered the locomotives that hauled trains; and then built a huge business financing all that and more.

The ambition to be everything was enabled by the perception that it could manage anything. The 21st century punctured that perception. Jack Welch, an acquisitive chief executive reputed to be a managerial genius, retired in 2001 after receiving a mind-boggling $417m severance package. Ever-better results during his tenure beguiled investors and sent the share price soaring. But problems soon arose. The structure Welch left behind was in effect bailed out during the financial crisis. Losses at GE Capital, the sprawling financial unit he fostered, were blamed, though the company’s industrial core turned out to have plenty of problems, too.

Recent years have been spent spitting out one notable business after another. The timing of the break-up announcement was determined by the sale of a large aircraft-financing unit. The transaction reduced debt by enough to provide the three soon-to-be independent companies with an investment-grade credit rating. Mr Culp, the firm’s boss since 2018, speaks of the “illusory benefits of synergy” to be traded for the certain benefits of focus. “A sharper purpose attracts and motivates people,” he says.
Having boasted of its management nous, it now seems that poor management is what did it for a unified GE. The contest to replace Welch was widely seen as pitting the best global executives against one another, with the losers hired to run other big firms. But his successors struggled. Jeffrey Immelt, Welch’s hand-picked replacement, retired under a cloud in 2017. John Flannery, once seen as a wizard behind the rise of the health-care division, took over but was fired after little more than a year. Mr Culp was brought in from outside, a step last taken in the 19th century.
During much of Welch’s tenure and its immediate aftermath GE was the most valuable company in the world, reaching a peak market value nearly five times its current $121bn. It is tempting to conclude that GE’s failure illustrates the demise of the conglomerate. That is refuted by the diversification of today’s most valuable companies: tech firms that have branched out into driverless cars, cloud computing and so on. Rather, GE’s story reflects how even the most valuable American companies may be flawed—and if flaws emerge, may be thoroughly transformed.■

1504,"WHEN YOSHINO AKIRA, a Japanese chemist, worked on rechargeable batteries in the 1980s, it was with a view to powering portable devices. His Nobel-prizewinning research led to the first commercial lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery. These now power everything from smartphones to electric vehicles (EVs). But the Japanese firms that, building on Mr Yoshino’s work, dominated the Li-ion business early on have lost their edge. CATL, China’s battery giant, and the energy arm of LG, a South Korean group, have eclipsed Japan’s Panasonic as the world’s largest suppliers of EV batteries. Others are catching up in the production of materials and components.
Japanese battery-makers want to regain their rightful place at the head of the pack. To do so they are betting on solid-state batteries. These still shuttle lithium ions between the anode and the cathode to charge and discharge, but the electrolyte where this shuttling happens is solid not liquid. That makes the batteries more stable and potentially more powerful. It also dispenses with the need for bulky cooling systems, required for fast-charging Li-ion systems. Cars equipped with solid-state batteries could be lighter, which increases range.

Japan submits more battery-tech patents a year than any other country; second-ranked South Korea files half as many. Japanese firms and inventors accounted for more than one in two solid-state-related patents between 2014 and 2018. More are coming. Japan’s government is pouring money into research, including a centre headed by Mr Yoshino. Industrial and chemicals firms, of which Japan has plenty, are gearing up to make the materials needed to bring the technology to market.
Murata, a big manufacturer which bought Sony’s battery division in 2017, plans to begin mass-producing smaller solid-state batteries this autumn. Nakajima Norio, Murata’s boss, sees “lots of potential in wearables”, since the batteries do not burn or get hot (which is why they are already used in things like pacemakers). This month Toyota announced plans to invest $13.5bn by 2030 in next-generation car batteries, including the solid-state variety. Honda and Nissan, two other carmakers, are also eyeing the technology.
Naturally, if making solid-state batteries were easy, manufacturers would be churning them out. It isn’t. Water mucks up the materials, so factories must be kept ultra-dry. Mitsui Kinzoku, an engineering firm, has been testing mass production of solid electrolytes and found that it is “indeed a very difficult process”, in the words of Takahashi Tsukasa, who is involved in the project. Toyota hopes to begin manufacturing in the mid-2020s, but even its technology chief, Maeda Masahiko, has cautioned that “we can’t be optimistic yet”.
Even if they can get the technology right, Japanese firms are not running unopposed, as they had been in Li-ion’s early days. Most big carmakers, including Ford, Hyundai and Volkswagen, have solid-state cars in the works. They may want to make the batteries themselves. Volkswagen has a big stake in QuantumScape, an American solid-state-battery startup backed by Bill Gates. Last month a group of British organisations, including Johnson Matthey, a big chemicals firm, and Oxford University formed a consortium to work on the technology. That’s some solid competition. ■

1505,"VENTURE INTO the chat rooms of French cyberspace or onto the streets of Paris, and the impression this summer is of a country on the brink of totalitarian rule or civil collapse, or both. In July the word dictature (dictatorship) surged tenfold on Google, in anticipation of a new “health pass” introduced on August 9th by President Emmanuel Macron. This makes full vaccination (or a negative covid-19 test) a condition of access to restaurants, bars, trains and other places.
Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a right-wing deputy, called the new pass sanitaire a “sanitary coup d’état”. Michèle Rivasi, a Green politician, called it “apartheid”. Protesters clutched placards with slogans such as “False pandemic, real dictatorship” and “Pass Nazitaire”, or photos of Mr Macron with a Hitler-style moustache. A few wore yellow stars on which was written “non-vaccinated”, eliciting widespread indignation. Joseph Szwarc, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor, called the comparison “odious” and said he shed tears at the sight: “I wore the yellow star; I know what it was.”

In April and May the phrase guerre civile (civil war) spiked on Twitter, after retired right-wing generals wrote an open letter offering to step in to save the country should it slide into chaos. A poll suggested that 58% of the French backed the officers, and nearly half thought the army should step in on its own initiative.

Why is France so often convinced it is on the brink, and so prone to rhetorical hysteria? The country’s disjointed and rebellious history is one answer. “Are we in 1789?” is still a periodic headline in the press. And indeed, the prospect of disorder is not wholly fanciful. A culture of mass protest is deeper-rooted in France than in any other European country, and reasoned debate often gives way to factional theatrics and sabotage. Fifty years after the May ‘68 student uprising, gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) ransacked Paris. In July anti-vaxxers invaded a town hall in Chambéry, in the Alps, and vandalised vaccination centres.
Inflating fears of violence or totalitarianism may also suit some politicians. Many a French election campaign has been won on the promise of calm after chaos. Over four-fifths of the French say that feelings of “insecurity” will influence their vote at the presidential election next year, even though violent crime (sexual and domestic violence aside) has been falling for years and the murder rate is stable. Some 200,000 people grabbed headlines on August 7th by marching against the new health rules. Yet, after they were announced, over 8.5m quietly got vaccinated for the first time. As for allegations of dictatorship, Mr Macron put it this way: “If we empty words of their meaning, the risk is that we threaten our democracy itself.”",2
1506,"IN YEMEN THEY set off fireworks; in Somalia they handed out sweets; in Syria they praised the Taliban for providing a “living example” of how to “bring down a criminal regime” through jihad. Around the world, jihadists were elated by the fall of Kabul. Through willpower, patience and cunning, a low-budget band of holy warriors has vanquished America and taken charge of a medium-size country. To Muslims who yearn to expel infidels and overthrow secular states, it was evidence that God approves. The ripple effects could be felt far and wide.
In the next few days President Joe Biden will have to sort out the mess he has created at Kabul airport, where throngs are clamouring to flee. It is a dangerous moment for his presidency. In the longer term the world must deal with the boost to jihadism from America’s humiliation. The chief risk is not that terrorists will use Afghanistan as a base from which to strike the West, as they did on September 11th 2001. Such attacks are harder now, since rich countries have better security. Besides, the Taliban are unlikely to tolerate big training camps for global-minded terrorists, as they crave recognition and aid.

Granted, some feel a duty of hospitality to foreign Sunni jihadists, and some will aid their militant cousins in Pakistan, making that nuclear-armed state even less stable. But outside Afghanistan, the main ripple effects will be psychological. The Taliban’s triumph will fire up jihadists in other countries, and spur recruits to join them. Some who live in rich countries will be inspired to commit acts of terrorism there. It does not take many such attacks to sow a sense of fear or roil domestic politics.
Even worse will be the effect in poorer, weaker states, where jihadists aspire not merely to kill but to control territory, or at least prevent the government from doing so. In places like Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Mali, Somalia and Mozambique, they already do. In several other parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, they threaten to. Many are asking: if our Afghan brothers can beat a superpower, surely we can beat our own wretched rulers?

Jihadists are not all the same. Many disagree about doctrine. Many hate and fight each other. Supporters of Islamic State deride the Taliban, absurdly, as American stooges. One of the first things the Taliban did in Kabul last week was to pull the leader of Islamic State in South Asia out of jail and kill him.
Most jihadist groups are motivated primarily by local grievances: a predatory government, an ethnic or sectarian divide, infidel intruders. Yet they also tap into a global narrative. On their phones they see daily evidence that the oppression they face at home is part of wider pattern of persecution of Muslims, from the gulag of Xinjiang to the hellscape of Gaza. When jihadists anywhere succeed, they feel pride—and a call to action.

Bad government creates an opening for jihadism. When a state is unjust, its citizens may imagine that one run by jihadists might be better. Even if they do not take up arms, they may quietly support those who do. Many rural Afghans decided that Taliban justice, though harsh, was quicker and less corrupt than government courts, and that Taliban checkpoints were less plunderous. This is one reason the Taliban’s final march to power met so little resistance. The other was psychological: they won because when America pulled out Afghans did not want to die fighting for a lost cause. Similar principles apply elsewhere. Jihadists in north-eastern Nigeria are hard to beat because locals detest the central government and army officers sell their own men’s weapons to the guerrillas and pocket the cash.
Once jihadists win power, however, they find that their ideology makes governing hard (see our Special report on the Arab world). Their desire to create a perfectly pious society, and ruthless intolerance of deviation from that ideal, make pragmatic compromise tricky. Islamic State’s rule over a big chunk of Iraq and Syria lasted only three years. Its habit of drowning people in cages alienated a potentially sympathetic Sunni population. So did its failure to foster economic activities other than looting and kidnapping. It scared outside powers and Shia Iraqis so much that they clubbed together to crush it.

The Taliban were also dreadful rulers when they last ran Afghanistan. Much depends on whether they have learned from their mistakes. If a group of jihadists could not only seize a country but also run it tolerably well, jihadists everywhere would see it as a beacon. Senior Taliban are at pains to seem pragmatic and insist they will respect human rights. But rocky times lie ahead. Taliban footsoldiers are already committing atrocities. Many urban Afghans, who have tasted the freedom to dress, work and study as they please, even if they are female, despise the new regime. Because reserves are frozen in America, it is short of cash. The Afghan economy has seized up; prices are soaring. The Taliban have yet to unveil good ideas for reviving it. Instead they bluster that skilled Afghans must not emigrate. Skilled Afghans may have other ideas.
One lesson of the Afghan fiasco is that what happens in far-off failing states matters not only to the people who live there, but also to the rest of the world. Calamity in Kabul today means bigger refugee flows, more jihadist attacks and a greater chance that other Islamist insurgencies will prevail. That could destabilise a large number of countries, endangering both locals and the foreigners who visit or do business there.
Another lesson is that a purely military approach to fighting jihadism does little to make the ground less fertile for it. The long-term solution is to build less awful, less exclusive states. If the old Afghan government had been less corrupt and less inept in dealing with tribal power-brokers, it might have proved more resilient. Likewise, if northern Mozambique, southern Thailand, Kashmir or the vast expanses of the Sahel were more benignly ruled, they might not be havens for jihadists.
Improving governance is hard, not least since many countries vulnerable to jihad are also racked by climate change. More frequent droughts add to discontent and stir conflicts over water and pasture. Donors can offer advice and cash, but ultimately it is up to locals to build institutions that work. Unless existing states provide basic services and something resembling justice, the jihadists’ siren song will always sound seductive. ■",2
1507,"WITHIN HOURS of the publication of a New York Post article on October 14th, Twitter users began receiving strange messages. If they tried to share the story—a dubious “exposé” of emails supposedly from the laptop of Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential nominee—they were told that their tweet could not be sent, as the link had been identified as harmful. Many Facebook users were not seeing the story at all: the social network had demoted it in the news feed of its 2.7bn users while its fact-checkers reviewed it.
If the companies had hoped that by burying or blocking the story they would stop people from reading it, the bet did not pay off. The article ended up being the most-discussed story of the week on both platforms—and the second-most talked-about story was the fact that the social networks had tried to block it. The Post called it an act of modern totalitarianism, carried out “not [by] men in darkened cells driving screws under the fingernails of dissidents, but Silicon Valley dweebs.” Republican senators vowed to extract testimony on anticonservative bias from Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, the dweebs-in-chief of, respectively, Facebook and Twitter.

The tale sums up the problem that social networks are encountering wherever they operate. They set out to be neutral platforms, letting users provide the content and keeping their hands off editorial decisions. Twitter executives used to joke that they were “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party”. Yet as they have become more active at algorithmically ranking the content that users upload, and moderating the undesirable stuff, they have edged towards being something more like publishers. Mr Zuckerberg says he does not want to be an “arbiter of truth”. The Post episode fed the suspicion of many that, willingly or not, that is precisely what he is becoming.
America’s fractious election campaign has only made more urgent the need to answer the unresolved questions about free expression online. What speech should be allowed? And who should decide? Rasmus Nielsen of the Reuters Institute at Oxford University describes this as a “constitutional moment” for how to regulate the private infrastructure that has come to support free expression around the world.

Social networks have been on the mother of all clean-ups. Facebook’s removal of hate speech has risen tenfold in two years (see chart 1). It disables some 17m fake accounts every single day, more than twice the number three years ago. YouTube, a video platform owned by Google with about 2bn monthly users, removed 11.4m videos in the past quarter, along with 2.1bn user comments, up from just 166m comments in the second quarter of 2018. Twitter, with a smaller base of about 350m users, removed 2.9m tweets in the second half of last year, more than double the amount a year earlier. TikTok, a Chinese short-video upstart, removed 105m clips in the first half of this year, twice as many as in the previous six months (a jump partly explained by the firm’s growth).
Artificial intelligence has helped to make such a clean-up possible. Most offending content is taken down before any user has had a chance to flag it. Some lends itself readily to policing with machines: more than 99% of the child-nudity posts Facebook takes down are removed before anyone has reported them, but most of the bullying or harassment is flagged by users rather than robots. Two years ago Facebook’s AI removed a post referring to “merciless Indian Savages”, before human moderators realised it was a quote from the Declaration of Independence. Facebook now employs about 15,000 people to moderate content. In May the company agreed to pay $52m to 11,250 moderators who developed post-traumatic stress disorder from looking at the worst of the internet.
Discussions about free speech that may once have seemed abstract have become all too practical—the murder of Samuel Paty near Paris last week being the latest shocking reminder. Social networks tightened their policies on terrorism after Islamist attacks in Europe in 2015 and an anti-Muslim rampage in New Zealand last year, which was live-streamed on Facebook and shared on YouTube. The American election and Brexit referendum of 2016 forced them to think again about political communication. Twitter banned all political ads last year, and Facebook and Google have said they will ban them around the time of this year’s election on November 3rd.
The companies have also improved their scrutiny of far-flung countries, after criticism of their earlier negligence in places such as Myanmar, where Facebook played a “determining role” in the violence against Rohingya Muslims, according to the UN (see article). This week Facebook announced that it had hired more content-reviewers fluent in Swahili, Amharic, Zulu, Somali, Oromo and Hausa, ahead of African elections. Its AI is learning new languages, and hoovering up rule-breaking content as it does so.
The room where it happens
Some tech bosses have been rethinking their approach to the trade-offs between free expression and safety. Last October, in a speech at Georgetown University, Mr Zuckerberg made a full-throated defence of free speech, warning: “More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that’s dangerous.” Yet this year, as misinformation about covid-19 flourished, Facebook took a harder line on fake news about health, including banning anti-vaccination ads. And this month it banned both Holocaust denial and groups promoting QAnon, a crackpot conspiracy.
The pressure from the media is to “remove more, remove more, remove more”, says one senior tech executive. But in some quarters unease is growing that the firms are removing too much. In America this criticism comes mostly from the right, which sees Silicon Valley as a nest of liberals. It is one thing to zap content from racists and Russian trolls; it is another to block the New York Post, one of America’s highest-circulation newspapers, founded by Alexander Hamilton (who admittedly might not have approved of its current incarnation, under Rupert Murdoch).
Elsewhere, liberals worry that whistle-blowing content is being wrongly taken down. YouTube removed footage from users in Syria that it deemed to break its guidelines on violence, but which was also potential evidence of war crimes. Until last year TikTok’s guidelines banned criticism of systems of government and “distortion” of historical events including the massacre near Tiananmen Square.
Where both camps agree is in their unease that it is falling to social networks to decide what speech is acceptable. As private companies they can set their own rules about what to publish (within the confines of the laws of countries where they operate). But they have come to play a big role in public life. Mr Zuckerberg himself compares Facebook to a “town square”.
Rival social networks promising truly free speech have struggled to overcome the network effects enjoyed by the incumbents. One, Gab, attracted neo-Nazis. Another, Parler, has been promoted by some Republican politicians but so far failed to take off. (It is also grappling with free-speech dilemmas of its own, reluctantly laying down rules including no sending of photos of fecal matter.) Outside China, where Facebook does not operate, four out of ten people worldwide use the platform; WhatsApp and Instagram, which it also owns, have another 3bn or so accounts between them. “Frankly, I don’t think we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either,” Mr Zuckerberg said in his Georgetown speech.
Say no to this
Bill Clinton once said that attempting to regulate the internet, with its millions of different sites, would be “like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall”. But the concentration of the social-media market around a few companies has made the job easier.

Twitter has faced steep growth in the number of legal requests for content removal, from individuals as well as governments (see chart 2). Last year Google received 30,000 requests from governments to remove pieces of content, up from a couple of thousand requests ten years ago (see chart 3). And Facebook took down 33,600 pieces of content in response to legal requests. They included a Photoshopped picture of President Emmanuel Macron in pink underwear, which French police wanted removed because it broke a law from 1881 restricting press freedom.

In America the government is prevented from meddling too much with online speech by the First Amendment. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives online platforms further protection, exempting them from liability for the content they publish. But carve-outs to this exemption are growing. Firms cannot avoid responsibility for copyright infringements, posts that break federal criminal law, or which enable sex trafficking. The latter exemption, made in 2018, had an impact on speech that was greater than its drafting implied: sites including Tumblr and Craigslist concluded that, rather than risk prosecution, they would stop publishing adult material of all sorts.
In Europe regulation has gone further. In 2014 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) established the “right to be forgotten” when it found in favour of a Spanish man who wanted Google to remove old references to his history of indebtedness. Since then Google has fielded requests for about half a million URLs to be removed each year, and granted about half of them. Last year the ECJ ruled that European countries could order Facebook to remove content worldwide, not just for users within their borders. The European Audiovisual Media Services Directive requires online video services to take “appropriate measures” to protect viewers from harmful or illegal content, including setting up age checks. The European Commission is to publish a Digital Services Act, expected to impose further obligations on internet companies.
National governments have also set their own rules, notably Germany, whose Network Enforcement Act of 2017 threatens platforms with fines of up to €50m ($60m) if they fail to take down illegal content within 24 hours of notification. In response Facebook opened a new moderation centre in Germany. The trouble with privatising the enforcement of the law in this way, points out Mr Nielsen, is that the companies have big incentives to err on the side of caution. A judge may use discretion to ignore rules on speech that are seldom applied (such as a German law that until recently banned insulting a foreign head of state). But a social-media company has no reason to risk ignoring a law.
Who tells your story
Some governments are leaning on social networks to remove content that may be legal. The social-media platforms have their own rules that go further than most governments’. A ban on material that could interfere with “civic integrity” may sound like something from communist China; it is actually in Twitter’s rules. London’s Metropolitan Police has a unit that scours platforms for terrorism-related content, which it “requests” be taken down for breaching the platform’s terms of service—even though the material may not break any law.
“Authoritarian governments are taking cues from the loose regulatory talk among democracies,” writes David Kaye, a former UN special rapporteur on free expression. Last year Singapore passed what it described as an anti-fake-news law, banning the online publication of lies that could harm the public interest. Thailand has enforced its lèse-majesté laws online, in August ordering Facebook to block a critical group called Royalist Marketplace, which with more than 1m members was one of the largest on the platform. (Facebook complied, but is suing the Thai government for breaking human-rights law.)
If neither governments nor executives make reliable custodians of free speech, what can be done to keep the internet a tolerable place while protecting freedom of expression? An increasingly common answer in Silicon Valley is to draw a distinction between freedom of speech and “freedom of reach”: leave posts up, but make them less visible and viral.
Last year YouTube changed its algorithm so that videos that were borderline cases for deletion were recommended less often. After the bombings of churches and hotels in Sri Lanka at Easter in 2019, Facebook prevented the resharing of posts by friends of friends, to stop inflammatory content travelling too far or fast; this rule is in place in Ethiopia and Myanmar. Twitter has tried to stop people from mindlessly sharing fake news by prompting them to read articles before they retweet them. Platforms are adding more labels to content, warning users that it is misleading.

Another idea gaining momentum is that firms should make their data available for audit just as listed companies must open up their accounts. Their internal processes could also be more transparent. At Facebook there is an odd tension between its earnest approach to policymaking, with fortnightly “mini-legislative sessions”, and the fact that every month Mr Zuckerberg personally takes a handful of the hardest decisions on content moderation. Treating the big calls as “corner-office decisions” is a mistake, believes Mr Kaye: better for companies to say, “We have these rules, we’re going to apply them neutrally. And we don’t want that process to be corrupted by political pressure.”
Facebook took a step towards such a system on October 22nd with the launch of its Oversight Board, a watchdog made up of 20 members of the great and good who will scrutinise its moderation decisions and issue binding rulings. The board’s scope is narrower than some had hoped. It can consider only whether deleted posts should be reinstated. It merely applies Facebook’s rules, rather than setting them. It cannot consider posts that have been algorithmically demoted, as opposed to deleted. So some of the most prominent recent controversies—Facebook’s decision to leave up a contentious post by Donald Trump, its removal of QAnon, its reversal on Holocaust denial and its demotion of the Post story—are outside the board’s jurisdiction.
History has its eyes on you
Yet as Alan Rusbridger, a former Guardian editor and member of the new board, puts it, it is a “revolutionary thought”. “A company that has notoriously been very reluctant to surrender control on anything has handed over…the power to make some pretty consequential decisions on its behalf,” he says. He hopes the board will get more powers over time. Facebook says this is premature. But Sir Nick Clegg, its head of global affairs, hopes the board’s remit might one day expand to consider cases submitted by other social networks.
Others have similar ideas. Article 19, a free-speech lobby group, has suggested that platforms could outsource their moderation decisions to non-governmental “social-media councils”, something like the press watchdogs that in many countries hold newspapers to a voluntary code.
For now, the social networks have to get through perhaps the hardest fortnight in their short history. They face the possibility of having to deploy content-moderation tools developed for fragile, emerging democracies in their home country. Facebook removed 120,000 pieces of content aimed at voter suppression in America in the past quarter. The New York Post affair does not bode well for how the companies might handle the fallout from a contested election. “When they appeared to depart from their policies they opened themselves up to the very charges of bias that followed,” says Evelyn Douek of Harvard Law School. As the election approaches, they need to “tie themselves to a mast” of clear rules, she says. A storm is coming. ■
Correction (October 27th 2020): An earlier version of this story said that Facebook employed 35,000 people to moderate content. That is the number of people it has working in safety and security; about 15,000 of them are moderators. Sorry.",2
1508,"SUCCESS OR FAILURE in war often hinges on how much soldiers know about the enemy and the areas in which it operates. Tactical intelligence of all sorts helps. Locations of culverts where bombs may lie hidden. Spots from which snipers have scored kills. Water sources likely to have been polluted by agricultural runoff after heavy rain. Identities of locals suspected of aiding insurgents. Armed forces compile such intelligence and store it on computers. But making full use of it in the heat of battle has never been easy. This is now poised to change, thanks to display technology known as augmented reality (AR).
AR is the art of superimposing computer graphics on a view of the real world. It is popular in applications ranging from video games to selling furniture. America’s army would like tactical intelligence pertinent to a soldier’s mission to pop up similarly on a transparent visor attached to his helmet, no hands required. And for this capability, it is spending big. In March it announced a deal with Microsoft to build such a system. This could, over the course of a decade, cost a staggering $21.9bn.

The army has dubbed the kit IVAS (Integrated Visual Augmentation System). David Marra, who runs Microsoft’s end of the project, describes it as a holographic computer. The displays produced, he says, appear “locked to the real world”, even as a wearer moves and shifts gaze.
IVAS pulls off this wizardry by crunching and synthesising several types of data. A GPS receiver locates the wearer within centimetres. Instruments fitted with accelerometers and gyroscopes provide information on how he is moving around. Cameras track eye movements. IVAS must also be aware of a soldier’s environment. This relies on lidar, an optical equivalent of radar. An array of sensors record the time it takes infrared laser pulses bounced off nearby objects to return. That allows those objects’ distances to be calculated. Machine-vision software that recognises those objects then keeps track of how they move. Mr Marra describes the process as a “continuous rendering of the xyz co-ordinates of everything”.
IVAS must calculate with extraordinary speed where on a headset’s visor to display graphics. A latency of just seven milliseconds risks causing vestibular ocular discomfort, a type of dizziness that has long plagued the development of realistic displays of augmented and virtual reality. In most circumstances, Mr Marra says, IVAS operates well within that limit.
Theatre of war
To build the system, Microsoft has modified an AR headset called HoloLens that it has so far sold mostly to businesses and research outfits. The militarised version of this has been “ruggedised” and souped up with a computing and battery “puck”, a bit bigger than a smartphone, that the user carries on his chest.
Tactical intelligence can be uploaded before an operation, with updates transmitted wirelessly as needed. AR text and graphics guide soldiers through unfamiliar terrain, highlight the whereabouts of friendly forces and mark the enemy’s known and suspected positions. The headsets will also employ facial-recognition technology to append information on possible persons of interest who come into view. As Susan Fung, the army’s deputy head of IVAS technology at Fort Belvoir, in Virginia, puts it, soldiers freed of the need to look down at a screen will be able to “focus on moving and engaging targets”.
IVAS will also exchange data with Azure, Microsoft’s computing cloud. This will permit additional features, such as language interpretation, to be included. Production of the headsets, which weigh about a kilogram, has begun. The first of an expected 120,000 or so units are to be deployed this year.
Others besides the army are also interested. America’s marine corps is a partner in the IVAS programme. Undisclosed allies are seeking to join. And modified HoloLenses may also see use on warships. Britain’s Royal Navy has paid $25.5m to BAE Systems, a local defence giant, to adapt them to show pictures currently displayed on screens on the bridge to officers elsewhere on a vessel.
The benefits of AR may be even greater inside tanks, from which crew typically peer at the world through periscopes. That, says Daniel Covzhun, chief technologist at Limpid Armor, an AR firm in Kiev, Ukraine, is like viewing the world “through a length of metal pipe”. Limpid’s system, dubbed LPMK, superimposes graphics on video images collected by cameras and infrared sensors mounted on an armoured vehicle, and will soon be able to do the same for images relayed by nearby flying drones.
A handful of armoured vehicles belonging to Ukraine’s army have already been fitted with test versions of LPMK. Before an operation, these are fed intelligence from a battle-management system. Commanders choose what they wish to be marked with icons, says Colonel Vadym Slyusar of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Armament and Military Equipment, in Kiev. Options include sewers and other underground infrastructure, preferred landing zones for medical-evacuation helicopters, culturally important buildings, and spots where attacks have been recorded or are feared. The systems start at about $50,000. Ukraine recently ordered more than 50 for delivery this autumn. The United Arab Emirates and an undisclosed Asian country have placed orders with Limpid, too.
AR can also expand the capabilities of optical gear already used by soldiers. In September 2019 the American army began to use a new AR feature added to its Enhanced Night Vision Goggle—Binoculars (ENVG-B), which are attached to a soldier’s helmet and flip down over his eyes when needed. The new feature, made by L3 Harris, a firm in Florida, highlights sources of heat and amplifies what light is available to render objects visible in the dark.
ENVG-B works out the portion of the world within its wearer’s field of view. It then superimposes icons on things like friendly and enemy troops, or the route to a rally point, drawing their co-ordinates from a wireless network called Nett Warrior. Soldiers especially like an AR mode called “rapid target acquisition”, says Lynn Bollengier, head of “integrated vision” at L3 Harris. This pulls data from an inertial-measurement unit in a soldier’s rifle to place crosshairs over whatever it is pointing at. That means a soldier can shoot from behind a corner without sticking his head out to put an eye to the rifle’s sight. America’s army and marine corps have bought more than 6,000 of the systems..
A sight to behold
This is heady stuff. Even so, enhancing combat operations with AR will remain, for some time, beyond all but the most technologically sophisticated armies. Marcel Baltzer, of the Fraunhofer Institute’s campus in Wachtberg, who co-chairs an AR-research team for Germany’s armed forces, believes that even the European armies most advanced in the art (which are, by his reckoning, those of Britain, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Norway) will need another decade. Using AR for training, and for the maintenance and design of military hardware, he adds, is easier and will become common sooner.
Ambition, at any rate, is not lacking. Mojo Vision, a new Californian firm that has received money from DARPA, an American government military-research agency, is developing an AR system embedded in contact lenses. Tiny batteries power sensors that track a wearer’s gaze and the movement of objects in view. An array of LEDs roughly the size of a grain of sand projects images received via a wireless link onto the wearer’s retina. The brightness of these is adjusted according to the ambient light. Steve Sinclair, Mojo’s head of marketing, expects a usable version of the system to be ready in a few years’ time.
Whether or not that proves feasible, the use of AR of any sort in combat will introduce risks. Designers must identify the point at which further visual augmentation will lead to confusing information overload—and what happens in training may not mirror the messiness of real battle. An imprecise data overlay could lead to a blunder. And if an AR system proves hackable, soldiers could be tricked by the enemy, with grim consequences.
A different sort of pitfall also looms. AR will make it easier for distant commanders to tell soldiers in battle what to do. The risk is that officers sitting far away from the fight will “feel like they’ve got puppets on the ground”, says Axel Dyèvre, of Avisa Partners, a consultancy based in Paris that has studied AR for France’s defence ministry. He calls the phenomenon a “squashing of chains of command” which robs troops of the degree of autonomy needed to fight effectively. AR for combat, then, offers perils as well as promise. ■",2
1509,"FRENCH OFFICIALDOM is abuzz with preparations for the PFUE, which the MEAE and SGAE are organising for the PR in 2022. Lost? Spare a thought for the outsider who must daily navigate the French passion for acronyms and initialisms. All countries use them, but France has a particular penchant. The latest (PFUE) refers to the French Presidency of the European Union, which starts in January 2022 (and is in fact the presidency of the Council of the European Union). No matter. The abbreviation is already everywhere, and, as the opening sentence says, officials from the foreign ministry and a secretariat in the prime minister’s office are preparing this occasion for the president.
The preference of the French for abbreviations is so ingrained that they scarcely notice it. Britain may have its NHS, or America NASA. France has them for every part of life: transport (TGV, RER, SNCF), politics (PS, EELV, LREM, LFI, RN (formerly the FN) and LR), unions (CGT, CFDT), work (SMIC, CDD, CDI, CSE, RTT), the police (BRI, RAID), taxes (CSG, URSSAF, IFI). The principle seems simple: why use a word like budget when an abbreviation like PLF (projet de loi de finances) will do?

What is behind this zeal? Some date it to the organisation of the modern state in the late 19th century, when bodies such as unions (CGT) or the political movements that later joined together as the SFIO, the precursor to the Socialist Party (PS), emerged, and with them the complex names that deserved shortening. Perhaps it is also the result of the state’s tendency to bureaucratic complication; an acronym can simplify rather than confuse. So the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (the national railway) becomes the less indigestible SNCF.
The fact that practitioners of such an elegant language infect it with such abominations has not gone unnoticed. The Académie Française, which polices such matters, recommends that when it comes to acronyms “moderation is a good thing and abuse dangerous.” Curiously, one of the few spheres in which the French leave prolix descriptions alone is food. No CDC for confit de canard, nor BDV for blanquette de veau. Organisational or bureaucratic life, it seems, is to be tolerated and shortened. Gastronomy can take its time.

1510,"IT HAS BEEN a summer of unpleasant surprises for the world economy. America, Europe and China are growing more slowly than investors had hoped. Consumer prices are rising uncomfortably fast, especially in America. Even in the euro area, used to tepid inflation, prices in August were 3% higher than a year earlier, the most in a decade. Economies are troubled by shortages of parts and labour, slow and expensive shipping and the bewildering variation of lockdown measures.
The spread of the Delta variant is to blame, but the way the pandemic is affecting the economy is shifting. The world had become accustomed to the virus battering growth, as waves of infection caused a sudden stop in activity, and prices moderated or even fell. Delta, by contrast, looks like a stagflationary force that is sapping growth less dramatically but firing up inflation.

Delta is weighing on consumer spending in the rich world but not causing a collapse. In countries with lots of vaccine, cases are no longer doing as much to stop consumers from moving around. Europe’s service sector has reopened amid its Delta wave.
Consumers seem less scared of the disease even if there are enough unvaccinated people to fill up hospitals. A year ago the number of diners in American restaurants was nearly half the level in 2019. Now service is about 10% down, even though hospitals are three times fuller. In Japan a state of emergency covering Tokyo does not seem to be keeping consumers away from the shops. Only in countries with draconian policies aimed at eliminating the virus are people stuck at home. Australia and New Zealand face new recessions as a result of their lockdowns and China’s service sector appears to be shrinking.
Meanwhile, the spread of Delta continues to interfere with the global supply of goods just as consumers, especially Americans, are intent on buying more cars, devices and sporting gear than ever. Outbreaks in South-East Asian countries with low rates of vaccination are causing production plants and logistics networks to shut down temporarily, prolonging the disruption to supply chains. In America retailers, including Gap and Nike, have lobbied the White House to donate more vaccines to Vietnam, so crucial have its factories become to their businesses. Shortages are driving up prices.

The changing relationship between the virus and the economy has implications for policymakers. They will not be able to repeat the trick from earlier in the pandemic of restricting people’s movement as a way to contain the spread of the virus, while at the same time unleashing stimulus to create a compensating boom in demand for goods.
A service-sector revival is now the only quick route to fast growth because that is where the slack is. In the second quarter of the year spending on services by American households was about 3% below its level in 2019 in real terms. Should the spread of Delta interfere with service industries such as leisure and hospitality, more stimulus will only create more inflation.
It is also harder to argue that fear of the virus scares consumers off spending, and that government restrictions to slow the spread of disease therefore have little extra economic cost. A weaker link between cases and people’s movement, and the necessity of service-sector growth, raise the cost of lockdowns. If pressure on hospitals causes even highly vaccinated countries like Britain to restrict services over the winter, the economic damage will be large and the benefits smaller. The Delta wave may subside soon, easing the pressure on the world economy. If it does not or another variant takes its place, the trade-offs involved in fighting the virus will become harder to justify. ■

1511,"MALE BIRDS are often colourful and ornate. These embellishments demonstrate the wearer is a suitable candidate for fatherhood and is not to be trifled with by other males. Why females are sometimes colourful too is more of a mystery.
One idea is that if the sexes co-operate to raise their young—which birds often do—males as well as females must be choosy about their mates. But Jay Falk of the University of Washington has another explanation. In a paper in Current Biology he suggests it is a way for females to avoid being harassed when they are feeding.

Plumage transvestism, known technically as female-limited polymorphism, is especially common in hummingbirds. Earlier work involving Dr Falk, who was then a PhD student at Cornell University, showed that it has evolved independently in all nine big groups of these birds and is found in nearly a quarter of hummingbird species. This makes them ideal for studying it. But that work was done on museum specimens. Mr Falk, as he then was, wished to take the question into the field.
His reason for doubting sexual selection as the explanation for female-limited polymorphism in hummingbirds was that males of this group do not help raise the young. He therefore tested an alternative—that male-like plumage in females confuses real males. To do so, he decamped to Panama, and spent four years studying a species called the white-necked jacobin.
He started by collecting and recording the details of a lot of birds, eventually fitting some with tiny transponders so that he could follow and identify individuals. Over the course of the study, he captured 436 jacobins, of which he managed to recapture 135 in at least one subsequent year.
Sexing hummingbirds is hard. As with most avians, the males have no penis. To work out a bird’s sex, he took a blood sample. This showed that nearly 30% of females had male-like colouration. A jacobin’s age, though, is easy to estimate from its beak. Younger birds’ beaks have more serrations. On this basis, he discovered that all young jacobins, regardless of sex, sport male-like plumage. Only later in life do some females develop distinctive muted colouration—a fact confirmed by some of the recaptures, which had changed plumage in the intervening period.
This is the reverse of normal for sexual selection, in which there is no point in immature individuals pretending they are mature, nor mature females pretending to be males. So he carried out experiments at hummingbird feeding stations filled with sugarwater to try to find out what benefits adult-male-like plumage brings.
First, he put pairs of stuffed hummingbirds by these stations—mixing males, females with male plumage, and females with female plumage—and recorded how they were treated. A clear pattern emerged. As might be expected, stuffed females in female plumage received a lot of sexual attention from males, whilst those in male plumage were spared. More surprisingly, they were also on the receiving end of more aggression, perhaps because males see females as easier to drive away from contested food sources. Both courtship and hostility, though, distract from the serious business of feeding, and are therefore harmful.
He then started varying the amount of sugar in the sugarwater, while measuring the frequency and length of visits to feeders. Female birds with male-like plumage, he discovered, fed more frequently and for longer than those with muted colours. At feeders with higher sugar concentrations, the difference was yet more pronounced—probably because, the stakes being higher, birds with muted colours were experiencing more harassment.
And that, perhaps, explains why hummingbirds as a group have evolved female-limited polymorphism so often—for, of all known vertebrates, they have the highest metabolic demand per gram of body weight. Anything detracting from feeding will get short shrift from natural selection. If looking like an adult male while actually being juvenile, female or both gets the job done, such plumage will evolve.
The remaining puzzle is why some adult females, having adopted the disguise as juveniles, then go on to abandon it. Perhaps the muted female colours make them less conspicuous to predators, especially at their nests. But polymorphisms of this sort are normally maintained because each option is advantageous when rare in a population, and disadvantageous when common. The details of how such a trade-off—between access to food and protection from predators—would work in this case remain unclear. Dr Falk has therefore only half-answered the question he set out to investigate. Answering the other half might require another trip to Panama. ■

1512,"Cricket whistleblower Azeem Rafiq has been accused of sending 'creepy' Whatsapp messages to a teenage girl who has gone public with her allegations.
Gayathri Ajith, 16 at the time, told the Yorkshire Post she received texts from the former Yorkshire cricketer about kissing her and inviting her to dinner after meeting her on a flight from Manchester to Dubai in 2015.
Rafiq last week apologised for sending anti-semitic messages on Facebook after his description of racism he experienced at Yorkshire Cricket Club named several top players at the top of the sport. 
In shocking testimony before MPs, Rafiq broke down in tears as he made racial discrimination claims against Tim Bresnan, Matthew Hoggard, Alex Hales, Gary Ballance and David 'Bumble' Lloyd. 
The spin bowler turned racism whistleblower also claimed the word P*** was 'used constantly' during his time at Yorkshire CCC as he gave explosive testimony to MPs.
In one shocking claim, he gave a harrowing account of having red wine forced down his throat by older players at his local team when he was 15 and a devout Muslim - before he drank more heavily from 2012 'to try to fit in'.  
But Rafiq is now the subject of further claims about his character from local Yorkshire media after his whistleblowing sent shockwaves through the sport. 
Ms Ajith claimed she received the messages from the former Yorkshire cricketer, who was then aged 24, in December 2015.  
According to the messages, Mr Rafiq told the girl: 'u know what I wanted to do on the plane?. 
The message continued: 'I want to grab you push u up against wall and kiss you.'
Ms Ajith also alleges that Mr Rafiq had asked her to join him for dinner in Dubai. 
She said she had told the cricketer that she was 17 to 'appear a bit older' and so she could join him having a vodka and coke while onboard the aircraft. 
After receiving the messages, Ms Ajith responded: 'Do you realise that I'm only 17?' 
It is alleged Mr Rafiq responded: 'Does tht mean it not allowed to want to kiss me... wud u have let me kiss u?'
Ms Ajith, who is now 22, said the messages appeared 'creepy'. Responding to the proposition, Ms Ajith replied: 'How do I know that you're not some absolute pervert?'
Speaking to the Yorkshire Post last night, a spokesperson for Rafiq's legal team said: 'This was put to us late on a Friday evening. We need to look into this, so cannot comment further for now.' 
His legal team have since confirmed they are looking into the case but declined to comment further when pressed by MailOnline. 
Speaking to the Yorkshire Post, Ms Asjith added: 'I was just kind of shocked by the crudity of those messages. They were just so vulgar.
'I'm not disputing any of his racism claims, because I'm sure they're very true experiences. But certain aspects of what he said just don't really sit right with me.
'If he was being forced to drink by his teammates, then surely that wouldn't then mean he would be drinking alone on a flight and encouraging a 17-year-old girl to be drinking with him.'  
The former Yorkshire spinner, widely praised for highlighting racial discrimination in cricket, appeared before a parliamentary select committee this week to lift the lid on his own experience but has been forced to confront his own past shortcomings.
Ahead of a game-wide meeting due to take place at The Oval on Friday, an historic exchange with former Warwickshire and Leicestershire player Ateeq Javid in which Rafiq made offensive remarks was uncovered by The Times.
'I am ashamed of this exchange and have now deleted it so as not to cause further offence,' the 30-year-old wrote on Twitter.
'I was 19 at the time and I hope and believe I am a different person today. I am incredibly angry at myself and I apologise to the Jewish community and everyone who is rightly offended by this.
'At no point will I ever try and defend the indefensible. For those I have hurt I am sincerely sorry.
'I will continue to front up and own any more mistakes I have made.'
In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, he said: 'The circumstances do differ. I don't think I've ever played with anyone Jewish, so it was not exactly the same. But I don't want to play it down. I've hurt people. My genuine feeling is that I deserve the flak. I f***ed up.'
But he told the newspaper that his comments were not equivalent to the racist abuse he suffered, pointing out that he had red wine forced into his mouth when his Muslim faith prevented him from drinking booze.
Rafiq told the JC: 'I'm deeply sorry. I don't recall making any other antisemitic remarks, but I'll go back and think about it. People are going to go through my whole life looking for things I've done. I admit I've made mistakes.'
 A spokesperson for Mr Rafiq told MailOnline: 'This was put to us late on a Friday evening. We need to look into this, so cannot comment further for now.'
Azeem Rafiq today begged British Jews to forgive him as he admitted he 'f***ed up' and 'deserves the flak' over anti-Semitic tropes sent in messages to a teammate - but the ex-cricketer insisted his words 'do differ' from the racism he suffered for years at Yorkshire.
Mr Rafiq made the offensive remarks about Atif Sheikh, an Asian cricketer who was playing for Derbyshire, who they accused of not paying a dinner bill because 'he is a Jew'.
Rafiq, then 19, wrote on Facebook: 'Hahaha he is a Jew. Probs go after my 2nds again.' He later added: 'How wrong is that? Only Jews do that sort of s**t.' 
In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, he said: 'The circumstances do differ. I don't think I've ever played with anyone Jewish, so it was not exactly the same. But I don't want to play it down. I've hurt people. My genuine feeling is that I deserve the flak. I f***ed up.'

1513,"AT 107 METRES, the three carbon-fibre blades of a Haliade-X marine wind turbine are longer than the wingspan of any airliner ever made. The generator which transforms their rotation—over 300km an hour at the tip—into power requires over 100 powerful magnets made of exotic metals and untold lengths of coiled-up copper. The blades, generator and associated gubbins, weighing around 900 tonnes all-in, have to be installed on a pylon so tall that the blade-tips reach almost as high above the waves as the pinnacle of the Transamerica Pyramid rises over the 600 block of San Francisco’s Montgomery Street.
In May, President Joe Biden’s administration announced the approval of Vineyard Wind, a wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts which will require GE, an American industrial giant, to supply 60 of these airliner-skyscraper-stick-insect hybrids. With a planned capacity of 800 megawatts (MW) Vineyard Wind would on its own increase America’s offshore-wind capacity by a factor of roughly 25. But it will not be on its own. Mr Biden has set a target of 30,000MW (30 gigawatts, GW) of offshore wind by 2030, the equivalent of 37 such projects. Britain, China and Germany have ambitions on a similar scale. Bernstein, a research firm, reckons that the world’s offshore-wind capacity may reach 254GW by 2030, more than seven times today’s level.

A decade ago this would have seemed pure fantasy. Today companies are rushing to meet the demand. A battalion of European energy companies led by Equinor, Orsted and Royal Dutch Shell are competing to build in American waters. Equinor is backing a new wind-tower factory in Albany. Dominion Energy, a utility, is teaming up with a Texan shipbuilder to construct a vessel that can install turbines along America’s east coast. In Britain a rush to secure offshore-wind leases in February led to companies bidding so much for the privilege that the returns risk being nugatory.

Similar booms are under way across the world of renewable energy and electric-vehicle making. The reason is simple. Governments have said they want to cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically. Decades of subsidy and support, along with some inspired entrepreneurialism, have made available a range of technologies ready to do so. The time is ripe to push those technologies as hard as possible—both to battle rising temperatures and, governments hope, advance their countries’ role in a new green economy.
However, the fact that wind farms, solar farms and battery-powered vehicles are now cost-competitive does not mean they can be built at whatever pace politicians choose. They require raw materials—sometimes, as with the Haliade-X turbines, in prodigious amounts—siting permits, infrastructure for transmission, recharging and the like. They also need lots of capital. And the necessary materials, sites and capital are all, to various extents in different places, in short supply. The price of lithium has more than doubled in the past year. Copper prices are up by about 70%. Fights are breaking out over permits for new mines, wind and solar farms. Capital remains poorly allocated; while big companies rush for offshore-wind projects around Britain, poorer countries with rising emissions remain starved for investment. If efforts to ease those constraints fail, the world’s decarbonisation plans will stall instead of soar.

The Paris agreement of 2015 calls for a world in which average temperatures never climb more than 2°C above those of the preindustrial age, and ideally rise no further than 1.5°C. To that end most large economies have now committed themselves to “net zero” emissions—a notional state where the amount of greenhouse gas emitted is matched by the amount absorbed by natural and artificial “sinks”—by the middle of the century. In the long term, meeting or even approaching those goals is going to require new technologies, even new industries. But any serious attempt also requires the prompt use of the tools already to hand. Over the coming decade urgent research and development aimed at creating future tools must take place in tandem with a massive deployment of technologies which already exist.
Greenie in a bottle
In the past, such energy transitions have been slow affairs, and also cumulative ones; new technologies such as those of steam and oil added to the total energy budget rather than simply replacing what was there before them. Climate action requires the current transition to be both fast and total. A lack of precedent does not make the challenge impossible. But it reinforces the need for foresight and imagination in trying to overcome impediments.
The deployment of renewable technologies is already, by the standards of the past, a remarkable success. In 2019 installed solar capacity was almost 15 times higher than it was in 2010; for wind power, which got started earlier, the figure was a more modest but still impressive 3.4 times. Building capacity has driven down prices, thus making more capacity affordable and driving prices down further. Over the past decade the “levelised costs” of solar, offshore wind and onshore wind—figures that take into account initial investment in equipment and construction, financing and maintenance—dropped by 83%, 62% and 58% respectively, according to BloombergNEF, a research group. Two-thirds of humankind now lives in countries where wind and solar power offer the cheapest new electrical-generating capacity.
By the standards of the future, though, this is, if not paltry, certainly unsatisfactory. Without further intervention, says Seb Henbest, BloombergNEF’s chief economist, “The natural rate of change is far, far too slow to achieve climate targets.” In May the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental group founded in the 1970s to protect access to fossil fuels, published a report on how to abandon them that underscored Mr Henbest’s message.
Looking at pathways by which the world could reach net zero by 2050, the IEA confirmed that a lot of what was needed in the near term could be done with existing technologies. With a rapid expansion of renewable generation and electric cars through the 2020s electricity and transport could account for more than 70% of the envisaged drop in energy-related emissions. But following this path sees the world of 2030 building wind and solar farms at about four times the pace of 2020. 60% of new-car purchases would have to be electric, compared with about 5% today. Annual clean-energy investment, already at an all-time high, would have to exceed $4trn by 2030, three times its average over the past five years. And the market for key minerals needed to build clean-energy kit would expand nearly seven-fold.

There is an ethereal charm to replacing fuels won from the depths of the Earth with the barely corporeal powers of sun and wind. But doing so at scale still requires millions of tonnes of raw materials to be mined. Batteries depend on cobalt, lithium and nickel; neodymium and other rare-earth elements (which despite their name are not necessarily rare, though some are) make the magnets for electric generators and motors; the veins and arteries of the green economy run with copper.
The supply chains on which this all depends pose at least two big problems. The first is one of concentration. The mining and processing of minerals needed for renewables is far more geographically concentrated than the drilling of oil and gas; that should be troubling to anyone with a sense of how the distribution of fossil fuels has influenced history and geopolitics. Chinese firms control a large share of many crucial mineral supply chains and of the wherewithal for making batteries, a point anxiously underlined in a review of critical supply chains published by the White House on June 8th.

The second problem concerns underinvestment, particularly in metals. Revenues from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, continue to exceed those from the minerals that today’s technologies for providing a cleaner future require (see chart 2). Investment in new projects for lithium, nickel and copper were rising before the pandemic, but at less than $25bn the figure in 2019 was only about 5% of the amount invested on upstream oil and gas. And mines require sustained effort; it can take well over a decade to get one up and running.
If the prospect of huge booms in renewables and electric vehicles has not encouraged investment, price signals produced by shortages as those booms get booming may do better. But there are issues that go beyond price. Some investors find a lot of the mining sector off-putting, either because of genuine ethical concern or because they fear tarnishing their environmental and social credentials. They have a point. Lithium mining in Chile has triggered legal fights over water in the Atacama. More than 70% of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a history of corruption and what the sector euphemistically dubs “artisanal” mining by poor men, women and children.
American, European and Asian politicians are eager to boost mining within their countries’ borders. Their citizens may prove less keen. Environmental opposition to a rare-earths mine in Greenland helped topple the ruling party in an election there in April. In Minnesota conservation groups are worried about a proposed copper-and-nickel mine’s effect on creeks and rivers; in May Mr Biden’s government agreed to reconsider the mine’s permits. Its supply-chain review recommends both easing permitting for new mines and limiting their environmental impact; that looks likely to be a hard balancing act.
Rubbed up the wrong way
Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a research group, recently concluded that in the second half of this decade the world’s lithium demand might be more than twice the level of supply. Truly severe shortages could conceivably reverse the long-term trend towards cheaper batteries. Battery costs have declined by 83% since 2012. But those savings have come more from design and process improvements and economies of scale than from frugality with inputs. Raw materials now represent 50-70% of battery costs, up from 40-50% five years ago, making prices more vulnerable to expensive commodities.
Process changes will still reduce some of the supply gaps. Innovations which spare raw materials can spread very quickly—diamond wire saws, which reduce the amount of silicon wasted in the making of solar cells, went from novelty to industry standard almost overnight. There will be ever more scope for recycling. And there will be substitutions. Driven more by concerns over sustainability than price per se, turbine-makers are moving away from the balsa wood often used in their big blades. Andreas Nauen, the boss of Siemens Gamesa, a turbine manufacturer, says his company will be using foam instead of balsa by the middle of the decade. In February Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, an electric-car maker, called the availability of nickel the “biggest concern” as the business scales up; he would like to swap nickel-based cathodes for ones made with iron.
Ingenuity can be a powerful force. But it cannot be expected always to offset all the effects of the price signals which drive it. And it cannot do everything all at once. Tesla is still interested enough in nickel to have become an adviser to a nickel mine in New Caledonia.
Another potential shortage is land. Researchers at Princeton University have modelled transition pathways which take America to net zero by 2050. They found that the area occupied by solar and wind farms by 2030 might be about 160,000 square kilometres (62,000 square miles). That is less than 2% of the surface area of continental America. But it is around six times the area currently covered by the water in all the country’s reservoirs—or a little more than the area of Illinois.
Land used for wind farms can be used for other farming, too, and turbines have spread across swathes of America’s Great Plains without too much opposition. But for some technologies and places new projects may still depend less on resource abundance than on concern about local impacts and the political heft or legal budgets of those who live nearby. American offshore wind is still in its infancy in part because rich people who enjoy their views of the open ocean have fought hard to smother it in its crib—a cause which, in Massachusetts, has brought together Kennedys and Kochs. The problem is not restricted to well-off countries. In Indonesia, disputes over land rights have seriously slowed the deployment of renewables.
Building infrastructure to deliver green power from panels and pylons in plains and deserts to the places where it is needed faces some of the same challenges. Grids that are both bigger and smarter than today’s are needed to make use of intermittent renewable sources at the scales being envisaged later this decade. “There will be no renewables without networks,” says Armando Martínez, who leads the grid business of Iberdrola, a big utility. The IEA estimates that annual spending on electricity grids should more than triple by 2030.
But hurdles to grid investments remain stubbornly high. Disagreement over the siting of transmission lines from wind farms in Germany’s north to factories and cities in its south has helped sustain southern coal- and gas-fired power stations. In America a transmission line must receive approval from each state it crosses and, in some states, approval from each county. The result is that such projects can take more than a decade to build, if they are built at all. In Vietnam the growth of solar power in recent years has overwhelmed the country’s ability to transmit it to consumers. Forced curtailments of power from solar farms depress their profitability. Upgrades to the grid are sorely needed, but to date there has been little way for the private sector to provide it—Vietnam Electricity, or EVN, has a monopoly over the country’s transmission and distribution.
Lighting the lantern
Such disincentives point to the biggest supply constraint, especially in developing countries: that of capital. Despite rising interest in green investment, serious attempts to meet the Paris goals will require a further surge in finance for green energy and electrification.

The biggest shortfall is in emerging economies other than China, which are expected to account for most of the rise in emissions in the coming decades. Those markets saw just $150bn in clean-energy investment in 2020, down 8% from a year earlier, according to new analysis from the IEA, World Bank and World Economic Forum. In 2019 India attracted just $8bn in clean-energy finance, less than a tenth of China’s total and a sixth of America’s, according to BloombergNEF. Other middle-income and poor countries saw even less investment (see chart 3).
Enel, an Italian utility, is the largest foreign investor in green energy in emerging markets. To warrant the company’s investment, according to Francesco Starace, its boss, a country must have natural resources, such as ample sun or wind, be in need of infrastructure and, most important, “It has to have a legal and regulatory framework we can trust.” A survey by BloombergNEF found that, on average, countries without policies to support clean energy, such as auctions for supply and liberalised electricity sectors, attract one-seventeenth as much clean-energy investment as emerging markets with clearer policies. Government support of entrenched domestic coal production and use, as in India and Indonesia, muddies prospects further.

Regulatory and political uncertainties push a country’s levelised costs up. Renewable projects have low operating costs (the sun and wind are free) but require a lot of capital upfront. And in many emerging markets capital is expensive. The average cost of capital for a wind project in Indonesia is about four times that of one in Germany. Investors and politicians in rich countries claim to want to help, but they are not yet doing enough. Signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment, convened by the UN, aim to promote sustainable finance, but some 90% of signatories are not active in emerging markets. Rich countries have failed to provide the $100bn a year in climate finance that they promised developing countries in Paris.
Politicians and investors are just starting to face these constraints. The G7 meeting on June 11th-13th may see well-targeted green aid announced. Vietnam is contemplating reforms to encourage private investment in its grid. Investors are working to harmonise disclosure of climate risks; governments may do the job for them. The most important catalyst to broader green investment, argues Ed Morse of Citigroup, a bank, would be pricing to account for the environmental and social costs of carbon.
Such measures point to a new phase in the green revolution. The engineering which allows the spinning blades of a single wind turbine to power a thousand homes, or uses lithium from desiccated lake beds to store power from sunlight in the floor of a sedan, is remarkable. But it has to be fed the materials it needs, found places to stand, integrated into the rest of the world’s infrastructure and paid for. Innovation and investment in mining, pressure on the politics of land use and new catalysts for private investment, especially in emerging markets, are less iconic. But they are no less necessary.■

1514,"A gunman opened fire outside a Southern California mall Friday night, killing one man and wounding two others, including a child.
Witnesses said a man was found unresponsive near the entrance to the Mall of Victor Valley in Victorville after shots were fired near the shopping center.
First responders provided CPR to the victim, but despite their efforts, he was pronounced dead at the scene, the Victor Valley News Group reported.
The gunman also left at least two others injured, including a minor, and taken to the hospital by ambulance. Their current conditions are unknown.
An employee at nearby Desert Valley Hospital told the Daily Press, on the basis of anonymity, that juvenile was 8 years old and had been flown from the local facility to Loma Linda University Medical Center.     
The gunman remained on the loose as authorities investigated the incident.
Police in Victorville, located in San Bernardino County about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, responded to the mall around 7.51pm local time after receiving reports of shots fired.
Officials reportedly found the deceased victim's body near the Red Robin restaurant at the mall. His identity has not been released.
Shoppers were placed on a brief lockdown while police investigated.
‘They put up caution tape and told us that the area was on lockdown,’ witness Leanne Anderson, 25, told the Daily Press. ‘Later, we saw three ambulances speeding away from the mall.’
She added that a sheriff’s deputy also said they were looking for an ‘active shooter’ and that the surrounding businesses were also on lockdown.
Victorville Police Department, confirming the incident on Twitter, said no further details, including a suspect description, were available at this time. ",-2
1515,"THE MIGRANTS had nowhere to go. Behind them stood Belarus’s brutal security officers, before them rows of Polish soldiers. Mostly Iraqi Kurds, they had been lured to Minsk, Belarus’s capital, with promises of passage to Germany, then dumped in the forests, told to breach the border fence and beaten if they did not. On November 16th the Belarusians moved hundreds of them to a border crossing. Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s dictator, hoped that by provoking violence he could embarrass Poland and divide the EU, which imposed sanctions after he stole an election. When migrants threw stones, the Poles sprayed them with water cannon.
Mr Lukashenko’s use of helpless migrants as propaganda tools is a problem for the EU, but mostly not in the way he hopes. Rather, his border crisis complicates the European Commission’s conflict with Poland over the rule of law. Since coming to office in 2015, Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has passed laws that give the government power over the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that these laws violate EU rules about judicial independence and must be rolled back. After years of dithering, the commission has begun to enforce those judgments. Now it must balance supporting Poland on border security with keeping up the pressure on judicial matters.

Poland’s takeover of its judiciary is modelled on that of Hungary, Europe’s pioneer of illiberal democracy. PiS changed the rules governing its National Judicial Council, which picks judges, so that its members are named by parliament and the minister of justice, with no input from judges themselves. The ECJ has ruled that since the council is no longer independent, judges appointed under the new rules are not judges under EU law.
Many of them are poorly qualified PiS loyalists. PiS has packed the constitutional court and set up a disciplinary chamber of the supreme court that can punish judges for rulings it dislikes. The ECJ ordered Poland to disband the disciplinary chamber. The government says it will, but has yet to present a plan to that end.
This rule-of-law conflict threatens the very structure of the EU. In October, trying to wriggle out of the ECJ’S judgments, Poland’s constitutional court ruled that the articles of the union’s founding treaty dealing with judicial independence violate the Polish constitution. That challenged the principle that European law supersedes national law, without which the union would have little power. “We would be like the UN,” says an EU official.
The commission has some new tools of persuasion. Until it scraps the disciplinary chamber, Poland is accruing fines of €1m ($1.1m) a day. PiS is counting on €36bn from the EU’s new covid-19 recovery fund to bankroll its ambitious infrastructure and social-welfare plans. But that fund has a clause that blocks the money until the commission certifies that recipient countries comply with the rule of law. The commission could attach a list of specific conditions to Poland’s grants.
On November 15th Iustitia, an organisation of independent Polish judges, put out a proposal to restore the rule of law, including implementing all the ECJ rulings and giving judges back their voice on the National Council of the Judiciary. Some EU countries will press for such conditions, notably the Netherlands, which insisted on the rule-of-law clause. But Germany is more reluctant. Meanwhile Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland’s unrepentant justice minister, is trying to use the disbanding of the disciplinary chamber as an excuse for more changes, including a review of the credentials of every judge in the country. State-run television portrays the conflict as “an offensive of the ECJ against Poland”.
The migrant crisis is just as thorny. The EU and America have persuaded nearly all the airlines and transit countries that Mr Lukashenko used to bring in migrants to stop co-operating. The EU approved new sanctions this week on Belarusian individuals and firms, and could block trade entirely to deter Mr Lukashenko. That could limit the problem to the estimated 12,000-15,000 migrants already in Belarus—a fraction of the number who enter Italy across the Mediterranean each year.
EU and international law obliges countries to let people in to request asylum, so Poland’s pushbacks are illegal; some migrants have already died of exposure. The Poles have refused help from Frontex, the EU’s border agency, which can evaluate asylum claims fast. Marcin Przydacz, a deputy foreign minister, notes that few migrants apply for asylum in Poland; they want to get to Germany. Western officials hope to press Belarus to let UN agencies and NGOs offer humanitarian aid to the migrants there. Letting them cross might encourage more to come and reward the propaganda strategy of Mr Lukashenko and his sponsor, Vladimir Putin.
The commission may now postpone action on the rule of law in Poland until the border calms down. Failing to show solidarity could turn Poles against the EU and weaken their prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, a relative moderate and rival of Mr Ziobro. But a complete rollback of the government’s control over the judiciary is likely only if PiS loses the next election in 2023, says Stanislaw Biernat, a former judge on the constitutional court.
As for the migrants, they are losing hope that anyone will help them. As one put it, “The Poles will never have mercy on us, nor will the Belarusians have mercy on us. We are stuck between them.” ■",2
1516,"AS WELL AS a louche mystique, there has always been something murky about advertising. From P.T. Barnum’s “Mammoth Fat Infant: only three years old and weighing 196 POUNDS” to three-martini lunches at the dawn of the TV era, it was never quite clear whether the adman was artist, scientist, strong-livered schmoozer or con man. For all the wit and wiliness on Madison Avenue, the economic cycle had a much more direct impact on ad spending. And it was a wonder companies embraced the medium at all. As far back as 1904, the Atlantic, an American magazine, wrote that an estimated 75% of advertisements did not pay; yet the other 25% paid so well “there is scarcely a businessman who is prepared to stand idly by.”
In the digital age the guesswork should have become a thing of the past. User IDs, device-tracking technology and electronic marketplaces handling billions of transactions a day have turned the targeting of individuals into a drone strike rather than a hit-or-miss barrage. Costs have come down, so millions of online businesses, instead of renting premises, have turned digital ads into the Yellow Pages on steroids. People are spending more time glued to screens, giving advertisers more scope to seduce them. The result has been stunning growth. MoffettNathanson, a research firm, says digital ads have grown from 27% of all dollars spent on advertising in America in 2015 to 52% (TV, the second-biggest category, has dropped from 42% to 33%). Until recently, the main question asked on Wall Street was not whether the feast would continue but how soon the digital share would reach 80%?

For the first time, the past week has dented those convictions. On October 21st Snap, a photo-sharing platform, revealed that it had been caught flat-footed in the third quarter by new privacy measures introduced by Apple to enable users of iPhones and its other devices to stop advertisers tracking them across the web. Though revenues of $1.07bn were only just shy of expectations, it lost a quarter of its value in a day. Facebook, a social-media giant, recorded $28.3bn in ad revenues, a third higher than the prior year, but that was lower than expected. It is having to increase spending next year partly to improve its targeting and measurement techniques to counteract Apple’s restrictions. Alphabet, which owns Google, bucked the trend, recording its highest sales growth in more than a decade in the third quarter; its search engine, source of almost all of its ad revenue, seems immune to Apple’s changes.
For all of them, the underlying digital-ad market still looked vibrant. But their divergent performances raise three big questions about the future of advertising. For all its aura of precision, it’s an industry still full of unknowns.
The first one concerns the correlation between advertising and economic growth. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital, an advertising agency, notes that digital ads easily outperformed their analogue counterparts during the pandemic, indicating a break in the age-old link with GDP because of a structural shift as the economy moves online. But whether that shift continues is a matter of faith, not fact. Economic factors may already be re-emerging. Both Facebook and Snap said tangled supply chains would diminish the incentives to advertise in the lucrative holiday period because of fewer goods on shelves. Moreover, even if the link with GDP has frayed, online ads appear to correlate closely with growth in e-commerce, which Facebook says is slowing as the pandemic fades. In America, there is growing evidence that consumer confidence is on the wane, which could affect one of the biggest factors believed to be fuelling the ad boom—the explosion of new businesses, many of them small-time online retailers.
The second unknown is the extent to which consumers will continue to tolerate advertisers stalking them. According to Flurry, an app-analytics firm, only about one in five app users have opted in to being tracked since Apple’s iOS 14.5 launch in April gave them the option to choose. That suggests a keen embrace of privacy, which vindicates Apple’s hunch. That said, Apple may be benefiting at its rivals’ expense. The opt-in only applies to third-party apps. Meanwhile Apple’s advertising business is booming, especially in relation to searches on its App Store, according to Bernstein, an investment firm. Moreover, its privacy push is provoking rivals, such as Facebook, to make counter-moves into virtual-reality headsets and 3D digital worlds it calls the metaverse, in order to create a parallel universe to that dominated by Apple. Bernstein’s Mark Shmulik calls such domains “walled gardens”. If consumers discover they are just a way of better bombarding them with ads, the gardens will soon feel more like prisons.
The third unknown is the firms paying for all the ads. The tech giants provide little detail about where they come from, what size of firms they are, and on what they are spending their money. The result is a lot of frustrating sleuthing and guesswork. Brian Wieser of GroupM, the world’s largest media buyer, estimates from Facebook’s billing-address data that Chinese manufacturers selling abroad account for approaching $10bn of advertising on the social network this year. He points to third-party data suggesting that more than 40% of Amazon’s marketplace sellers are from China, but Amazon does not disclose such information. There is scant reporting quantifying the number of small versus large advertisers, and whether they are paying for brand-related advertising or for direct sales. The industry remains as murky as ever.
From grey-flannel suits to just flannel
The platforms promise precision to their advertisers based on consumers’ data. But they fail to reveal anything like enough information to enable outsiders to gauge the robustness of the digital-ad craze. The result, shared by many in the industry, is blithe optimism that the market will continue to grow like Topsy. The past few days have provided a welcome opportunity to re-examine that thought. ■

1517,"AS OMENS GO, it was a bad one. On May 23rd, less than two weeks ahead of Peru’s presidential run-off election, 16 people were massacred in a remote village in an area known as “VRAEM”, the valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro rivers, where coca is grown. The area has been under a state of emergency since 2003.
The motive of the killers remains unclear. The authorities in Lima rushed to blame remnants of the Shining Path, a radical left-wing insurgency. Leaflets justifying the murders were left behind with the bodies. In the 1980s and 1990s the Shining Path was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. However, the mayor of Vizcatán del Ene district, where the massacre took place, told reporters that he thought drug traffickers were more likely to be responsible (though both could be true). The violence throws a grenade into Peru’s already tumultuous election.

On one side is Pedro Castillo, a rural school teacher who briefly shot to fame in 2017 when he led a long teachers’ strike. He is the candidate of Free Peru, a hard-left party. On the other is Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, who as president in 1990-2000 defeated the Shining Path, but who has been serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and other abuses since 2009. Mr Castillo and Ms Fujimori were never expected to reach the run-off. Neither polled well in the first round campaign. But in a crowded field of 18 candidates on April 11th, they came top, with 19% and 13% respectively, putting them through to the final vote.
Ms Fujimori had already been making much of Mr Castillo’s supposed Marxism. Billboards across Lima encourage people to vote against communism. On May 25th, after the massacre, she accused him of having ties to the militants she considers responsible, and thereby of threatening her father’s legacy. Mr Castillo denies any such connections. His supporters say he is not a communist. But a newly elected congressman from Free Peru, Guillermo Bermejo, is on trial for terrorism for collaboration with the Shining Path 13 years ago. (He calls the accusations “pure fantasy”.) He has been taped saying that if his party takes power, “we’re not going to give it up...we prefer to stay to establish a revolutionary process in Peru.” Mr Castillo has not rebuked him.
Ms Fujimori has problems of her own. She has been arrested three times and spent more than a year in prison in pre-trial detention on charges of accepting illegal campaign donations. She was released a year ago as part of a scheme to curb the spread of covid-19 in jails. The Castillo campaign argues that Ms Fujimori would turn the state into a patronage machine to benefit the rich and well-connected. Ms Fujimori says that she is innocent and the victim of political persecution.
Whoever wins on June 6th will face a mistrustful population and a fractured Congress, with ten parties splitting the 130 seats in the unicameral legislature. Thanks to a series of scandals and political feuds, Peru has rattled through four presidents in the past five years. This election may not end the instability. ■",2
1518,"JUST TWO months ago, in early June, cases of covid-19 were waning in Israel. With one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, the country seemed to be nearly done with the virus. Masks were discarded and restrictions lifted. But the end was illusory. The spread of the Delta variant has caused a spike in new cases. More than 8,000 were logged on August 17th.
The Delta variant may have entered Israel before Naftali Bennett became prime minister on June 13th, but he has taken a beating over his handling of the outbreak. The government “received the country in the best state in the world in regard to coronavirus”, says Binyamin Netanyahu, who preceded Mr Bennett and is now leader of the opposition. The prime minister, says Mr Netanyahu, has spoiled that success.

Mr Netanyahu’s criticism is self-serving, but for much of July he did call on the government to give Israelis a third dose of the vaccine. On July 29th the government said it would do just that, jabbing those over 60 for a third time—the first country to do so. It has since broadened the policy to those over 50. Some restrictions have also been renewed, such as limits on the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings.
Early data suggest the new jabs do indeed offer more protection from infection. Officials hope they will reduce pressure on hospitals. Mr Bennett is desperate to avoid another lockdown, claiming that the three previous ones, under Mr Netanyahu, had “a direct price in human lives”. The prime minister also fears that Israelis may not abide by a fourth lockdown.
Israelis are already souring on Mr Bennett. According to a recent poll, 43% of them think Mr Netanyahu did a better job of handling the pandemic. Only 21% favoured Mr Bennett. His party, Yamina, was never all that popular. It won just seven seats (out of 120) in the last election. But the coalition opposed to Mr Netanyahu needed Yamina to form a government, so Mr Bennett was offered the top job for two years in order to gain his support.
As part of the coalition agreement, Mr Bennett cannot remove or discipline ministers of other parties. That includes nearly all senior cabinet ministers, most of whom have left Mr Bennett to fend for himself when it comes to the pandemic. Erstwhile rivals, such as Yair Lapid, the foreign minister, and Avigdor Lieberman, the finance minister, rarely attend meetings of the “coronavirus cabinet”.
Mr Bennett is largely to blame for the pressure he is under. In 2020 he positioned himself as Mr Netanyahu’s chief critic, even writing a book, “How to Beat Covid-19”, in which he confidently explained how Israel could adopt a “zero infections” policy. In July he promised to rid the country of the virus in five weeks. Now, though, he is resorting to word games. He has largely stopped saying “coronavirus” in public, preferring “the Delta virus”, in order to convince voters that he is facing an entirely new challenge.
Mr Bennett says, “The pandemic is teaching the whole world a lesson in humility.” Yet he hasn’t stopped personalising the fight against covid-19, much as Mr Netanyahu did. On August 17th he celebrated the fact that a million Israelis had got a third jab, calling it “an expression of trust” in himself. If this wave begins to dwindle soon, Mr Bennett can claim that, unlike Mr Netanyahu, he succeeded without resorting to a lockdown. But if cases continue to rise, he may find himself even more isolated. Health experts are watching the outbreak closely. Politicians are, too. ■

1519,"TYPE THE brand Allbirds into Amazon and any number of woolly shoes are displayed. None, though, belongs to the San Francisco-based shoemaker whose Merino-wool sneakers began the trend. Joey Zwillinger, Allbirds’ co-founder, grumbles about what he calls the “knock-off” shoes he sees on Amazon. But he says that, since the company first started selling online in 2016, it has avoided the online giant, as well as physical wholesalers like Shoe Locker. That strategy is revolutionary in the global shoe industry, with revenues of $80bn in America alone. The rationale is that by avoiding middlemen, whether online or offline, Allbirds can invest in more sustainable materials that go down well with its rich, techie clientele. It also helps it keep tabs on its customers. 
Rather than selling on Amazon, it uses Shopify, an Ottawa-based platform operating in 175 countries that allows it to sell through its own online channels, as well as its physical stores. Yet despite Allbirds’ thirst for independence, Mr Zwillinger is not starry-eyed about the ability of direct-to-consumer (DTC) retailers to resist the gravitational pull of Amazon and other tech platforms. He notes that more than half of all product searches start on Amazon, making it easy to be overlooked (or imitated). Digital advertising needed to start a brand and maintain its popularity is mostly in the hands of a powerful triumvirate of Google, Facebook and Amazon, and its costs are rising. “It’s probably the easiest time in the history of the world to build a business of reasonable size,” he says. Keeping it there is a different matter. “Will a bunch of [DTC] companies be able to overcome the headwinds? The answer is likely to be no,” he says grimly.

For physical retailers, the Amazon effect has been brutal. Many have collapsed, leaving malls and high streets abandoned. In America and Britain, the closure of stores has far exceeded openings in recent years. During the pandemic in 2020, the big ones were particularly hard hit. Goldman Sachs, a bank, says that in Britain, which has a high share of online retail, existing stores have been cannibalised by e-commerce, driving down profit margins.
Not everyone is suffering equally. Big global brands such as Nike or Zara, owned by Inditex, a Spanish retailer, have reputations that encourage customers to find them without their having to fork out a fortune to win loyalty. They can preserve profit margins by keeping supply chains lean, adding RFID identifier tags to ensure clothes can be switched for in-store or online shopping, depending where the demand is, and using their stores as sales points, distribution centres or places to return items. Yet Inditex said last year it would close up to 1,200 stores around the world.
Discount stores, such as Dollar General in America, are thriving. Many continue to open shops. Primark, a low-cost European fashion chain that has eschewed online, is convinced that low prices are such a powerful draw that shoppers will flock back to its shops when lockdowns are lifted. As long as they have a strong brand, “the shop is a much more efficient, lower-cost, lower-carbon method of fulfilment than the little van driving up and down our streets during lockdown,” insists George Weston, boss of Associated British Foods (ABF), Primark’s owner.
Some online-fashion retailers are creating portfolios of brands out of failed physical retailers, on the assumption that, if brands are well-known, it is easy to attract customers. In America Authentic Brands, a New-York based firm, has acquired Brooks Brothers and Barneys. In Britain Boohoo has bought the Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Wallis brands from the failed chain Arcadia.

For digitally native retailers such as Allbirds, one way to expand the  business is to open shops as well as selling online. Mr Zwillinger sees the irony that, although people lament the “retail apocalypse” caused by e-commerce, Allbirds is opening not closing shops. Other digital insurgents doing the same include Warby Parker, a firm of eyewear specialists, and Casper, a mattress-maker. Three Squirrels, a snack company that started as a digital darling in China, now has 300 shops.
The trick is to make the shops not just sales nodes but ways for shoppers to interact with the product. Allbirds finesses what Mr Zwillinger calls the “try-on experience”. It stacks artfully presented shoeboxes in the store, not in a backroom, so fittings are available within seconds, not minutes. Casper offers “nap appointments” on its mattresses. Other swanky retailers talk of curating stores like art galleries. This approach may not work for all income brackets. “Bond Street is lovely, but that’s not how most people shop,” quips ABF’s Mr Weston. Nonetheless, the more impersonally goods are sold online, the more urgent it is that shops stand out for customer service.
One drawback in avoiding Amazon is that it is tiresome for shoppers to toggle between apps belonging to different marques. Mr Zwillinger hopes Shopify may provide an answer by building a virtual storefront where brands can display their wares, as Alibaba’s TMall does in China. Not everyone believes independent brands are fighting an uphill battle against the tech giants. Harley Finkelstein, Shopify’s boss, disputes the idea. “I vehemently disagree that it’s only the big folks that are going to get bigger and I have proof of that,” he insists. He points to brands from Beyond Yoga, a clothing company, to Beyond Meat, a vegan one, that have grown rapidly via Shopify. He says their desire to keep close to their customers, to champion sustainability, and to offer inspiring examples of entrepreneurship all support them. 
That view is shared by Sebastian Siemiatkowski, founder of Klarna, an online-payments platform that works with many DTC brands. He disdains what he calls the “scrolling” nature of much online shopping. He thinks the infrastructure of e-commerce, including online marketplaces, delivery and payments, will become commoditised. But as digitalisation removes friction between buyers and sellers it will create “a more perfect economy” with almost limitless scope for growth. “People totally underestimate how large the internet economy is,” he says. Even Netflix movies could be a sales channel for shoppers keen to buy what they see on screen. Customer-centric innovations (he includes Klarna’s buy-now, pay-later schemes) will be essential for survival.
Strangely, the pandemic has given part of the retail industry least known for innovation, grocery selling, a crash course in reinvention. As one of the fastest-growing online categories around the world in 2020, it has become the next frontier of e-commerce. But do not get your hopes up. The weekly trip to the supermarket will not become a thing of the past. ■",2
1520," (CNN)The NFL's Kansas City Chiefs have reached a financial agreement with the family of the 5-year-old girl who was seriously injured in a crash involving former assistant coach Britt Reid. According to a joint statement by the Chiefs and the family's attorneys, the team will provide the girl, Ariel Young, with ""world-class medical care and long-term financial stability"" for the ""rest of her life."" ""Over the last several months, representatives of the Kansas City Chiefs, Ariel Young and Ariel's family have worked together, alongside medical experts, to develop a plan to take care of Ariel — both now, and for the rest of her life,"" the statement said. ""The Chiefs and Ariel's attorney, Tom Porto, announce today that the parties have finalized a comprehensive care plan that provides Ariel with world-class medical care and long-term financial stability."" ""Ariel's recovery is a long road, but she has made great strides and continues to improve every day,"" it added. ""Earlier this fall, she attended her first day of school.""Ariel suffered a severe traumatic brain injury, a parietal fracture, brain contusions and subdural hematomas in the three-vehicle crash on February 4 when Kansas City, Missouri, police said a Chevrolet Impala was disabled on the ramp of Interstate 435. The driver had called family members for assistance, per police, and family members arrived and parked their vehicle south of the disabled car. A Dodge Ram truck allegedly driven by Reid struck both vehicles, sending two children, including Ariel, to the hospital. Reid was driving his truck at nearly 84 mph less than two seconds before the crash, per the Jackson County, Missouri, prosecutor's office, and a post-accident test showed his blood alcohol concentration to be at .113.Reid pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated in June. According to CNN affiliate KSHB, his trial date is set for April 18, 2022. The Chiefs initially placed Reid, the son of head coach Andy Reid, on administrative leave after the crash. The team did not sign him to a new contract following their loss in Super Bowl LV. ",0
1521,"THERE ARE things that democratic governments are not supposed to do. They are not supposed to change the rules of the game at the last minute because they are going to lose. They are not supposed to make it easier to take money for favours. They are not supposed to force MPs to do things that make them hang their heads in shame. Yet on November 3rd Boris Johnson’s government did all this and more. The father of the House, Peter Bottomley, declared that he could not in conscience vote with his party. Younger Tory MPs with careers still to make looked embarrassed.
On October 26th Parliament’s standards committee issued a damning report on Owen Paterson, a veteran MP and leading Brexiteer. He was guilty of “an egregious case of paid advocacy” and had “brought the House into disrepute”, it said. He should be suspended for 30 days, long enough to trigger a recall if enough voters demanded it. Mr Paterson had lobbied ministers and officials on behalf of two companies, Randox, a clinical-diagnostics firm, and Lynn’s Country Foods, a meat processor and distributor. They paid him more than £100,000 ($137,000) a year between them for consulting work.

The report brought a furious rebuttal from Mr Paterson and a fusillade of complaints from his friends in Parliament and the media. They accused the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, of bias against Tories, particularly Brexiteers, of having used the two-year-long inquiry to torment Mr Paterson (his wife, Rose, took her own life during it) and, in the Daily Telegraph, of wearing a nose-stud and refusing to condemn the IRA.
If the Tories disagreed with the verdict, they could have voted to reject the report or reduce Mr Paterson’s suspension. Instead Dame Andrea Leadsom, a former leader of the Commons, tabled an amendment to create a new committee to fix “potential defects” in the disciplinary system. The government then used its might to rescue Mr Paterson by imposing a three-line whip on its MPs to vote for the amendment.
His allies had little to say about the evidence against him, probably because it was overwhelming. He had lobbied ministers and officials not once but repeatedly, using contacts acquired when he was secretary of state for Northern Ireland and then the environment. He used his parliamentary office for business meetings, and parliament-headed notepaper for lobbying. He claimed in his defence that he raised issues of food safety with the Food Standards Agency. But after that he made further attempts to contact officials and to promote “Randox’s superior technology”. The committee concluded that “no previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of confusion between the private and public interest”.
Instead, Mr Paterson’s supporters criticised the process. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the house, argued that it had denied him the right of appeal as required by “natural justice”, a phrase he and other Tories used with the reverence of Thomist scholars. In fact, the system offers several chances for reconsideration—the standards committee can reject the commissioner’s report and even if it does not, the House of Commons has final say. The committee read all the evidence Mr Paterson presented, and no court is obliged to listen to any and all supporters a defendant nominates.
Whatever the current system’s failings, the government’s plan was worse. The new committee was to dispense with the independent commissioner and consist entirely of MPs, with a built-in Tory majority. It made a nonsense of Mr Rees-Mogg’s talk of an appeals process: what sort of appeal court is controlled by the governing political party? Other parties said that their MPs would refuse to sit on it.
As if to acknowledge these shortcomings, on November 4th the government appeared to back down. It would, Mr Rees-Mogg said, bring about reform on a “cross-party” basis and break the link between Mr Paterson’s case and future cases. Mr Paterson himself resigned as an MP, though he continued to insist he was innocent of wrongdoing.
Today’s system is itself the product of the cash-for-questions imbroglio in 1994 and the parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009. Yet the government is now dismantling it to wish away another money-related scandal. Almost a quarter of the 59 backbenchers who signed Dame Andrea’s amendment had previously been found in breach of parliamentary standards. David Cameron, the prime minister from 2010 to 2016, was recently hauled over the coals for lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital, a financial company that later failed. Yet the government has now protected yet another Tory MP who used his office to lobby.
The Paterson affair looks likely to further undermine public trust in politicians in general and Tories in particular. How will rich rewards for lobbying go down with the Conservative Party’s new working-class voters in northern constituencies? That MPs voted for the amendment by just 250 to 232, despite a government majority of 80 and a three-line whip, suggests many Tory MPs are uneasy. Mr Rees-Mogg closed his speech by saying that “sometimes to do the right thing, one has to accept a degree of opprobrium”. The government has just earned a great deal of opprobrium by doing the wrong thing. ■
Editor’s note (November 4th 2021): This story has been updated since its initial publication",2
1522,"ON THE FIRST day of his two-part inauguration on August 3rd, Ebrahim Raisi regretted that he could not kiss the hand of his mentor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, owing to covid-19 restrictions. But there was no doubting the bond between Mr Raisi, Iran’s new president, and Mr Khamenei, its supreme leader. Both men are hardline clerics who view the world, and the West in particular, with suspicion. “Trusting the West does not yield results,” said Mr Khamenei in the run-up to the ceremony.
Some in Iran may be pushing for confrontation. On July 29th, just days before the inauguration, a drone laden with explosives was flown into the MV Mercer Street, an oil tanker off the coast of Oman managed by an Israeli-owned firm. Two crew members, a Briton and a Romanian, were killed. America, Britain, Israel and Romania blamed Iran, which denied involvement. Saeed Khatibzadeh, an Iranian foreign-ministry spokesman, accused Israel of creating “instability, terror and violence” and warned that “whoever sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind”.

Then, on August 3rd, came another incident in nearby waters (see map). Gunmen boarded a bitumen tanker, the MV Asphalt Princess, and sailed it towards Iran before disembarking some 15 hours later, after the crew reportedly sabotaged the engines. The crew said the assailants were Iranians, according to recordings of communications between the ship and the Emirati coastguard heard by Argus Media, an energy-information firm. Iran denied involvement. The Asphalt Princess is owned by a firm in Dubai that had another vessel hijacked two years ago by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran’s most powerful military force.


Iran and its proxies have exchanged attacks with America, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in recent years. A shadow war between Iran and Israel has also been escalating. Several vessels have been attacked, with each side blaming the other. Israel has struck Iranian positions in Syria and is accused of attacking people and facilities in Iran, sometimes with cyber-weapons. An attack earlier this year on Iran’s main uranium-enrichment complex, in Natanz, using planted explosives, did significant damage.
If the IRGC is behind the attacks on shipping, it will come as no surprise. Its workings are murky, but it often seems to pursue a policy at odds with that of the weak elected government. Or at least, it did when Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who reached out to the West, was still president (he handed over to Mr Raisi after the maximum two consecutive terms). With hardliners now in control of the entire government, there should be less tension. “Under the new administration, Iran will be much more assertive,” says Mohammad Marandi, an academic who is close to the IRGC.
All of this complicates efforts to revive the nuclear deal signed in 2015 by Iran and six world powers. That agreement, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had Iran curb its nuclear programme and agree to rigorous inspections in return for the lifting of some international sanctions. But in 2018, during the presidency of Donald Trump, America abandoned the deal. In response, Iran began breaking parts of it.
President Joe Biden has promised to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance. In an address on August 3rd Mr Raisi said his government would take steps to lift the “tyrannical” sanctions imposed by America. But a sixth round of indirect negotiations to revive the JCPOA ended in June. There is no date set for the resumption of talks. Iran, meanwhile, has continued to expand its nuclear activity. It is enriching uranium beyond the levels required for civilian use and it has sharply curbed co-operation with inspectors.
Britain will raise the strike on the Mercer Street at the UN. “The UK is working with our international partners on a concerted response to this unacceptable attack,” said Dominic Raab, its foreign secretary. “Ultimately, we have got to restore deterrence,” said General Sir Nick Carter, its most senior military officer.

1523,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3

1525,"HONG KONG, July 12 (Reuters) - China's antitrust regulator is set to order the music streaming arm of Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) to give up exclusive rights to music labels which it has used to compete with smaller rivals, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
The State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) will also fine it 500,000 yuan ($77,150) for lapses in reporting the acquisitions of apps Kuwo and Kugou, the people told Reuters - a milder penalty than the forced sale indicated earlier this year.
SAMR, Tencent Holdings and Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME.N) did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
The move is the latest in a clamp-down to curb the economic and social power of China's once-loosely regulated internet giants. The campaign, which began late last year, has included a record 18 billion yuan fine on e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  for abusing its market position.
In April, Reuters reported that SAMR aimed to fine Tencent Holdings at least 10 billion yuan, and that the social media leader was lobbying for leniency. Reuters also reported that SAMR had told Tencent Music it may have to sell Kuwo and Kugou.
Instead, SAMR will no longer require a sale but will impose the maximum 500,000 yuan fine for not properly flagging the 2016 app purchases for antitrust review, the people said on Monday.
""Personally, I think this punishment falls short and is even a boon for Tencent. The acquisitions obviously would restrict competition in the market, and should have been vetoed,"" said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Offices.
""It is too little a hit to Tencent Music's dominant position in the market,"" said You, a commentator on antitrust law.
Reuters could not determine whether Tencent Holdings faces any further antitrust penalty beyond the expected ruling on Tencent Music, China's dominant music streamer.
On Saturday, SAMR said it would block Tencent Holdings' plan to merge China's two biggest videogame streamers - Huya Inc (HUYA.N) and DouYu International Holdings Ltd  - on antitrust grounds, confirming an earlier Reuters report.  read more 
EXCLUSIVITY
Tencent Music, China's equivalent to Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), had been pursuing exclusive streaming rights with labels including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group and Warner Music Group Corp (WMG.O) to fend off competition.
It became the subject of a SAMR investigation in 2018 which stopped the following year after the company agreed not to renew some of its exclusive rights, which normally expire after three years, Reuters previously reported.
It nevertheless kept exclusive rights to music from some acts, including Jay Chou, one of the Chinese-speaking world's most influential artists.
After SAMR's latest ruling, Tencent Music will at least be able to retain rights to music from some domestic indie acts, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Losing exclusive rights means Tencent Music will likely have to redouble efforts to build a more interactive and lively community to engage with its users. The firm has also been diversifying its content through long-form shows and live talk shows to attract more paying users as well as advertisers.
Tencent Music is facing a mounting challenge from ByteDance, which is using its Douyin app - its Chinese version of TikTok - to promote music backed by sophisticated algorithms.

1526,"AT ORBITAL SPEEDS a tennis-ball-sized piece of space junk packs enough energy to obliterate a satellite. It makes good sense, then, to track orbiting debris, the better to steer spacecraft away from danger. That this is hard was underscored on April 23rd, as a SpaceX capsule sped toward the International Space Station (ISS). The crew were preparing to sleep when ground control hastily announced they had just 20 minutes to complete a safety procedure before a potential impact. The object, probably a piece of defunct spacecraft, later whizzed past harmlessly.
At the moment, space-going junk is mapped mostly by radar. But of an estimated 34,000 orbiting objects ten or more centimetres across, only about 29,000 are being tracked with reasonable accuracy. Smaller pieces are more numerous, and harder to follow. Those between one and ten centimetres across number more than 900,000; those at least a millimetre across, perhaps 128m. Even tiny bits of debris can do damage. In May the Canadian Space Agency said an untracked piece of junk had punched a hole 5mm across in Canadarm2, a robotic limb attached to the ISS.

As orbiting objects multiply, the danger grows. Roughly a dozen sizeable pieces of space debris break up every year as a result of collisions, exploding rocket fuel, or the rupturing of pressurised tanks or old batteries. Solar radiation chips off bits of paint and metal. And the number of launches is increasing. According to BryceTech, a consultancy in Virginia, at the end of 2001 there were 771 active satellites orbiting Earth. Ten years later that population had grown to 965. Since then, it has nearly quintupled, to roughly 4,500—and this does not include defunct satellites. And small, cheap satellites are a booming business. Maciej Konacki, an astronomer at the Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw, who has studied the matter on behalf of the European Union, reckons there could be 100,000 active satellites in orbit by the end of the decade.
One sign of this crowding is that forecasts of potential impacts have roughly doubled in the past few years, says the Space Data Association, an industry group based in the Isle of Man which calculates collision risks for its members. But the rise conceals some good news. Part of the reason for more predicted impacts is better forecasting. As the quality and quantity of information grows, many potential collisions which would have gone unnoticed in the past are now foreseen.
Collision warning
Radars operated by America’s Department of Defence have long been the biggest providers of “space situational awareness”. Little more than ten years ago, position fixes were generally accurate only to within a few hundred metres. Since then, says François Laporte, an expert at CNES, France’s space agency, the accuracy of America’s debris tracking has improved by an “extraordinary, marvellous” order of magnitude, to a few tens of metres.
One big advance has been “Space Fence”. This is a system built in the Marshall Islands for America’s air force. It is billed (admittedly by its maker, Lockheed Martin, an arms firm) as the world’s most advanced radar. It went into service in March 2020 and now makes 2m observations a day, many of closely spaced objects just 5cm across. In time, that level of scrutiny should more than triple the number of items which have their orbits regularly updated in a catalogue maintained by the 18th Space Control Squadron, at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
Since 2014 the EU has been chipping in too. Seven of its members pool their space-surveillance and tracking assets in an arrangement called the EU SST Consortium. Europeans worry that American data on debris may not remain forever free and freely available. Pride also plays a role. Mr Laporte says Europe’s spacefarers want to see debris for themselves, “not just through the Americans”. The consortium has yet to increase meaningfully the number of catalogued objects—“We’re not even in the same league” as America, says Mr Laporte. But satellite operators welcome the effort nonetheless.
One problem is that there is no consensus on the best way to predict an object’s future orbit. To do this its position must be recorded several times, to observe how its path is being altered by the gravitational pulls of the Earth, Moon and sun, the pressure imposed on it by solar radiation and, in low orbits, the drag caused by wayward wisps of air from the upper atmosphere, and so on. Different teams often come up with different results, says Dr Konacki, who was once a delegate to the EU SST Consortium. Any extra data should help make the process more accurate.
The private sector is gearing up its efforts, too. In April LeoLabs, a firm in Silicon Valley, switched on its fourth debris-tracking radar station. This facility, in Costa Rica, joins others in Alaska, New Zealand and Texas. A fifth is being built in the Azores. LeoLabs can currently track objects slightly bigger than tennis balls. The short wavelength and high power of the radars mean it may eventually be able keep tabs on bits of junk just 2cm across.
LeoLabs sells data to satellite operators, space agencies, America’s armed forces and insurers keen to calculate better actuarial tables for spacecraft. Dan Ceperley, the firm’s boss, notes that government agencies often take several “hand-wringing” hours to answer requests for a satellite’s probability of collision. His firm’s website lets customers see within seconds whether a proposed manoeuvre will lead, over the next week, to danger from any of the objects in LeoLabs’ catalogue.
Besides using radar, debris can also be tracked optically. In collaboration with Curtin University, in Perth, Lockheed Martin runs FireOPAL, a system of 20 cheap cameras aimed at the sky from various parts of Australia. For several hours at dawn and dusk, when these cameras are in the dark but sunlight still illuminates debris orbiting above, the cameras take pictures every ten seconds. The closer an object, the more it appears to move relative to the stars, allowing triangulation of its position. For items at an altitude of 400km, says Phil Bland, who is in charge of Curtin’s side of the project, the system is accurate to within 30 metres.
FireOPAL’s greatest success so far was locating a satellite half a metre across, 26,000km up. The smallest objects the lenses capture in low orbits are about 30cm across. Rod Drury, Dr Bland’s counterpart at Lockheed, says the firm now plans to expand FireOPAL around the world.
Lasers are another option. Around 40 outfits, including some belonging to the members of the EU SST Consortium, are shooting laser pulses at “retro-reflectors” fitted to many satellites. Clocking the return time allows positions to be calculated with an accuracy of a few millimetres. Seven laser stations also use a more powerful pulse that can spot debris without retro-reflectors, to within around a metre.
For finding stuff in high orbits, though, neither lasers nor radars are much help. But telescopes work. ExoAnalytic Solutions, a Californian firm, tracks junk up to 170,000km away—nearly halfway to the Moon—using instruments “just laying on the shelves” at astronomy shops, according to Clint Clark, the firm’s “Vice President of First Impressions” (as some marketing bosses like to be known in California). As for debris in geosynchronous orbit, a mere 36,000km up, ExoAnalytic’s 300 telescopes, scattered in 35 clusters over five continents and Hawaii, track grapefruit-sized objects to within an accuracy of about ten metres. The company is adding a couple of sites a year, to improve the degree of precision. Customers include insurers keen to see if policyholders fly their satellites as safely as they claim to.
These efforts are impressive. Even so, back at LeoLabs Dr Ceperley reckons that ten times more tracking capability is needed than is available today. Such demand has allowed Northstar Earth  Space, a new firm in Montreal, to raise money to build, at $25m a pop, three 100kg satellites that will use telescopic cameras to track junk from orbit. The plan, according to Northstar’s boss, Stewart Bain, is to launch the satellites in 2023, into an orbit with an altitude of 575km—the celestial equivalent, he quips, of “riviera or beach-front property”. If this goes well, another nine will join them in subsequent years, to create a panopticon a dozen strong.
Where there’s muck there’s brass
For customers, none of this comes cheap. Northstar, for example, plans to charge annual subscriptions of between $10m and $100m. But that will buy more than just a degree of collision-proofing. It will also permit the manoeuvres made to avoid such collisions to be fine-tuned, or even deemed unnecessary. That will save fuel, extending a satellite’s useful life. And it will also reduce pauses in service, which are almost inevitable when a satellite’s orbit is being adjusted.
Naturally, this orbital-tracking technology has military value as well. Knowing objects’ orbits can reveal much about an adversary’s capabilities—including, perhaps, orbital combat. Movements that represent any deviation from normal patterns are most telling, says Scott Norr, an expert at Lockheed in the use of Space Fence for military intelligence. To illustrate why, he points to an object that had been considered to be just a piece of debris from a Russian military launch. In May 2014 the “debris” sprang to life. Its movements since then have fuelled fears that it could be an anti-satellite weapon. Whether other such “sleepers” are hidden in plain sight among the clouds of rubbish orbiting Earth remains to be seen. ■

1527,"FEW POP videos require subtitles. But a minute into “Francisca Pizarro”, a song by the Peruvian singer Renata Flores, some appear. “Let’s just remember that our worlds came together,” Ms Flores (pictured) croons in Spanish, shortly before breaking into dance and into Quechua, the language of the Inca.
Some 47 indigenous languages are used in Peru, by 4m people. Around three-quarters speak Quechua, which is also spoken in Bolivia and Ecuador. Designated an official language in 1975, it has been promoted in recent years by politicians. In 2017 Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, then president, launched a “policy for native languages”, including state-run news programmes in indigenous tongues, ahead of the 200th anniversary of independence from Spain this year.

Such endeavours have given Quechua a modest boost. It has received a bigger one, some say, from the music of Ms Flores, a 20-year-old from Ayacucho. Her Quechua cover of Michael Jackson’s “The Way You Make Me Feel” went viral online in 2015. In March Ms Flores released her first full-length album, which fuses rap and hip-hop with pop and blues and which is mostly sung in Quechua. She also became the face of a new line of perfume, speaking the language in the adverts. “I think people can do much bigger things when they can use their own language,” says Ms Flores.
All this is despite the fact that she did not study it until she was 13. Indeed, although now fairly fluent she still goes to university classes to brush up on it. Luis Andrade of the Catholic University of Peru suggests her music could be part of the reason why more people are now identifying as being of Quechua descent.
“The use of Quechua, for me...is being able to express yourself in a way you feel comfortable,” says Ms Flores. Of course, it also draws attention, which is useful for a pop star. Rosalía, a Spanish singer whom Ms Flores name-checks in “Francisca Pizarro”, has been accused of “cultural appropriation” for using reggaeton (which originated in Puerto Rico) and flamenco (which is associated with the Roma). Ms Flores has yet to face similar complaints for copying an African-American artist, but you never know.",2
1528,"America’s annual inflation rate stood at 5.3% in August, down slightly from the 13-year highs of the previous two months. There was some evidence that inflationary pressures may be levelling off, such as an easing of prices for used cars, which have driven some of this year’s inflation because of supply-chain problems in new-vehicle production. Britain’s inflation rate, meanwhile, surged from 2% to 3.2%, partly because of a jump in the cost of eating out, which was artificially lowered a year ago by a government pandemic scheme that subsidised restaurant meals. In Canada inflation rose to 4.1%, an 18-year high.
Soaring energy prices are a factor pushing up inflation. Prices for natural gas have hit new highs in Europe for a variety of reasons, including a supply shortage ahead of the coming winter. In Spain, where consumers’ energy costs have soared, the government wants to seize what it describes as “excess profits” from utility companies to reduce household bills.

The controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline was completed, allowing Russia to bypass Ukraine and pump more gas to Europe. Russia says it can start delivering gas once the “remaining formalities” are completed.
CMA CGM, one of the world’s biggest container-shipping firms, took the industry by surprise when it announced a five-month cap on spot rates for ocean freight. The cost of shipping a standard large container is four times higher than it was a year ago for a number of reasons, including congestion at ports. CMA CGM describes this as an “unprecedented situation” and is capping prices to keep its customers happy.

The long-running battle to take over Kansas City Southern appeared to have reached the end of the line when the rail-freight company, which operates in America and Mexico, agreed to a $31bn bid from Canadian Pacific. It had struck an agreement with Canadian National, CP’s rival, but America’s Surface Transportation Board didn’t like the structure of the deal.
A federal judge in California gave her verdict in the closely watched legal battle between Epic Games and Apple. It was mostly, but not entirely, good news for Apple. The judge said Epic had failed to prove its central claim that Apple was abusing its market dominance by charging developers commissions of up to 30%. But she ruled that Apple had broken Californian law, and ordered it to allow app developers to offer customers alternative payment options outside Apple’s ecosystem. Epic is appealing against the ruling.
Goldman Sachs expanded its consumer-focused business by agreeing to buy GreenSky, a platform that focuses on providing loans for home improvements, for $2.2bn.
There was more evidence of the recent slowdown in China’s economy, caused in part by outbreaks of covid-19. Retail sales rose by 2.5% in August, year on year, well below economists’ average forecast of 7%. Industrial production grew by 5.3% on the same basis, which was also short of expectations.
The crisis deepened at Evergrande, one of China’s biggest property developers, which has warned that it may default on its debt. Its recent sales have fallen by half, which it blamed on speculative media reports about its future; it has employed specialists to assess its liquidity. Protesters took up residence outside Evergrande’s headquarters in Shenzhen.
The share prices of big casino operators in Macau plunged, after the Chinese territory began a consultation process on revising gaming laws. Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal.

1529,"IT LOOKS LIKE the perfect time to be a chipmaker. The market for semiconductors continues to grow rapidly. By the end of the decade it will exceed $1trn globally, up from $500bn this year, forecasts VLSI Research, a firm of analysts. Demand keeps outstripping supply; the chip shortage is now expected to last well into 2023, paralysing factories of everything that needs processors—which in this day and age is basically everything. Western governments have earmarked billions to build chipmaking capacity within their borders in order to become less dependent on Asian suppliers. America alone is planning to spend $52bn over the next five years.
In this context the initial public offering (IPO) of GlobalFoundries, a contract manufacturer which makes chips for other firms, seems a safe bet. The firm, which unveiled its prospectus on October 4th and is expected to list soon, is the world’s fourth-biggest chip foundry by revenues. The typical characteristics of an IPO—a lowish offering price and a small proportion of shares available to public investors, both of which have yet to be decided—should ensure a healthy “pop” in the share price in the early days of trading. But GloFo, as semiconductor aficionados endearingly call the firm, is also an example of how tough the chip business has become, notwithstanding the favourable climate.

GloFo is a product of consolidation, caused by the industry’s unforgiving economics that demand ever-tinier silicon furrows and hence ever-costlier fabrication plants (or “fabs”). The most advanced of these now cost more than $20bn apiece. After a spin-off in 2009 from AMD, which designs processors for personal computers and servers in data centres, GloFo later acquired Chartered Semiconductor, another foundry, and the chip-manufacturing business of IBM, a purveyor of assorted information-technology wares.
With billions from Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign-wealth fund from the United Arab Emirates, which currently owns all of GloFo, the firm tried to keep up with rivals in the race to forge cutting-edge electronic circuitry. In 2018 it gave up and started catering to the lower end of the market. These are semiconductors which go into products such as cars and machine tools, and therefore do not need the highest-performing processors, rather than data centres or smartphones. This niche is still a $54bn market, according to Gartner, another market-researcher.
Today GloFo operates a handful of fabs across the world, employs around 15,000 people and has a market share of 7% in the chip-manufacturing business. Most of its customers, which include AMD, Broadcom, another American chip designer, and NXP, a Dutch one, are “single sourced”. That means their chips cannot be made by other foundries, such as Samsung of South Korea and in particular Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s mightiest chip manufacturer, which controls more than half the market.
The difference in size goes a long way to explaining why TSMC is hugely profitable whereas GloFo struggles to generate cash. In the first six months of this year the Taiwanese giant boasted sales of $26bn and profits of $9.8bn. Although GloFo’s revenues rose to $3bn in the same period, up by nearly 13% on a year ago, and its accounting losses have been narrowing, it still lost $300m between January and June.
Investing in GloFo will therefore be a wager that the company can ride the current tailwinds in its industry and start making serious money. But it may also be a bet that another firm snaps up GloFo for itself. In July it emerged that Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker by revenues, was in takeover talks with the firm. These did not go anywhere because the parties could not agree on a price. Once GloFo is listed it should be clearer how much it is worth. Negotiations could restart. Then again, with GloFo’s numbers now public, Intel may have a hard time convincing its shareholders that it needs to pay the $25bn that GloFo is expected to fetch. ■

1530," (CNN)While many colleges and universities are offering classes online, that hasn't necessarily stopped students from gathering. And now some college towns are grappling with outbreaks of Covid-19 as the start of the fall semester complicates local responses to the pandemic. ""We are urging students to understand the imperative role that they play in stopping this community spread and, ultimately, saving lives,"" said Mayor Aaron Stephens of East Lansing, Michigan, where Michigan State University students were asked to quarantine after the local health department reported 342 new cases among people affiliated with the university since August 24.The outbreak started as students returned to East Lansing for the fall semester, the health department's statement said. MSU resumed classes on September 2. And while most are online, many students had ""binding off-campuses leases or simply desired to physically return to the university community.""""MSU is committed to doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" MSU Physician David Weismantel said. ""The safety of our entire community is a priority and we all have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus.""Kelly Girtz, the mayor of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia -- home to the University of Georgia -- told CNN Saturday his city has seen a ""dramatic spike"" in cases after maintaining lower case counts and death counts throughout the summer. UGA classes began August 20.""Clearly it's the return to campus of large numbers of students who are not here through the summertime,"" he said.""Certainly young people are going to do the things that young people do, so we need to create the underlying conditions that keep people safe,"" Girtz said, calling for better coordination among state and national leaders. ""So that means very low allowance of gatherings and really as much digital or online learning as possible.""Six students at Miami University in Ohio were cited after holding a house party even though at least one of them tested positive for Covid-19, according to police records. The university declined to comment, citing federal privacy laws, but said students would face disciplinary action if they violate quarantine orders or the city ordinance on mass gatherings.Arkansas reported a record high of 1,107 new cases on Friday, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson said a backlog in testing was to blame. About 13% of the state's cases were attributed to young people in college communities, according to Dr. José Romero, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health -- though he said that was down from previous counts, calling it a ""good indicator."" More than 6.4 million infections have been recorded in the US and 193,482 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Air pollution from wildfires could lead to vulnerabilityDoctors warn that bad air quality stemming from smoke produced by the wildfires ravaging Western states could make people more vulnerable to coronavirus infections.""Multiple studies have shown a correlation between higher levels of pollution in the air and greater spread and severity of Covid-19 cases,"" said Dr. Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, citing several studies conducted in the United States, China and Italy. ""Some studies have also shown that exposure of lung tissue to pollution may increase susceptibility to viral infections.""Smoke from wildfires can irritate the lungs and cause inflammation that can affect the immune system, said Dr. Rekha Murthy, an infectious disease specialist at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. That inflammation can make people more at risk of lung infections. ""Whenever the lining of the lung or the airways become inflamed or damaged, it increases the potential for inhaled viral particles to take hold in the lungs and cause infection,"" Murthy said.There are also concerns that smoke-filled air will drive coronavirus-positive people indoors, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. That, she said, could potentially increase the spread of the virus. ""We know being outdoors versus indoors reduces the rate of transmission ... but now people are being told you have to go indoors because you don't want to breathe in the air that could cause respiratory issues,"" she said. ""But you don't want to be indoors with other individuals and have a higher rate of contracting COVID-19... so, it's really a catch-22.""To prevent the possible spread of coronavirus during the intense fire season, those remaining indoors due to poor air quality should stay away from anyone who is not in their immediate household, Wen said.Early mask wearing would have saved livesAbout 150,000 of the lives lost would have been saved if more Americans wore masks earlier on in the coronavirus pandemic, a health expert says.  ""If the President had said from day one everyone is wearing a mask, we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" said CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University. Reiner pointed to how Germany handled the pandemic. ""They haven't been the best. They haven't been the worst. They've been OK in their pandemic response and they've had about 10,000 deaths,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett.The US has four times the population of Germany. ""So we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" he said. ""So about 150,000 people would be alive.""He reiterated the importance of embracing masks. ""If you want to think about why we still have 40,000 cases a day and 1,000 deaths a day in this country, it's because we're still talking about masks,"" Reiner said. ""It's so basic.""More deaths predicted if people let their guards downAn influential model is predicting a catastrophic winter with a significant rise in coronavirus deaths.A possible scenario sees 415,090 Covid-19 deaths by January, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington says in its latest forecast. The worst-case scenario is 611,000 deaths by January 1.""When we look ahead into the winter with seasonality kicking in, people becoming clearly less vigilant, you know mask use is down, mobility is up in the nation, you put all those together and we look like we're going to have a very deadly December ahead of us in terms of toll of coronavirus,""  IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper.Despite the dire prediction, President Donald Trump says the US has done ""really well"" in fighting the virus. ""I really do believe we're rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there, but not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump said. Speaking with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not agree with the President's statements.""We're plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day, and the deaths of around 1,000,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He said test positivity is increasing in some regions of the country and people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather.""That's not good for a respiratory-borne virus,"" he said. Fauci warned that the country needs to get the levels down lower ""so that when you go into a more precarious situation, like the fall and the winter, you won't have a situation where you really are at a disadvantage right from the very beginning.""",0
1531,"A centuries-old Charles Dickens letter written in code has been offered up to the public to help solve it - with a cash prize.
The so-called 'Tavistock letter' is one of a number of manuscripts which Dickens wrote in a modified version of brachygraphy - a form of shorthand popular in the 18th century.
Researchers have been stumped by the code and have now turned to amateur cryptographers to try and decipher it, offering a £300 prize to do so before New Year's Eve.
The prize is being offered by the Dickens Code Project led by the University of Leicester and the University of Foggia and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
The letter has never been read despite being one of the ten surviving manuscripts from Dickens after he burned a trove of documents at his Gad's Hill home in Kent.
The blue letter paper of the manuscript is headed with the words 'Tavistock House' the London house where Dickens wrote Bleak House, A Tale of Two Cities and other works.
It is from this heading where the letter has got its name. 
Hugo Bowles, professor of English at the University of Foggia in Italy told The Times: 'It looks simple but really is not.
'You read back the consonants and fill in the gaps.
'It is a little like playing Scrabble in your head.'
'Dickens clearly liked word games and puzzles and would have been very good at them, hence the use of this system.'
Dickens' shorthand system was partially illuminated by researchers using a notebook stored at the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester.
Dr Claire Wood, lecturer in Victorian literature at the University of Leicester, told the Times: '[Dickens] throws out the symbols that are more obscure and that aren't coming up in what he is reporting on. 
'Instead he creates new marks that make more sense and that save him time as a shorthand writer.'
But the genius' messy handwriting still poses a problem for anyone hoping to claim the cash on offer. 
Professor Bowles told The Times that Dickens' messy shorthand has been a major hurdle for the researchers in trying to figure out what the letter actually says.
He said: 'Unfortunately, the notebook is not nearly enough to help us decode everything.
'It gives a few of his extra symbols, which are useful, but a lot of the problem is actually connected to his writing.
'Much like messy handwriting, he has messy shorthand.'
Researchers have employed a series of techniques to try and decipher Dickens' difficult code including finding translated pieces and working backwards and also employing machine learning.
Both techniques have failed due to the lack of material on offer to try and figure out patterns.",-2
1532,"IN 1975, IN her first conference speech as Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher pledged to build “a property-owning democracy”. More than 45 years later homeowners are still more likely to back the Tories than their rivals, and so the government would like there to be more of them. In 2017 it set an ambitious target of increasing the housing stock by 300,000 units a year in England. To help hit that target, in 2020 Boris Johnson, the prime minister, promised to simplify planning and weaken locals’ rights to object to development.
But housing and planning present the Conservatives with a dilemma: although they want more homeowners, they do not want to annoy existing ones. A by-election loss in June to the Liberal Democrats in the constituency of Chesham and Amersham, prosperous commuter towns, was chalked up in part to local anger over planned development. It spooked the party leadership. Backbenchers, too, are growing nervous. Political insiders now expect a shift in emphasis at the Conservative Party conference, which starts on October 3rd, away from building new homes and the 300,000 annual target, and towards increasing taxpayer support to enable first-time buyers to take on larger mortgages.

British homes are expensive. Since 1995 prices have gone up by 170% in real (ie, inflation-adjusted) terms, one of the fastest increases among rich economies (see chart). The median house in England and Wales cost five times the median salary in 2002, but closer to eight times by 2020. Home ownership, which had been rising for decades, peaked in the early 2000s). Over the past two decades a consensus has emerged among politicians and policymakers that the main reason has been too little supply. But since the mid-2010s Ian Mulheirn, an economist who now works at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, has argued that the main causes of higher house prices have been falling real interest rates and looser credit.

For a long time, Mr Mulheirn seemed a voice in the wilderness. But now, it seems, the government is listening. Michael Gove, who became the minister responsible for planning and housing in September’s reshuffle, has reportedly taken to telling colleagues that only around 15% of the growth in house prices of the past two decades can be explained by lack of supply. Nick Boles, a minister for planning in the early 2010s, an ally of Mr Gove and long almost evangelical on the need for planning reform, has changed his view too.
Mr Mulheirn provides cover for the new direction. He has long argued that there is little evidence of an undersupply of housing. He cautions against reliance on house-building volumes: what matters, he says, are total net additions to the dwelling stock. The conversion of a three-storey house into three flats is materially the same as building two new flats, but is not captured by a focus on new building. Between 1996 and 2018, the dwelling stock in England grew by an annual average of 168,000 while the number of households grew by an average of 147,000. The result was that the net surplus of dwellings rose from around 660,000 to around 1.1m. And although the price of houses as an asset has indeed soared, he argues that the price of housing as a service has not. Rents have risen more slowly than median household incomes since 1996.
On this view—which, it now seems, the government shares—the main cause of higher prices is the role of housing as an asset. Owning a home produces an implicit income: the saving that would otherwise have been spent on rent. As with other assets that provide an income stream, such as stocks or bonds, the value of that income is determined by the interest rates available elsewhere. According to this logic, house prices are high for the same reason that bond and stock prices are high: because interest rates have collapsed and credit has become looser. Mr Mulheirn does not entirely reject the notion that more supply would lower prices, but estimates that two decades of adding 300,000 units a year would reduce prices by only around 10%.
Castles in the air
This theory is not without critics. The rental data on which it is based is of low quality. Household formation does not just influence house prices; it is also influenced by them. For example, high prices may nudge young adults to stay living with their parents for longer. Real interest rates are low pretty much everywhere, but housing markets vary by country and region. Rental yields are considerably lower in London than in northern England.
In any case, even if global factors explain most of the past two decades’ rise in house prices, increasing stock in the places where people most want to live would be both welfare-enhancing and good for productivity. And encouraging young people to take on more debt need not be the sole way to improve their living conditions. More social housing could be built, and conditions in the private rental sector improved. The taxation of housing could be reformed, the better to reflect rising values. But for a government committed to increasing home ownership, none of this would help hit its central target. ■",2
1533,"Vials labeled 'smallpox' that were discovered in a freezer in a Philadelphia laboratory don't contain any traces of the deadly virus, federal health officials reveals.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday that testing showed the vials contain 'vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine' and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. 
The vials 'were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker' who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer on Monday night.
There were 15 vials in total - five of which were labeled 'smallpox' and the other 10 labeled 'vaccinia.' 
Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 with a successful mass vaccination campaign after it killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone.
Samples of the deadly virus are only supposed to be kept in two labs: the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Russia.  
Mark O'Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County.
It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. 
The CDC said it was 'in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization' about the findings.  
The finding was first reported by Yahoo News, which obtained a copy of an alert sent to the Department of Homeland Security labeled 'For Official Use Only.'  
Smallpox is a serious, life-threatening illness causes by variola virus.
A person may not look or feel sick for 7 to 14 days after exposure, but initial symptoms include high fever, headaches, backaches, and vomiting.
Around a third of people who contract the disease, die. 
After the initial symptoms, a body-wide rash appears. The person is most contagious during this stage.
Rashes develop in the tongue, mouth and throat. They then spread to the face and arms, torso and legs.
Pus-filled bumps, also called pustules, form and begin to scab over and fall off over a period of about 10 days.
It was mostly spread by prolonged face-to-face due to respiratory particles. The virus was also spread by sharing sheets, towels and clothing.     
Source: Cleveland Clinic 
After they were discovered, the vials were secured immediately and the facility was put on a lockdown that was lifted by Wednesday night.
'Merck is in the process of figuring out why it was there,' the source told NBC10 on Wednesday 
Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com.
'There is no indication that anyone has been exposed to the small number of frozen vials,' a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo. 
'The frozen vials labeled 'Smallpox' were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker while cleaning out a freezer in a facility that conducts vaccine research in Pennsylvania.'
The discovery took place at the Merck Upper Gwynedd facility in North Wales, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, according to WCAU. 
'CDC, its Administration partners, and law enforcement are investigating the matter, and the vials' contents appear intact. The laboratory worker who discovered the vials was wearing gloves and a face mask. We will provide further details as they are available,' the spokesperson said. 
The incident is likely to renew questions about what should be done with the world's Smallpox samples, which are kept in only two labs in the world. 
Smallpox is an infection caused by the variola virus. Patients develop a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash, according to the CDC.  
Most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, meaning an outbreak could have devastating consequences.  
The vaccine leaves a dime-sized lesion that gradually forms a scab and leaves a scar, the CDC says. The lesion is contagious before the scab forms, and those who receive it have to protect the vaccination site from other parts of their body and other people.
In 2014, a government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland - just outside of Washington, DC - found six decades-old glass vials containing freeze-dried smallpox, according to the Washington Post.
The samples were packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box. At the time, it was the first such discovery in the country. 
In 2019, an explosion at the state-owned Russian lab holding some of the samples sent one worker to the hospital, though the World Health Organization said the blast didn't occur near the stockpiles, according to NPR.  
Earlier this month, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said the US and UK should invest 'tens of billions' in virus research, including how to possibly prevent smallpox attacks from being unleashed in places like airports, according to Yahoo News. 
'So along with the climate message and the ongoing fight against diseases of the poor, pandemic preparedness is something I'll be talking about a lot,' he said in an interview with British health policy official Jeremy Hunt.
The origin of smallpox is unknown, but the earliest written description of a similar virus appeared in China in the 4th century.
It has typically worked in outbreaks and was brought to North America by European settlers in the 17th century.
About a third of infected patients died. Those who survived were sometimes left with various scars or even blind.
The 'basis for vaccination' began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had gotten cowpox were also protected from smallpox, according to the CDC.
In the 1800s, the virus used to make the smallpox vaccine changed from cowpox to vaccinia virus. (Five of the fifteen vials found in Philadelphia on Tuesday were labeled 'vaccinia.')
Before the vaccine, variolation was a common method of protection against the virus. People who had never had smallpox took material from pustules of infected people and scratched it into their arm or inhaled it through their nose to develop immunity. 
In 1948, the virus was infecting about 50 million people a year throughout the globe, according to the WHO. 
Experts estimate that the virus killed about 300 million people in the 20th century.
Soviet scientist Viktor Zhdanov proposed a four-year global vaccination campaign starting in 1959, and the campaign got a global boost aided by US funds in 1966 and 1967, with the Intensified Eradication Program.
'Laboratories in many countries where smallpox occurred regularly were able to produce more, higher-quality freeze-dried vaccine,' the CDC notes. 
'Other factors that played an important role in the success of the intensified efforts included the development of the bifurcated needle, the establishment of a case surveillance system, and mass vaccination campaigns.'
The last known naturally occurring case happened in 1977 in Somalia. The last natural US outbreak was in 1949. 
By 1980, the WHO declared the disease wiped out.
At this point, most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, according to Yahoo News.

1534,"ON JUNE 29TH 1950 the USS Valley Forge, flagship of America’s Seventh Fleet, passed through the Taiwan Strait. A battle group defended her flanks, America’s first naval jets sat in her hangar, and a new vision of American-dominated Asian security unfurled in her wake.
Only a few months before, America’s secretary of state, Dean Acheson, had declared that “The Asian peoples are on their own, and know it.” But on June 25th Stalinist North Korea launched an invasion of its southern neighbour, and a country confronting communism could no longer leave Asia alone. America would fight with South Korea. It was to join in that defence that the Valley Forge was steaming north from Subic Bay.

Her route had added purpose. Containing Asian communism meant more than fighting North Korea. It also required making sure that Mao Zedong—mainland China’s ruler since the previous year—did not take the island of Taiwan from the Nationalist regime led by Chiang Kai-shek, who had been forced to retreat there. On June 27th President Harry Truman announced a new Taiwan policy: America would defend the island from attack; the Nationalists must, for their part, cease air and sea operations against the mainland. “The Seventh Fleet will see that this is done,” the president declared, with nicely laconic menace. Hence the Valley Forge’s show of strength.
From that week on, to the relief of some and the frustration of others, Asian peoples were no longer on their own. The Korean war transformed the region into a theatre of ideological struggle just as fraught as divided cold-war Europe. For nearly three decades the Taiwan Strait saw ships of the Seventh Fleet acting as a tripwire between the two Chinas. There were early battles over outlying islands, including a crisis in 1958 in which Mao’s brinkmanship nearly started a nuclear war. But over time the rivals to the west and east of the strait settled into an uneasy half-peace, both adamant that they were the one true China, neither able to act on the conviction.
Over time Taiwan became the prosperous, pro-Western democracy of 24m people which it is today. While the mainland saw traditions and social codes destroyed by Maoist fanaticism, Taiwan has a rich religious and cultural life. It has come to enjoy raucous free speech and a marked liberal streak: it was the first Asian country to legalise gay marriage.
A generation ago, it could matter greatly whether someone’s grandparents had arrived from the mainland in 1949 or had deeper roots on the island. That has now changed, especially among the young. In 2020 a poll by the Pew Research Centre, a Washington-based research outfit, found that about two-thirds of adults on the island now identified as purely Taiwanese. About three in ten called themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese. Just 4% called themselves simply Chinese.
Leaders in Beijing differ; they consider them all Chinese. They tell their own people that most citizens of Taiwan agree, and that the historical necessity of national unification is being thwarted by secessionist troublemakers egged on by America.
Once, Taiwan was a point of compromise between the two powers. On January 1st 1979, the day that America recognised the People’s Republic of China, the economic reformers running the mainland changed their Taiwan policy from armed liberation to “peaceful reunification”, soon afterwards adding a promise of considerable autonomy: “one country, two systems”. But for the past 25 years that conciliatory offer has been accompanied by an unprecedented military build up.
In recent years China’s rhetoric towards Taiwan has sounded new notes of impatience. And the crushing abnegation of its promise to observe “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong over the past two years has deepened Taiwanese distrust. Last year the issue helped Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to be re-elected president.
In principle the DPP favours the creation of a Taiwan that is formally its own nation; but to declare independence in that way would trigger massive Chinese reprisals. To keep that crisis at bay, Ms Tsai, a moderate, cat-loving academic, relies on an artful diplomatic dodge: that she governs a country which, while proudly Taiwanese, uses the legal name of the Republic of China which it inherited from the Nationalists who arrived in 1949. China’s leaders detest her.
The passage of time poses a dilemma for China. Every year, China’s ability to coerce Taiwan economically and militarily grows greater. And every year it loses more hearts and minds on Taiwan. Should rulers in Beijing ever conclude that peaceful unification is a hopeless cause, Chinese law instructs them to use force.
Present fears
This dynamic alarms the heirs to Acheson. Though the accord of 1979 cast Taiwan into non-state limbo, the island’s security remained—as a matter of American law—a question of “grave concern”. When in 1996 China sought to intimidate the Taiwanese, about to vote in their first free presidential election, by means of missile tests, President Bill Clinton ordered the USS Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft-carrier, and her attendant battle group to the waters off Taiwan. The missile tests stopped.

American military commanders are increasingly open about their concerns that, in the context of Taiwan, the balance of military power between China and America has swung in China’s direction. A 25-year campaign of shipbuilding and weapons procurement, begun in direct response to the humiliation of 1996, has provided the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) a fleet of 360 ships, according to American naval intelligence, compared with America’s 297. On April 23rd state media hailed the symbolism of a ceremony in which China’s supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, commissioned three large warships on the same day: a destroyer, a helicopter-carrier and a ballistic-missile submarine. The second of these is ideal for airlifting troops to a mountainous island, the media noted with glee. The third is a way of deterring superpowers.

America still boasts more, better carriers and nuclear submarines. It has much more experience of far-flung operations, and it has allies, too. But America’s forces have global duties. China would be fighting close to home and thus enjoying the benefit of the PLA’s land-based aircraft and missiles. Lonnie Henley, who was until 2019 the chief Pentagon intelligence analyst for East Asia, sees the radars and missiles of the integrated air-defence system along China’s coast as the “centre of gravity” of any war over Taiwan (see map). Unless those defences are destroyed, American forces would be limited to long-range weapons or attacks by the stealthiest warplanes, Mr Henley told a congressional panel in February. But destroying those defences would mean one nuclear power launching direct attacks on the territory of another.

And the Chinese build-up continues apace. History is an imperfect guide, but offers precedents to ponder, says a senior American defence official. “The world has never seen a military expansion of this scale not associated with conflict.”
It is not just a matter of numbers. China has carefully focused its efforts on the ability to defeat American forces that might trouble it. It has missiles designed expressly for killing carriers, and others that would allow precision strikes on the American base on Guam. The defence official lists other fields in which China has worked to neutralise areas of American strength, whether that means investment in anti-submarine weapons and sensors or systems to jam or destroy the satellites on which American forces rely. Copying an American method, China has set up a training centre with a professional opposing force that mimics enemy (in this case American) doctrines and tactics.
Horrible imaginings
The head of Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil Davidson, told a Senate hearing in March that China’s fielding of new warships, planes and rockets, when considered alongside the regime’s unblushing readiness to crush dissent from Hong Kong to Tibet, makes him worry that China is accelerating its apparent ambitions to supplant America and its allies from their position atop what he called the rules-based international order—a phrase that China sees as code for Western hegemony. Pondering the specific risks of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the admiral told senators that “the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact in the next six years.”
Admiral John Aquilino, nominated to be Admiral Davidson’s successor as head of Indo-Pacific Command, told a confirmation hearing in March that work to shore up America’s ability to deter a Chinese attack on Taiwan is urgent. While he stopped short of endorsing his predecessor’s timeline of six years, he called the prospect of a Chinese use of force “much closer to us than most think”. Anxiety has been raised further by war games involving Taiwan scenarios, both secret and unclassified, that were won by officers, spooks or scholars playing the role of China.

The admirals’ worries mix judgments about China’s capabilities with hunches about its intent. Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund, a public-policy outfit, notes that their mission is to make plans, in this case to win a war over Taiwan. Once they realise that victory may elude them, or may only be possible at great cost, panic is understandable. That does not mean they are correctly assessing China’s incentives to act soon. Strikingly, some of the intelligence officers paid to analyse the world for admirals and generals are noticeably calmer. “The trends are not ideal from a Chinese perspective,” says Mr Henley. “But are they intolerable? I just don’t see them being in that grim a mindset.”
When the battle’s lost and won
A broader American angst is driven by the knowledge of what defeat would mean. Niall Ferguson, a historian, recently wrote that the fall of Taiwan to China would be seen around Asia as the end of American predominance and even as “America’s Suez”, a reference to the humbling of Britain when it overreached during the Suez crisis of 1956. Asked about this idea in early April Matt Pottinger, who was head of Asia policy in the Trump White House, agreed and added another reason for Asian allies to fear such a public loss of American credibility. When Britain stumbled at Suez, America had already taken its place as the leader of the Western world, Mr Pottinger told a Hoover Institution podcast. Today, he observed, “There's not another United States waiting in the wings.”
For all its newfound strength China faces daunting odds. A full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan, a mountainous island that lies across at least 130km of water, would be the most ambitious such venture since the second world war. America has spent years nagging its Taiwanese allies to capitalise on their natural insular advantages, for instance by buying lots of naval mines, drones and coastal-defence cruise missiles on mobile launchers to sink Chinese troop ships, rather than continuing to splurge on tanks and F-16 fighters. Randall Schriver, the assistant secretary of defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs in 2018-19, promoted efforts to help Taiwan disable Chinese radar and other sensors: “If we are able to just blind the PLA, that would be a huge contribution to the fight.”
If a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan were to fail, or military conflict to reach a stalemate, would it fight on? Outsiders offer no consensus. Mr Henley suggests that a failed invasion might evolve into a long-term blockade—a strategy to which Western defence planners are paying increasing attention. There is a much-heard view that once China starts fighting anything short of victory would mean regime-toppling humiliation. But Mr Schriver is sceptical. “This is part of Beijing’s win-without-fighting strategy. To make everyone believe that they climb the escalation ladder all the way to nukes if they have to.”
The risks and costs of war, even a successful one, bring home the point that capabilities in themselves are never the determining factor. Intentions matter too, and are far more opaque—especially when, as in China, they reside largely in the mind of one man. It is common to hear Western analysts state that Mr Xi has staked his legacy and legitimacy on Taiwan’s return. Hard evidence for this alarming belief is in short supply. The most cited is that, in a new-year speech in 2019, he linked union with Taiwan to the ambition that he has placed at the core of his leadership, namely the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”. He also repeated what he had said to a Taiwanese envoy in 2013: that cross-strait differences should not be passed from generation to generation.
Having abolished the term limit on his role as president in 2018, 67-year-old Mr Xi can hardly expect to be succeeded by another member of his generation. Following his own logic, it thus falls to him to make sure that the task is not passed on. In an October 2019 meeting in Beijing, Chinese scholars and military experts shared with Oriana Skylar Mastro of Stanford University their understanding that it is imperative for Taiwan to be recovered during Mr Xi’s time as leader.
Though some semi-official Chinese commentators already say that they see no hope for unification without some use of violence, there is no agreement among foreign governments as to whether that is the settled view of China’s rulers. China continues to try to shape Taiwanese opinion with a mix of sticks and carrots, which suggests that negotiation has not been abandoned. The biggest carrot, access to its vast markets, continues to be dangled in front of Taiwanese business interests. Ms Glaser notes that Mr Xi sounded a patient note in March when he visited Fujian, the coastal province nearest to Taiwan, urging officials to explore new paths of cross-strait integration and economic development.
To the sticking place
But China’s carrots and sticks can clash. To punish the Taiwanese for electing a DPP government China has reduced official and semi-official cross-strait contacts to “nearly zero”, says Andrew Nien-Dzu Yang, a former Taiwanese deputy defence minister, now at the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a think-tank in Taipei. That raises the danger of misunderstandings.
So does China’s increased military activity around the island. Psychological operations and “grey-zone” warfare have been intensifying. In 2020, according to Taiwan’s government, Chinese warplanes made 380 sorties into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), a buffer zone of international airspace where foreign planes face questioning by controllers and potential interception by Taiwanese fighters. Such a tempo of operations has not been seen since 1996. On April 5th the Chinese navy promised patrols by its aircraft-carriers around Taiwan on a regular basis. On April 12th 25 Chinese planes entered the ADIZ, a record for a single day.
This may be a test of the new Biden administration, says a senior Taiwanese diplomat, or a bid to create a “new normal” in which Chinese forces are routinely present in a zone formerly controlled by Taiwan. China knows that Taiwan will not fire first, so “the Chinese will continue to push,” the diplomat says. The constant incursions wear down Taiwanese defences, raise the chances of accidental collisions and would make it harder to spot a rush to real war. Beyond the constant drumbeat of military pressure, China is “trying to divide society, trying to sow the seeds of chaos,” says the diplomat. “They also conduct cyber-activities and disinformation campaigns.”
Wang Zaixi, a former deputy head of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, a semi-official Chinese body, advocates a “third way” between all-out war and political negotiations, one in which a massive display of firepower cows Taiwan into submission. In Chinese media interviews he has cited the (not wholly reassuring) precedent of Red Army troops surrounding Beijing in 1949 in such intimidating numbers that the city fell with rather few casualties, an approach he calls “using war to force peace”.
In some polls less than half of Taiwanese say they would fight in a war with China, or want relatives to do so (compulsory military service was sharply reduced in 2013, by a government keen on closer ties with China). If the island loses more than half of its defences in the first waves of an attack, the public’s will to fight might collapse, frets Mr Yang. A swift collapse would make America’s position yet harder. If American reinforcements arrive to find China’s troops already on the island, asks Ms Skylar Mastro, can they start firing if no Chinese unit has shot at Americans? “I think that would be a very hard call for a US president to make.”
If the Taiwanese appetite for a fight is unclear, so too is America’s. Taiwan’s government is painfully aware that preserving their friendly, successful democracy is not in itself a vital national interest for anyone else. Instead, Taiwanese officials stress the extraordinary importance of the island’s semiconductor industry to global supply chains. They also emphasise how grim and frightening the Asia-Pacific would feel if America ever broke its commitments and ducked a fight with China. Japan’s prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, recently went further than any recent predecessor, when he mentioned the importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait in a joint statement with Mr Biden. Japan fears Taiwan becoming a Chinese bastion just to its south, explains Michishita Narushige of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. But it also has much to lose if America is chased out of the Pacific: “If the fall of Taiwan means the disengagement of the US from this region, that would be a vital interest.”
Some in America want to make clear that maintaining its Asian role is central to America’s interests, too. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat close to Mr Biden, is co-sponsor of the Strategic Competition Act, a bill with strong bipartisan support that would deepen ties with Taiwan—whether by offering the island trade deals, weapons sales, expanded contacts with American officials or support in its attempts to take part in international forums—as one of several measures to push back against what he calls China’s growing global aggression. To explain the island’s importance to voters he talks of how dependent modern life is on the chips it makes. He also cites the importance of America being seen to keep its word and linking arms with allies to counter China, rather than trying to lead the world through “bluster”.
The seeds of time
It may sound a bit narcissistic for Americans to assume that China’s plans for Taiwan turn on how strong America looks to China. But Chinese experts and officials are sincerely convinced that America is delighted to be Taiwan’s security guarantor and thus gain a chance to meddle in China’s internal affairs. Without America to help, Taiwan will surrender in an instant, they argue, rather as Mr Yang fears. Their disdain for the idea that China might try to win over Taiwanese hearts and minds can be chilling. Unification will not be decided by Taiwan’s “playhouse politics” but by geopolitical power struggles, Zhu Feng of Nanjing University told an annual forum run by the Global Times, a jingoistic party newspaper.

Ni Lexiong, a Taiwan expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, says that bellicose commentaries in the state media must, in some limited sense, enjoy official sanction. Such commentators “would be too scared to write about such things without approval”, he says. But he scoffs at Westerners who worry that Chinese leaders may feel compelled by the nationalism which such screeds stoke in the public. The views of the masses will not decide what happens, he says: “The key is military power.”
There is much to be said for America’s decades-long policy of strategic ambiguity. Though some American scholars believe it would usefully deter China to hear the Biden administration say it would join any war over Taiwan, it could also provoke China to rash acts or embolden some future leader on Taiwan to declare independence. Logic also supports the Pentagon’s desire to spend the next ten years arming Taiwan, buying new weapons and thus increasing the uncertainty of Chinese commanders and their political masters.
The challenge of such an approach is to generate enough anxiety to stay China’s hand, but not so much that Mr Xi sees Taiwan slipping permanently from his grasp. For all the alarm in Washington, China does not feel like a country on a war footing, or particularly close to one. Several sources briefed on a recent meeting in Alaska between China’s top foreign-policy officials, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi, and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, report that the Chinese delivered shrill and inflexible talking points on Taiwan, but used no new language that showed unprecedented urgency.
China’s public stance involves much sabre-rattling, to be sure. Viewers of state television are never far from their next sight of an aircraft-carrier, or gleaming jets screaming through azure skies. But calls for sacrifice to prepare the public for full-on hostilities are missing. The party’s claims to legitimacy in this, its centenary year, are overwhelmingly domestic and based on order and material prosperity: they are buttressed by images of gorge-spanning bridges and high-speed trains, villagers raised from poverty and heroic doctors beating back covid-19 even as it rages around the outside world.
Nevertheless, China’s visible capabilities and veiled intent are grounds for alarm. Its scorn for Western opinion, as over Hong Kong, is a bad sign. War over Taiwan may not appear imminent in Beijing. But nor, shockingly, is it unthinkable.■
Correction (April 30th 2021): Due to an editing error this article originally said that the USS Nimitz, an aircraft carrier, sailed through the Taiwan Straits in 1996, halting Chinese missile tests. It actually transited the strait in December 1995 after a first set of Chinese missile tests. Further Chinese missiles were fired in March 1996, causing the Nimitz to return to the area, but not to the strait. The deterrent effect of the Nimitz’s show of force is a point of historical dispute

1535,"AT THE NUREMBERG trials, which began on November 20th 1945, allied forces prosecuted leading Nazis for atrocities committed during the Holocaust and the second world war. Among the charges against them was something which, just four years earlier, Winston Churchill had called “a crime without a name”: genocide, the deliberate destruction of a group of people. The term, and a convention against it, was then formally adopted by the United Nations. Half a century later it became one of just four crimes punishable by the International Criminal Court (along with crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression). Now, there is a push to name another concept as an international crime—destruction of ecosystems and the environment, also known as “ecocide”.
In November last year a group of international lawyers set about formally defining ecocide. The panel—which is co-chaired by Philippe Sands, a lawyer who has appeared before the ICC and the European Court of Justice and wrote a book about bringing the Nazis to justice, and Dior Fall Sow, a former UN international prosecutor—will publish its draft definition in June. After that, they hope, it will be proposed and eventually adopted as an amendment to the Rome Statute, which governs the work of the ICC. If it is, ecocide will be susceptible to all the frustrations and limitations that plague efforts to halt other international crimes. But it could also mark a turning-point in how the relationship between humans and the natural world is understood.

That environmental damage might be curtailed through international criminal law is not a new idea. Some scholars have seized upon the fact that the UN genocide convention prohibits “deliberately inflicting” on the group attacked “conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction”. They argue this could include the devastation of the ecosystems on which the group relies.
In 1972 at the UN Environment Conference in Stockholm, Olof Palme, then prime minister of Sweden, accused the American government of “ecocide” over its use of Agent Orange, a herbicide used to defoliate forests and wither crops, in Vietnam, leaving vast tracts of land barren. Early drafts of the Rome Statute included crimes of “severe environmental damage” but these were ultimately not adopted, apart from a slim provision under war crimes which prohibits “environmental modification techniques”, like Agent Orange, that have “widespread, long-lasting or severe effects”.
The subsequent campaign to have ecocide adopted as an international crime was chiefly the work of Polly Higgins, a barrister and activist who died in 2019. In 2010 Higgins lobbied the UN law commission to make ecocide—which she defined as the “extensive destruction, damage to or loss of ecosystem(s) of a given territory”—a fifth crime against peace. Though it refused, the ICC subsequently agreed to examine cases of environmental destruction as “crimes against humanity”, provided they had a sufficiently deleterious impact on people living within an area. (Early this year, such a case was submitted to The Hague by indigenous leaders against Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president, over deforestation in the Amazon. The ICC is considering it.) Higgins also co-founded the Stop Ecocide Foundation, an NGO, which has continued to advocate since her death for the recognition of ecocide as an international crime and which convened the legal panel currently drafting a definition.
All the crimes overseen by the ICC focus on the protection of humans. Most attempts to include environmental damage in international criminal law have been similarly anthropocentric, tying the status of ecosystems to the benefits they confer to the people that rely on them for homes, livelihoods or food. Mr Sands thinks that ecocide should be defined by the need to protect the environment as an end in itself. This would require it to have its own free-standing basis as a new crime, rather than being slotted under existing ones. Though he does not speak for the group, whose decision must be made collectively, Mr Sands is hopeful that others might feel similarly. “My sense is that there is a broad recognition that the old anthropocentric assumptions may well have to be cast to one side if justice is truly to be done, and the environment given a fair degree of protection,” he says.
Any amendments to the Rome Statute must be proposed by one of the countries that signed it, then approved by two-thirds of the others. Vanuatu and the Maldives, both low-lying archipelagic countries greatly threatened by climate change, have expressed interest in putting forward such an amendment. France and Belgium have promised diplomatic support. Mr Sands believes that the world’s growing environmental consciousness, and public pressure on politicians, will see other countries follow suit. But the required consensus is elusive.
Even if the notion of ecocide is ultimately adopted by the ICC, so what? International criminal law serves mostly as a backstop, and an imperfect one at that. Though countries often change their domestic laws to match global accords, in many instances governments simply delete provisions they dislike. Saudi Arabia, for example, ratified the UN convention on the elimination of “all forms of discrimination against women” in 2001, but refused to accept rules that contradict sharia. Some states simply refuse to sign up at all. Neither China nor America is party to the Rome Statute.
Decades of treaties condemning genocide—and UN stipulations that countries must intervene to stop it—have not prevented it occurring, even when a crime is defined as such by the United Nations. Witness the fate of the Rohingyas in Myanmar. But supporters argue that naming international crimes helps set norms for acceptable behaviour. International court cases also create lasting records of wrongdoing and strip perpetrators of the illusion of impunity. Before the Nuremberg trials, Mr Sands points out, countries were “entirely free to treat their own citizens as they wished. If they wanted to kill half their population, they could do that,” he says. “And that changed in an instant.”

1536,"CONCERNS ABOUT the health of American business are many and varied. Chief executives are chastised for their apparent short-termism. Their companies are berated for fetishising shareholders over everyone and everything else. Elon Musk, boss of Tesla, a maker of electric cars, grumbles about a surfeit of business-school graduates stifling innovation. President Joe Biden frets as much about American companies losing out to China as Donald Trump did (albeit with less bile). He also worries about the concentration of power among America’s biggest firms.
All this paints a picture of America Inc that looks stodgier, more parochial and monopolistic. If true, that would be bad news for the spiritual home of free-market capitalism. But is it? The Economist set out to test all three hypotheses about American business: that it is less dynamic, less global and more concentrated. The results appear nowhere near as bleak as the doom-sayers would have you believe.

Start with dynamism. Scholars have long argued that it isn’t what it used to be. Ten years ago Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, warned that the American economy was in the midst of a “great stagnation”. The reasons cited by Mr Cowen and others range from more red tape to fewer transformative technologies such as aeroplanes and telephones, because the low-hanging fruit had been plucked. Symptoms of the malaise included fewer employers being created, fewer companies going public and fewer investments made by existing ones. The share of workers employed at firms less than a year old fell from 4% of total employment in the 1980s to around 2% in the 2010s. Around three-quarters of the workforce is employed by a company that is more than 16 years old, up from two-thirds in 1992.
Economists are still debating just how great the stagnation really was. One thing is certain, though: since the arrival of covid-19 America Inc has been anything but stagnant. Applications to start new businesses have soared. In the first six months of 2021 around 2.8m new firms were born, 60% more than in the same period in pre-pandemic 2019 (see chart 1). Many are small enterprises created by people stuck at home during lockdowns. A third of the new applications were in retail, in particular the online variety. Business starts in other e-commerce-related areas, including trucking and warehousing, have surged, too, notes John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland. The quit rate, which indicates churn in the labour market, is at a record high. Nearly 3% of workers left their job in July, presumably because they believe they can get a better one.

Larger contenders are also thriving. Take America’s biggest startups. CB Insights, a data firm, found that in 2019 a monthly average of five unlisted firms became “unicorns” (ie, were valued at over $1bn). Since the start of 2020 that figure has swelled to 12. Many older unicorns have gone public. Airbnb, a holiday-rental firm, was the biggest American initial public offering (IPO) of 2020. Its valuation surged past $100bn on the first day of trading. Since January 2020 the average number of monthly IPOs has risen three-fold, to around 80. In that period American firms have raised nearly $350bn, more than in the preceding seven years added together.
Some of the ferment comes out of necessity. A survey by the Kauffman Foundation, a think-tank, finds that the share of new entrepreneurs who are starting businesses because they spy an opportunity rather than because they lost their jobs dropped from 87% in 2019 to 70% in 2020. But the “physiological shock” of the pandemic may also have led people to re-evaluate their lives, says Kenan Fikri of the Economic Innovation Group, another think-tank. Some of them handed in their notice and struck out on their own.
With the Federal Reserve flooding markets with newly created cash, investors had plenty of capital to back businesses of all sizes. Jim Tierney of AllianceBernstein, an investment firm, observes that the market is favouring disruptive new entrants such as Robinhood, a broker catering to day-traders. With less than one retail trader for every 70 at Charles Schwab, recently listed Robinhood already boasts half the incumbent firm’s market capitalisation. Small wonder American unicorns are eager to list, says Mr Tierney.
Cheap capital is also encouraging the established beasts of American business to boost their investment plans. American companies’ real spending on equipment, structures and software grew at an annualised rate of 13% in the first half of the year, the fastest since 1984. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, will spend $430bn in America over a five-year period, 20% more than it had previously planned. Intel is splurging some $20bn a year on new microchip factories.
If dynamism was ever in retreat, then, it no longer appears to be. Even Mr Cowen has all but declared the great stagnation over. What about American firms’ global stature? World trade as a share of planetary GDP peaked in 2008. In America imports and exports as a proportion of output have declined from an all-time high of 31% in 2011 to 26%. Mr Biden’s policies show a preference for jobs at home over free trade. Covid-19 has disrupted some supply chains, prompting a number of pundits to predict a wave of reshoring. “The era of reflexive offshoring is over,” declared Robert Lighthizer, Mr Trump’s trade representative, in the New York Times in 2020.
Before the pandemic some data were indeed hinting that corporate America was becoming less global. Dealogic, a research firm, estimated that cross-border mergers and acquisitions by American firms as a share of domestic M activity declined from 16% in 2014 to 9% in 2019. In the past 18 months, however, this figure has jumped back to around a fifth, thanks in part to all that cheap capital. Other indicators of internationalism have barely budged. Kearney, a consultancy, tries to capture the extent of reshoring by looking at the total value of manufactured goods imported from a list of 14 trading partners, including China, Vietnam and Malaysia, relative to American manufacturing output. Between 2018 and 2020 this ratio has stayed stable at around 13%.
Some companies are, it is true, adapting their supply chains. They are seriously considering moving manufacturing out of China, says Jan Loeys of JPMorgan Chase, a bank. But those companies are mostly eyeing nearby countries, often in addition to rather than instead of their Chinese suppliers. American imports from Taiwan rose by 35%, or $11bn, in the first seven months of 2021, compared with the same period in 2019. But those from China increased by nearly as much in dollar terms.
Americans also continue to sell a lot to foreigners. The Economist looked at the share of revenue earned overseas by non-financial firms in the Russell 3000, a broad index of American firms. Some industries, such as professional services, have seen their domestic share of sales increase, as lockdowns around the world hampered foreign contracts. Others, such as entertainment, have become more reliant on foreign sales; Netflix now books 54% of its revenue abroad, up from 40% a few years ago. Imax, a cinema chain, has made over two-thirds of its revenue this year from Asia, compared with two-fifths in 2017.

Overall, the median firm’s foreign sales as a share of its total has stayed flat at 15%. So has the revenue-weighted average, which has oscillated around 35% (see chart 2). Two in five firms make more than half of their sales abroad, a share that has also remained more or less constant in the past four years. CEOs fall over themselves to signal international ambition during earnings calls. On July 27th Tim Cook, who runs Apple, named 14 countries where the iPhone-maker’s sales reached a record high for the third quarter. “I could go on...It’s a very long list.” On the same day Kevin Johnson, boss of Starbucks, said he was “very bullish” about the coffee-pedlar’s prospects in China.
Power dynamics
The third area of concern is market concentration. In 2016 we published an analysis that divided the American economy into around 900 sectors covered by the five-yearly economic census. Two-thirds of them had grown more concentrated between 1997 and 2012. The weighted-average market share of the top four firms in each sector had risen from 26% to 32%. The latest census data up to 2017 show that the trend did not reverse. But nor did it accelerate. Although concentration edged up in around half of industries between 2012 and 2017, the weighted-average market share across all sectors remained at 32%.
More recent census data will not be published for years. So we looked at the market share of the top four firms in the Russell 3000. In seven of the ten sectors, the revenue-weighted market concentration was a bit higher in the past 12 months than in 2019. Similarly, Bank of America, which has tracked the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, a gauge of market concentration, for firms in the Russell 3000 since 1986, reports that it hit a new high in 2020.
This could be because deep downturns like last year’s covid recession tend to favour large firms with healthy balance-sheets. Big tech in particular has benefited from the pandemic shift to all things digital. America’s five tech titans—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—notched up combined revenues of $1.3trn in the past 12 months, 43% higher than in 2019. They are America’s five most valuable companies, accounting for 16% of its entire stockmarket value—considerably higher than the 10% attributable to the five biggest firms in the past 50 years, according to calculations by Thomas Philippon of New York University’s Stern School of Business.
In hard-hit industries, meanwhile, cash-rich survivors are snapping up struggling rivals, fuelling an M bonanza. Between January and August American companies announced deals worth almost $2trn. The sectors which saw the biggest rise in concentration were those disrupted by covid-19, such as real estate and consumer goods (where the top four’s share has jumped by around four percentage points since 2019). Some big firms are getting a larger slice of a shrinking pie. Among energy-services companies, such as Haliburton, the strongest four increased their market share from 59% to 75%, even as sectoral sales fell by a quarter.
All this would be worrying—were it not for concomitant trends. The tech giants, for example, are increasingly stomping on each other’s turf. Nearly 40% of the revenues of the big five now come from areas where their businesses overlap, up from a fifth in 2015. Facebook wants to become an e-merchant, Amazon is getting into online ads, Google and Microsoft are challenging Amazon in the computing cloud, and Apple is reportedly building a search engine.
Such oligopolistic competition is not ideal, perhaps, but much better than nothing. And money flowing to newly listed disruptors and to corporate capital budgets implies that companies and investors are spying fresh opportunities for future profits, including at the expense of incumbents, should they become complacent. American business could use some more pep here or there—who couldn’t? But it does not scream sclerosis, either. ■

1537,"NEARLY TWO years into the covid-19 pandemic, China’s propaganda machine is locked in a futile argument with the outside world. The row is about whether this giant country is paying too high a price for its “zero-covid” policy. China’s attempts to eliminate the virus, rather than merely manage it, are certainly costly. They have largely closed China’s borders for 19 months. Dozens of city districts, towns and counties are enduring lockdowns as the highly contagious Delta variant and an early cold snap cause a flare-up of infections. There are several hundred cases of the disease nationwide. Many of them are local transmissions rather than imports from abroad, underscoring Delta’s perils. Controls include roadblocks manned by police in protective suits, closed schools, cancelled trains and testing of millions of residents.
With officials facing punishment for cases on their watch, grassroots harshness abounds. The northern city of Heihe has declared a “people’s war”, with rewards of up to 100,000 yuan ($15,600) for residents who report such pandemic crimes as illegal hunting. A county in Inner Mongolia locked nearly 10,000 tourists in hotels for two weeks to smother an outbreak. Two pharmacies in suburban Beijing lost their licences for selling fever-reducing medicines to a couple without logging their names in a virus-tracking database. The customers, who had earlier visited areas with covid cases and later tested positive, are being prosecuted for failing to report to a fever clinic. Citing possible transmission risks, officials in cities including Chengdu, Harbin and Wuxi entered the homes of quarantined locals and killed their pet cats.

Officials reject foreign reports that call such measures unsustainable. “It’s simply not right to question China’s efforts to eliminate the virus,” complained Xinhua, a state news agency, citing the country’s “robust” economy and calling travel curbs a “minor inconvenience”. Hu Xijin, the editor of a tabloid newspaper, says foreigners are jealous of China’s virus-fighting record, and charges that America has eased pandemic controls because it values “money over life”. In fact, the two sides are talking past one another if they focus on how strict zero-covid policies are. It is more relevant to ask who feels the pain from those controls. They are best understood as a giant utilitarian experiment. To help the majority enjoy an orderly, covid-free existence, a hapless minority—notably those who catch the virus or are suspected of contact with carriers—must sacrifice individual liberties, privacy and dignity.
A focus on the interests of the majority resonates with many Chinese. They remember images of chaos in Wuhan last year, as the virus overwhelmed hospitals in that city of 10m. They know that the health system is weaker outside big urban centres. Many doctors in rural clinics lack university degrees. Intensive-care beds are rare. American-style pandemic policies could have led to millions of deaths. As for closed borders, which cause anguish to expatriates and Chinese with family overseas, they do not greatly pain the 87% of the population without passports.
Many citizens of democratic countries would not tolerate half the rules imposed on China in this pandemic. But the collective sacrifices of the Chinese have produced something remarkable. In a country of 1.4bn people, the official total death toll from the pandemic is under 6,000, compared with almost 808,000 excess deaths in America, which has less than one-quarter of China’s population. Some scepticism of China’s statistics is reasonable, given that officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected, concealed the virus for weeks in late 2019 and early 2020. Yet if large outbreaks were still being concealed today, control systems would start breaking down, for they rely on tracking and tracing fresh cases. Instead, life in much of China is relatively normal.
Strictness for the greater good continues to enjoy unmistakable public support. But Chinese leaders do face a risk whenever public opinion suspects that overly harsh lockdowns actually serve the interests of a minority, ie, officials eager to cover their backs. There are signs of disquiet. Chengdu, for instance, recently broadened its pandemic controls, testing 82,000 people whose mobile telephones had spent ten minutes within 800 metres of a suspected case. Other cities have started copying this approach. But on November 8th two leading epidemiologists and a doctor in Chengdu wrote an open letter warning pandemic officials that such mass testing must be guided by science, and risks causing panic. That officials keep talking about punishing rule-breakers is a sign of at least some public fatigue. It also risks driving the weary to hide from the authorities.
The party calls pandemic control proof that it loves the people
To maintain support, strict controls must be seen to benefit everyone, though a minority will feel the most hardship. Foreigners in China, yearning for borders to open, often suggest that the sight of normality in the rest of the world will soon make Chinese citizens restless. For now, state media keep such envy at bay by presenting the West as a death-stalked hellhole. An online video promoted this week by state media is filled with images of Donald Trump when he was America’s president, and the chaos abroad of those days. It calls American travellers “walking vectors of contagion”.
To date, zero-covid’s worst effects have been felt by luckless minorities, from locked-down residents to those whose livelihoods depend on free movement within and outside China. Fear, and the stigma endured by those who catch the virus, have ensured compliance with orders. Harsh policies have bought China’s leaders time, as they wait for potent vaccines and antiviral drugs that might let them open up safely. Officials have arguably slowed an exit by refusing to approve foreign vaccines that are more effective than China’s, in their eagerness to prove the superiority of one-party rule over Western democracy. Further mutations of the virus may one day challenge China’s strategy. If they make lockdowns more frequent, the ranks of the unlucky will grow.■

1538,"NEW DELHI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - India, grappling with its worst power crisis in five years, has asked Qatar to expedite delivery of 58 delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Asia's third largest economy is suffering its worst power shortage since March 2016 due to a crippling coal shortage amid high global energy prices.
Infrastructure maintenance at supplier Qatargas prevented it from delivering 50 LNG cargoes to India this year, the sources said, prompting India's oil ministry last week to write a letter seeking delivery of those cargoes.
The ministry is also seeking eight additional cargoes which were delayed last year at New Delhi's request after COVID-induced lockdowns lowered demand for the super-cooled fuel, they said.
The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media.
India's top gas importer, Petronet LNG (PLNG.NS), has long-term deals to buy 7.5 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of LNG from Qatar and 1.44 mtpa from Exxon's Gorgon project in Australia.
LNG under those long-term deals costs about $11-$12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), versus more than $38 per mmBtu on Asia's spot gas  market currently and a record high of over $56 hit earlier this month.  read more 
Indian customers in August started deferring imports of spot LNG due to high prices, Petronet LNG CEO A.K. Singh said at the time.
He said the Indian power sector reduces its intake of LNG once prices rise above about $10/mmBtu.
India has 24 gigawatts (GW) of gas-fired power generation capacity of which about 14 GW has been stranded for more than 10 years due to non-availability of gas, while the remaining plants are operating at very low capacity.
India's oil ministry, Qatargas and its parent company Qatar Energy did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comment.",3
1539,"“THE RAIN it raineth every day,” Feste tells the audience at the end of “Twelfth Night”. And the COP it COPpeth every year. Since 1995 the countries bound by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have missed only one conference of the parties—when the pandemic struck in 2020. These COPs can produce action plans (Bali, 2007), mandates (Berlin, 1995), protocols (Kyoto, 1997), platforms (Durban, 2011), acrimonious breakdowns (Copenhagen, 2009) and agreements (Paris, 2015). But the rise in the atmosphere’s greenhouse-gas content and the associated warming of the climate continues in spite of them—even when, as so often, they are hyped as the world’s last chance.
As diplomats, scientists, lobbyists, activists, artists, the media, politicians and businesspeople gather in Glasgow for COP26, which begins on October 31st, it is therefore easy to dismiss the entire affair. That would be a mistake. The UNFCCC and its COPs, for all their flaws, play a crucial part in a process that is historic and vital: the removal of the fundamental limit on human flourishing imposed by dependence on fossil fuels.

One reason COPs matter is that some of them do in fact make a difference. Despite rules on consensus, meaning that the pace is set by the least willing, the agreement in Paris committed all parties, rich and poor, to keep the rise in Earth’s temperature since the mid-19th century well below 2°C. Glasgow will bring fresh national pledges promising increased efforts towards the Paris temperature targets—though they will not be ambitious enough to make meeting those goals likely.
The main reason the UNFCCC and COP process matters is that the science, diplomacy, activism and public opinion that support it make up the best mechanism the world currently has to help it come to terms with a fundamental truth. The dream of a planet of almost 8bn people all living in material comfort will be unachievable if it is based on an economy powered by coal, oil and natural gas. The harms from the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide would eventually pile up so rapidly that fossil-fuel-fired development would stall.
As our special report in this week’s issue sets out, nowhere is this logic more pressing than in Asia. About 1.5bn Asians live in the tropics. Hundreds of millions of them live near the coasts. For their economies to continue to grow, they will need ever more energy. If this comes in the fossil-fuelled manner of past decades they will have to bear the mounting costs of adapting to and living with floods, storms, heatwaves and droughts long before they get rich. As the world heats up, they will have to run faster just to stay in the same place. Zero-emissions technology could free them from this dismal bind: in principle, they can tap into a supply of development-promoting energy that is, in effect, unlimited.
In the long run, therefore, the only way to keep growing is by leaving fossil fuels behind. That requires Asian countries, in most of which emissions are still surging, to forgo much more by way of future emissions than the countries of the developed world, where emissions are already declining. India is vocal in pointing to the unfairness of this, so far refusing to embrace carbon neutrality. Let others with more responsibility for historical emissions do more, it says.
However just that may be, the problem for India—and for everyone else—is that the daunting cost of limiting emissions is falling on a few generations, most of whose members live in developing countries. All of them live in a fractious world where there is a dearth of leadership. America’s government is not suddenly a reliable partner just because it has now rejoined the Paris agreement. Nor is China, the world’s largest emitter. Though its capacity for action is great, its pledges thus far are more about posturing than substance. The multilateral institutions created to spread the cost between countries equitably are weak and hostage to procedures based on consensus and unanimity.
For all their disappointments, the UNFCCC and its repeated COPs are the best forum to force change. But until the arguments sink in, the wisest response is bold, prompt action from willing countries in Europe and elsewhere that others cannot frustrate.
As so often in climate change, the task is not choosing between options so much as finding how to press ahead with all of them at once. A commitment to large, fast reductions in methane emissions is vital. More money for developing-country decarbonisation, in which government investment can lower risks for the private sector, must flow alongside increased aid for adaptation. Innovation should be encouraged in various ways. America’s 45Q tax incentives for carbon capture could be expanded at home and copied by Europe.
Investment in fossil fuels has fallen faster than replacements have come on line, aggravating the dramatic recent price rises. In the long term it is necessary that fossil fuels become increasingly expensive, but peaks and volatility are destructive. Governments need to build more buffers into the current system as well as hasten alternatives. When prices fall, those still subsidising fossil fuels will have an excellent opportunity to stop.
Anyone who dreams of a reprieve for fossil fuels must be disabused. It suits Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, Scott Morrison, prime minister of Australia, and Joe Manchin, a senator from West Virginia, never to speak of an end to the fossil-fuels age. But for them to duck the responsibility of planning a transition is rank cowardice. True, oil and gas cannot vanish overnight, but their day is closing. And coal’s day must be done.
Then there are the unanswered questions. Meeting the Paris targets will require carbon dioxide to be withdrawn from the atmosphere: who will do it? And who will pay? Some countries may one day seek to ward off disaster with solar geoengineering, which reduces the amount of incoming sunlight. Might that help? If not, could it be stopped?
Feste laments an unchanging world. The climate crisis stems from change which is out of control. Yet by responding to it, the world can become a place where long-run prosperity for all becomes possible. It is a noble future that the fossil-fuel age, despite its illusory plenty, could never have created. ■

1540,"WHEN THE evacuation of Saigon began in March 1975, fixed-wing flights were quickly abandoned. Keeping runways open under artillery fire was too difficult. Instead, the American army used helicopters to bring people from all over the South Vietnamese capital to aircraft-carriers in the South China Sea. In landlocked Kabul, the American government does not have that option as it tries to evacuate its own citizens and Afghans who have worked for the United States. And so the scenes beamed all over the world from the city’s airport on August 15th and 16th were not of choppers carrying people to safety, but of an Apache attack helicopter hovering low over the runway to chase off a crowd of desperate Afghans so that planes could take off. The image that people will remember will be that of an air force transport plane taking off with desperate Afghans clinging to its undercarriage, from which they fell to their deaths.
The chaos was predictable. For weeks, flights out of Kabul had been packed with foreigners and those Afghans lucky enough to have passports, visas and money. When the city fell to the Taliban, less than 24 hours after President Ashraf Ghani visited the edge of the capital to inspect its defences, it was inevitable that people would try to flee. The airport is now the only part of Kabul not held by the militants. Instead, it is defended by several thousand American and other foreign troops, many flown in specifically for the evacuation. The Americans have taken over air-traffic control, and their Boeing C-17 transport planes have been leaving packed tightly with refugees. One was reported by Defence One, a website, to have landed in Qatar with 640 passengers, a near record. In one case, the dead body of an Afghan was found in the landing gear of a C-17. A picture showed families crammed into every available space of the cargo bay.

Over the coming weeks, the evacuation could lift away tens of thousands of people. The Pentagon has said that at least 22,000 Afghans who qualify for “special immigrant visas” (SIVs) will be airlifted out, at a rate of 5,000 per day. Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, told her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party that 10,000 will be admitted. Priti Patel, Britain's home secretary, says that the country will take up 20,000 refugees, up to 5,000 of them within a year. It had already planned to evacuate 2,700 people, including 900 Britons and 1,600 Afghans who had worked directly with British forces. How exactly all this will work is unclear. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told a radio show that the government had set a deadline of August 31st to finish its immediate evacuation. But as he noted, choking with emotion, “some people won’t get back.”

The last-minute panic to rescue interpreters and others who have worked for foreign armies could have been avoided. America’s SIV programme has been in existence since 2009. Yet it has been taking years to issue visas to former workers. By June 16,000 Afghan workers and their families had been resettled under the programme, but 18,000 applications were still waiting to be processed. In Britain the government by June had resettled only around 1,300 interpreters and their families. It changed its mind on whether Afghans employed indirectly through contractors ought to qualify as late as August 3rd. The rush now is making up for lost time.
The Taliban, for their part, insist the scramble to leave is unnecessary. They have said they have “no plans to take revenge on anyone”, and have promised a “general amnesty” to government employees and asked them to come back to work. Foreign diplomats have been told that they can stay. The UN has continued to work in many parts of the country. Afghan journalists working for TOLONews, a TV channel, have continued broadcasting; female presenters have even interviewed Taliban officials live on air. But though they have not hindered the evacuation flights, Taliban soldiers are reported to be checking people trying to get into the airport, and preventing many from leaving the country. Thousands of Afghans who might be accepted to fly remain in hiding, wondering if they will be able to escape.

What happens next? Over the past four decades of conflict, millions of Afghans have been displaced within the country’s borders and then spilled into neighbouring countries. The UN counts 2.5m registered refugees, or roughly 6% of the country’s population. Of these, an estimated 780,000 Afghan refugees were in Iran, but the UN thinks a further 2m unregistered Afghans are also there. Another 1.4m registered Afghans have taken long-term shelter in Pakistan. Those are among the largest refugee populations anywhere. Efforts to repatriate some of those people are likely to be stalled, and their numbers will probably swell. Iran is bracing itself for a new influx of Shia Muslims fleeing the anti-Shia Taliban (though it has supported them in their fight against America). It is setting up camps in three provinces along its eastern border.
Many may try to go farther. Even as they evacuate their citizens and local friends, politicians in rich countries are already terrified of a bigger emerging refugee crisis. As many as half a million Afghans may already be in Turkey. Even if fighting does not break out again, many more could flee if the Taliban begin to impose their brutal version of sharia in Afghan cities or if humanitarian aid collapses. As recently as August 5th, ministers from six European countries signed a letter supporting the continued deportation of failed Afghan asylum-seekers (many have halted the practice). Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, has promised to crack down on people-smugglers, saying that “we must anticipate and protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows”. Armin Laschet, the CDU’s candidate to succeed Mrs Merkel after next month’s German election, has said, “We should not send the signal that Germany can take in everyone in need.” German politicians are worried about a repeat of 2015, when more than 1m Syrian refugees arrived. Some Europeans, notably Mrs Merkel, welcomed them, but a nativist backlash soon followed.
Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, called on countries not to “prematurely recognise” the militants. But for now, tens of thousands of Afghans who worked with international forces, as well as their families, have been abandoned. Millions more face an uncertain future. They will be hoping that the Taliban’s promises mean something, but fearing the worst.

1541,"MYAWADDY, A TELEVISION station owned by the Burmese army, is normally so bad as to be unwatchable. But when the residents of Naypyidaw, Myanmar’s capital, and Yangon, its largest city, woke on February 1st to find soldiers in the streets and martial music blaring from their radios Myawaddy became “must-see TV”. It was a Myawaddy newsreader who announced that the country was in a state of emergency and under the control of Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the army.
Soldiers were stationed in government offices. Airports were closed and, in the cities, the internet shut down. Hundreds of politicians from the National League for Democracy (NLD), which won an overwhelming victory in the country’s parliamentary elections last November, were put under house arrest. The armed forces also rounded up chief ministers from all the country’s 14 states in addition to democracy activists, writers, three monks and a film-maker, Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi. Aung San Suu Kyi, who became a figure of global renown when she led the NLD from house arrest during the 1990s and 2000s, and who as “state counsellor” was the country’s undisputed civilian leader, now finds herself under lock and key again.

The army, known as the Tatmadaw, is used to being in charge. When created through conquest in the 19th century, British Burma lumped together over 100 different ethnic groups. After independence in 1948 many of those groups promptly rebelled against the new government. The army, then as now dominated by officers from the Bamar ethnic majority, began a suppression of such separatism that has gone on ever since. After toppling a democratically elected government in 1962 it stayed in power almost continuously for nearly 50 years, justifying its rule on the basis that it was the only institution capable of holding the country together. In 1988 it savagely quashed a democratic uprising.
In 2011, though, the Tatmadaw amazed the world by making way for a civilian government. There were two reasons. The first was that they were worried about the country’s direction of travel. Decades of diplomatic isolation by the West had forced Myanmar into China’s orbit, something the generals were uneasy about. They were also embarrassed about the country’s economy, which they had driven into the ground. In 1962 Burma had been one of Asia’s richest countries. Fifty years later it was one of the poorest. In 2008 the regime’s woeful response to Cyclone Nargis, which killed 140,000 people, destroyed any vestiges of credibility it might still have had.
The second reason for allowing a civilian government was that the Tatmadaw thought it could do so without really losing power. The generals painstakingly designed a hybrid political system that entrusted the thankless task of governance to civilians but enshrined the Tatmadaw’s independence and many of its powers. In the constitution for this “discipline-flourishing democracy”, as they memorably called it, the commander-in-chief of the army appoints the man who is notionally his boss, the minister of defence, as well as the ministers of the interior and border control. He thus commands all the organs of state security. A quarter of the seats in parliament are reserved for serving military officers appointed to them, which gives the army an effective veto over all constitutional change. Even as tensions rose over the past few weeks, many believed a coup unlikely simply because the constitution already protects the Tatmadaw’s interests so well.
Ms Suu Kyi’s NLD boycotted the first elections held under this new constitution in 2010, ushering in five years of rule by Thein Sein, an ex-general, and his Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), a proxy for the Tatmadaw. But in 2011, following talks with Mr Thein Sein, Ms Suu Kyi engaged in the process. After success in by-elections the NLD won a landslide victory in the general election of 2015.
The army had tried to ensure that, even if her party won at the polls, Ms Suu Kyi could not herself wield power. The framers of its constitution included a novel clause that bars anyone with foreign relatives from the presidency; it is in no way a coincidence that Ms Suu Kyi has two British sons. It was to circumvent this obstacle that, after the NLD took office in 2016, parliament created the new position of state counsellor.
Best laid plans
The generals were able to take some consolation from the fact that, having achieved power, Ms Suu Kyi did not use it very well. A lacklustre performance was to some extent unavoidable, given the constitutional constraints that stopped her from exerting power over the army and the weakness of all other governmental institutions. But the state counsellor added unforced errors. At first she surrounded herself with ministers whose only credentials were loyalty and grey hair, and though some of the duffers were later replaced with technocrats her management wasted their potential; she brooked no dissent and refused to delegate. The economy was sluggish; the country’s precariat grew. Though Ms Suu Kyi continued peace talks with various separatist factions begun under Mr Thein Sein, she alienated many minorities by refusing to take their grievances seriously or to include their representatives in government.

General Min Aung Hlaing had particular reason to hope that this poor record would be reflected in November’s vote. He was due to retire from the armed forces this coming July and appears to have harboured hopes of becoming president; he has a hunger for “raw power”, says David Mathieson, an analyst based in Thailand. With a quarter of the seats in parliament occupied by loyal officers come what may, a reasonable showing by the USDP would have produced a legislature happy to vote him into office even if the NLD was the biggest party.
It was not to be. Myanmar’s system of first-past-the-post constituencies gave the NLD 83% of the elected seats in parliament; the USDP got just 7%. The USDP promptly made allegations of fraud to the electoral commission, which administered the poll. The commission denied them.
There were some problems with the election, and the government refused to allow any voting in some places, citing fears of violence. The same had been done in 2010 and 2015, but this time the no-vote zones in the states of Bago, Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine and Shan were significantly larger. Nonetheless, independent election observers, including those from overseas, agreed that there was no proof of fraud on a scale sufficient to overturn the NLD’s landslide victory.
The army, which thought its handcrafted constitution would never see it in the minority, faced the prospect of taking up permanent residence there. And General Min Aung Hlaing’s personal ambitions were dashed. He still “needed something to guarantee his legacy, his liberty and his family wealth,” says a Western diplomat based in Yangon. But, denied the presidency, “He didn’t have a plan B.”
In a conscious or unconscious echo of what was going on in Washington, DC, the Tatmadaw took up the USDP’s cry of “terrible fraud”. By January 26th its spokesman was refusing to rule out the possibility of a coup. At crisis talks on January 28th the army demanded that the new session of parliament, scheduled to start on February 1st, be delayed while a nationwide recount of the vote took place. The government refused, and over the weekend parliamentarians duly gathered in Naypyidaw to get on with things—which made it easy for the armed forces to gather them all up at once.
Forwards to the past
In many ways post-coup Myanmar looks familiar. The army is again in charge, but the reasons it had for stepping aside persist. Ms Suu Kyi is again under house arrest, but remains by far the most popular politician in the country.
Her international standing, admittedly, is not what it was. In 2017 insurgents from the Muslim Rohingya minority attacked an army base in Rakhine. The Tatmadaw, in concert with Buddhist mobs, responded by sacking Rohingya villages, killing at least 10,000 and impelling 720,000 to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. Many Bamars cheered the army on.
The generals may have hoped that this violence would see Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel-prizewinning human-rights icon, sacrifice support at home by defending the rights of Rohingyas. She went the other way, refusing to denounce the army’s “clearance operations”. In 2019 she went to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to defend the generals accused of genocide. Her reputation abroad will never recover; at home it was burnished. Her performance at the ICJ probably helped win the NLD their massive majority in November.
The army’s best chance of getting out of the cleft stick into which it has reinserted itself is to delegitimise the NLD and make itself and its proxies more popular. To further the first agenda it argues that its coup was a defence of democracy in the face of the NLD’s stolen election, and carried out in a perfectly proper way. The state of emergency was, as the constitution requires, enacted by the president—albeit a rather fresh one, as Myint Swe, a retired general, had been elevated from the vice-presidency only minutes earlier, following the detention of the former president, Win Myint of the NLD. Ms Suu Kyi’s detention is justified by the charge that she had improperly imported walkie-talkies—a charge which puts her at risk of being barred from office. Most of the other politicians originally detained have since been released.
The commander-in-chief will try to “position [his administration] as a more effective government, relative to the NLD,” says Tom Kean, editor-in-chief of Frontier, a magazine based in Yangon. General Min Aung Hlaing has said that his government will focus on battling covid-19, boosting the economy and brokering peace with insurgent forces.
International sanctions might put paid to his hopes of economic growth—but they are not a foregone conclusion. Since 2019 America has had specific sanctions aimed at General Min Aung Hlaing and three other officers associated with the pogroms against Rohingyas. President Joe Biden has threatened to reimpose broader sanctions lifted after the elections of 2010. Such sanctions might well, as they did during the years of military rule, hurt the poorest members of a highly unequal society most. Myanmar’s army rulers and the business networks and smuggling rackets they patronise, used to such constraints, would be much less affected.
One of those sceptical about a policy of isolation may well be the Indo-Pacific tsar in Mr Biden’s National Security Council, Kurt Campbell, who from 2009 on orchestrated America’s rapprochement with Myanmar under Barack Obama. On past form he will argue that engagement with Myanmar is the only hope of getting the democratic process back on track.
Part of Mr Campbell’s strategy in the 2010s was to play on the Tatmadaw’s worries about China’s power over their isolated country. Those fears, like the other drivers behind that opening-up, are still apparent today. The army is wary of Chinese support for insurgencies along their shared border. Chinese interests are deeply embedded in the country’s dysfunctional economy, easily discerned in arms sales, infrastructure projects, an army of small traders and border enclaves that are havens for gambling, smuggling and money-laundering.
The fact that Chinese state media described the coup as no more than a “major cabinet reshuffle” suggests that the Chinese government, which had been wooing Ms Suu Kyi, is keen to be on good terms with the new regime. Myanmar offers it a strategically crucial direct route to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean beyond—a way for China’s imports of oil and gas to bypass the potential chokehold of the Malacca Straits and for exports to be shipped out of its inner provinces. In time it could be a military foothold, too.
The physical manifestation of these strategic desires is the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, over $21bn-worth of country-spanning projects including a railway, oil and gas pipelines and a deepwater port at Kyaukphyu. These projects were troubled even before the uncertainty injected by the coup. It is far from clear how Myanmar can pay for them all. And the links run through the territories of various ethnic minorities, including, in Rakhine, the territory where the ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas took place. Chinese-backed construction is more likely to inflame existing ethnic conflicts in such places than to bring peace and development.
The wars at home
While outsiders vie for favour and seek to engineer an outcome they prefer, political opposition inside Myanmar may be weak. On February 3rd staff at 70 hospitals in 30 towns went on strike. The following day, a small demonstration took place in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second city. The All Burma Federation of Student Unions, which played a role in the seminal protest movement which saw Ms Suu Kyi emerge as a leader in 1988, is planning protests across the country, according to Wai Yan Phyoe Moe, the organisation’s vice-chair. But the NLD itself is in disarray. “Without [Ms Suu Kyi’s] leadership in the short term, I think it will be difficult for the NLD to respond cohesively to this challenge it now faces,” says Mr Kean.

Nay Phone Latt, an activist and political prisoner under the last junta, suspects that at least for the moment people would prefer to express their dissent on social media rather than in the streets, daunted as they are by the twin risks of catching covid-19 and provoking the army. “We saw such brutal crackdowns in the past,” he says. After the coup’s initial restrictions on internet use were eased (they were too disruptive to business) criticism flooded social media, leading the regime to order internet providers to block Facebook, widely used in Myanmar, for four days from February 4th. In the longer term the Tatmadaw has other weapons at its disposal, like disinformation. Mr Wai Yan Phyoe Moe alleges that the army is already trying to sow doubt about the true identities of protesters in order to foment instability.
As these fights continue online, others will be fought on the ground. General Min Aung Hlaing’s talk of reinvigorating peace talks needs to be read in the context of the army’s belief that negotiation works best from a position of strength. “[The coup] is a precursor to a much more aggressive [military] approach,” says Avinash Paliwal, of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He believes that the Kachin Independence Army, one of the more powerful armed groups, has privately warned its rank and file to “prepare for the worst”. It may not escape the junta’s notice that more intense fighting could offer a pretext for extending the state of emergency.
Attending to health and the economy while refraining from violence in the Bamar heartland may win the new regime the support it needs for the next election to produce a parliament more to the Tatmadaw’s liking. To help things along it has already appointed loyalists to a new election commission, and Ian Holliday of the University of Hong Kong suspects that it may seek a way to ditch the first-past-the-post system which has amplified the NLD’s parliamentary majorities.
Their aim is not inconceivable. Most Burmese adore Ms Suu Kyi. But their views on democracy are ambivalent. Although 87% of those surveyed in 2019 by the Asian Barometer Survey say that they support democracy, two-thirds believe it neither promotes economic growth nor maintains order. Nearly half support a role for the Tatmadaw in politics—more than in 2015.
But having had a taste of democracy for the past five years, many Burmese will be loth to give it up. “We are afraid of being beaten or killed or shot,” says Mr Wai Yan Phyoe Moe. “But we have also seen that many people have sacrificed their lives fighting injustice during the military dictatorship in past decades. This time it is our duty to end the injustice.”■",2
1542,"LATIN AMERICA’S economies are punch-drunk from the pandemic. No other region suffered a bigger drop in GDP in 2020 or a higher death rate. Even before the coronavirus arrived, the larger Latin economies lagged behind emerging-world success stories in Asia and Europe. They were held back by poor governance, excessive dependence on commodities and protectionism. In the steepness of its barriers to trade, the region is second only to sub-Saharan Africa. From 1995 to 2015 its participation in global supply chains rose by just 0.1%; in the rest of the world supply-chain trade jumped by 19%.
But the Americas now have a chance to make progress. The capriciousness of Chinese regulators, the tangled state of global trade and the trend towards reshoring and nearshoring are prompting firms in the United States to reassess where they should build factories and invest their cash. With the right policies, Latin American countries could be attractive locations for new plants supplying the United States and each other. This is the best chance in decades to pursue a policy of regional economic integration.

Whether that actually takes place will depend in part on President Joe Biden. Already, Latin American governments are being courted to take part in Mr Biden’s Build Back Better World partnership, an infrastructure-investment programme that is intended to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Yet, for all its good intentions, the Biden plan lacks ambition.
As well as promoting infrastructure-building, Mr Biden should urge his neighbours to lower trade barriers, harmonise provisions across the hundreds of trade agreements which already criss-cross the region and clear up onerous customs procedures. This could help persuade investors to take the plunge.
Nobody should underestimate how hard it will be to overcome Latin America’s scepticism of markets. Big economies such as Brazil and Argentina have long been protectionist, coddling domestic firms behind high trade barriers. The results of past trade deals have sometimes been disappointing.
Policy mistakes continue. Left-wing leaders, such as Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, want less private capital in the economy, not more. Peru has recently elected a far-left leader, Pedro Castillo, who has been seeking to calm the market’s apprehension about his economic policies, with only some success.
Partly as a result, Latin America has failed to transform itself economically as East Asia has done over the past generation. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994, real income per person in Mexico, measured by purchasing power, has fallen further behind that in the United States.
However, you can find signs of openness. Uruguay is seeking new trade deals with China and, as part of a regional grouping, South Korea. In Ecuador Guillermo Lasso, the president and a former banker, is valiantly battling populism. Countries that have been open to trade, like Chile and Costa Rica, have outgrown their inward-looking Latin American peers.
Even Mexico holds out some hope. In recent years its exporters competed directly with China’s in industries that China came to dominate. Now Mexicans have adapted. Whereas the country’s overall growth has been disappointing, its manufacturers have shifted from low-value textiles into automotive, aerospace and semiconductor industries that will benefit from being close to the United States and far from China.
Mr Biden could help by pairing access to badly needed investment through Build Back Better with a drive for trade liberalisation. In September members of the Biden administration visited Colombia, Ecuador and Panama to gauge interest in the initiative, which could also boost Latin America’s defences against climate change.
The alternative to integration is grim. Further economic stagnation in Latin America would leave governments struggling to cope with the rising costs of climate change. A lack of jobs and growth would rile their increasingly frustrated citizens, many of whom have taken to the streets in recent years.
Similarly, a further inward lurch in Latin America would not serve the security and commercial interests of the United States. At the very least it would be a missed opportunity to expand markets for the country’s firms. Mr Biden has a chance to help create a more prosperous region. He should take it. ■",2
1543,"OVER THE past decade Gloria Porras, a judge on Guatemala’s constitutional court, has earned a reputation for fearless independence. It came as little surprise to some, then, that on April 13th Congress refused to confirm her nomination for a third five-year term. The move is the latest effort to oust Ms Porras, who has faced a series of lawsuits from groups believed to be acting on behalf of corrupt politicians, smears in the media and attempts to strip her of her immunity as a judge.
Resistance to crusading judges is growing. The constitutional court is the primary target since it deals with politics and crime. Ms Porras often ruled against the rich and in favour of the marginalised. She boosted the rights of indigenous people, who make up at least 40% of the population of 18m. She also helped block a congressional proposal to provide amnesty for crimes against humanity.

The backsliding started under the administration of Jimmy Morales, president from 2016 to 2020. In 2019 he refused to renew the mandate of CICIG, a UN-backed commission that successfully prosecuted dirty politicians and businessmen. But Ms Porras says pressure on her has intensified since Mr Morales’s successor, Alejandro Giammattei, took office.
The judicial system has been hindered in other ways, too. In 2009 a law was adopted to bring transparency to the committees that appoint judges to the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal. But according to the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) a human-rights lobby group, the process has been marred by conflicts of interest and criminal manipulation. For example, an increasing number of law schools have been created to try to influence which judges are picked (the committees are partially drawn from these schools). Last year the special prosecutor’s office against impunity, a state body, suggested that a businessman in pre-trial detention for corruption had attempted to rig the selection process. Congress, as the blocking of Ms Porras’s confirmation shows, is also biased. It barred another judge, Néster Vásquez, from taking his seat on the constitutional court. Other judges on the court have close links to the president: one of them, Leyla Lemus Arriaga, was his chief of staff.
This will further weaken the rule of law in Guatemala, one of the factors behind the migration of its citizens northwards. “The constitutional court was one of the last checks and balances in the country,” says Adriana Beltrán of WOLA. The abuses that will follow its taming are yet another reason to leave. ■",2
1544,"IT IS BECOMING clear that China will not, or perhaps cannot, re-open its borders soon. The reasons are many. Chinese leaders have declared that zero tolerance of covid-19 is a mark of good government. Officials are fired if cases are found on their patch, so they lock down whole cities to crush even tiny outbreaks. Ordinary Chinese associate the virus with fear and stigma, knowing that a single infected person may force thousands of neighbours, colleagues or classmates into quarantine.
The outside world stands for chaos. Propaganda outlets stress that new cases involve arrivals from abroad. State media describe foreigners, notably Americans, as too selfish, science-scorning and obsessed with individual rights to control the virus. Images of mask-less Westerners on crowded beaches or rampaging at anti-lockdown protests are a staple of Chinese news coverage. Lots of Chinese are cross about a lack of overseas praise for their country’s strict approach. Their resentment is both sincere and stoked by propaganda that accuses American leaders of slandering China to cover up their cruel incompetence and 600,000 pandemic deaths.

Finally, though open discussion of this question is taboo, the authorities are being oddly secretive about how well Chinese-made vaccines work. Locally made jabs have been given to two-fifths of the population, with assurances that they are highly effective. But few data have been released about how Chinese vaccines cope with variants, or how long they work. This opacity is a problem. Many developing countries have relied heavily on Chinese shots. Indonesia and Thailand are among those now planning booster jabs with Western vaccines, at least for medical workers.
Chinese officials grumble that America and the European Union have yet to approve a vaccine from China. But in May, EU regulators trying to inspect a vaccine production site near Beijing were stymied by Chinese officials who insisted that those busy scientists would have to spend three weeks in quarantine. The government rejected an offer for them to fly in by charter plane for a brief inspection visit in protective suits.
Meanwhile, mainland China has yet to approve any foreign vaccines, including the most effective ones that use mRNA gene technology. Perhaps China wants to protect domestic drugmakers from competition, suggest foreign diplomats. Equally, China may want to buy time for a locally made mRNA vaccine that is known to be in development. Given all these factors, it is not obvious how China will start to re-open, especially before some big events have safely passed. These include the Winter Olympics that Beijing will host next February and a Communist Party congress in late 2022, at which Xi Jinping is set to seek a fresh term as supreme leader.
For their part, foreigners who live in mainland China appreciate being in a country that has the virus under control: in spring 2020 hundreds of millions of Chinese spent weeks at home to break the chain of transmission, often without pay. But quite a few have also had enough. Surveys by the American and European chambers of commerce suggested the number of foreign residents in China had fallen by 30% in 18 months. International schools are braced for a fresh exodus this summer, it is said, including of teachers who have not seen families outside China for more than a year. This spring several embassies debated whether China should become a hardship posting reserved for diplomats without dependents. Their concerns include rules obliging all international arrivals, including children, to quarantine in a hotel for three weeks, and to enter an isolation clinic if they test positive. (Ambassadors may quarantine at home for 21 days, but only if their residence is a detached house and they are driven there with a police escort.)
In June Spain’s consulate-general in Shanghai protested after a newly arrived Spanish citizen was made to sign documents that she could not read and undergo days of tests and MRI scans in a clinic. The Spaniard had apparently tested positive for antibodies, either as a result of having been vaccinated or after recovering from a bout of covid-19. Chinese officials declined to explain.
Foreign companies in favoured sectors can secure visas for executives, or for engineers who are needed to build advanced manufacturing sites that China wants. But even the largest such businesses struggle to obtain visas for the families of their expatriate staff. As many as half a million foreign students at Chinese institutions are stuck outside the country: their visas were cancelled in March 2020. Let them study online, Chinese officials tell diplomats who mention their plight. International tourism, both inbound and outbound, has ground to a halt.
China now issues a few visas for temporary business and family visits. But any further opening provokes nervousness. The southern province of Guangdong, hit by a recent virus outbreak, is building a quarantine clinic for international arrivals with 5,000 beds. Those foreign airlines allowed to operate limited flights into China are often running at 10% of pre-pandemic capacity. Visits by political leaders from abroad have largely ceased. Some foreign ministers have been admitted to China to meet their counterpart, Wang Yi, but only in provincial cities. Beijing, where top leaders live, is off limits. Mr Xi attends overseas summits by video-link.
China wants foreign know-how and respect, not foreigners
Chinese history has seen many cycles of opening and turning inward. Anecdote by anecdote, evidence is mounting that foreigners, whether suspected of bearing dangerous germs or ideas, are becoming less welcome. On a recent domestic flight, Chaguan’s neighbour pointedly asked to move seats. It is growing more common to face demands from members of the public to agree that China is strong and the West failing. Nationalism and impatience with foreign criticism were on the rise before covid-19. The pandemic has sped up those trends—as it has inspired at times nasty anti-Chinese racism abroad. Mutual distrust will be hard to overcome until China re-opens. That may take a while.■

1545,"AMERICA MUST focus on “blunting Chinese power and order and building the foundations for US power and order”. That, at least, is the message of a recent book by Rush Doshi, until recently a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington, DC. “The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order” argues that China has worked for years to undermine America’s geopolitical dominance and shape a more illiberal world order that better protects and serves China’s interests. It concludes that these efforts need to be repaid in kind.
This is a striking rebuke to decades of American foreign-policy thinking focused on “engagement” with China. The rebuke gains extra weight from the fact that Mr Doshi is now a China director on President Joe Biden’s National Security Council, where he works under Kurt Campbell, his mentor and a leading architect of the administration’s China strategy.


Engagement was already on its uppers. Donald Trump had replaced it with something more belligerent and capricious. Many hoped that Mr Biden would bring some order to the chaos and lay down rules for a return to some sort of engagement, albeit on less friendly terms than those practised by the Obama administration in which he served. But although Mr Biden’s administration is indeed forgoing the caprice and wilfulness of his predecessor, in other respects it is toughening policy, assiduously building a strategic framework for countering and checking China’s rise.
Unlike Mr Trump, Mr Biden seems sincerely worried about a world in which China’s authoritarian model wins. That makes him more serious about the policies implemented, often haphazardly, by the hawks who served in the previous administration. In its first six months Mr Biden’s administration has, to the surprise of many, officially affirmed the label of “genocide” applied by the last administration to atrocities in Xinjiang, and also worked with allies to impose further sanctions on the perpetrators. It has kept in place and refined Mr Trump’s prohibitions on doing business with Huawei and a long list of technology companies and military-affiliated businesses (see chart 1). It has made countering China a priority in talks with allies around the world, and shown no urgency to hold a summit with Xi Jinping, China’s president.

Mr Biden is positioning America as the West’s leader in a “contest with autocrats”, as he put it at the G7 summit in June. In an interview with The Economist a senior administration official said China sees the next 10 to 15 years as a window of opportunity in which to “assert its authority globally”: continuing its attempts to dominate critical technologies and rewrite the rules of the global order, and cowing its critics so as to make the world safe for autocracy. This is not a secret. Mr Xi has outlined China’s ambitions to exert influence on the global order, seizing a moment when the Communist Party views the West to be in decline. Even so, people in the West, the official said, are only beginning to recognise “that we’re dealing with a country that is perhaps less interested in coexistence, and more interested in dominance”. The time to take a stand, therefore, is now.
Build then blunt
Defining the relationship as one of two antagonists with antithetical values makes it sound like the cold war. But there are crucial differences, none more notable than China’s inextricable integration into the global economy. America cannot try to contain it as it did the Soviet Union; instead Mr Biden wants to counter China’s influence by increasing America’s own.
The emerging strategy, while still protean, sounds of a kind with Mr Doshi’s prescription for “blunting and building”. The building comes first. Mr Biden’s aides invariably start any discussion of China strategy with the need to restore American greatness after decades of decline. “Rarely has a great power like the United States gone on such a detour,” says the senior official. “It’s tragic.” America must recover from all that, and invest in itself, Mr Biden’s aides say, so that it can deal with China from a position of strength.
Hence the United States Innovation and Competition Act, which passed the Senate in early June packed with spending intended to improve America’s competitiveness. It would authorise $52bn to boost semiconductor research and manufacturing in America and $29bn for a new applied-sciences fund that would support projects in advanced materials, robotics, artificial intelligence and other technologies. It also contains extra money for going to the Moon.
Spending does not have to be aimed so precisely to be part of the policy. Mr Biden’s $1.9trn pandemic recovery package, which passed in March; his multi-trillion dollar proposals for “hard” and “soft” infrastructure; his provisos on buying American: all can be read as part of a rebuilding policy aimed at China while also looking to fulfil lavish campaign promises.
But ambitious as they look in Washington, these numbers cannot compare with Chinese spending on infrastructure and industrial policy. And they are shrinking. The core infrastructure plan has been whittled down to $600bn in negotiations with Republicans whose distaste for handing victories to Mr Biden exceeds their animosity to China (though Democrats want to add back $3.5trn in another package). Republicans such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley, all self-professed China hawks, are unlikely to abandon their party’s opposition to Mr Biden’s domestic agenda when they have their eyes on his job.
Even if America were united in its efforts, though, building back at a rate that would seriously diminish China’s current prospects is not possible. Barring a serious setback, China’s economy will become the world’s largest within its 10-15 year “window of opportunity”. The country’s gigantic market will exert, as Communist Party lingo puts it, a “powerful gravitational field” far beyond its borders. It will be able to spend even more on its armed forces. The country’s investments in research and development will make its technological prowess increasingly formidable.
That is why an antagonistic policy requires what Mr Doshi calls “asymmetric blunting”: ways of undermining China’s attempts to rebuild the world order that do not cost too much. Militarily, that means adopting an approach of “deterrence by denial” in areas just beyond internationally recognised Chinese waters, investing in state-of-the-art weapons to stop China seizing control of waters or islands (like Taiwan) to which it considers itself entitled. Economic blunting tactics include enforcing export controls so that American companies do not fuel China’s rapid development of critical technologies—a tool that the Trump administration used to cripple Huawei and to impede China’s biggest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation. Political blunting includes countering China’s influence in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions.
Sharpen up
Because such strategies require partners, their cultivation is a core tenet of Mr Biden’s strategy. He has been courting other governments and sorting out old grievances. He has agreed to a suspension of tariffs in a 17-year-old dispute with the EU over subsidies to Airbus, an aerospace company. He has also waived sanctions on the company building the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 pipeline as a favour to Germany, which will be the recipient of most of its gas. In so doing he signalled that his administration views potential co-operation with allies on China as more important than confronting Russia. In March America agreed on a new cost-sharing deal for its military presence in South Korea.
This cultivation has borne some fruit. In March Britain, Canada and the EU joined with America in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials and entities over Xinjiang—the first time any other governments had done so. In May South Korean President Moon Jae-in, on a visit to the White House, agreed to a mention of preserving the status of Taiwan in the subsequent joint statement. In June the G7 and, a couple of days later, a NATO summit both produced statements recognising the threat posed by China.
Serious blunting, though, requires more than co-ordinated statements and (largely symbolic) sanctions. Here there is less to report. Build Back Better World, or B3W, a response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative announced at the G7 summit, has no new institutional framework or funding. Mr Biden has worked with the G7 and the Quad, a military grouping with Australia, Japan and India, to counter China’s coercive, strings-attached vaccine diplomacy. But the commitments of vaccine doses are tiny compared with the need. He has not as yet put serious resources to his broader vision of providing middle-income countries with alternatives to taking money and business from China. Congress would not let him.
Where America does not lead, its allies seem unlikely to go of their own accord. In May the European Parliament responded to China’s bullying over the EU’s earlier Xinjiang sanctions by freezing ratification of an investment treaty. But many governments still want such deals and are not looking for trouble. On July 1st Rishi Sunak, Britain’s chancellor, called for a “mature and balanced relationship” with China, eyeing the City’s potential to sell financial services into the world’s second-largest national market. On July 7th Boris Johnson, the prime minister, said he did not want to scare away investment because of an “anti-China spirit”.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Armin Laschet, who may succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor, have shown a lack of enthusiasm for confronting China. Smaller countries feel similarly. Not coincidentally, the number of countries with which China shares more trade than America is far greater than the other way round (see chart 2).

There are also American voices opposed to a tougher line. Businesses and financial institutions are lobbying hard to maintain access to the China market and for the easing of export controls. On July 7th more than 40 progressive groups wrote to Mr Biden urging him to drop America’s “antagonistic posture” towards China and to co-operate on climate change. Such calls are music to Mr Xi’s ears. As Mr Doshi writes, Chinese officials routinely treat America’s wish for progress on major challenges—such as climate or nuclear non-proliferation—as opportunities for leverage. China’s determination to link issues America would like to keep separate makes America’s interest in cordoning off areas for co- operation some what moot. They are not decisions it can make on its own.
The climate looks likely to fall victim to this antagonism. Both countries will lower their emissions (though Mr Biden’s ambitions may be thwarted by opposition at home) but it will be hard for them to come together to set rules of the road for others. There are economic risks, too. There are almost no advocates for free and unfettered trade around Mr Biden, and that suits the architects of his China policy well.
During the 2020 presidential campaign Jake Sullivan, now Mr Biden’s national security adviser, co-authored an article calling on foreign-policy experts to stop deferring to economists and move past the assumption “that more trade is always the answer”. He is in no rush to get rid of Mr Trump’s tariffs and “phase one” trade deal, which required China to meet specific import quotas; they may not be to his taste, but they could supply leverage for future negotiations. This was despite the judgment of economists outside the administration—and some inside—that the tariffs hurt America more than they hurt China.
There are also areas where trade with China is seen as a risk in and of itself. China’s dominance over the markets for some key resources, while not yet a national-security problem, could become one. Mr Sullivan, Mr Campbell, Mr Doshi and others want America to reduce the degree to which it relies on its antagonist for some critical commodities. In June the administration completed a supply-chain review that identified areas that China dominates—including rare-earth metals, lithium and cobalt (vital for high-capacity batteries) and some drugs and drug ingredients—and called for America to work with other countries on how to wean themselves off the Chinese market.
Such concerns could lead to a bifurcation in global trade. But voices warning of the economic costs such a split would impose are exactly those to which Mr Sullivan wants policymakers to pay less heed. If his security-first view prevails Mr Biden may go further to decouple the two economies than did Mr Trump, parts of whose administration exploited his inattention in order to do less than he would have wished. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, delayed efforts to impose sanctions on Chinese institutions. Officials at the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) dragged their feet on drawing up a list of emerging technologies that could be subject to broad export controls. Customs and Border Protection issued most of its orders to block imports of goods made by forced labour in Xinjiang only in 2020, after Mr Trump had taken to blaming China for the pandemic.

Mr Biden’s administration is more responsive to his intentions. The machinery that can be used to blacklist more Chinese companies has been fine-tuned, in part to make it more resistant to legal challenges. It has maintained virtually all the existing sanctions, export controls and customs orders, and instituted a few more that were under way before Mr Trump left office. These included a ban in June on imports from a Xinjiang-based company which produces the type of silicon needed for solar cells, because of concerns about the forced labour of Uyghurs there. Some 45% of the world’s supply of this highly refined silicon comes from Xinjiang, and sanctions against more of its manufacturers are expected, if not from the administration, then through a bill pending in Congress.
How blunt, exactly?
In a speech on July 13th Mr Sullivan signalled concerns about companies evading export controls “in ways that harm national security”. What that posture means in terms of slowing China’s progress in technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing is still a matter of concern for those watching proceedings. The tech industry has its worries about China (particularly over the long-term security of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the main supplier of the highest-end chips). But it still wants to sell it more stuff. The most ardent foreign-policy hawks want the toughest actions, including things they are sure the Biden administration would not dare to do, such as banning dollar-denominated transactions with leading Chinese chipmakers.
Both sides have been keenly interested in who would serve as the new head of the BIS, seeing the position as a bellwether. But when, on July 13th, they learned it would be Alan Estevez, a former Obama-era Pentagon official with experience conducting national-security reviews of foreign investments, they seemed at first little the wiser. As a nominee to a sensitive post his chief attribute may be a lack of preconceptions as to how he will approach the job.
Beyond the question of how hard to push, though, lies the disconcerting realisation that China may well be an immovable object. If American businesses turn away from China, others will step in. Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund, a think-tank, says the best hope of shaping China’s choices lies in forming an “anti-China coalition” (though not explicitly calling it that). Like those around Mr Biden, she believes that, even then, the odds of affecting change will not be good, but “we have to try”.
An us-v-them approach has problems. When Mr Biden presents it as a dichotomy of democracies versus autocracies, European officials wince—and the status of a country like Vietnam, which Mr Biden wants on-side, becomes problematic. Jude Blanchette of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, another think-tank, argues that the Biden administration would be better-served if it stopped paying such close-up attention to China and instead zoomed out to take a broader view of the world. America reacts to everything Chinese leaders do, he says: they adopt an industrial policy, America adopts an industrial policy; they secure supply chains, so does America; they have a Belt and Road Initiative, so must America.
Mr Blanchette argues that America should take a different page out of Mr Xi’s playbook: talk less about its adversary and more about the world it wants to build. “Xi just does not talk about America a lot. When they articulate their vision it’s not an America strategy,” he says. “It’s ‘this is the role China wants to play in the world over the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years’.” Like some members of the Biden administration, Mr Blanchette looks to the early days of the cold war for inspiration. Then America placed its attempts to contain the Soviet Union within a broader vision of the world. If today it could articulate such a vision again, it might become clearer how China fits in and open up a policy shaped by America’s continuing role, rather than purely by China’s rise. ■

1546,"THE MOOD among her comrades is “euphoric”, says Sonja Hergarten, a volunteer for Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) at a campaign stand in Munich’s university district. At the last election, in 2017, she had the unenviable task of persuading Germans to vote for Martin Schulz, a little-known politician who had returned from a career in Brussels to lead the SPD’s campaign. This time the candidate is Olaf Scholz, a familiar face to most Germans as the finance minister and vice-chancellor, and a much easier sell. As if to prove the point, a grinning passer-by exclaims “Toi, toi, toi!” (“Good luck, good luck, good luck!”).
A few hours later Mr Scholz himself arrives in town. Speaking below the impressive façade of Munich’s neo-Gothic Neues Rathaus (town hall), he presents a list of modest social-democratic priorities, including affordable housing (an important local issue), pension security and the preservation of jobs during Germany’s climate transition. Then comes his leitmotif: “respect” for the labour of “the craftsman or the logistics worker”, which implies lifting the minimum hourly wage to €12 ($14), a signature policy. Mr Scholz hammers the governing Christian Democrats (CDU), the senior partner in the “grand” coalition with his SPD, for pushing tax cuts when the state has incurred €400bn in pandemic debt. Afterwards, Mr Scholz receives the adoration of autograph-hunting fans with the reserve customary to his home town of Hamburg. His famous Smurf-like grin turns rictus after the seventh selfie.

Until this summer the SPD had been in the doldrums for years, haemorrhaging members, money and support. If the extraordinary comeback suggested by opinion polls (see chart 1) is confirmed on September 26th, the victory will belong to Mr Scholz. An experienced politician who sits on his party’s right, he is by far the most popular of the candidates seeking to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor, and the SPD’s campaign has been organised accordingly. Mr Scholz’s visage dominates the stylish red posters that festoon the Munich stand, along with reassuring phrases like “Kompetenz für Deutschland”. They have been a huge hit with voters, says Ms Hergarten, sporting a “#TeamOlaf” face-mask.

Yet the real story of the campaign has been the weakness of Mr Scholz’s rivals, chief among them Armin Laschet, candidate for the centre-right CDU and its Bavarian sister, the Christian Social Union (CSU). In April Mr Laschet prevailed over the more popular (and populist) Markus Söder, the CSU leader, for the parties’ joint candidacy only because CDU grandees feared yielding to the Bavarians would doom their party for a generation. Mr Laschet’s dire approval ratings have dragged his party down with him. “People dread the idea of seeing him on the evening news for four years,” says Frank Stauss, a campaign strategist. A faint air of the ludicrous has attached to Mr Laschet throughout the campaign.
This feeling is not entirely dispelled at a recent campaign stop in a beer garden in Celle, a small town in the northern state of Lower Saxony. The 5’8” bespectacled Mr Laschet, with a slow-moving entourage and security detail, is welcomed onstage to the strains of “Eye of the Tiger”, a macho boxing anthem. A local official introduces him as if he were Rocky Balboa.
Yet Mr Laschet is a strong speechmaker once he finds his stride. He aims his pitch at Germany’s “normal people,” who rise at seven and drive to work each day; the sorts, in fact, that fill the Celle beer garden. Like Mr Scholz, he pledges to combine climate protection and support for industry, while weaving in foreign-policy and security themes that CDU strategists reckon are their comparative advantage over the SPD. Mr Laschet also finds time to wage a bit of a culture war against Germany’s hyperactive language police—a jab mostly at the Greens. Several attendees say Mr Laschet’s performance has dispelled their original scepticism. “He’s obviously not a person who opens hearts immediately,” says Sabine Rudnick, a party foot-soldier. But the media exaggerate his foibles, she reckons.
Touching the void
In 2001, four years before she took office, Mrs Merkel outlined her electoral strategy to Der Spiegel, a weekly. “Think of the [political] middle as a point,” she said. “Divide the scale into three sections to the right and left of this point, and we have to get the larger part of the middle third of the voters.” A majority of German voters indeed place themselves in the centre of the political spectrum, and more of them lean left than right. Mrs Merkel, who will leave office after 16 years with approval ratings of over 80%, was able to extend the reach of the CDU/CSU to groups like older women and ethnic minorities while defusing conflicts that might rouse opponents (a trick known to electoral strategists as “asymmetric demobilisation”). Some of her deeds in office, such as keeping Germany’s borders open to over 1m migrants in 2015-16, earned her lasting support from Green and other progressive voters.
This is the first time in modern German history that a sitting chancellor has not sought re-election. The void left by Mrs Merkel’s departure has led to what Kajo Wasserhövel, an SPD politician-turned-consultant, says is the most extraordinary campaign he has witnessed in four decades. Within four months the lead has bounced between the Greens, the CDU/CSU and now the SPD. Yet voters’ basic preferences have been broadly stable, says Peter Matuschek at Forsa, a pollster. Instead, the parties—and especially, in what has been a highly personalised campaign, their lead candidates—have stumbled in their bids to appeal to the Merkel Mitte (middle).
As the candidate of Mrs Merkel’s party, Mr Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s largest state, had the easiest task. A centrist who saw off a threat from the CDU’s conservative wing to win the party leadership in January, he had hoped that simply aspiring to the moderate course of Mrs Merkel’s two grand coalitions would allow him to coast to victory. Two-thirds of Germans feel personally well-off; the party assumed few voters would see much reason for rupture. The CDU/CSU manifesto is strikingly thin, even by the standards of a party that has always been more interested in power than ideas.
But voters have long noticed that Mrs Merkel’s party has been struggling to articulate an identity that will outlast her. Before covid-19 struck, the CDU/CSU had slumped to around 26% nationally and suffered a string of reverses in state elections. Yet the incumbency effect of the pandemic, which saw the party briefly soar to 40%, bred complacency. Mr Laschet sometimes acted as if the chancellorship was a bequest from Mrs Merkel rather than an office to be fought for. Playing it safe looked risky even when the Greens, the most radical of the leading parties, were expected to be the progressive challenger. In July Mr Laschet, touring the flood-hit regions of his state, was caught chuckling on film. Many voters saw confirmation of a fundamental unseriousness.

But when Mr Scholz, who represented a more credible brand of continuity than Mr Laschet, unexpectedly rose from the dead, the CDU/CSU was left flat-footed. Its campaign has floundered ever since. The party’s tone veers from statesmanlike one day to blindly partisan the next, pushing an implausible argument that the impeccably moderate Mr Scholz wants to invite the hard left into coalition. Mr Söder, still smarting from his defeat, sounds more antagonist than ally. The CDU/CSU has lost the support of perhaps 7m voters since the start of the year, and fewer than half those who remain prefer Mr Laschet as chancellor. If he had drawn the lesson of complacency from Mrs Merkel’s reign, he forgot about her competence.
The Greens placed a different bet. Germany’s Mitte had shifted, they argued; voters wanted something more imaginative than the clapped-out grand coalition they had been lumbered with for eight years. The shift was subtle, but important: the Greens no longer presented themselves as a vanguard but as a vessel for voters’ ambitions. The party’s co-leaders, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, are found delivering this message on a warm late summer evening in Frankfurt’s Römerberg square. Mr Habeck, who cultivates the image of a rugged philosopher-statesman, delivers a disquisition on the nature of freedom, while Ms Baerbock, the Greens’ first ever chancellor-candidate, offers down-to-earth details on party policy. She presents her inexperience—she has done little more than hold a Bundestag seat—as a virtue when set against the failures of Germany’s establishment. The speeches make a neat pairing. “These two have brought our party to heaven,” beams Omid Nouripour, the local Green MP.
The pitch indeed proved effective, for a time. When the Greens chose Ms Baerbock in April, at the height of the CDU/CSU infighting, the party briefly topped the polls. They still hope to perhaps double their 2017 score, but if the dream of capturing the chancellery has evaporated it is because the party believed too strongly in the power of its own myth. “I admire Annalena Baerbock, but how will the Greens pay for it all?” asks Vanessa Erb, a 19-year-old watching the speeches. The Greens have an answer to this and most other questions, but they fail to cut through to an electorate that remains concerned about climate change but wary of anything that reeks of radicalism. Nor has the party’s deep bench, with expertise that extends to security, fiscal policy and migration, pulled the Greens out of their single-issue ghetto.
This leaves Mr Scholz out in front. His claim to Mrs Merkel’s job lies in his experience, which includes stints as federal labour and finance minister, and seven years running Hamburg; an air of just-the-facts competence; and a demeanour so unruffled that mini-scandals around financial supervision fail to stick. “A Merkel voter in 2017 does not have to travel a long way to become a Scholz voter in 2021,” says Mr Stauss. Yet his success has rested on two conditions. One is his luck in his opponents. Had Mr Habeck or, especially, Mr Söder led their parties’ campaigns, the race would have looked very different.
The other is the acquiescence of the SPD’s left wing—including the two co-leaders of the party—which has been surprisingly complete for an outfit with a habit of vicious public rows. Mr Scholz’s personal popularity belies his party’s struggle to regain voters’ trust. Just 14% of Germans say the SPD is best placed to manage Germany’s problems, a number that has barely shifted even as the CDU/CSU’s has plummeted. But Mr Scholz’s anointment over a year ago gave time for the party’s wings to come to terms. “I’m very grateful that the top of the SPD is working closely together,” says Lars Klingbeil, the party’s secretary-general and an architect of its internal harmony. Mr Scholz’s platform has enough red meat to satisfy the leftists, and they are hungry for the power that is now within grasp.

As Germany’s politics have fragmented, its voters have become more promiscuous. Parties have been able to fish for votes from across as well as within their respective progressive or conservative camps: in the 2019 European elections, for example, the Greens attracted over 1m voters who had backed the CDU/CSU in the 2017 national vote. Their growth means this year is likely to reverse a decades-long shrinkage of Germany’s “progressive” block of voters (see chart 2). In July a study by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which is linked to the CDU, found that only a quarter of Germans had an unbreakable link to a single party. (Supporters of the hard-right AfD, whose views place them out of reach for other parties, are the exception.) Voters are open to new governing arrangements, and indeed have elected them: there are 14 flavours of coalition in Germany’s 16 states.
Send for plenty of coffee
So it is fitting that the election outcome remains highly uncertain. The SPD’s lead over the CDU/CSU is small, and there are several unknowns. Turnout is hard to predict; an unusually high share of postal ballots is expected; and the state of the polls may create its own dynamic. Some CDU/CSU waverers could make a late return to the flock if spooked by the prospect of an SPD-led government, for example.
But the difficulty of the coalition negotiations that will follow can be safely predicted. Germany is probably headed for its first three-way national coalition in decades; an ominous prospect given the array of domestic and international challenges that will confront it (see Special Report). Either of the two likeliest results—a “Jamaica” government led by Mr Laschet, or a more left-leaning “traffic-light” arrangement under Mr Scholz, with the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats as junior partners in each case—will unite parties that disagree on much. That risks entrenching gridlock at just the moment Germany’s partners will have hoped for resolve. If so, this will not be the outcome Germany’s resolutely centrist voters might have sought. But it is one that they will have earned. ■

1547,"AMERICAN AIRCRAFT-CARRIERS have not always been welcome in the Indian Ocean. In 1971, during a war between India and Pakistan, America sailed the USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal to intimidate India. Decades later, the slight has not been forgotten—but it has been forgiven. The USS Nimitz, an American supercarrier launched a year after that war, has joined its fellow carrier, the INS Vikramaditya, the Indian Navy’s ex-Soviet flagship, off Goa, on India’s west coast, for the second phase of the annual “Malabar” exercises, from November 17th to 20th. Japan, which joined Malabar in 2015, has sent warships, too. So has Australia, which has been invited for the first time in 13 years. The quartet met for the first round of Malabar in the Bay of Bengal, off India’s east coast, earlier this month.
Military drills in Asia are a dime a dozen. China’s naval expansion and tensions in the South China Sea, among other hotspots, have resulted in an explosion of maritime activity in recent years. What is notable about Malabar is its membership, for with Australia’s return it has become a naval reflection of a deepening diplomatic quartet. In 2007 America, Australia, India and Japan met for a “quadrilateral dialogue”, which promptly acquired the snappier title of the “Quad”. That initiative lost steam, in part because Australia, spooked by China’s prickly reaction, broke ranks. A decade later, it was revived: first, among diplomats from the foursome; and then foreign ministers, who met for the second time on October 6th in Tokyo. Though the group’s public statements are replete with diplomatic bromides and euphemism—“a region governed by rules, not power”—the spectre of China and its growing muscle is obvious.

The Quad has no standing bureaucracy or permanent secretariat. It is certainly not an alliance—that word is anathema to India, which was formally non-aligned during the cold war. The four countries are under no obligation to intervene if one is attacked. It is, rather, a “coalition of the willing and capable”, says Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington. Nonetheless, its members have steadily and quietly deepened co-operation on defence and security. In November 2019, for instance, India hosted a Quad tabletop exercise on counter-terrorism—an occasion for the four countries’ spooks to get together. In September Quad officials discussed how to promote “trusted vendors” in 5G networks—an implicit rebuke to Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant—and build resilient supply chains for such things as critical minerals, where China has used its market power as a geopolitical cudgel.
In theory, Malabar is entirely separate from the Quad. In practice, that all four countries now take part in the drills—though Australia’s invitation may not be a standing one—is symbolically important, and speaks to their naval ambitions. Andrew Shearer, who was appointed Australia’s intelligence chief last month, wrote in 2017 that co-operation “should cover the gamut, from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief through to maritime surveillance and ultimately covering high-end missions such as theatre anti-submarine warfare—a growing priority as Chinese submarines enter the Indian Ocean in increasing numbers.” Sub-hunting drills are among the “high intensity” operations at this year’s Malabar.
Malabar, however, is just one strand in a growing thicket of defence ties. The six-way bilateral ties between all four members of the Quad have all expanded. On November 17th Australia and Japan agreed a pact which will facilitate joint military exercises. Over the past several years, America and India have signed agreements on logistical support (enabling America to rush cold-weather gear to India for troops deployed against China), encrypted communications and the exchange of geospatial intelligence, such as secret maps. India now routinely holds “two-plus-two” meetings of foreign and defence ministers with all three of its Quad partners.
Trilateral ties are also deepening. America, Australia and Japan are all preparing to operate America’s new F-35 jet, for instance, allowing a high degree of integration between their respective carriers. Australian, Indian and Japanese foreign ministers also meet as a trio, without America in the room. “We are veering towards some sort of an alliance relationship with the Quad countries,” says Gurpreet Khurana, a serving Indian naval officer who until last year headed the National Maritime Foundation, a think-tank in Delhi. “There are many shades of alliance which are short of a formal nature.”
China’s response to all this has been a mixture of contrived indifference and spluttering indignation. In 2018 Wang Yi, the foreign minister, declared that “headline-grabbing ideas” like the “free and open Indo-Pacific”, a Japanese concept taken up enthusiastically by the Quad, were “like the sea foam in the Pacific or Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate”. In September this year, China’s foreign ministry sternly warned that “no one should seek an exclusive clique”. Mr Khurana says that in his interaction with Chinese officials, “they are really very worried” about India’s partnership with America, and the Quad.
There is also some Quad-scepticism in the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN), where many governments are concerned that the four powers might overshadow an institution of ten mostly smaller ones. The idea of “ASEAN centrality” has wide appeal. But even there, attitudes have softened, not least because threat perceptions of China have grown. A survey of ASEAN policy elites by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in 2018 found that 69% thought that the Quad should “play a role in enforcing rules-based order”, for instance by ensuring freedom of navigation against Chinese maritime claims. Many South-East Asian officials are sceptical, though, that the Quad will go anywhere.
What has sustained its momentum since 2017 is that all four countries have seen their relationship with China deteriorate in one way or another. Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a tense border stand-off since the spring, resulting in the first fatal clashes in 45 years. Japan has protested against increasing Chinese incursions around the disputed Senkaku islands (which China calls the Diaoyu) in the East China Sea since August. Australia faces Chinese trade restrictions on everything from wine to lobsters to coal, following its call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and a spying row in Melbourne.
These diverse disputes have all taken their toll on China’s image. A Pew poll published in October showed that 86% of Japanese people and 81% of Australians regard China unfavourably. The Australian figure has climbed by 24 points since last year. “The Quad’s significance is that it is another reflection of growing concern among a diverse array of countries across different regions over Chinese behaviour,” says Bilahari Kausikan, a former Singaporean diplomat. “Not everyone has the same concerns or holds their concerns with the same intensity, but they exist. China has done more to put together a nascent anti-China coalition than the US.”
In America, too, Joe Biden is likely to preserve much of Donald Trump’s emphasis on strategic competition with China, even if he jettisons Mr Trump’s bellicose language. In an op-ed this summer, Richard Fontaine and Ely Ratner, a member of Mr Biden’s transition team for the Department of Defence, observed: “Out with unified blocs…the competition for friends will rarely be one of strict strategic alignment, but rather an effort to build coalitions of the willing on different issues.”
That chimes with the Quad’s catholic interests. “If a Biden administration wants burden sharing, the Quad countries are the ones likely to do a lot of the heavy lifting in Asia,” notes Ms Madan. The group is not just willing, but also capable. China’s navy, for instance, has 82 high-end warships; Australia, India and Japan have 88 between them. The point is not that India would rush into a war over, say, Taiwan (it would not) but that habits of co-operation will build up over time.
In many ways, the Quad embodies the grammar of modern diplomacy. It is a compact bloc, rather than a sprawling multilateral organisation; it has a broad agenda, from investment to cybersecurity; and it is suitably elastic, opportunistically embracing New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam during the early weeks of the pandemic to discuss economic recovery. “It reflects the flexible multilateralism that we're likely to see much of in the years ahead,” says Ms Madan. Europeans are accustomed to living in a world of a single, dominant and highly formalised alliance system. By contrast, says Mr Kausikan, “relationships in this region [Asia] are fluid and ambivalent”. The resulting security architecture, he says, will comprise “multiple overlapping frameworks rather than any single structure”. The sea foam shows no signs of dissipating yet.",2
1548,"IT WAS ONE of the grandest ceremonies that Meskel Square had ever witnessed. Part military parade, part cultural jamboree, the spectacle in the heart of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, was so lavish that one might have mistaken it for the inauguration of a president or the crowning of a monarch.
In fact, the focus of the pomp was Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister. He came to power when his predecessor resigned amid massive protests in 2018. Although the early months of his tenure involved mending relations with the opposition and signing a peace deal with Eritrea (for which he won a Nobel prize in 2019), his rule has since been marred by ethnic unrest, a slowing economy and a devastating civil war in the northern state of Tigray. The event on October 4th marked the start of his first full five-year term as prime minister, following elections in July.

The ceremony was in part a riposte to those questioning Abiy’s legitimacy, above all the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which once called the shots in the country and is now at war with the central government. “We have reached a new era,” Abiy told cheering crowds (pictured), one in which power “emanates only from the genuine voice of the people via the ballot box”. But the voice was somewhat muffled by an opposition boycott and the decision to call the election off in a fifth of districts because of violence. Small wonder that Abiy’s Prosperity Party won more than 90% of the seats contested.
The show was also aimed at an international audience. Relations between Ethiopia and many Western countries have sunk to their lowest point in decades. Last month America said it would slap sanctions on officials involved in the war in Tigray if the parties (which also include Eritrean troops fighting alongside Ethiopian forces) did not start talks or allow food to reach those cut off by the government’s blockade of the state. Martin Griffiths, the UN’s humanitarian chief, warned on September 29th that hundreds of thousands could starve. Abiy’s response was to expel seven senior UN officials, accusing them of “meddling” in Ethiopia’s affairs.
In his speech Abiy declared that Ethiopia would never submit to foreign pressure. In the past such prickly talk typically masked a great degree of pragmatism, as Ethiopia attempted to win friends and gain international influence. For instance, it championed IGAD, a regional bloc, and contributed more peacekeeping troops to the UN than almost any other country. It also cultivated close ties with China and America, becoming the latter’s eager ally in its “war on terror”. Ethiopia enjoyed such clout in Washington that when it invaded Somalia in 2006 to topple an Islamist government, America joined in.
The picture now is very different. Abiy’s decision to cosy up to Eritrea’s dictator, Issaias Afwerki, has divided IGAD. Ethiopia’s relations with Sudan have soured, leading to border clashes. Even more spectacular is the falling out with the West. Barely a week goes by without a rally against alleged foreign interference, or a statement by a senior official denouncing “foreign enemies”. A stream of conspiracy theories floods state media: that America is supplying TPLF fighters with drug-laced biscuits, for example, or that UN agencies are smuggling weapons. In August the government halted the work of Médecins Sans Frontières and the Norwegian Refugee Council, two aid organisations.
Three factors are contributing to Ethiopia’s growing isolation. The first is Abiy’s capricious approach to foreign policy, which is characterised by personal relationships rather than engagement with institutions. He has sidelined the foreign ministry and closed or downsized dozens of embassies. He has alienated foreign leaders with a string of unkept promises, such as those to allow aid to reach Tigray or to eject Eritrean troops. And he has infuriated America by buying drones from Iran and snubbing American envoys.
The second factor is the West’s perceived double standard. From 1991 to 2018, when the TPLF dominated the Ethiopian government, America routinely turned a blind eye to its ally’s human-rights violations. Because the Ethiopian army was helping fight jihadists in Somalia, a brutal campaign against separatists in Ethiopia’s own Somali region drew scant condemnation. “The West emboldened the TPLF and whitewashed its past sins,” argues Zelalem Moges, an Ethiopian lawyer. More recently, the administration of Donald Trump sided with Egypt and Sudan in their dispute with Ethiopia over a huge dam it is building on the Blue Nile. “Abiy genuinely believes the United States is trying to overthrow him,” notes an American diplomat. “He believes that he is this pro-American, liberalising market reformer that we have shunned.”
Most important is a disagreement about the wisdom of continuing the war. “Our demands are quite simple: end the war and our relations are by definition better,” says a European diplomat. African officials, though quieter, tend to agree. Even Russia and China, which Abiy hopes will plug any financial holes left by cuts in Western aid and military assistance, have been reticent. Both have opposed punitive measures in the UN Security Council. China has also criticised American sanctions. But neither has offered Abiy much by way of practical support.
Abiy has hinted privately that he might be open to negotiations with the TPLF. The special envoy of the African Union (AU) to the Horn of Africa, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, has reportedly been given permission to sound out the Tigrayan leadership. But the TPLF, which considers the AU biased against it, may not accept its mediation. The prime minister, for his part, made no mention of talks in his inaugural address and seems determined instead to launch a new offensive. That may force the hand of America, which is deciding whether to suspend duty-free access for Ethiopian goods under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Already bad, relations between Ethiopia and its allies are set to sink further. ■",2
1549,"Prince Charles’s charity was plunged into fresh crisis yesterday by a watchdog investigation.
Charity Commission chiefs are launching a statutory inquiry – their most serious level of probe – into its dealings with the Mahfouz Foundation. 
They want to know whether the foundation received donations meant for the prince’s charity, with some cash then moved elsewhere.
The foundation is run by Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, a Saudi billionaire granted an honorary CBE by the prince in 2016. 
Charles’s charity is already being probed by Scottish regulators over claims it accepted a £500,000 gift from a Russian donor that was later rejected by an ethics committee.
The latest development comes after the prince’s right-hand man quit over ‘cash for honours’ allegations. Michael Fawcett resigned  as chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation following reports that he promised to secure a knighthood and British citizenship for Mr Mahfouz in exchange for major donations.
In 2017, Mr Fawcett wrote to an aide of Mr Mahfouz, who had donated £1.5million to help renovate two of the prince’s Scottish properties, saying that ‘in light of his ongoing and most recent generosity... we are willing and happy to support and contribute to the application for citizenship’.
On headed notepaper in his then-role as chief executive of the Dumfries House Trust, he added that the charity would also apply to raise his honorary CBE to a knighthood. 
The letter may form a part of ‘initial’ police inquiries, it has emerged.
Sources said Charles was not aware of any link between donations to the foundation and honours.
Announcing its inquiry yesterday, the Charity Commission said of the Mahfouz Foundation: ‘The commission has been engaging with its trustees since September after media reports alleged that donations, intended for the Prince’s Foundation, went instead to the Mahfouz Foundation.
‘The regulator has also identified concerns around the trustees’ governance and financial control of the charity.’
The inquiry will examine whether ‘donations received by the Mahfouz Foundation were intended for the charity’, whether they were used ‘in accordance with donors’ intentions’ and whether they should be returned to donors.
It will also look at whether trustees have carried out legal duties.
The commission added that the scope of the inquiry could be extended ‘if additional issues emerge’. 
It is believed the investigation will examine the whereabouts of £500,000 donated to the Prince’s Foundation by Dmitry Leus, a former Russian banker.
1981: As a teenager, Michael Fawcett lands a job as junior footman to the Queen at Buckingham Palace. He later moves to Kensington Palace as assistant valet to Prince Charles, who is setting up home with Diana.
1990: He is reportedly trusted to squeeze toothpaste on to Charles's brush when the prince broke an arm playing polo.
1992: When the royal couple separate, Diana has the locks of the marital apartment changed to keep out Fawcett, who pinned his loyalties to Charles.
1998: Three members of palace staff go to the prince to complain about Fawcett's allegedly overbearing and bullying manner, and he quits. But his resignation leaves Charles in tears and he is reinstated and promoted within a week.
2000: Fawcett is appointed a Member of the Victorian Order by the Prince in the New Year's Honours – an honour normally reserved for Royal Household members.
2003: He is again forced out for supposedly selling on behalf of Charles gifts the prince did not want. An internal inquiry clears him of any financial misconduct. He resigns but the prince rewards him with a £500,000 severance packet. Fawcett sets up a private events company, Premier Mode.
2005: Premier Mode organises Charles and Camilla's wedding party.
2017: Fawcett joins the board of A G Carrick, a company Charles set up to sell mementoes at his Highgrove shop. Fawcett also runs the trust set up to run Prince Charles's pet project, Dumfries House.
2018: Fawcett is appointed to a £95,000-a-year role as chief executive of Charles's charity, The Prince's Foundation.
2021: It is alleged that Fawcett fixed a CBE for a Saudi billionaire who had donated more than £1.5 million to royal charities. Fawcett resigns for the third time. 
Following the donation, Prince Charles told Mr Leus he was ‘incredibly grateful’ and proposed the pair meet after the coronavirus pandemic.
But the foundation’s ethics committee rejected the money over concerns about a previous money-laundering conviction, which was later overturned.
Mr Leus insisted the money was not returned to him. In September, the Mail on Sunday reported that the Mahfouz Foundation had admitted holding £300,000 of the cash, with Michael Wynne-Parker, a society fixer, allegedly holding the remaining £200,000.
In a statement to the newspaper, Mr Leus said he had never heard of the Mahfouz Foundation and was ‘deeply shocked at what appears to have happened to a charitable donation given in good faith’.
The Mahfouz Foundation appears to have been set up in 2012 to promote the history and culture of the Middle East to the UK.
However there is little information on its website other than a black-and-white photograph of Mr Mahfouz alongside his title, including his honorary CBE.
Mr Mahfouz has been accused of paying fixers with links to the prince tens of thousands of pounds in the hope of securing an honour. 
He allegedly believed a title would help him secure British citizenship. He denies any wrongdoing.
For the financial year to the end of April, the Mahfouz Foundation had a total income of just £10,000, records show.
It has two trustees, although Mr Mahfouz is not among them. Over the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that Mr Fawcett had agreed to help Mr Mahfouz secure a knighthood if he could back ‘three possibilities’ for donations to Dumfries House, Charles’s 18th century mansion.
One option was £10million to design and build houses in the area. The Prince’s Foundation was unable to comment because of the ongoing investigation but sources said it would be happy to offer its cooperation on the matter. 
A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment.
n The High Court’s decision to ban media organisations from a secret hearing about Prince Philip’s will has prompted legal action.
Lawyers are seeking permission to argue that a judge did not properly consider the need for open justice. The Duke of Edinburgh’s will is to be kept from public view for 90 years after a September ruling by Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the family division of the High Court.
The legal challenge, brought by The Guardian, will draw attention to a century-long tradition that sees senior judges lock away wills belonging to royals.
British laws hold that all wills should be open to the public to ensure the wishes of the deceased are carried out and to alert creditors. Since the early 19th century the monarch has been exempt.",-2
1550,"IN LATE JULY a Chinese Long March rocket streaked into space, much like the dozens that took off last year. But having begun to orbit the Earth, this rocket’s payload then lurched downwards, glided through the upper atmosphere and finally crashed to the ground. American officials were stunned, says the Financial Times, which recently broke news that this had been a test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic glider (China denies it). China conducted another such experiment a couple of weeks later, says the newspaper.

The novelty of such gliders is not that they are unusually fast—in some cases, they are slower than an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as it re-enters the atmosphere—but that they are manoeuvrable. A Russian or Chinese ICBM fired at America travels over the North Pole and high into space, visible to radar systems in the Arctic, and then plunges back down in a predictable way (see diagram).
Gliders are also taken up on rockets but they are released much lower and re-enter the atmosphere very quickly, if they leave it at all, making them less visible to radar. Then they cruise, unpowered, over long distances, allowing them to take convoluted routes that skirt around missile defences. America and the Soviet Union experimented with gliders in the cold war. Many others are doing so today.
China’s tests, however, involved a twist. The gliders did not simply go up and coast down, but also circled the Earth in space. This is similar to the approach employed by the Soviet Union’s Fractional Orbital Bombardment System—fractional because it did not involve a full revolution around the Earth—which was deployed between 1969 and 1983. The advantage of an orbital weapon is that it can go over the South Pole and reach America from a direction where the country has neither ground-based radar nor perfect coverage from infra-red satellites that can spot rocket engines.
The combination of orbiter and glider is not in itself new. America’s old space shuttle and its current X-37B spaceplane are examples of things that are sent up by rocket, go into orbit and then glide back. The difference is that the shuttle was not built to crash to the ground with nukes attached. China appears to be the first to turn this combination into a prototype of a weapon, says Tong Zhao of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy in Beijing.
China’s motivation for doing this may, in part, relate to America’s development of missile defences, which intensified after the administration of George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in 2002. China and Russia are building ever more exotic nukes to ensure that their missiles can penetrate any current or future American defences.
The growing geopolitical and military competition between America and China seems to have turbocharged China’s nuclear ambitions. Earlier this year, researchers discovered two large fields of suspected ICBM silos in northern China. All this reflects not just narrow military calculations, but political ones, too. China, suggests Mr Zhao, believes that nuclear strength “helps force the US to accept peaceful co-existence”. ■",2
1551,"IT TOOK THREE and a half months and a constitutional crisis, but Samoa at last has its first change of governing party in 33 years, as well as its first female prime minister. On July 23rd the country’s court of appeal ruled that Fiame Naomi Mata’afa’s FAST party, which narrowly won an election in April, was the legitimate government of Samoa, an island nation of 200,000 people 2,900 km north-east of New Zealand. The judges emphatically rejected the protracted efforts by Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, the outgoing prime minister, and the O le Ao o le Malo, Samoa’s head of state, to thwart the election outcome. On July 26th Mr Tuilaepa at last conceded defeat.
That the saga has at last ended and the opposition has been able to form a government is no thanks to him, but to the judiciary, one of the few state institutions that he had not managed to compromise during his lengthy stint in office. In power since 1988, Mr Tuilaepa’s Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) had become too accustomed to the trappings of government. So had Mr Tuilaepa himself, who had been prime minister since 1998 and claimed to have been chosen by God.

His purported divine mandate inspired him to dominate vast parts of the state apparatus, as is apparent from the number of institutions affected by recent court rulings. After Mr Tuilaepa’s party lost the election in April, the electoral commissioner sought to manufacture an extra parliamentary seat for the HRPP by arguing that the composition of Parliament failed to meet the country’s minimum 10% quota for women legislators. The attempt was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court. When the former speaker locked the doors of Parliament in May to prevent the new government from being sworn in, he too was rebuked by the court.
The O le Ao o le Malo at first obeyed a court order to call Parliament to sit, but then revoked it for reasons he never explained. He has belatedly accepted the new government, but still maintains that the judges usurped his role in convening Parliament. The judges point out that the O le Ao o le Malo forfeited those powers after failing to do so within 45 days after a general election, as the constitution requires.
The new administration faces several immediate challenges. For a start, the prime minister needs an emergency budget to replace the potentially unlawful one passed by the caretaker administration in June. Ms Mata’afa has suggested a constitutional review to close some of the loopholes exposed by the recent political crisis. She resigned as deputy prime minister, left the HRPP and joined the new FAST party as its leader because of a schism in the HRPP caused by disagreement over proposed legal changes curbing the power of the Supreme Court. These reforms are now likely to be ditched. Plans for a $100m port paid for by China but disliked by Australia will probably be shelved as well.
Other changes may prove trickier. Ms Mata’afa may be inclined to remove the deeply compromised O le Ao o le Malo from office. He can potentially be dislodged by Parliament, though it may be easier to allow him to serve out his first five-year term, which expires in 2022. Even then, replacing him would be a delicate matter, as he is the holder of one of Samoa’s four much-venerated paramount Tama a ‘Aiga chiefly titles. It may help that Ms Mata’afa holds one, too.
Ms Mata’afa is likely to reinforce Samoa’s close relations with New Zealand and Australia and remain a strong advocate for the rule of law. But those who expect radical change are likely to be disappointed. Despite her recent switch to the opposition, the new prime minister spent many years as a loyal HRPP politician, and five years as Mr Tuilaepa’s deputy.
Still, she won partly thanks to spirited campaigning by the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa on behalf of the opposition. On the off-chance that she feels imbued with a divine mandate, she may be inclined to interpret it less expansively than her predecessor did. ■

1552,"New York (CNN Business)An animated dumpling called ""Dart,"" with a shiny gold chrome body that pops out of its head when you squeeze its squishy cheeks, is creating quite a stir as parents scramble to score one of this year's must-have toys.Dart belongs to a family of interactive dumplings from toymaker WowWee that hit stores in mid July. They're basically what the name suggests -- squeezable but inedible dumplings big enough to fit into the palm of your hand.And they're increasingly difficult to find. Like with everything, blame the supply chain.""It's a s**tshow,"" said Michael Yanofsky, the company's managing director of sales. ""It's not just the holdup at the ports, it's labor shortages and backups all along the transportation network that's been a struggle to get the toys to retailers.""""Our bet is made for Black Friday,"" said Yanofsky. ""Whatever inventory of dumplings is in is it and we hope it all makes it onto store shelve. There's no chance of getting more unless we put them on planes.""WowWee is trying to navigate the serious supply chain issues to ensure it has enough inventory overall of its dumplings to satisfy strong demand through to Christmas. The dumplings, like most toys sold in the United States, are made in China. Sold outThe first four in the lineup are named ""Doe,"" ""Dip,"" ""Dee"" and ""Dot."" They each speak a weird ""Squish-Pop"" language and giggle and laugh. The cheeks change color and the top of their head lights up to a color code that matches their current ""mood"" -- energetic, happy, silly. Then along came ""Mel the Marshamallow, "" ""Peace the Peach"" and ""Coco the Cotton Candy Cloud.""But it's Dart, the golden dumpling who flaunts 24K gold glasses, that everyone desperately wants. He's sold out on Amazon (AMZN) where WowWee launched him at the end September. Dart has been popping up on eBay  (EBAY)at twice the retail price.Its popularity even caught the attention of MyBookie.com, an offshore gaming site, which was accepting bets this month on whether the squishy little golden dumpling would sell out on Amazon before Black Friday. Hitting all the trendsThe $15 dumpling toy is popular because it's hitting a few dominant trends in toys right now, said Marissa Silva, editor-in-chief of The Toy Insider, a toy review and news website.She said kids are obsessed with collecting tiny cute toys that come in tiny packages, as proven by the Shopkins mania. ""Dumplings are a little bit bigger but collectible,"" said Silva. ""They're also affordable and not overly complicated for kids to figure out.""Plus, the soft squishy texture of the dumpling and the popping out of their body also cleverly plays into the current bubble fidget poppers toy craze.There's one other appeal: the food inspiration.""Food-themed toys continue to be very hot trend.

Mini Brands are tiny shrunken versions of popular consumer products like a can of Spam, or a bottle of Dove Body Wash that come hidden in tiny bags.""""These food-inspired toys are also so easy for kids to have fun with on social media,"" said Silver.The squishy dumplings are the brainchild of Sydney Wiseman, vice president of brand development and creative strategy for WowWee. She came up with the idea for them 18 moths ago. ""I wanted to do a toy based on a dumpling for a long time,"" she said. And she wanted the dumpling characters to be in a band. That aspect is infused in their look and the accessories they wear.More are comingWowWee in August announced a partnership with Nickelodeon to produce animated digital music videos that feature the squishy characters in a band.Wiseman is thrilled with the dumplings popularity overall, and especially of Dart's, which WowWee only produced 100,000 pieces of as a very limited character.

1553,"FOR AN INSIGHT into the thoughts of teenagers about social-media, TikTok is the place to look. “Anyone else feel like it’s low key kinda cringe to post on Instagram now?” asks one in a clip uploaded to the video-sharing platform in June. It has been liked over 368,000 times. Facebook, which owns Instagram, is under fire after Frances Haugen, a former employee, leaked internal documents suggesting the firm was aware it was causing harm to the mental health of teenage girls in particular. But the internet’s youngest users have been falling out of love with Facebook’s platforms for a while. American children aged between four and 15 spent an average of 17 minutes per day on Facebook in 2020, down from 18 minutes in 2019, according to a report from Qustodio, a security software company. Instagram stayed at 40 minutes, and Snapchat was up from 37 minutes to 47. Screen time on TikTok, meanwhile, surged, from 44 average daily minutes to 87.
These numbers are a consequence of lockdowns, but are also a testament to TikTok’s engrossing “For You” page (FYP), which is powered by an algorithm that serves users an endless stream of videos they might be interested in. Getting featured on it is often an indicator that a clip will go viral (many videos are tagged #FYP to boost their chances), which is part of the app’s thrill. The platform, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has become synonymous with lip-synching teenagers, dances and challenges. And despite interventions from various governments, including the threat of its removal from app stores by former President Donald Trump, TikTok has continued to soar since its launch in 2016: last month it hit 1bn monthly users.

As a newer platform, TikTok also had a chance to learn from the mistakes of its predecessors. It has proposed the creation of a “global coalition” of social platforms to protect users better from harmful content. The FYP makes people internet-famous very quickly—and makes them targets for harassment. To address this, TikTok deleted millions of accounts belonging to users under the age of 13, and limited the use of its more public features from its youngest profiles. It also claims that less than 1% of videos uploaded in the first quarter of 2021 violated its terms of service—and those that did were removed within 24 hours. All this, in theory, ought to mean TikTok is healthier than other social media apps.
The reality is different. Last year the Intercept, a news site, published Chinese moderation documents, revealing a preference to filter out users with “ugly facial looks”, “beer belly” and content that risked “endangering…national honour and interests”. Teenage girls have been targeted with adverts about intermittent fasting. And reports by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think-tank, have found that videos peddling harmful covid-19 vaccine misinformation and white-supremacist content accumulated millions of views before they were taken down by the company. Some of these exploited TikTok’s features, it says, such as trending songs, to extend their reach. The ISD found the firm’s application of its policies to be “lacking in accuracy, consistency and transparency”.
Ms Haugen’s leaks about Instagram have put a spotlight on the platform’s role in perpetuating negative thoughts about body image among teenage girls. A similar culture flourishes on TikTok, too. There are currently 8.8bn total views on videos tagged #whatIeatinaday, a viral trend where mostly young girls document their food diaries, some of which include under-eating. Learning from Facebook’s mistakes, TikTok announced that it would include safety announcements on these videos and do more to direct users to support resources. Yet the lines between what is a direct consequence of social media and what is symptomatic of wider cultural pressures about body shapes are blurred.
Tumblr, a blogging platform, was polluted with content promoting eating disorders and self-harm over a decade ago, prompting the site to censor accounts that were endorsing harmful behaviour. Internet users are wise to moderators, though. Misspellings of hashtags are used on TikTok to bypass censored words. Last month TikTok censored videos tagged “devious licks”—a viral challenge which saw teenagers vandalising or stealing school property—from its search bar. Yet misspellings of the phrase are still accessible and are even suggested by the platform. Similarly, misspelt eating-disorder tags are easily discoverable and the videos tagged under them have thousands of views. One such post, live for a week at time of writing, promotes eating fewer than 500 calories a day.
Most TikToks are innocuous. But like its predecessors, the app has not yet effectively addressed problems that hide in plain sight. If an under-age user wants to create an account, no community guidelines can stop them from lying about their age. If someone wants to view harmful content, they will seek it out. And the features that make TikTok so successful also make it risky: the more a user engages with certain tags, the more the FYP will serve similar content. Much like Facebook’s platforms, in other words. ■",2
1554,"WHEN LAWMAKERS from South Korea’s ruling Minjoo party discuss their plan to impose tougher penalties on the media for reporting “fake news”, they stress that they merely want to safeguard vulnerable citizens. “It’s the least we can do to protect the people from fake news,” one legislator told reporters earlier this month. “We have to remember that our people’s basic rights and freedoms are more important than the freedom of the press,” said another. The proposed changes to the Press Arbitration Act of 2011, the party argues, would improve the quality of reporting and increase the public’s trust in it.
Hogwash, says the conservative opposition, which quashed a first attempt to pass the bill last month by threatening a filibuster. The proposal, it argues, is an attempt by the government to shield itself from criticism. Other observers appear to agree. Last week, a coalition of activist groups including Human Rights Watch called on legislators from all parties to reject the bill when it is put to another vote in the National Assembly on September 27th.

The bill introduces new provisions allowing individuals and small businesses to go after reporters and media organisations for, among other things, causing “emotional distress” by spreading false information either intentionally or as a result of “gross negligence”, for instance without fact-checking. Critics worry the vague wording of some of the clauses would give the authorities too much discretion to decide which reports qualify for corrections or damages. A letter from the UN’s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, sent to the government in August, warned that the law could be used to limit ordinary news reporting and criticism of the government, and could see writers held liable for parody and satire or simply for expressing unpopular opinions.
The ruling party’s concerns are not entirely unfounded. Like people everywhere, South Koreans are exposed to mountains of humbug. A noisy minority of mostly elderly right-wingers watch YouTube channels that spread misinformation about vaccines, American politics and President Moon Jae-in’s supposed chumminess with North Korea, the Chinese Communist Party, the devil, or all three. Even beyond the radical fringe, most people get their news from online aggregators whose algorithms reward sensationalist clickbait and which take little responsibility for sourcing. The biggest newspapers have long-standing links to big conglomerates; the heads of public broadcasters change with the government. Unsurprisingly, less than a third of South Koreans say they trust the news.
But if legislators are indeed trying to solve these problems and bolster their democracy, they are going about it in a curious way, says Park Kyung-sin, a law professor and free-speech activist at Korea University in Seoul. Most fake news and conspiracy-mongering originates on social media, he notes. But the law only applies to newspapers and broadcasters, leaving the main source of falsehoods untouched. Mr Park suspects the party’s real motive is a feeling of being under siege by the press: they find it hard to accept that, in government, “they’re being criticised by all journalists, not just the right-wing media”.
It is all the more surprising given that press freedom in South Korea has improved significantly since Mr Moon took power in 2017. South Korea climbed 30 places in a global press freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, a watchdog, after his election. And it is an unusual bill for a liberal democracy to propose, carrying as it does elements of similar laws passed in recent years by bossier places such as Singapore.
The many complaints have not fallen on deaf ears. Minjoo legislators have responded by drafting a revised version of the bill. But it still fails to resolve the main worry, that the law would unduly restrict speech. Given the party’s absolute majority, it is likely to pass, unless legislators decide to withdraw it. If it does, South Korea will surely drop a few places in next year’s press-freedom ranking. ■",2
1555,"The wife of former French international Eric Abidal is seeking a divorce after learning of his alleged relationship with Paris Saint-Germain women's footballer Kheira Hamraoui.
The links emerged as investigators try to learn who was behind a mysterious attack against Hamraoui this month, when her legs were beaten after she was dragged out of a car with her team-mate Aminata Diallo.
Earlier this week, Hamraoui appealed to the media to respect her privacy after police discovered she was using a telephone SIM card registered in Abidal's name on the night of the attack.
'Hayet Abidal is going to file a divorce request in Barcelona,' her lawyers said in a statement.
Eric Abidal, a household name in France, was Barcelona's sporting director from 2018 to 2020, during which time Hamraoui was with the women's team.
The statement claimed that he 'admitted to his spouse' having an affair with Hamraoui after French prosecutors in the Paris suburb of Versailles announced the SIM card link.
Hayet Abidal 'reiterates her request to be questioned very soon on a case that has already had several collateral victims,' the statement added.
The Abidals, who know each other from their native Lyon in southeast France, have been married since 2007 and have four daughters and a son.
Diallo, who was not injured in the attack, was held for questioning for nearly 35 hours last week before being released without charge.
The attack and its aftermath sent shockwaves through the PSG club, with the two players considered friendly rivals for midfield positions.
Hamraoui was left out of the squad in PSG's 2-0 defeat of Real Madrid on Thursday, which saw them clinch their place in the quarter-finals of the Women's Champions League.
Hamraoui, 31, was beaten with an iron bar, leaving her with a number of bruises and cuts on her legs which required stitches. 
French sports paper L'Equipe have released details from the police on how the attack took place, detailing how Diallo drove Hamraoui to and from a team meal in a Toyota Corolla provided by the club, dropping off another player afterwards - Sakina Karchaoui - before the attack began in Chatou, Yvelines.
'My attacker hit me with an iron bar several times. I saw that he was mainly targeting my legs and I was trying to protect myself with my hands,' Hamraoui told police.  
'At that time, I didn't see a weapon. They immediately start yelling: ""Open the door! Open the door!"" The one on my side grabbed me and pulled me out of the vehicle. 
'Before, he grabbed a rectangular iron bar that he had hidden in his pants or under his sweater.
'He gave me a first blow from the first moments of the assault to force me out of the cabin. I fell on the road and then on the right side of the road. 
'My attacker hit me with an iron bar several times. I saw that he was mainly targeting my legs and I was trying to protect myself with my hands.
'The scene lasted several minutes, it seemed long to me. Aminata told me it was faster. I think the two individuals fled because cars were coming into the street. 
'They started running in the direction of the traffic. We quickly lost sight of them. I think a car should be waiting for them nearby.'
Hamraoui also refers to hearing the term 'you like to sleep with married men' during the assault, a detail confirmed by Diallo who was being 'detained' by the second stranger throughout the attack.  
After sustaining serious injuries, she was taken to hospital and has been told to stay off work for three weeks but she has reportedly resumed individual training - yet is being aided by a psychologist and benefits from 'close protection set up by the club.' 
The 42-year-old Abidal has been married to his wife, Hayet Abidal, since 2003 and they have five children together. Le Monde say it is possible she could be called upon as a witness. Abidal's lawyer was contacted and said: 'I have spoken with him, but for now I won’t tell you anything at all.'
Diallo, meanwhile, released a statement this week about the allegations: 'Aminata Diallo deplores the perfectly artificial dramatisation of a rivalry between her and Kheira Hamraoui which would justify her taking it out on her team-mate.
'This theory does not correspond in any way to the true nature of their relationship.
'Other much more serious leads are now being looked at by investigators, which do not implicate my client in any way.
'Aminata Diallo regrets the media uproar which had already sentenced her, with no basis, and she would like to emphasise that she will not hesitate to defend her rights through legal action, if necessary, against all defamation.' ",-2
1556,"SINCE HANDING over the reins as Microsoft’s chief executive in 2000, Bill Gates has been best-known for his philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest charities, has given billions of dollars to vaccination drives, family-planning clinics, research into drug treatments for malaria and more.
But Mr Gates has not abandoned the business world entirely. On June 2nd TerraPower, a company he founded in 2008, announced that it would build a demonstration of an exotic, high-tech nuclear power station in Wyoming. The firm’s Natrium reactor is one of a gaggle of new designs that have emerged in recent years, as engineers try to come up with cheaper, simpler nuclear power plants that can provide low-carbon electricity with fewer of the cost and safety worries that have plagued the industry in the past.

The Natrium reactor makes two big changes to the standard nuclear-power-plant design. It replaces the liquid water that normally courses through the core with hot, liquid sodium (natrium, in Latin). And instead of using the heat generated by the reactor to make electricity directly, it first employs it to heat a tank of molten salt that acts as a giant battery. The upshot, the firm hopes, will be a cheaper reactor that is better suited to power grids that will increasingly be dominated by intermittent sources of energy such as wind turbines and solar panels.
Start with the reactor itself. Most nuclear power plants are light-water reactors (LWRs), a technology developed in America in the 1950s. They use ordinary water both to cool the reactor core and to increase the intensity of the chain-reaction by moderating the speed of the neutrons that are emitted when uranium atoms split. Thus slowed, these neutrons are more likely to go on to split more atoms in turn.
Natrium employs hot, liquid sodium as a coolant, and dispenses with the moderator entirely. This is another idea that dates back to the 1950s, but one which has never been widely deployed. Yet sodium offers several advantages as a coolant, says Chris Levesque, TerraPower’s boss. The liquid sodium’s high temperature—around 500°C—makes the reactor more efficient. At the same time, liquid sodium is much less corrosive to pipes than hot water. And though the water in LWRs is pumped through at high pressure, Natrium is designed to operate at close to atmospheric pressure. That means pipes, containment buildings and the like can be less beefy without affecting safety. TerraPower reckons its reactor needs only 20% of the concrete required by an LWR of equivalent power, which helps keep down costs.
The firm’s second big idea is its molten-salt energy-storage system. Inspiration for this came from the solar-power industry, says Mr Levesque. Solar-thermal systems (in contradistinction to the more familiar photovoltaic ones that generate electricity directly) have, for several years, used similar tanks to store excess solar energy harvested during the day. In Natrium’s case, the sodium coolant transfers heat from the reactor into the molten-salt tanks. A separate set of pipes then removes heat from the tanks and uses it to produce electricity.
TerraPower hopes this arrangement will let the new reactor ramp its power output up and down, depending on the price of electricity. This is something that LWRs struggle to do. The firm’s demonstration plant will usually produce 345 megawatts (MW) of electrical power. But by releasing the energy stored in the molten-salt tanks, it will be able to boost that to 500MW for over five-and-a-half hours. This should be a useful trick as power grids fill up with wind and solar farms that are likely to cause power prices to fluctuate more than they do at present. Combined with lower construction costs, TerraPower hopes such agility will make its plant more economically attractive than older designs.
It all looks good on paper. But then, nuclear power always does. The industry has been plagued by delays and cost overruns for decades. Existing sodium-cooled reactors, most of which are experimental, have a spotty record. A plant in Japan suffered a serious fire in 1995 and was shut down for over a decade. The Superphénix reactor in France, built in 1974, proved extremely unreliable, and was offline for years at a time. It closed for good in 1998. (Other reactors, such as the Fast Flux Test Facility in Washington state, have better records.)

The Union of Concerned Scientists, an American not-for-profit organisation, argues in a report published in March that sodium’s advantages as a coolant are counterbalanced by drawbacks. One is that a reactor which ran too hot might see its power output rise as a consequence. Unlike water, the loss of which shuts a reactor down for lack of moderation, sodium slightly damps the chain-reaction. If bubbles of sodium vapour formed in the coolant, that damping effect would diminish, risking a dangerous feedback loop of rising temperatures and growing power output.
The physics of such judgments are tricky. Few countries have as much nuclear experience as France, which generates around 70% of its electricity that way. Yet in 2015 French regulators said they could not determine whether sodium-cooled reactors are significantly safer than modern LWRs. TerraPower, moreover, insists that its Natrium plant is designed in a way that makes runaway reactions impossible.
America’s government, for its part, thinks the technology has merit. It is chipping in $80m to help TerraPower build the demonstration plant, which the firm says should be ready by 2028. In the meantime, says Mr Levesque, TerraPower has been fielding inquiries from electricity firms interested in its technology. Whether Mr Gates’s bet on a nuclear-power revival will pay off remains to be seen. ■

1557,"Seven migrants have been killed and eight others injured after the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in lost control and crashed near a motorway toll station in northern Greece, authorities said.
Police said the vehicle carrying 15 people had been travelling on a motorway from the area of Greece's north-eastern border with Turkey towards the north's main city of Thessaloniki when it crashed just after midnight.
The vehicle had been travelling at high speed and the driver lost control as he tried to exit the motorway, hitting a toll booth and crashing into a nearby storage container, police said.
The injured were four men from Pakistan, one from Afghanistan and two from Nepal, as well as the 35-year-old Moldovan driver, who police suspect was acting as a smuggler.
They have been transported to hospitals in the north-eastern Greek towns of Xanthi and Komotini.
The seven people killed in the crash included one woman.
Their nationalities were not immediately known, authorities said.
Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
The most frequently used routes for clandestine entries into Greece are the short but dangerous sea crossing from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands, or crossing the heavily guarded land border between Greece and Turkey.",-2
1558,"The Chinese government widened its crackdown on businesses that don’t toe the Communist Party’s line, targeting private tutoring, an industry worth $100bn in revenue, which it decreed can now only operate without profit. Foreign investment will be restricted, no new licences issued, and curbs on teaching hours introduced. The constraints are harsher in tone than those imposed on the tech industry, but Chinese tech stocks swooned as investors wondered whether a broader clampdown was on the cards.
Tencent’s share-price fall was among the steepest; it shed a sixth of its value. The Chinese tech giant has suspended new registrations on its WeChat social network while it upgrades the platform to comply with the government’s latest edicts for the industry.

SoftBank is reportedly selling about a quarter of the stake it holds in Uber to offset the heavy losses from its holding in Didi Global, China’s biggest ride-hailing company. Didi’s market value slumped when Chinese regulators targeted it for investigation recently.
Meanwhile, China’s securities regulator approved a secondary listing of shares by state-owned China Telecom on the Shanghai stockmarket, which could raise $8.4bn.
Zomato’s IPO was a roaring success in Mumbai. The food-delivery app is the first of several tech firms in India to whet investors’ appetite with a market flotation. Paytm, a fintech firm, is next. Both it and Zomato count Jack Ma’s Ant Group among their backers.
Robinhood, a trading app used by hordes of small investors to buy and sell stocks, not least the “meme” variety, priced its shares at the lower end of its target range ahead of its debut on the Nasdaq stockmarket.

In its latest outlook, the IMF said that access to vaccines had become the “principal fault line” for the world economy, separating emerging markets and low-income countries, which are grappling with surging infections, from advanced economies. The fund increased its projections of growth for the rich world this year, but shaved its estimate for less-developed regions. It does expect all countries to have gained broad access to vaccines by the end of 2022.
Pfizer said it now thinks revenue from the vaccine it developed with BioNTech will reach $33.5bn this year. The drug company is selling its doses for profit (as is Moderna). AstraZeneca and Johnson  Johnson have said they will not make a profit from their vaccines until the pandemic ends.
South Korea’s economy was 5.9% larger in the second quarter than it was a year earlier, during the depths of the pandemic. On that measure exports also rebounded, as they have in other countries. But by comparison with the first quarter of this year GDP expanded by just 0.7%, the slowest pace since the middle of last year.
Facebook doubled its net profit in the second quarter, year on year, to $10.4bn. Its revenue from ads soared, suggesting that Apple’s new privacy policy, under which iPhone users must give their clear consent for ad data to be collected, has had little impact on Facebook’s business so far.
America’s other tech stars also reported stellar earnings. Apple’s quarterly net income of $21.7bn was driven by iPhone sales; it is on track for a record profit for its fiscal year. Alphabet reported its best-ever quarter for revenue and profit, of $18.5bn, boosted by online advertising as economies reopen. And Microsoft had another bumper three months as the pandemic boon to its cloud-computing and Team communications businesses helped generate a profit of $16.5bn.
A report by a law firm into Credit Suisse’s dealings with Archegos Capital Management delivered a damning verdict on its risk management. The Swiss bank lost billions when Archegos went bust in March. The report highlighted how it had focused on short-term profits, and failed to see the hazard in Archegos’s “voracious” hedging of stocks. Credit Suisse said the incident had been a “turning point” and it was now taking a more “conservative” approach to risk.
Laying out the welcome mat
All visitors from America and the European Union who are fully vaccinated will no longer have to quarantine upon arrival in most of Britain (they will still have to take covid-19 tests).

The Biden administration, however, has no current plans to lift its measures on visitors from Britain and the EU to the United States.",2
1559,"THE SHEER number was overwhelming. Between 1950 and 2020 at least 216,000 children were sexually abused in France by Catholic clergy. Thus, on October 5th, concluded a two-year independent inquiry commissioned by the church. Jean-Marc Sauvé, who led it, said it uncovered “the lead weight of silence smothering the crimes” committed by 2,900-3,200 clergy. If lay molesters involved in church activities were also included, the number of abused could reach 330,000.
Mr Sauvé’s introduction to the report is chilling and unflinching: “The Catholic church’s immediate reaction was to protect itself as an institution” and it “has shown complete, even cruel, indifference to those who suffered”. About 90% of the victims were boys, many between ten and 13 years old. He called for “a humble acknowledgement of responsibility from the church authorities for the mistakes and crimes committed under its auspices”.

As was revealed by reports into sexual abuse by Catholic clergy elsewhere, the crimes in France involved a sinister web of misplaced trust, manipulated authority, concealment, silence and shame. The abuse was countrywide: in local parishes, scout groups, catechism classes and within families. Pope Francis expressed “great sorrow” for the victims. François Devaux, who suffered sexual abuse at the age of ten and later founded a victims group, called what they had gone through simply “hell”.
It was the efforts of survivors such as Mr Devaux that forced the church to confront its denials and cover-ups. He and others came forward in 2015 to accuse Bernard Preynat, a priest and scout leader, of sexual abuse. Mr Preynat was convicted last year. In 2019 the accusations prompted the resignation of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, convicted of covering up the Preynat affair (the conviction was overturned on appeal).
France has an unusual link with Catholicism, due to strict secular rules, known as laïcité, designed to keep the state neutral in religious affairs. It lacks the wide network of church-linked boarding schools and state institutions that helped to conceal paedophilia in some other countries. Yet this proved no protection for the victims.
Today the Catholic church in France is a hollowed-out version of its former self. Numbering 12,000, the priesthood is half what it was 20 years ago—and half of those serving are over 75. Only 49% of the French say they believe in God. Two years ago 56% said in one survey that they had a bad image of the Catholic church. This week’s report will entrench these trends.
The church is not the only French arena in which denial of sexual abuse has been exposed. Another is politics, where, until #MeToo, sexual violence towards women tended to be hushed up. Two recent books also reveal how members of Left-Bank Parisian circles deployed the principle of sexual liberty to mask abuse and incest. By exposing the manipulation and cruelty of the predators, those brave enough to speak out may in future help prevent such abuse from going undetected for so long. ■",2
1560,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3
1561,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks.
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.
Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.",3
1562,"ONE EVENING last month Francisco Sagasti, who was Peru’s interim president for eight months until July, launched his new book in Barranco, a bohemian district of Lima. Mr Sagasti, an academic, is a centrist who steered the country through a divisive election. The event was disrupted by demonstrators who surrounded the bookshop chanting “corrupt” and “murderer” at the author while punching a journalist. They belonged to “The Resistance”, a group formed in 2018 under the banner of “God, Fatherland and Family” to oppose communism and liberalism. They are one of many facets of a new, more aggressive right wing in Latin America.
Its breakthrough came with the election in 2018 of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil. A former army officer scornful of democracy and nostalgic for his country’s military dictatorship of 1964-85, Mr Bolsonaro marked a break with previous political norms in the region. Since democratisation in the 1980s, with one or two exceptions, conservative political forces were generally moderate, often influenced by Christian Democracy.

Mr Bolsonaro has spawned would-be imitators, of different kinds. They include Guido Manini, a retired army commander who promised to crack down on crime and who as a political outsider won 11% of the vote in Uruguay’s presidential election in 2019. In Peru Rafael López Aliaga, a businessman who is a member of Opus Dei, a Catholic movement, won 12% in an election in April on a platform of social conservatism and extreme economic liberalism. In Argentina Javier Milei, a libertarian economist, is poised to win a seat in Congress in an election this month, running against the main centre-right coalition as well as the ruling Peronists.
Closest to power is José Antonio Kast, a former legislator who in his first presidential campaign in 2017 said that, if he were alive, General Pinochet, Chile’s dictator in 1973-90, would vote for him. For the presidential election later this month he has promised to “restore Chile” with mano dura (“a firm hand”) against crime and violent disorder, a border ditch to stop immigrants, withdrawing from international human-rights bodies and tax cuts to promote economic growth. He also claims to defend Chile’s European heritage and national unity against the left’s espousal of indigenous groups and multiculturalism. Mr Kast looks set to contest a run-off election for the presidency against Gabriel Boric of the hard left.
Mr Kast is not Mr Bolsonaro. Rather, he represents a radical populist right, more in the mould of Álvaro Uribe, Colombia’s president from 2002 to 2010. He insists he is not “extremist” and now doesn’t deny that there were abuses under Pinochet. Not all of the new rightists represent a clear threat to democracy itself. But some do. All of them are less conciliatory than the old conservative parties. Minority groups have reasons to worry.
What explains the rise of the new right? One factor is the formation in recent years of grassroots groups with Catholic and evangelical ties which have campaigned against abortion, gay rights and feminism. Another is a popular demand for protection against crime. As with the radical left, the radical right is benefiting from public disillusionment with economic stagnation and mainstream democratic politicians, who are seen as self-serving if not corrupt. But what unites all these new right-wing forces, says Ariel Goldstein, a political scientist at the University of Buenos Aires, is “the spectre of Venezuela” which has sought to export its poverty-spreading leftist dictatorship. In that sense, the radicalisation of the right is a mirror of the same process on the left. If Mr Kast has a chance of winning, as he does, it is partly because Mr Boric, though himself a democrat, espouses a statist economic programme and has communist allies.
Latin America’s new right is also part of a broader international trend. Donald Trump’s victory in the United States in 2016 paved the way for Mr Bolsonaro. Mr Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo has close links to the nativist fringe of the Republican Party. Now Vox, a Spanish anti-immigrant party, is acting as an agent uniting the new right in Latin America. In September it published a “Letter from Madrid”, denouncing communism in the “Iberosphere” and signed so far by almost 9,000 politicians or activists including Messrs Kast, López Aliaga and Milei, as well as Eduardo Bolsonaro. Liberal democrats in Latin America now have to deal not just with an authoritarian left but with a right that is far more intolerant than in the recent past.",2
1563,"A Russian model who put two million Swarovski diamonds onto her £270,000 Lamborghini Aventado has been left with a new car bill - after it was wrecked in a crash.
Daria Radionova, 26, had the black supercar customised with the crystals to show off her bling lifestyle to her 626,000 Instagram followers.
The motor - which has a top speed of 217mph - even has a personalised numberplate DAR 11A so people know who it belongs to.
But the unusual vehicle is now off the road after being involved in a crash in Kensington, west London yesterday. 
A picture emerged showing the rear of the car completely smashed up after another vehicle seemingly smashed into the back of it.
Ms Radionova posted about the mishap this lunchtime but it is not known who was in the car at the time.
She offered a cash reward to anyone with information about a blue Vauxhall car. 
Last night, a friend of Ms Radionova posted a video of the pair driving through Oxford Street in a car, though it remains unclear who was driving and what car they were travelling in.  
It will come as a devastating blow to her as it is one of her most prized possessions.
She regularly shows it off on her social media platforms to her fans.
Only a week ago she put up two pictures of it at a garage in Knightsbridge being filled up with petrol.
Then on Monday she Instragramed another of her in a baseball cap getting out of the driver's seat.
The location appeared to be a similar road to where the crash happened.
Ms Radionova was first known to have been the owner of the car back in 2019.
Stunned pedestrians in London spied it as it was showcased at rally in Kensington.
Work to add on the crystals took over 700 hours, because it has to be done painstakingly by hand.
She had been delighted with the end result, telling her followers 'I have no words to describe how shiny it is -  it was a complete shutdown.""
Ms Radionova is a serial car customiser and has done the same to one of her vehicles before.
In 2020 she drove her £150,000 Lamborghini Huracan covered in a million crystals down Oxford Street. 
Six years earlier she sold her Mercedes CLS 350, which was also covered in crystals, on eBay.
The bespoke work is carried out by Swarovski artist Vinceri, who has also worked with TV personality Maya Jama.
They teamed up to do some flash drinks tumblers with the former Radio 1 DJ.  ",-2
1564,"SAN FRANCISCO boasts the lowest death rate from covid-19 of any big American city. An early shutdown, a culture of caution and mask mandates helped curb the spread of the virus. “Our response to covid-19 has been hailed as a national model,” crows London Breed, the mayor. More than 78% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, one of the highest rates in the country.
The City by the Bay may have avoided a heavy death toll from covid-19 but, counter-intuitively, it could feel the virus’s impact longer than other places. Ted Egan, the city’s chief economist, admits as much. “San Francisco could well have a slower economic recovery than other cities,” he says. The city, with a GDP which roughly matches that of Greece, is facing a swathe of problems. These include emigration, a rise in some types of crime, drugs and homelessness. Dysfunctional and corrupt governance makes them harder to fix.

Faced with the prospect of paying steep rents while enduring some of the longest, strictest lockdowns in the country, people left—some permanently. According to CBRE, a commercial-property firm, 27% of offices are being marketed as available in San Francisco (compared with 19% in Manhattan). An analysis by California Policy Lab at the University of California shows that “net exits” from San Francisco (those leaving minus those arriving) rose by 649%—from 5,200 to nearly 39,000—in the last three quarters of 2020. The drop in apartment rents was the largest in the country, although they are climbing back. Even with this adjustment, the cost of living in San Francisco is still around two and a half times higher than the national average and 44% more than New York City.

Much attention has been paid to techies taking their laptops to the suburbs, the Sierras or Austin, Texas, but the less well-off have moved too. In the first quarter of 2021 average wages increased 34% year-on-year, the largest jump of any big county and six times the national average. This suggests a severe shortage of workers, especially in hospitality, says Mr Egan.
With less bustle and fewer commuters, San Francisco’s problems have become more obvious. “We’re a smaller city, a dense city, so our social problems are more visible to people,” says Matt Haney, who represents the troubled Tenderloin neighbourhood on the 11-member Board of Supervisors, which functions as the city’s legislative branch. “Our city government overall fails to meet the moment and has for some time,” he admits.
Start with schools. San Francisco was the only top-25 city not to bring most middle- and high-school pupils back to classrooms at all in the 2020-21 academic year. Meanwhile the school board used its time to scrap merit-based admissions to its leading high school in order to boost diversity, and spent months researching and then voting to change schools named after people it deemed objectionable on grounds of racism or otherwise standing in the way of progress, such as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, before abandoning the idea after a public outcry.

The renaming-while-not-reopening saga was almost a parody of San Francisco. A school-board commissioner criticised for racist tweets tried to sue her fellow board members and the school district for $87m. Parents who could afford to do so, including the former head of the Parent-Teacher Association, moved their children to private schools. Now an effort is under way to gather enough signatures to remove three commissioners from the school board in a special recall election. On Twitter some teachers and school board members are firing back at “reopener” parents.
A similar dysfunction afflicts policing and the criminal-justice system. Before covid-19 San Francisco was the car-break-in capital of America; but with fewer tourists, criminals have shifted their attention. Home burglaries are up. Shootings have more than doubled in the past year. Viral videos show daytime heists, with perpetrators sauntering out of stores without consequence. Lax enforcement of drug laws can become fatal when even small amounts can kill. In 2020 San Francisco saw around 700 deaths from overdoses, mostly from fentanyl: more than double the number from covid-19.
The district attorney (DA), Chesa Boudin, who ran on a platform of sending fewer people to prison and assumed office in January 2020, is the public’s person-of-interest. Two recall campaigns to remove him from office were started. One failed, but the other looks poised to gather enough signatures to trigger a vote. Mr Boudin, the son of two members of the leftist Weather Underground who were convicted for their involvement in the murder of two police officers and a security guard, has many critics, including, unsurprisingly, the police. Tony Montoya, who runs the police union, says officers are taking some cases directly to federal prosecutors, because they feel the DA is loth to prosecute them and pursue maximum charges.
Mr Boudin says he is being unfairly targeted. “None of the recall groups talk about how our courthouse has been mostly closed for the past year,” he says. “The issues have been driven more by a pandemic than any policy I’ve pursued.” Nor are the police blameless. In the fourth quarter of last year, the “clearance” rate for robbery (which measures the share of reported crimes that result in an arrest) was half that of New York City. The police are notoriously unresponsive. Gillian Morris, a startup founder, called three times about two office break-ins and one stolen package but never heard back. She describes San Francisco as “the most dysfunctional place I’ve ever lived when it comes to the protection of property and public safety”. (She left and now lives in San Juan, Puerto Rico.)
All this is despite San Francisco’s budget more than doubling since 2010 while the population rose less than 9%. As Michael Shellenberger, a journalist, writes in his forthcoming book, “San Fransicko”: “Though I have been a progressive and Democrat all of my adult life, I found myself asking a question that sounded rather conservative. What were we getting for our high taxes? And why, after 20 years of voting for ballot initiatives promising to address drug addiction, mental illness, and homelessness, had all three gotten worse?”
One City Hall insider suggests that San Francisco overreacts to issues that are in the national news, and designs solutions to the country’s problems rather than its own. For example, when Mr Boudin ran on his platform of less punitive justice, San Francisco already had one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. In 2019, 106 adults were in prison for every 100,000 people, one-fifth the rate in California and the nation. If the rest of the country behaved like San Francisco, the prison population would decline by 80%, says James Austin of the JFA Institute, a think-tank that evaluates criminal-justice policies.
City politics would look very different, quips one prosecutor, if everyone who got fed up could vote after they left San Francisco. Joel Kotkin of Chapman University blames high costs for the city’s political make-up: “You wouldn’t have the politics of San Francisco if there was still a middle class left,” he says. Young techies are transient and older residents, who locked in affordable housing decades ago, are happy enough with the status quo. The well-heeled can insulate mostly themselves, opting out of public schools and hiring neighbourhood security guards. As it is, the city has been safely Democratic for 40 years and seems allergic to choosing a Bloomberg-type figure from one of the big tech companies to try something different.
No elected mayor has failed to be re-elected in 20 years, points out Griffin Gaffney of Together SF, a volunteer group. That is despite a slew of corruption scandals. Joe Eskenazi, a reporter for Mission Local, an online news site, reckons “San Francisco’s problems aren’t liberalism. They’re incompetence and corruption.” Municipal graft has long been a feature of the city, dating back to the Barbary Coast days and the Gold Rush. But many are unaware that their city is currently at the centre of a big public corruption probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Already three former City Hall department heads have been charged by federal prosecutors, including the former boss of the Public Works Department, Mohammed Nuru, who has been accused of bribery. Craig Fair, the FBI agent in charge, describes “insidious corruption plaguing San Francisco”. Mayor Breed, who once dated Mr Nuru, recently agreed to pay a fine of $23,000 to the city’s Ethics Commission for accepting payment for her car repairs from Mr Nuru and using mayoral stationery to press the then-governor to reduce her brother’s prison sentence.
Ms Breed is also the highest-paid mayor in the country, earning a salary of $351,000. She sits at the summit of a highly paid bureaucracy. In 2020 nearly 150 city employees earned salaries of over $300,000, and roughly one-fifth earned salaries of over $150,000. The cost of living contributes to these pay-packets. But city government also functions like one of those clubby, richly valued startups that politicians accuse of ruining San Francisco—flush with cash, but operating with little oversight. ■",2
1565,"THE “Project for Bringing About Perpetual Peace in Europe” did not receive rave reviews when published in 1713. Voltaire thought the author, the Abbot of Saint-Pierre, was deluded. “The peace…will no more be realised than among elephants, rhinoceroses, wolves, or dogs,” he wrote. Showing less understanding of nature than of politics, he added: “Carnivorous animals will always tear one another to pieces at the first opportunity.”
Over the years, European intellectuals queued up to give the work a kicking. Immanuel Kant poked holes in it. Rousseau labelled it naive. Frederick II of Prussia declared the plan “very practicable: all it lacks to be successful is the consent of all Europe and a few other such small details.” Yet skip forward three centuries and the plan is, more or less, in place as the European Union.

To understand the EU today, one could usefully turn to the works of the abbot, now largely forgotten outside academia. Glance between Saint-Pierre’s 18th-century blueprint and the EU as it stands, and they are strikingly similar. In both cases, European countries agree to club together, submit themselves to the rulings of a court and devise rules by means of a continental parliament. Both have a rotating presidency. Contributions to the budget are based on wealth. Saint-Pierre even called his scheme a “European union”. Only Saint-Pierre’s inclusion of long-defunct countries such as Venice and Savoy gives the game away.
At the heart of both schemes is a radical idea. Under Saint-Pierre’s plan, sovereigns would submit to a superior law, enforced by independent supranational institutions. Coming more than half a century before Americans kicked out the British and the French started decapitating kings, this was radical. Without such a principle, argued Saint-Pierre, sovereigns would be stuck in a Hobbesian nightmare of constant struggle. Judging by the intervening three centuries of on-and-off wars and failed attempts to unify the continent spelled out in Shane Weller’s recent “The idea of Europe: A Critical History”, Saint-Pierre was on to something.
The rule of law has made the latest crack at European integration a success. Whether mighty Germany or tiny Malta, all members of the modern EU agree to subject themselves to the rulings of the European Court of Justice and laws put forward by the European Commission. Fundamentally, it is down to trust, or rather the lack of it. One country does not always believe another will abide by the rules, so other institutions must enforce them. This makes recent challenges to the supremacy of EU law from judges in Germany and Poland, who have questioned the authority of the ECJ, so dangerous. What was true in 1713 is even more true now. Without a clear legal basis, things can fall apart.
Saint-Pierre had a subtle understanding of sovereignty, which still applies today. From one perspective, most enthusiastically put forward by Brexiters, pooling sovereignty weakens it. For Saint-Pierre, true sovereignty involved no longer fearing one’s neighbours, since insecurity makes independence an illusion. The same logic is at work in the EU. Small countries appreciate the EU because it protects them from the excesses of big countries. Take the euro. Rather than suffer monetary whiplash from a decision by the Bundesbank, small countries can give up their monetary independence in exchange for a modest say in a bigger project. Saint-Pierre knew that sacrificing sovereignty is sometimes the only way of saving it.
Likewise, criticism of the abbot’s plan holds true for the EU today. Rousseau was almost right when he argued that Saint-Pierre’s idea could come about only through violent means. It took two world wars for European leaders to abandon their objections to such a scheme. In the EU, things still go forward when things go wrong. A pandemic and the biggest recession in the club’s history were needed for Germany and other holdouts to agree to the club issuing common debt.
Even Saint-Pierre’s failings feel appropriate for an ancestor of the EU. The abbot was a clunky writer, on a par with Brussels’s best bloviators. Where Americans have “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, the EU has “concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity”. In an age when Europe’s fiercest intellects were forging the Enlightenment, Saint-Pierre was decidedly second-rate, littering his argument with factual errors. One academic labelled him a “genius of European idiocy”.
But the abbot fits squarely into the EU’s long tradition of grey men and women who ultimately succeed despite having first been written off. Jacques Delors was initially seen as a patsy of Paris and Bonn, yet managed to become the commission’s most illustrious leader, leaving behind the single market, a path to monetary union and a natty flag. Ursula von der Leyen, the current German chief of the commission, ended up in Brussels only after her domestic career had gone off track. Yet the commission has quietly become more powerful on her watch. Second-tier types have a way of succeeding in the EU.
Forgotten forebears
Given Saint-Pierre’s foresight, it is at first odd that he is so little known. Unfortunately, there is a tendency in Brussels to trace the history of European integration no further back than the bloodless, legal approach that took hold after 1945, points out Luuk van Middelaar, a Dutch historian. Attempts before that—whether in the shape of Napoleon or Hitler charging across Europe or more diplomatic efforts—are played down. This makes the history neater, but less honest. For a club that is obsessed with notions of “European values” this is disappointing. The EU is always keen to claim such noble ideals as democracy and the rule of law as distinctly European traits. But imperialism and totalitarianism have just as long a pedigree on the continent. Rather than deal with that history, the EU overlooks it. Forgetting about Saint-Pierre’s efforts is one consequence of that tendency to brush over a messy past. ■",2
1566,"THE FERMENTED African locust bean, known in Yoruba as iru, has an unmistakable cheesy tang that hits you before you see it. “Iru isn’t just a flavour on the tongue,” says Ozoz Sokoh, a food blogger. After an elaborate process of fermentation, the smell is essential to its flavour. Iru is further enriched once tossed in smoky, bleached palm oil.
Long before Nestlé came to Nigeria with its Maggi bouillon cubes, iru was flavouring soups, stews and rice dishes. After independence the cube, with its monosodium glutamate seasoning, became more popular than iru, particularly in cities. But iru is making a worldwide comeback, thanks to a dish called ayamase which is packed with it.

A decade ago you would have been hard-pressed to find ayamase on a party menu. Instead you might have found ofada, a dish named after a town in south-western Nigeria close to Lagos, the commercial capital. It consists of unpolished rice and a spicy fried red-pepper beef stew. But now ayamase, the green-pepper rival of ofada, is wherever you find Nigerians, at home or abroad.
Bilikisu Raji, who lives in Ibadan, another big city in the south-west, was taught to ferment iru by her mother-in-law. The iru enterprise is run by women because, she jokes in Yoruba, the men aren’t up to it. She buys the yellow-tinged seeds in the market and boils them for 12 hours in a cauldron. She removes the chaff to reveal black-brown beans, peels them with the balls of her feet, washes them through a sieve, then boils them again. Eventually she dry-roasts them and covers them with a raffia tray to let them ferment overnight. Finally she rubs the iru in salt, then rolls it up in dry leaves, ready to sell. A small wrap weighing 20 grams goes for only 50 naira (an American dime). She survives on the patronage of foreign customers who buy as much as $25-worth at a time to use in ayamase abroad.
Nowadays you can find iru on shelves across the world. Ms Sokoh, who has lived in the Netherlands and Canada, has seen it in shops everywhere. “You find frozen iru, fresh iru, powdered iru, dried iru on the shelves in ways you couldn’t ten years ago,” she says. Suffering from high blood pressure, she steers clear of stock cubes in favour of iru. “There’s definitely a saltiness without being sodium-heavy,” she says.
To non-West Africans, iru is likely to remain a niche ingredient “like fish sauce”, sighs Tunde Wey, a popular Nigerian chef based in New Orleans. He has collaborated with an American company to sell iru in sleek jars, hoping to boost small farmers back home while getting fellow cooks abroad to appreciate its versatility. Whether or not Western foodies catch on to this superbean rich in probiotics, iru is fuelling Nigerian partygoers around the world.",2
1567,"IT IS AN unfortunate fact that the ease of throwing things into a wheelie-bag and travelling far and wide helped spread covid-19 around the world. The effects on leisure travel and destinations that rely on tourism will be felt for years to come. But just as the way we travel may improve as a result, so the chance for countries to rethink tourism industries could turn a bruised and battered industry into a better one.
The pursuit of pleasure using cultural pursuits as cover goes back to the days of the grand tourists, who trawled Europe’s artistic heritage as well as indulging in more hedonistic activities. As souvenirs they returned with paintings, sculptures and sometimes syphilis. Travel was hard and expensive. The earl of Salisbury spent the equivalent of nearly £500,000 today on his grand tour in the 18th century, according to MBNA, a credit-card firm. Even 50 years ago foreign travel was a luxury pursuit. In 1970 a return flight from New York to London cost around $500 (equivalent to $3,500 today).

Lower fares and the rise of the internet have made holidays cheaper and easier to arrange. Airlines, hotel chains, car-hire firms and other businesses have moved online. Dedicated internet travel agents like Expedia and Booking.com have emerged. Online peer-to-peer review sites offer a mostly honest assessment of hotels, restaurants and tourist sites. Airbnb and its competitors have created a new class of accommodation. The frictional costs of travel have fallen sharply.

Such is the stunning growth of tourism that the 72% decline in trips in the first ten months of 2020 on a year earlier merely took international travel back to where it was in 1990. Leisure travel accounts for the biggest slice but the rest contributes too. Business travellers stay in hotels, eat at restaurants and hire cars. Some visits to relatives or friends may be barely distinguishable from a holiday.

Not only are there more trips, but the world is a bigger oyster. In 1950 the top 15 destinations—with America, France, Italy and Spain the most visited—claimed 97% of tourist arrivals. By 2015 that share had dropped to just over half. Europe, with it historic cities, countryside and beaches, still rules, taking just over half of all international travellers. That is twice the share of the Asia-Pacific region, the next most popular area. Europe rakes in the most receipts, around 37% of the global total, worth some $619bn in 2019. France and Spain are the most popular countries for a visit. The top spots may not have changed, but their arrivals have. Chinese visits overseas have grown from just 9m trips in 1999 to 150m in 2018.
Travellers’ preference for richer countries has created large industries. Spain relied on domestic and foreign visitors for 11.8% of GDP in 2019, France 7.4% and Mexico 8.7%. Poorer countries lean even more on tourist dollars. America is the biggest country for travel spending, some $1.8trn in 2019, but overseas visitors have put tourism at the heart of many economies. In Aruba it accounts for nearly three-quarters of GDP; in most other small Caribbean islands it is also the main economic activity. Other poorer countries are less reliant overall but have vast tourist industries. Thailand welcomed around 10m foreign tourists in 2001. By 2019 it had grown fourfold (with a quarter of the total coming from China), bringing in 1.9trn baht ($60bn) and contributing some 18% of GDP.
The emptying of tourist trails and resorts resembling ghost towns is causing massive upheaval. UNCTAD estimated that losses could amount to 2.8% of world output if international arrivals dropped by 66% in 2020. The OECD now reckons that the drop was more like 80%. And the expectation is that international arrivals will probably not recover to pre-covid levels until 2023.
Tourism is a resilient industry. But it faces a downturn like no other. Firms reliant on visitors may not be best placed to survive. According to the WTCC, around 80% of tourist businesses worldwide, from hotels to restaurants to tour guides, are small businesses. Large hotel chains may have the balance-sheets to weather the storm or the management skills to reconfigure their business to cater more to domestic travellers. Small businesses probably lack the cash to invest in equipment for contactless payments or better cleaning and hygiene to reassure returning tourists.
The uncertain path to recovery raises questions over what will remain. The UNWTO reckons that countries with a big share of domestic tourism—America, China and India have the largest home markets—will recover more quickly. Travel restrictions have kept China’s high-rollers at home, giving its fanciest hotels their best year ever. But even domestic tourism is far from a saviour. Britain and Spain, for example, reckon on a decrease in domestic tourism of 45-50% in 2020.
These problems have prompted various responses to keep businesses alive. Some countries such as France, which launched an $18bn bail-out in May, have aimed cash directly at tourist businesses. Others are trying to reassure tourists that their countries are safe by developing protocols and guidelines for tourism workers. Luís Araújo, president of the Portuguese National Tourism Authority, says his organisation has arranged training for 60,000 workers at restaurants, hotels and travel agents to create a safer travel experience. Finland and Greece are among countries with new training programmes aimed at improving the digital presence of tourist businesses.
Some parts of the tourist economy will do better than others. Travel firms have noted a rising preference for self-catering and private accommodation over hotels. Coastal and rural locations, far from crowds, will recover faster than cities. Cyril Ranque of Expedia notes that his customers are more inclined to drive to domestic locations but then to stay longer than before. But these trends, he believes, are “all temporary”.
Waiting for the rebound
The travel bug seems certain to outlast the virus. Its first manifestation may be “revenge tourism” as people get away after a year of lockdowns and quarantines. But some things will change for good. A preoccupation in previous centuries, health and hygiene will re-emerge as central to holiday planning. Guidebooks from Baedeker, a German publisher, were never reticent about warning travellers of the filth they faced in foreign climes even in the early 20th century, bemoaning the “evil sanitary reputation of Naples”. Destinations will continue to boast of their scenery, cuisine and beaches but safety and hygiene will become as important, says Ian Yeoman, a tourism academic at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. This may benefit longer-established destinations, tilting visitors away from poorer countries.
Those countries will not be deliberately trying to avoid tourists, even so. Some remote places have used the hiatus to build a better online presence, says Mr Ranque. He points to other innovations to make travel less of a bother. Flexibility, to cope with last-minute changes of plans, will endure. Late or even last-minute bookings are more common. Josh Belkin of Hotels.com reports that, because people are taking more staycations and travelling by car rather than plane, they are booking hotels later, on average 13 days before a trip rather than the 20 before covid-19.
Many travel companies and airlines have introduced more flexible rebooking policies. Faced by a wave of cancellations as covid-19 took hold, Expedia introduced “one-click cancellation” to deal with all elements from flights and hotels to car hire. Firms that use its platform can deploy new tools to add special offers to listings to encourage last-minute bookers and manage refunds. Gathering real-time data on searches, and sharing them with businesses that relied on information from previous years to set prices, could also lead to a better match between supply and demand and encourage more dynamic pricing. In future, personalised customer data should allow travel firms to recommend holidays in a more focused way.
Covid-19 presents a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to move towards more sustainable and resilient models of tourism development”, says the OECD. “Tourism was seen as unambiguously good 20 years ago...now it’s a double-edged sword,” says Paul Flatters of the Trajectory Partnership. Concerns about the impact of tourism on the environment predate the pandemic. But tourism also broadens awareness of different cultures and environmental issues and helps pay for wildlife conservation, as well as providing employment and economic development.
Many destinations failed to strike a balance between tourist numbers and local sensibilities. Venetians have long protested against vast cruise ships, prompting some firms to drop the city from their itineraries. Venice also plans to impose a levy on all visitors from 2022. Anti-tourist slogans daubed on walls have greeted visitors to Barcelona, which has clamped down on illegal holiday letting (as have Berlin and other places in which holiday lets have replaced rental properties, forcing up prices for residents). Amsterdam is considering a ban on non-residents buying cannabis in its notorious coffee shops, to encourage a better class of tourist. Machu Picchu, where trails were overrun, imposed a pre-covid limit of 5,000 visitors a day. That will be cut to 675 to ensure social distancing.
Covid-19 offers the chance not only to reset tourism to reduce the numbers who spend the least but also to spread them out. Barcelona has run a campaign to encourage people to venture away from the old city. Thailand has a scheme to promote 55 less visited parts of the country. Concentrating on attracting fewer tourists ready to spend more is one way to promote a healthier business. And sustainability may become a more important guide to choices as awareness of climate change and the less welcome effects of tourism grow. Getting the right balance between economic, environmental and social benefits and costs has seen a new emphasis on sustainability. Mexico thinks covid-19 will help with its “Mexico Reborn Sustainable” campaign, which aims in part to create new routes that spread tourist dollars more widely and promote destinations that tap into fast-growing nature tourism.
A dynamic tourism economy depends on the availability of a variety of services, from accommodation and good services to attractions, activities and events. Whether a critical mass of services will remain everywhere is less clear. Less choice and competition, if businesses go bust, may mean higher prices. The rapid growth of tourist economies in recent years suggests they can be rebuilt swiftly. But for all those governments that redesign their tourism strategies to keep down crowds and protect the environment, others may compete by racing to the bottom, using deep discounts to fill hotels and planes. Tourist numbers will recover and continue to grow either way. Greater efforts to manage them carefully should make for a better experience for everyone.■",2
1568,"JUST AS LINES on a summer wheat field reveal ancient walls below, so the architecture of an old city can be glimpsed in the new. The west ends of British cities tend to be swankier than the east, in part because prevailing British winds blew Victorian pollution eastward. Factory owners, preferring not to sit in their own smog, moved upwind.
London lends itself to such analyses because it has long had good maps of bad things. After the Great Fire of 1666, engravers produced an “AN EXACT SVRVEIGH” of the “RVINES OF THE CITY”. Two centuries later Charles Booth sent surveyors out into its streets to note broken windows, barefoot children and “rough Irish”, then colour-coded them (black for “vicious, semi-criminal”, yellow for wealthy). Academics have found considerable agreement between his “Maps Descriptive of London Poverty” and modern patterns of deprivation.

A new study by academics at the London School of Economics exploits another record of misery: the London Bomb Census. After raids, officials would note where bombs fell and the number killed. Overlaying the maps they made on modern gang territories reveals suggestive similarities. The probability of finding a gang is 7% higher in areas that were bombed than those that were not. And with gangs come knives: gang presence in an area increases the likelihood of a knife crime by 22%.
The causal chain has several links. Bombs create dereliction, and hence space for tower blocks. By concentrating people living on benefits, these distil disadvantage, says Tom Kirchmaier, one of the study’s authors. Just one tower block on a council estate correlates with a 15% average annual rise in knife crime.
The moment before a parachute bomb landed in London could be quiet, almost serene. Destruction, Graham Greene wrote, came “drifting quietly down on green silk cords”. Then windows would shatter and walls cave in. The ground itself would “dent”. The blast could be felt half a mile away, Greene noted. The echoes reverberate still.",2
1569,"FRANKFURT, Aug 27 (Reuters) - German genetic testing specialist Qiagen (QIA.DE) is seeing demand for its COVID-19 tests firming up again, leading it to believe that sagging demand in July was temporary, Chief Financial Officer Roland Sackers said on Friday.
The stock extended gains to hit a 21-year high after the comments, trading 2.6% higher at 47.51 euros by 1520 GMT versus a record 61.24 set in 2000.
Qiagen, whose shareholders a year ago rebuffed a takeover bid by life science tools maker Thermo Fisher (TMO.N), had said in July that faster-than-expected uptake of vaccination campaigns weighed on demand for its diagnostics kits, prompting it to cut its full-year guidance.
Sackers told Reuters that demand for tests had taken yet another turn as continued breakthrough infections from the Delta coronavirus variant in some vaccinated people was fuelling test kit demand.
""We are now at a turning point where we realise that a one-off boost is turning into normal business. COVID is becoming an infectious disease that stays with us. Therefore the tests will stay,"" he said.
In July, Qiagen predicted currency-adjusted sales growth of at least 12% in 2021, down from a previous outlook of 18%-20% amid a dip in demand for COVID-19 tests, even though second-quarter non-COVID related business including latent tuberculosis tests surpassed expectations.
""A growing COVID business is an additional upside to our guidance and it looks like we can realise some of that upside,"" Sackers added, when asked about the revised outlook. ""I'm very confident that we'll have a good third quarter.""
Industry executives and health officials have told Reuters that U.S. companies are scrambling to boost production of coronavirus tests as infection cases soar, and schools and employers revive surveillance programmes.  read more 
A spokesperson for Qiagen, which also serves the U.S. market, said it had the capacity to meet growing demand there.
Asked about the prospect of Qiagen becoming a takeover target again, Sackers said he had strong confidence in the group's growth potential but would not rule out any tie-up.
Qiagen could purchase companies worth well over $1 billion but share buybacks were also an option to spend excess cash, he added.",3
1570,"AS THE DELTA variant of covid-19 continues to spread across large parts of the world, the shame is that vaccines are still in such short supply. Worse, they are being hogged by rich countries even though the need elsewhere is so great. For that, blame politics. The triumph, however, is that vaccines exist at all. And for that, praise science.
The sequence of the virus’s genome was made public on January 11th 2020, just one month after a new respiratory illness was first reported in Wuhan, in China. Days later, on January 15th, Moderna, working with America’s National Institutes of Health, had completed the design of the prototype molecule that would comprise its vaccine. Sixty-two days after that, on March 16th, human trials began. Maggie Keenan, a 91-year-old Briton, received the first clinical Pfizer vaccine on December 8th. By comparison, the vaccine against polio in America took 20 years to make the journey from trials to licence.

And yet scientists could do even better. By the beginning of 2021, according to our statistical model of excess deaths, the pandemic had claimed between 4m and 8m lives. If mass vaccination had got under way even a bit sooner and scaled up just a little more quickly, hundreds of thousands of people could have been saved. That is a goal worth striving for in the next pandemic—and, recent research suggests, it is entirely possible.
The foundation for this is decades of scientific and medical research. Katalin Karikó, one of the pioneers of the mRNA technology that underpins the two most successful vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna, spent 30 years studying how mRNA can help fight disease. Her research was often too radical to attract government grants or institutional support. But it is part of a body of work that vastly enlarges the scope to cope with infectious diseases, including those that are new.
As we explain this week, the pandemic has seen a new set of biochemical and computational tools come to the fore in predicting the evolution of viruses. One approach is called “deep mutational scanning”, which observes random changes in a pathogen’s crucial proteins under laboratory conditions. Using machine learning, scientists can form predictions about which combinations of these mutations will, for instance, make the disease spread faster and hence come to dominate a pandemic in much the way that Delta is dominating covid-19.
Armed with these predictions, manufacturers could prepare stockpiles of vaccines and therapies before pathogens have mutated and spread. One day, people could even be vaccinated pre-emptively. Such a degree of preparedness, and the rapid deployment of doses that it will make possible, could save many lives.
The same faster-is-better logic also applies to other areas of pandemic response. Testing and contact-tracing ought to be available as soon as the first signs emerge that a pathogen is going global. The pandemic has shown that large centralised testing facilities, while they are quick to get up and running from scratch, have slower turnaround times than smaller, more local facilities which can process samples on site.
Such facilities ought to be ready for the next pandemic, relying on rapid, purpose-built genetic testing that has only just started to come online in airports around the world. By the time the next pathogen arrives, the same technology which allows the covid-19 testing centre in Berlin’s new Brandenburg airport to turn around a sample in less than an hour should be widely available.
Regulators must also play their part. Health authorities are already grappling with the modular nature of the new vaccine-production systems, streamlining their approval processes so that shots may be updated to confer protection against the coronavirus variants. The new vaccine “platforms” can churn out one vaccine as easily as another, with only minor changes. The authorities should start thinking about how to ensure the safety of platform-produced vaccines against entirely new pathogens without having to start the approval process from scratch each time.
There is no knowing when the next pandemic will come. New pathogens are emerging from complex, unpredictable environments all the time, often far from scrutiny or regulatory control. A fresh disease could be about to take off right now, as a freak bacterium escapes from an antibiotic-abusing factory farm, say, or a mutated virus sweeps out of a laboratory or a forest, as a bat passes it on to a new host which can infect humans. You cannot stop all pandemics, but you can prepare for them better. ■

1571,"IN THE SPRING of 2019 micro-fractures were found in the cast-iron pedestals of Hammersmith Bridge in west London—one of more than 40 Thames river crossings in the capital. It has been closed to cars and buses ever since. That has knock-on effects on the neighbouring Chiswick and Putney bridges, as the 20,000-odd vehicles that used to cross Hammersmith Bridge each day seek other routes.
Cockneys have long joked that north and south London are separate cities, and increasingly they are. Last year Vauxhall and London bridges were closed to car traffic in order to allow repairs. Tower Bridge has closed twice in the past year because its drawbridge was jammed open. Battersea, Kew, Lambeth and Twickenham bridges are expected to need expensive repairs within a decade.

Many of the bridges are old: Hammersmith’s opened in 1887. But they would be in better nick if they had been properly maintained. A report published on November 4th by the London Assembly’s transport committee put the blame on the lack of any single authority responsible for keeping London’s bridges functioning. Dozens of agencies, boroughs and departments share responsibility for their upkeep. As each tries to hand off the burden to others, a maintenance backlog of £241m ($326m) has built up.
Hammersmith and Fulham, the borough north of Hammersmith Bridge, has been responsible for its maintenance since 1985. Even before covid-19 gutted its reserves, it would have struggled to find the £140m or more needed to repair the bridge sufficiently to reopen it to cars and buses (an alternative plan to build a temporary truss and repair the bridge off-site might lower the cost—and be quicker). Nor does it feel much compulsion to do so. Its residents use the bridge less than people living in Richmond upon Thames to the south, says Sarah Olney, the local MP.
The national Department of Transport and Transport for London (TfL) have agreed to split the cost of repairs with the borough in equal parts. But TfL also has a huge budget shortfall, caused by a slump in the use of public transport. The Conservative government in Westminster is more focused on building up infrastructure in northern England, where many of its new voters live, than on repairing a crumbling bridge in an affluent part of London. It might not help that Ms Olney is a Liberal Democrat. In 2019 her predecessor, Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative, claimed that he could get the bridge open if he was re-elected—though that boast was never tested.
A solution is possible. Some of London’s transport authorities already work together informally to ensure that maintenance work does not gum up traffic entirely. The London Assembly’s transport committee recommends formalising that co-operation, and giving the resulting group a budget to take over the repair of bridges. TfL seems open to the idea. But even if this solution is adopted, it could be too late for Hammersmith Bridge.
Build it up with iron bars
Locals fear that the government-led task force meant to be co-ordinating repairs is waiting out the frustration, and that the bridge will never reopen to heavy vehicles. Some have already changed their travel habits. Fabrice Guillon, who owns a café down the street from Hammersmith Bridge, used to drive in every day from Kensington. He has switched to biking. Others have added 15 minutes to their commute, as they walk instead of taking the bus over the bridge to the closest Tube stop, in Hammersmith and Fulham. Older, frailer people must drive over another bridge. Efforts have been made to bring in pedicabs to help. But these too, have been held up by buck-passing and red tape.■",2
1572,"AMID THE dust and sagebrush of New Mexico there are 61 rigs at work. The south-eastern part of the state, which sits over the shales of the Permian basin that spans the border with Texas, has over the past decade attracted shale-oil specialists, oil majors like ExxonMobil and innumerable camp followers fixing pumps, selling pipe and hauling the sand used to fracture the underground strata. About 40,000 people in the state now work in the sector; the taxes it generates pay for a third of the state’s budget; and it accounts for about 1% of America’s greenhouse-gas emissions.
President Joe Biden’s announcement in January of a temporary moratorium on new leases allowing drilling on federal land has not gone down well in this bit of the Permian; New Mexico accounts for more than half of such onshore oil production. The American Petroleum Institute (API), the industry’s main lobby, contends that the moratorium could cost the state 62,000 jobs. But for all the importance oil has in its economy, even New Mexico is preparing for a new energy era.

The Democratic governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, wants her state’s emissions in 2030 to be at least 45% below their level in 2005, which given the recent oil boom means about 60% less than what they were in 2018. Across the state solar farms are being set up to harness the abundant sunshine and charging points provided for electric cars—just the sort of initiatives Mr Biden is seeking to accelerate as he aims to turn the American economy away from fossil fuels once and for all.
In January the president signed an executive order calling for the country to reduce its net greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by 2050, and to that end he wants the electricity sector to be emissions-free by 2035. Angelica Rubio, a New Mexico state representative who has relatives working on oil and gas projects in the Permian basin, acknowledges local resistance to Mr Biden’s decarbonisation goals. “It is drastic,” she says. “But this is the road map we need to take.” She is sponsoring a bill in the state legislature to ease the transition for oil workers.
Any encouragement from within the shale patch will be welcome to Mr Biden’s team, which needs all the help it can get. In Europe, as in China, politicians are using industrial policy, regulations, carbon prices and other tools to lessen the risks associated with climate change and secure their place in a global clean-energy economy; some have got a fair way already (see article). But despite having played a key role in the negotiations which produced the Paris agreement in 2015—an agreement that it is rejoining on February 19th—America has to date offered no comprehensive outline of the goals and strategies it will use to tackle greenhouse-gas emissions which, in 2019, were equivalent to 5.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide (see chart 1). Those emissions declined in 2020 by a staggering 9%, according to estimates from BloombergNEF, a data provider. But as the economy recovers they will bounce back quickly.

The lack of an ambitious national programme is largely down to the fact that America’s Republican Party couples political power with a climate nihilism to an almost unparalleled extent. Donald Trump called climate change a hoax and withdrew from the Paris agreement; his administration put significant effort into trying to roll back the regulations with which his predecessor, Barack Obama, had tried to lower emissions. That they are subject to such reversals is one of the reasons that executive orders and regulatory stances are a poor substitute for thoroughgoing legislation. But Mr Obama had little choice. The vast majority of Republicans elected to federal office reject policies to cut emissions, which is why Congress has not seriously confronted the issue for more than a decade. The power of Republicans in the Senate made it pointless.
The problem is made worse by the fact that some conservative Democrats have their own reservations. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, says that he supports climate action. But he rejects the idea that coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, might be permanently removed from the world’s energy portfolio: “Get into reality,” he says. “It’s not going to be eliminated.” The fact that the Senate is split 50-50 between the parties means that, even with Vice-President Kamala Harris’s casting vote, Mr Manchin in effect has a veto over legislation.
Should such obstacles lead to America punting for another decade, it will pay for the privilege. Delaying to 2030 would make the transition to a net-zero emissions economy almost twice as expensive as it would be if started today, with costs soaring to $750bn a year by 2035 and more than $900bn a year by the early 2040s, according to Energy Innovation, a policy group. But today’s urgency comes from greater concerns than fiscal prudence. America’s emissions are not only a problem for the climate in and of themselves. They are also a check on its opportunities to influence the rest of the world’s emissions, which copiously outweigh its own.
A decisive American effort to reduce emissions would be a potent signal of solidarity and a great enabler of change. It is unlikely that poor- and middle-income countries, eager to lift their citizens out of poverty, will try hard to curb their emissions if the world’s richest nation declines to limit its own, which are among the world’s largest per person. A vibrant American programme would also guarantee levels of innovation devoted to the fight for a stable climate that easily exceed today’s. America’s wealth, national laboratories, universities, corporate giants and entrepreneurs, if properly harnessed to the task of decarbonisation, will undoubtedly produce novel approaches and technologies that would benefit other nations.
And it would be a licence to persuade, shame and, where appropriate, bully. Mr Biden has charged John Kerry, who when secretary of state was an important player in the Paris negotiations, with leading efforts on climate change abroad (see Lexington). If he cannot point to progress at home, Mr Kerry’s job will be an unprofitable and thankless one.
Running down a dream
But providing Mr Kerry with compelling backup is a tall order. In December researchers at Princeton University published a sweeping report to show how American emissions might by 2050 be reduced to “net zero”—a state where the amount of greenhouse gas still being dumped into the atmosphere is no greater than the amount deliberately being taken out of it and sequestered in some form. Though the study outlined various paths to that goal, all of them shared the basic foundation of an electricity sector rapidly both decarbonised and enlarged.
Over the past decade America’s electricity industry has become significantly less carbon-intensive despite meagre federal action. This has mainly been down to the replacement of coal by natural gas; coal, which provided 45% of the electricity generated in 2010, provided just 19% in 2020. But truly clean energy has been on the rise too. Though no new nuclear-power plants have been built and brought online, annual installations of wind and solar have rocketed as states have imposed mandates which require a certain amount of renewable or emissions-free generating capacity—mandates which, with the capital costs of renewables tumbling and interest rates low, have not been irksome to meet. In 2010, according to BloombergNEF, America had 42.6GW of wind and solar capacity. Last year it had 213.2GW, about five times as much, with 33.6GW added in 2020 alone.

But this progress is mere prologue to what must come in the 2020s. “The pace we are talking about is much faster than what has been done historically,” says Eric Larson, who led the Princeton study. In one scenario, wind and solar capacity would need to expand each year through 2025 by about 40GW before hitting 70-75 GW a year in 2026-30—more than double last year’s record rate (see chart 2). If those targets are met, the Princeton researchers reckon, by 2030 wind and solar farms could be providing about half of America’s electricity, up from 9% in 2019.
One of the reasons for dealing with electricity first is that it opens up possibilities in other sectors. A grid powered by abundant clean energy allows emissions from cars, light vans, trains and buildings to be slashed as they turn to electricity for more and more of their energy needs.


Turbines in America’s endless skyways and panels across her diamond deserts are no use if the power cannot get to the people. Lots of clean power means lots of new transmission lines, too—in one scenario, Princeton estimates that high-voltage transmission capacity would need to jump by 60% over the course of the coming decade. It adds up to a big bill. Mr Larson and his colleagues estimate that setting America on a path to net zero will require at least $2.5trn of additional capital investment over the present decade. And that spending requires careful planning, with enough spare power capacity to deal with extreme weather.
The blackouts which hit Texas in this week’s catastrophic cold snap are a case in point (see article). The problem was not primarily one of renewables failing in the freezing conditions, as some have suggested; many gas-fired plants failed, as did one nuclear reactor. But this does not mean that a grid dominated by renewables would necessarily have done better. Jesse Jenkins, one of the authors of the Princeton study, says the outages show both that America needs interconnections that can transmit large amounts of power over long distances and that “firm” generating capacity—be it in the form of thermal plants powered by biomass, natural-gas plants from which the carbon-dioxide emissions are sequestered, nuclear plants, hydrogen or even geothermal generation—needs to be really reliable.
By 2050 the expansion of transmission and renewables would be truly prodigious (see map). At that point onshore wind and solar farms would span some 600,000 square kilometres, an expanse slightly smaller than two New Mexicos but slightly larger than Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois combined. And even that is not, in itself, enough. Research must ramp up, too, to explore the best mix of ways to provide the firm capacity such a grid will need.
E pluribus unum
And even if all electricity were carbon-free and all the country’s cars, light-duty trucks, trains and buildings used nothing else, almost half of America’s emissions would still need to be tackled. Dealing with aircraft, shipping and farms is much harder. Many firms have committed themselves to reducing or eliminating emissions; but it will be harder to do so in heavy industries such as cement or steel. In those areas change requires either entirely new technology or technologies not yet deployed at a remotely appropriate scale.
This is not the level of change states alone could bring about, even if all of them were trying their hardest. States cannot on their own drive the car industry and its customers away from internal-combustion engines, or deal with the requirement for emissions-free steel, cement, shipping and aircraft. They cannot foot the bill for the $35bn a year on clean-energy research that Bill Gates, a philanthropist, calls for in a new book (see Books and arts). As revenues have plunged during the covid-19 pandemic, some states may struggle to supply even basic services; transforming whole swathes of industry is someone else’s job.
Enter Mr Biden. His executive order setting the 2050 goal signalled his intentions to push hard on climate; his moratorium on new leases and his revoking of the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada’s oil sands showed he was willing to upset people doing so.
There is a lot he can do simply through forceful leadership and better management of various obscure agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees wholesale power markets, can do a great deal to ease the endlessly fractious construction of transmission lines and support states’ efforts to deploy clean electricity. New York’s plans to develop a whopping 9GW of wind power off the southern shores of Long Island were held up by Mr Trump’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Mr Biden has hired Amanda Lefton, previously New York’s assistant energy secretary, to run the bureau, so that will probably change.
Mr Biden can also try and use his powers under the Clean Air Act to accelerate the shift toward low- and zero-emission cars. GM, a giant carmaker, in January announced that it would offer only electric cars by 2035; the prospect for ever stricter regulations on carbon-emitting cars may lead its peers to follow suit. The Securities and Exchange Commission may push companies to disclose climate risks, thus making things easier for the increasing number of investors and asset managers who care about such things. The federal government’s nearly $600bn in annual procurement can be used to create a huge market for new clean technologies.
There are limits, however, to pursuing green policy through the executive branch. Mr Biden risks litigation and review before a conservative Supreme Court that is more sceptical of environmental rules. And even executive orders that avoid legal action remain vulnerable, as first Mr Obama and then Mr Trump have found. These are all strong reasons for Mr Biden to give his programme the buttress of legislation. But in truth, the fact that Congress controls spending is probably enough; a fair amount of the money needed is going to have to come from the public purse.
The most likely vehicle for action is an infrastructure bill which may come later this year. Such a bill might include charging stations for electric cars, support for transmission and investment infrastructure resilient to rising seas. It could also include money not just for basic energy innovation, but for large demonstration projects. Either as part of that bill or separately, Mr Biden would like to create a national clean-electricity standard that could provide zero-emissions power by 2035, mimicking states’ preference for such targets over broader carbon-pricing approaches. Such a clean-electricity standard would force utilities to decarbonise more quickly.
The power to employ
Central to Mr Biden’s pitch for such a package is the idea that a green transition will create employment. “Climate change at its heart is not a planetary problem,” argues Gina McCarthy, his national climate adviser. “It’s a people problem.” Building new industries is always appealing to politicians who want voters to have good jobs; updating a great nation’s ageing infrastructure could serve the same end. “If we can show that we are growing jobs and that those jobs are good union jobs,” argues Ms McCarthy, “then we’re going to be able to convince the middle of this country.”
The size of any surge in American clean-energy manufacturing should not be overestimated. America is late to the game; industrial policy has already made China the world’s dominant producer of solar panels and batteries, and that is unlikely to change. “The United States needs to be clear-eyed about where it will be very hard for us to gain a competitive advantage at this point,” says Kelly Sims Gallagher a professor at Tufts University and a former adviser to Mr Obama.
However, she allows that still-nascent, complex technologies such as hydrogen fuel-cells or carbon capture might be possible areas for American differentiation. And the scale of the endeavour matters in itself. If America were to ramp up the deployment of wind and solar as the Princeton team suggests, America’s manufacturing jobs for wind would increase by five to tenfold to 2030 and for solar by about tenfold—even if the share of imported components remained the same. Workers would also set about installing wind farms, heat pumps and power lines, to name a few, as well as operating and maintaining them.
Jobs in mining and drilling would decline; those in construction would climb. Princeton estimates that energy’s share of employment in 2050 would stay level or rise in most states, with Louisiana, North Dakota and Wyoming notable exceptions. In New Mexico, it would climb from 6% to 10%. In West Virginia, it would inch up from 5% to 6%, as jobs lost in coal were replaced by those in clean power.
Silly games
But that may not be enough to placate Mr Manchin. He is a staunch supporter of his home state’s coal miners, who have a symbolic heft that outweighs their economic clout. “We need to innovate our way through this,” he asserts, rather than close down industries. He has backed bills to support energy innovation but has so far declined to throw his weight behind a clean-energy standard, noting that renewables are being built quickly already so may not need such support. “Out west, people quit basically raising cows and started raising windmills,” he quips.
With Mr Manchin crucial to any attempt to pass a bill purely on the basis of Democratic votes, this might seem to take sweeping legislation off the table. But Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator for Rhode Island and perhaps the chamber’s most reliable climate advocate, says he is newly hopeful that eight or so Senate Republicans may emerge from their self-imposed exile from the cause. Two-thirds of Americans believe that Washington is doing too little to fight climate change. In January America’s Chamber of Commerce—“probably our worst and most implacable adversary”, Mr Whitehouse says—voiced support for “durable climate policy” from Congress that supports investment and includes “well designed market mechanisms”. Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is urging businesses to align their strategies with a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. A growing number of companies are tired of climate rules that ping pong from one presidency to the next. “We prefer legislation over regulation,” says Ben Fowke, the chief executive of Xcel Energy, a big utility. “It’s not as subject to change.”

Mr Whitehouse contends that the shift in corporate attitudes may give Republicans cover to support some kinds of climate policy, at least. The fossil-fuel lobby has not gone away. Mike Sommers, who leads API, says he and his colleagues speak with lawmakers daily to explain “what our energy needs are and what they are going to be.” That includes a robust future for both American oil and gas, he argues. But Mr Whitehouse says that “there is a very significant chance that the blockade that the fossil-fuel industry perpetrated over the last decade can actually be broken by the rest of corporate America.” Indeed in December Congress passed a bill that included an extension of clean-energy tax credits and $35bn in support for energy research over the next decade—hardly an investment on Mr Gates’s preferred scale, but at least a faint glimmer of bipartisanship.
In most 50-50 legislatures the prospect of even a few members of the other side coming over to your point of view would be enough. The Senate is different. Its filibuster rules require 60 votes in order to bring a motion to the floor, meaning that just 41 of the 50 Republicans can block almost any piece of legislation. In principle, the 50 Democratic senators could, with the help of the vice-president’s casting vote, end this filibuster rule. But Mr Manchin says it will be eliminated “over my dead body.”
The eye of the needle
That leaves Mr Biden with limited options. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic lawmakers who are favourites among the party’s left, want to declare climate change a national emergency. That would allow Mr Biden to redirect military funds to boost clean energy; again, though, it would have to pass the Senate.
More likely, Democrats will use their 50 votes in the Senate in a process known as budget reconciliation that allows spending and tax measures to pass with a simple majority. Such a bill could approve investments and tax credits to deal with climate change. Some argue that a clean-energy standard might, if properly designed, squeak through too. Along with a White House that tightens emissions-standards for cars and streamlines permitting for new projects, that would count as progress. America would connect more clean power to better grids. Additional money could be funnelled towards research. More electric cars would take to the roads.
The question is whether Democrats are able to advance a bill that complies with Senate rules, satisfies both Mr Manchin and Mr Sanders, and is remotely commensurate with the problem at hand. “In the short run we can make a hell of a lot of progress through 2030,” argues Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defence Fund, a non-profit. But emissions neutrality, he says, would eventually require Congress to pass an economy-wide carbon price, too.
Were it not for its politics, America would be as well positioned to decarbonise as any country in the world, argues Stephen Pacala, who led a climate study recently published by America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The country benefits from wide plains and long coasts for wind power, ample sunshine for solar farms across the South, rich forests to act as carbon sinks, expanses of land for producing new energy crops and well-understood reservoirs where emissions might be stored. It has magnificent human resources, too, and a history of rising to challenges, even if it sometimes needs a wake-up call to do so.
For now, Ms Rubio is trying to advance her bill to aid New Mexico’s transition from oil and gas. A port in south Brooklyn awaits transformation into a hub for wind companies. Congress is consumed by debates over covid-19 relief. And still the world’s emissions are set to rise. ■
Correction (February 18th): An earlier version of this piece said that America emitted 5.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2018, rather than 2019. Sorry.

1573,"Migrants have been filmed cheering and clapping as they launched dinghies off the coast of France to cross the English Channel as French police officers stood by and filmed the scenes.
Video footage taken on Tuesday - the same day that a staggering 1,000 migrants made it to the UK - showed groups of migrants, including young children, clapping in celebration as they managed to restart their boat's engine on a Calais beach.
In the clip, taken by local jogger Franck Viandier, dozens of migrants crowded around the small boat and helped to push it into the water while children clapped and cheered with excitement as they prepared to cross the Channel.
Other footage obtained by ITV News showed dozens of migrants wearing life jackets carrying a small dinghy down to the sea while French Gendarmerie officers stood by on the shore and watched.
Some officers appeared to be holding up their phones and filming the scenes, while others stood by and did not intervene as the migrants prepared to launch a boat, heading for the UK. 
On Tuesday, MailOnline journalists witnessed two 50ft long boats, setting off from the beaches near Wimereux, around 20 mile south of Calais. No police were on the beach at the time - but turned up some 24 hours later.  
Today, the RNLI rescued 23 migrants before around 50 more arrived in Kent. More people are expected to make the dangerous 21-mile trip across the Dover Strait throughout the day as weather is said to be good in the Channel.
A lifeboat was scrambled this morning to rescue people from a boat in the Channel, with one migrant airlifted to hospital after suffering a suspected medical episode while attempting the crossing. The man, who was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, is believed to be okay. 
Mr Viandier, who jogs along a Calais beach every morning, said he believes the Gendarmerie officers are doing their best amid the migrant crisis, saying that it is not 'their job' to fight migrants if they want to cross to England.
He told ITV News: 'Sometimes there is a lot of police, I can see the fight sometimes. But they say to me 'it is not our job to fight with these people, the people want to go to England, we are French police'.'
France claims that it deploys 950 officers in the Calais region each day in a bid to prevent illegal Channel crossings. 
Migrants launch their boats from France along a 100mile stretch of beach, making it harder for authorities to stop them from crossing the Channel. Out of 40,000 crossings this year, only around half were stopped, according to official figures.
Meanwhile, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said the UK's offer to set up joint patrols with the French was rebuffed.
He added: 'We constantly discuss operational options with the French, we have offered to conduct joint patrols. It's not an offer that the French have currently taken us up on, but it continues to be on the table.' 
Official figures are yet to be released but it is feared that Tuesday's total could rival the 1,185 record reached last Thursday as the migrant crisis reaches breaking point. The figures have taken some two days to calculate due to the sheer number of arrivals.
The previous daily high was 853. At least 3,941 migrants have arrived this month in 121 boats, taking the total for the year so far to 23,683.
This morning, an RNLI Dover lifeboat was launched just after 5.30am at the request of the UK Coastguard following reports of a grey dinghy in distress. 
A number of 999 calls were made to the rescue centre requesting assistance with reports that a man onboard required medical attention. 
Lifeboat crew reported there were 23 other people on the 6-foot grey rib that was caught out in rough seas. A rescue and recovery operation was launched with a helicopter seen airlifting a person to hospital.  
A spokesman for the Coastgaurd confirmed: 'HM Coastguard has been coordinating a search and rescue response to an incident off Kent, working with Border Force and other partners. We sent the coastguard helicopter from Lydd and Dover RNLI lifeboat.' 
Meanwhile, the Home Office also confirmed that 66 migrants made the perilous Channel crossing in three boats on Wednesday. French authorities stopped a further 43 in three small boats.
It comes after it was reported that Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
However, No 10 said it would not comment on conversations with specific countries over the processing of migrants who arrive in the UK. 
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'I've always been clear that we want to keep all options on the table.
'As illegal migration is an international issue, you'd expect us to have discussions with both France and other international partners to help reduce illegal migration.'
He added the UK had been in talks with a 'number of countries' but added: 'I'm simply saying I'm not going to get into speculation about ongoing discussions with individually named countries.
'As you'd expect given the international elements of this, it is right the Government speaks to a number of countries about these global challenges.'
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project could cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
Ten migrants have been found dead in an overcrowded wooden boat trying to cross the Mediterranean.
The ramshackle boat, which was packed with around 100 refugees, was found by the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) team, drifting 30 nautical miles away from the coast of Libya, where it departed. 
Dozens of survivors were rescued by the MSF team, and are now on the Geo Barents rescue vessel.
Those on board revealed there was a powerful smell of fuel in the boat and victims had spent more than 13 hours crammed in the lower deck. 
So far this year, around 1,225 migrants have died or gone missing while trying to make the perilous crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean. 
Caroline Willemen, project coordinator on the Geo Barents, described the Mediterranean as the 'deadliest migration route'.
'We are once more witnessing Europe's unwillingness to provide the much needed dedicated and proactive search and rescue capacity in the Central Mediterranean' she added.
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday.  
Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said: 'We are facing a global migration crisis and the number of people arriving on UK shores is unacceptable.
'We must work closely with our European and international partners to target the ruthless organised criminal gangs behind these deadly crossing and welcome the French Government's commitment to step up action to prevent crossings, including increased surveillance, greater intelligence sharing and deployment of frontline operations
'The New Plan for Immigration will fix the broken system, break the deadly business model of the people smugglers and prevent further loss of life.' 
Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has confirmed that the Government is looking at processing migrants who cross the Channel in small boats overseas.
He told LBC Radio: 'First of all, you're always better off dealing with the flow of migrants from a crisis or a conflict in the region itself, our overwhelming focus is on that. It's better for migrants, it's better to be resettled and relocated nearer to your home.
'But to the extent that we get this flow over to the UK, it's important to reduce the pull factor, we will work with all our partners - and it's not just one country, we've looked at the Australian experience, we've been talking with the Danes about this and we want to make sure the processing, if it's possible - and that will depend on the good will and co-operation of partners - can be done elsewhere.'
Asked if this will include Albania and Rwanda, he said: 'Let me avoid talking about individual countries but just say with international partners this is something we're probing because we want to test the idea because we will do everything we can to resolve this problem.'
Pressed if the plan will cost £100,000 per migrant, he said: 'I don't recognise that number. Until you've got a detailed agreement with a particular country, I don't think we'll be in a position to cost it.'
Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal that migrants evicted from their squalid Dunkirk camp by French police have set up a new encampment in a field next door.
Others have erected their tents in woods less than half a mile away from their demolished camp to keep alive their dream of finding a place on a boat to the UK.
The crowded camp on an area of abandoned industrial land and was home to 1,500 migrants until it was closed down by police at Grand-Synthe near Dunkirk.
Residents of the camp were given the option of being taken by coach to shelters across France in return for going through the French process for asylum seekers.
But most of them chose to continue living rough and refused to accept the offer out of fears that it would hinder their long term aim to reach the UK. 
Small groups of migrants today returned to their old camp and broke through the fences erected by police in a half-hearted bid to seal off the entrance.
MailOnline today witnessed pitiful scenes as former camp residents rummaged through stinking piles or rubbish left behind after the mass eviction. 
Migrants piled up old clothing, bedding, tents and pots and pans into supermarket trolleys which they wheeled away to their new camps.
Others chopped up pallets and other construction material from flattened makeshift shelters to get fuel for their camp fires.
Many of the migrants including families with children had only a short distance to travel to their new home in the field next door to their old camp.
They included Iraqi Kurdish mother Kazhal Rzgar, 46, and her two daughters Hadya, 22, and Hasta, seven, and her and her two sons who put up their old tent in a corner of the field.
The family have been surviving largely on food hand outs from charities since they arrived 16 days ago at the Grand-Synthe camp after landing in Italy on a migrant boat.
Channel migrants are set to be flown to ALBANIA to a new asylum centre at cost of £100,000-a-head a year as French deny agreeing to stop all crossings 
Channel migrants who reach Britain could be fast-tracked to an off-shore processing centre in Albania, it was reported last night.
Ministers are discussing opening an asylum centre in the eastern European country, which they believe would act as a deterrent for migrants crossing from northern France.
Anyone seeking asylum in Britain after arriving by illegal routes, such as in dinghies and small boats, would be flown out to the new centre within seven days, the Times said.
However, the project would cost the British taxpayer £100,000 per migrant for flights and accommodation.
'Off shore processing is our best hope now, as nothing else is working,' an unnamed minister told the newspaper.
Earlier reports of plans for offshore processing centres including using disused oil rigs in the North Sea - which were mooted last year - ultimately proved fruitless.
But the likelihood of sealing a deal with Tirana were now 'looking good', a UK government source said, despite Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka rubbishing the idea just last month.
The latest development in the migrant crisis comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed earlier this week to stop '100 per cent' of Channel crossings from France. 
But her claim that she had agreed the plan with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin was then contradicted by Paris yesterday. 
On Tuesday, around 80 migrants were pictured climbing into inflatable dinghies in northern France before they were pushed into the sea and began their journey to Britain. 
A total of 1,185 people crossed the channel last Thursday, eclipsing the previous daily high of 853. Overall this year, there have been more than 20,000 crossings.
In response to news about the plan to open an asylum centre in Albania, a Home Office spokesman said: 'Migrants making these dangerous crossings are putting their lives at risk and it is vital we do everything we can to prevent them and break the business model of the criminal gangs exploiting people.
Migrants who have been picked up after landing or intercepted at sea are taken to a Border Force processing centre, such as Tug Haven near Dover. 
Here arrivals are triaged to identify any medical needs or vulnerabilities, fed and checked to see if they have a criminal record. Adults have an initial interview before being sent to accommodation centres across Britain, paid for by UK taxpayers and provided by private contractors. 
The migrants are given £37.75 per week for essentials like food, clothes and toiletries while they wait for a decision on their asylum application. If the claim is rejected they face deportation back to their home country. 
Kent County Council normally takes unaccompanied children into its care, although other local authorities are also involved in this programme. 
'People should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and as part of our response it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the channel and work with international partners to put an end to these dangerous journeys.'
When the plans were first reported by The Sun last month, the Albanian prime minister's official spokesman branded the reports as 'absolutely untrue'.   
The news comes after it was suggested in March that asylum seekers who cross the Channel illegally to reach Britain could be sent to a third country such as Turkey. 
Other options on the table were islands off the coast of Scotland, the Isle of Man, or Gibraltar. 
At the time, charities branded the proposals 'inhumane', while an immigration expert said that whilst there was no law prohibiting such a move, there was 'bound to be a court case about it'. 
On Wednesday, new research from the British Refugee Council revealed that nearly two thirds of migrants who cross the Channel to reach the UK are originally from the Middle East.    
More than 61 per cent of those who make the dangerous journey across the 21 mile straight Calais to Dover are nationals from countries such as Iran and Iraq.
The highest number of migrants arriving in small boats are from Iran, with 3,187 Iranian nationals reaching UK shores from January last year to May this year. 
This accounts for 26 per cent of all arrivals in small boats over this period.
Figures also show 2,185 people from Iraq crossed the Channel over the same period. 
The figure makes up around 17 per cent of the 12,195 migrants who arrived in the UK in small boats in 2020 and at the start of this year.
Other Middle Eastern nationalities in the top 10 countries of people who arrived in small boats include war-torn nations such as Syria and Yemen, along with oil rich Kuwait.  
From non-Middle Eastern countries, the largest number of arrivals came from Sudan, in north-east Africa. Around eight per cent of small boat arrivals were from Vietnam, while around six per cent of people arrived from Eritrea and one per cent from Ethiopia.
All of the nations in the top 10, which make up 91 per cent of arrivals on UK shores, are countries were human rights abuses and persecution are common, according to the British Refugee Council. 
According to figures obtained by the British Refugee council, migrants arriving in the UK in small boats between January 2020 and May 2021 were from: 
Iran: 26 per cent
Iraq 17 per cent
Sudan 11 per cent
Syria: 10 per cent
Vietnam 8 per cent
Eritrea: 6 per cent
Afghanistan 5 per cent
Kuwait 5 per cent
Yemen 2 per cent
Ethiopia 1 per cent
Other: 9 per cent  

The research came after MailOnline journalists witnessed the moment that two 50ft long inflatable dinghies loaded with up to 40 migrants each leave northern France on Tuesday morning. 
At dawn. dog walkers and a jogger watched in amazement as the two separate groups, who had been hiding overnight in the sand dunes, ran to the water's edge with their giant boats.
Smuggler minders waded in to the sea as the migrants climbed aboard for the dangerous trip to Britain but they did not make the journey with them.  
Despite the ongoing crossings and the lack of progress in stopping them, Ms Patel had claimed she had agreed with French interior minister Gerald Darmanin agreed to work to prevent '100 per cent of crossings' of the Channel.   
The Home Office issued a joint statement from the pair which said they had agreed measures to 'stop the dangerous crossings' of the 'deadly route'.
But the French embassy in London said the 100% figure 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin held talks on Monday night with the UK and France involved in a long-running row over how to address the problem of migrants seeking to cross the Channel.
The 'joint statement' issued afterwards said: 'Both the Home Secretary and interior minister agreed to strengthen operational cooperation further.
'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings.
'They agreed to accelerate the delivery of the commitments made in the joint agreement of July 2021 to deliver on their joint determination to prevent 100% of crossings and make this deadly route unviable.'
But the French embassy said on Twitter: 'For the record, the 100% figure was not agreed between the Home Secretary and French interior minister @GDarmanin and should not be presented as an agreed commitment: it is not.
'And it is not part of the joint statement.'
However, in a press conference on October 9, Mr Darmanin said that with the correct resources and the support of the British authorities, 100 per cent should be able to be reached.",-2
1574,"ENRIQUE, A LAWYER (not his real name), worked for the authorities in El Salvador for over a decade, going from advising a local council to being employed in the transport ministry. Despite his misgivings about graft in politics, he worked with the two parties that have dominated the country since the end of the civil war in 1992. But shortly after Nayib Bukele, the president, came to power in 2019, he went back to private practice. “This government is worse—it attacks anyone who doesn’t take its position and abuses of power go unchecked,” he says. “There is no rule of law.”
Mr Bukele, a 40-year-old populist, is threatening the fragile democracy that was built up in El Salvador over 30 years of peace. Shortly after coming to power he entered the legislature with armed soldiers to force lawmakers to vote for a loan to buy equipment for the police and military. In May the Congress, which Mr Bukele’s party now controls, dismissed the attorney-general and all five members of the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court, replacing them with cronies. In June he did away with CICIES, an anti-corruption body. He expelled a journalist for El Faro, a digital-news publication, from the country and proposed sweeping changes to the constitution, including one that would extend the president’s term by a year.

El Salvador is a striking example of democratic regression. In last year’s democracy index compiled by the EIU, a sister company of The Economist, it was demoted from “flawed democracy” to “hybrid regime”, meaning semi-authoritarian. Its neighbours are troubled, too. Although Latin America generally became more democratic in the 1980s and has held up reasonably well over the past few years (with notable exceptions, such as Venezuela), Central America has not. In four of its seven countries—El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, collectively known as the “Northern Triangle”, and Nicaragua—the systems are buckling. That matters for those who live there, but it also affects the United States.
Each Central American country differs from the others and has its own unique problems. Yet all have certain things in common. They have long been dominated by small yet powerful political and economic elites that do not necessarily favour democracy. Institutions are young, weak or politically charged. Economies tend to work best for those at the top. Corruption is depressingly common.
Poor governance has led to insecurity, economic stagnation and shoddy public services. Institutions that ought to uphold the rule of law, such as the courts and UN-backed bodies, have been co-opted or dismantled, allowing corruption to increase. The pandemic has added to these problems. The region “fell off a cliff” last year, says Dan Restrepo, a former adviser to Barack Obama who is now at the Centre for American Progress, a think-tank in Washington, DC. The pandemic provided a pretext to curtail civil liberties in the name of public health.
In Guatemala things went from bad to worse in 2019 when CICIG, a UN-backed anti-corruption body, was disbanded. It had looked into government sleaze and abuses of power by the army, which ruled the country until 1996. Over the past two years military men, corrupt officials and criminals have only become more powerful, says Carmen Rosa de León, who heads the Institute for Sustainable Development, a Guatemalan think-tank. American hopes that the country could be its main ally in the Northern Triangle are evaporating as President Alejandro Giammattei’s government attacks the justice system. On July 23rd Juan Franciso Sandoval, the anti-graft prosecutor, was fired, allegedly for bias. Mr Sandoval, who fled the country, said he was dismissed because he was investigating high-ranking officials. Drug money has started to seep into the state, too. Ms de León’s organisation has connected 38 lawmakers to drug-traffickers.
The criminality of the state is also the biggest concern in Honduras. Drug barons have seemingly infiltrated politics at every level. Juan Orlando Hernández, the president, has been fingered in at least threeUS cases against drug-traffickers, including one in May in which his brother was sentenced to life behind bars. Elections in November are unlikely to change much. Yani Rosenthal, a leading presidential candidate, served three years in a jail in the United States for money-laundering.
In Nicaragua Daniel Ortega, the authoritarian president, acts with increasing impunity. Over the past four months seven presidential hopefuls, as well as numerous intellectuals and former ministers, have been detained. On August 6th Nicaragua’s electoral council disqualified the main opposition party, Citizens for Liberty, from running. As of December NGOs must register as “foreign agents”. Police are also going after La Prensa, the country’s oldest newspaper. There is “no trace of democracy”, says a Nicaraguan businessman.
Few ordinary folk in these countries think they can change things through elections or protests. Many think their only option is to flee from their homes. In July US border guards had 213,000 encounters on the southern border, the largest number in a month since 2000. Some 44% were from the Northern Triangle. But this understates the problem. Many more of those fleeing spend time in Mexico, before trying to go farther north, while many Nicaraguans go south to Costa Rica.
President Joe Biden has made Central America, especially the Northern Triangle, a foreign-policy priority. (Officials fear they can do little about Nicaragua.) Rather than simply reinforcing the border, the administration wants to tackle the democratic regression and its effects.
That is easier said than done. The United States has some diplomatic tools at its disposal, such as slapping visa bans on the ruling elites. Last month the State Department published a list of more than 50 current and former officials accused of corruption or undermining democracy in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They will not be allowed to travel to the United States and may face further sanctions. (Similarly, Nicaraguans linked to the regime have been issued with visa bans.) The Justice Department says it will launch a task-force to investigate corruption and human trafficking in the region.
Boosting governance, security and prosperity in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador from afar will be much trickier. Some violence-reduction programmes may have had a bit of success over the past few decades. But even assessments by USAID admit that past aid efforts have had little effect. American officials say they have learned from previous mistakes. Their initial focus now is on improving prosperity, by working with the private sector in each country. For example, US officials are trying to persuade local businesses to provide more jobs. They also want them to lobby for policy changes, such as the introduction of well-regulated public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects. Such projects are typically wholly state-run and highly prone to graft.
Mr Restrepo says that American efforts need to be more “disruptive”. That could be achieved by creating a parallel market for captive industries, such as sugar. Producers could then sell goods directly to the United States rather than going through local cartels. Such work, he says, “takes a lot of nerve”. Mr Biden and his team may not have enough.■

1575,"LIFE FOR women who sell sex in Manhattan may be a little easier these days. In April the district attorney’s office said it would stop prosecuting those who offered or agreed to engage in a sex act for payment. Buyers of sex, though, can still be charged with “patronising a prostitute in the third degree”.
The language sounds archaic because the law is. Whereas many rich countries have decriminalised the buying or selling of sex (or both), prostitution remains illegal across America, apart from in a few counties in Nevada. But the change in Manhattan—and similar moves in other New York boroughs and Baltimore—is part of a growing movement to reform the criminal-justice system’s treatment of such transactions. A handful of states have introduced bills that would partially or fully legalise them.

This reflects a growing belief that prosecuting prostitutes is cruel and counterproductive. Criminal records can make it hard to find housing and alternative employment. The mere threat of them can prevent some from seeking health care.
What is the best way to reform? There are two broad approaches: allowing the selling of sex but retaining penalties for buying it, in the hope this will lower demand (this is known as the Nordic model, after a law passed in Sweden in 1999); and decriminalising both sides of the transaction, in the hope that it will result in better working conditions.
In America, where polarisation on many social issues is growing, divisions between the proponents of these different approaches can be stark. This is especially apparent in New York, where two bills have been introduced in the state legislature. In September Kathy Hochul, the governor, said she was considering decriminalisation. She did not say whether she favoured the Stop Violence in the Sex Trades Act, a full decriminalisation bill, or the Sex Trade Survivors Justice and Equality Act, which would punish only buyers.
Proponents of full decriminalisation argue that bringing sex work into the light makes it easier for prostitutes to get access to health services and report violence to the police. They often cite the example of New Zealand, which fully decriminalised in 2003. Four years later a study found that most prostitutes still did not report violence, but a majority said police attitudes towards them had improved. Barbara Brents, a sociology professor at the University of Nevada, says that although the state’s tightly regulated brothels take a big slice of sex workers’ earnings, some women choose to work in them because they feel safer. (Even so, most prostitutes in Nevada work outside the legal brothels.)
Cecilia Gentili, a former sex worker and trans woman who helped found Decrim NY, which was involved in drawing up the Stop Violence bill, says she never considered telling police when she was forced to sell sex, for fear of being arrested. Sex work, she believes, should be regarded much like any other employment. Laws aimed at reducing demand are “patronising”, she says, promoting the idea that “women are not able to make decisions”.
Whether such activists speak for most sex workers is impossible to know, because there have been no large-scale surveys of sex workers in America. Yet strong anecdotal evidence suggests selling sex is different from other forms of manual labour in important ways. Drug addiction and homelessness often lead people into sex work and keep them in it. Many prostitutes have sold sex since they were minors; other forms of employment are not connected with abuse in this way.
Nor are they typically connected with trafficking. Some people in organisations that work with prostitutes say the spectre of sex trafficking—defined by the federal government as a commercial sex act “induced by force, fraud, or coercion” or in which the seller is under 18—is a distraction from other problems. Reliable data are hard to come by, so no one really knows how prevalent trafficking is. But it is almost certainly underreported.
Proponents of full decriminalisation say it would make it easier to prosecute traffickers. But champions of the Nordic model say breaking the law acts as a deterrent to some would-be buyers, so full decriminalisation boosts demand, creating opportunities for exploitation on the supply side. Since most women with alternatives choose not to sell sex, less fortunate ones fill the gap. Some will be trafficked.
The New Zealand study found that the number of sex workers there had not increased after decriminalisation. But an analysis of data from 150 countries in 2013 found that legalising prostitution led to its expansion and increased trafficking. Alexi Meyers, a former assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, says prosecutions against sex-work “promoters” can lead to the prosecution of traffickers; full decriminalisation could prevent that happening.
Nordic or nothing?
In states that are mulling decriminalisation, decisions are likely to come down to practical factors such as this. Another consideration is how changes in one state will play out in a country where sex work mostly remains illegal (and in conservative states any reform is a distant prospect). If New York became the first to fully decriminalise, it could well attract sex tourists in large numbers.
In June, when Maine’s governor vetoed a bill decriminalising sex work, she expressed concerns about becoming the first state to do so (she also worried, she said, that it would push up demand). Though the rejected legislation was for the Nordic-style approach, this may emerge as the most palatable and practical way for America to begin to reform its sex-work laws. ■",2
1576,"WHEN SOTHEBY’S raised the gavel on the season’s biggest art auction on November 15th the sellers, Harry and Linda Macklowe, did not arrive as one to watch the proceedings from the discreet skybox above the auction floor, as those disposing of a collection often do. The couple can hardly stand to be in the same room together. Their divorce, after nearly six decades of marriage, was so contentious that in 2018 a judge ordered them to sell 65 of their magnificent 20th-century artworks and split the proceeds.
Death, debt and divorce are the auction market’s traditional catalysts. Sotheby’s won this particular deal by guaranteeing the Macklowes at least $600m from the sale. At the time it was agreed such a fulsome promise, the biggest ever offered to a client by an auction house, seemed to hark back to a bullish age before covid-19 roiled the art market. But Sotheby’s panache was well judged: the evening brought in $676m including fees, to which the proceeds of a second auction in May will be added. For beyond the Macklowe sale, the art market is changing, in three important ways.

It started even before the pandemic. The takeover of Sotheby’s by Patrick Drahi, a French telecoms and cable entrepreneur, for $3.7bn in the summer of 2019 looked with hindsight like an error when covid struck nine months later. Lockdowns shuttered auctioneers and galleries the world over. Art collectors quickly decided that 2020 was a bad time to sell. The best-connected auction houses moved swiftly into trying to broker private deals; the more entrepreneurial bolstered online sales with digital auctions.
Mr Drahi’s commercial nous has brought new meaning to the famous art-market quip that Sotheby’s are “auctioneers trying to be gentlemen”, in contrast to Christie’s, a firm of “gentlemen trying to be auctioneers”. The tycoon, who took on well over $1bn of debt to finance the deal, now has access to details of the 300,000 or so richest people in the world. The new Sotheby’s is bent on selling them not just art, but handbags and history too.
His timing may prove prescient. Contemporary art, which accounts for the single biggest share of the art market, saw a record-breaking $2.7bn change hands during the year to June, according to Artprice, which tracks sales. Both Sotheby’s and Christie’s say they expect their sales in 2021 to match the $4.8bn and $5.8bn they respectively made in 2019.
In part that is because both the main auction houses are expanding beyond their conventional offering of art, watches and wine—the market’s first big shift. In 2020 Christie’s sold a dinosaur fossil named Stan for $31.8m. Earlier this year Sotheby’s auctioned Kanye West’s Yeezy trainers for $1.8m. Both firms have jumped into crypto-art, selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to techies. All of these have brought in new buyers, especially from Asia, the fastest-growing market. Of the top 20 lots auctioned by Sotheby’s last year, Asian clients bid on ten and bought nine.
A second new development is that the two houses are wooing new customers by making buying at auction more fun. Last month Sotheby’s organised a weekend jamboree in Las Vegas for 40 clients. The main business was the auction of $100m-worth of artworks by Picasso. But in an effort to turn the affair into more of an experience, Sotheby’s also laid on wine-tasting, a session on how to game an auction and a talk by Jay Leno about vintage cars. At the party after the sale, the DJ was Picasso’s great-grandson.
Going, going, gone
The most far-reaching shift, though, may be the auction houses’ new cosy relationship with commercial galleries and private dealers. Historically these were their great rivals. Galleries know where the art is and what their clients might be prepared to sell, but lack the access to buyers who flock to auction houses. Now the two work more closely together, to find the right buyer for a piece and vice versa.
When a Düsseldorf gallerist recently wanted to sell a Gerhard Richter from the 1970s, an under-appreciated period, he turned to Sotheby’s. The private sale to one of its clients was at a far better price than he would have got at auction or selling to one of his own collectors, he says. In April 2020, a month after the pandemic hit, Rafael Valls, an dealer in Old Masters in London, was able to sell nearly 100 pictures in an online Sotheby’s auction; in a normal year the gallery would sell around 200.
In a move that highlights this rapprochement between auction houses and dealers, Sotheby’s recently hired Noah Horowitz, a director of the Art Basel art fair who is known to be particularly close to galleries. “Sotheby’s is tearing up the traditional playbook,” says a rival. The marriage is partly one of financial convenience: galleries lack the pools of capital big auction houses deploy to offer guarantees and thus lure potential sellers. Teaming up with dealers helps auctioneers find works to sell, which is almost as hard for them as identifying the next generation of buyers.
Sotheby’s and Christie’s hope their new approach will help both sides of the trade. When Christie’s sold its first piece of crypto-art earlier this year, its boss Guillaume Cerutti points out, almost all of the 33 bidders were new to the firm. A few days later one of those who had been outbid, a 31-year-old Chinese-American tech entrepreneur named Justin Sun, went on to buy a $20m Picasso—and, in the Macklowe sale, a Giacometti sculpture for $78m. ■

1577,"Tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has bought a significant chunk of the South Sydney Rabbitohs but exactly how much money he paid for it remains unknown.  
The founder of Atlassian, who is worth an estimated $26billion, now owns a 25 per cent share in the famous NRL club, but he has kept the price tag a secret. 
One source believes the figure is close to the $20 million mark. 
According to the Daily Telegraph, fellow high profile part owners - media mogul James Packer and Hollywood actor Russell Crowe - were set to receive $10 million each following the recent injection from Cannon-Brookes.
The purchase comes after both men reduced their 37.5 per cent shareholding to 25 per cent to enable Cannon-Brookes to also enjoy a quarter share of the club.
Members of the Rabbitohs own the remaining quarter. 
Crowe has remained tight-lipped, stating he was 'not at liberty to discuss details'.
Eventually, ASIC documents will pinpoint exactly how much Cannon-Brookes handed over to Blackcourt League Investments, the company who owns 75 per cent of the Rabbitohs, for his share. 
On November 15, it became public knowledge Cannon-Brookes had bought into Russell Crowe's footy team after going on a lavish $70million rural Australian property spending spree. 
The string of new investments take the philanthropist's estimated wealth to $26billion, comfortably exceeding Packer's net worth of $5billion. 
'The South Sydney Rabbitohs are special. Not only are we the oldest, loudest and proudest, we are an organisation people truly, deeply care about,' he said.
'I'm looking forward to partnering with Russell and James and bringing what I can to the table to help the club grow to even greater heights.' 
Cannon-Brookes, who in 2020 became the first Australian to own an American sports team after buying a minority stake in NBA side the Utah Jazz, said there was renewed pressure at leading South Sydney.
'It's one thing to have a really great legacy culture – 'the oldest, proudest, loudest' is written pretty deeply in people's psyches – but it also comes with a sense of that culture of continuing to improve,' he said.
Souths were infamously booted out of the competition in 1999 after a series of financial problems, before a campaign led by Crowe began to see the game's oldest and most successful club re-admitted.
They were re-instated in the NRL back in 2002 and 12 years later won the premiership in emotional scenes for the 'pride of the league.'
Crowe revealed he'd been working to get Cannon-Brookes involved for some time and regularly had him appearing in public wearing Rabbitohs merchandise. 
'I'm sure it hasn't gone unnoticed to South Sydney members and supporters that Mike wears a white Rabbitohs hat for special occasions,' Crowe told News Corp.
'This is a very strong move for the club. It connects us to the front edge of emerging technologies and business, and underlines the importance of our efforts in the community.
'Mike understands the resonance of sport in Australia, and James and I welcome his input going forward in keeping South Sydney ahead of the curve, and a game leading organisation, on and off the field.' 
Packer, who has amassed wealth across media and casinos, said he was excited Cannon-Brookes was coming aboard to help with the team's community program. 
'I am really pleased that Mike is joining us, because I know how committed he is to the community, he will be a big asset and supporter of Souths Cares and all the important work they do,' he said.
Earlier in November, Cannon-Brookes bought out a Melbourne Cup-winning racehorse stud as part of his ambitious personal mission to make Australia greener.
The purchase of the $15.25million, 120-hectare Think Big Stud is the latest acquisition in a massive $70million buy-up of property and land in the Southern Highlands, 120km south of Sydney.  
He is planning to transform the properties he buys into a green paradise using 'regenerative agriculture' - with part of his plan to encourage Australians to eat crickets and other insects. 
The 41-year-old has already pledged $1.5billion to climate initiatives.
'[I] have heavy investments in controlled environment agriculture because it turns electricity into farming,' he tweeted. 
'99 per cent less emissions from transport, 95 per cent less water and 95 per cent less land use. 
'Renewables make it continually better.'
He has also warned the world needs to change its eating habits by adding insects to its daily diet if the planet is to feed a global population of eight billion.
'Insects are a huge part of a sustainable future,' he said.
'I'm a big fan of cricket flour and insect eating in general. The logic totally stacks up - Low planet footprint, high protein, sustainable etc.
'Always looking for interesting opportunities in that space!'
The tech boss's latest buy, the Think Big Stud, was home to the 2008 Melbourne Cup and Caulfield Cup winner Viewed, as well as other Group One champions. 
Cricket flour is a high protein flour
It is far less intensive to farm
It requires much less water than wheat 
It is said to taste nutty but the flavour can be easily disguised
Crickets are killed by exposing them to low temperatures and putting them into stasis. They are then freeze-dried
 You can also pan fry them for a tasty crunchy snack 
They are said to be a highly nutritious and cheap source of protein, fat, minerals, vitamins and fibre
Atlassian boss Mike Cannon-Brookes believes they are the solution to feeding the world's 8 billion people 
The Southern Highlands property in Burradoo, near Moss Vale, was owned by Malaysian billionaire Dato Tan Chin Nam until his death in 2018, and is just the latest in a series of local acquisitions for the former Cranbrook schoolboy.
He has been snapping up a series of estates and properties in the area including the 258-hectare, 15-bedroom Wattle Ridge farm for $13million.  
Mr Cannon-Brookes also has another 15-bedroom mansion, Cooliatta, also at Burradoo, for which he paid $3.9million, as well as Rosehill Farm, worth $5.9million, and two other farms including Widgee Waa which cost him $14.5million.
He now has at least seven properties or estates in the area - and is tipped to buy more.
The controversial Hume Coal mine planned for the Moss Vale area was finally blocked by the NSW Independent Planning Commission last month.
Now the massive South Korean-owned 1300 hectare estate has also been linked to the green billionaire as his next possible acquisition.
Mr Cannon-Brookes is number three on the AFR's Rich List after founding the multinational company behind project management tools like Trello and Jira.
He has repeatedly slammed the Australian government for their approach to climate change - and blasted Prime Minister Scott Morrison's plan that he took to COP26.
'I read all 129 pages of the pamphlet' he tweeted. 'It's not worth the paper I didn't print it on. 
'I understand technology damn well. This isn't a 'technology driven approach'. It's inaction, misdirection and avoiding choices. 
'This is just ridiculously embarrassing.'
He and his wife Annie have vowed to transform their farmland into green-sensitive pastures. 
'Regenerative agriculture' aims to tackle a holistic approach to farming by careful soil and water management and rethinking the approach to fertilisers.
It aims to 'improve the resources it uses, rather than destroying or depleting them,' say proponents, by rotating crops, diversifying and allowing paddocks to lie empty.
The tech boss also brings the latest technology to his farms too. 
'[I do] everything I can,' he recently told the Sydney Morning Herald. 
'I drive an electric vehicle. I live on a farm that runs almost entirely on sunlight, electricity. I have electric farm vehicles up the wazoo.'  
And he believes Australia could be the 'Saudi Arabia of renewable electricity' if the political will was there. 
He added: 'We could power the entire world five times over from the Australian sun that we have. 
'It's a good measure of how large our country is, and how much great sun we have. We have a country almost designed to benefit most from the renewable boom.

1578," (CNN)Success hasn't spoiled ""Succession,"" as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of ""Veep"" blush.Having become HBO's version of ""Game of Thrones"" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of ""fine wines"" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, ""Can I do this? Can I win?""Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.While Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by ""Succession"" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with ""Veep,"" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.""Succession"" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that ""Game of Thrones"" comparison, the battles on ""Succession"" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.""Succession"" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",0
1579," (CNN)""Queens"" is an extremely familiar idea, elevated not quite to the level of royalty by being slickly cast, packaged and produced. Like Peacock's ""Girls5eva,"" the concept hinges on an all-girl group reunited and again pursuing stardom 20 years later, rediscovering the spotlight and its perils after years spent braiding hair and burning breakfast.Those last mundane activities are how we meet Brianna (Eve), once known as Professor Sex, who is now raising five kids. Methodically, the show goes about introducing the rest of the quartet once known as the Nasty Bitches (a name itself rooted in the past), who, as Jill a.k.a. Da Thrill (Naturi Naughton), notes, ""stood on top of the world for a hot minute.""The other members of the group, Naomi/Xplicit Lyrics (Brandy) and Valeria/Butter Pecan (Nadine Velazquez), had a sour falling out, with the former toiling away as a solo act -- ""still chasing the fame that you found 20 years ago,"" as she's told -- and the latter having successfully transitioned into morning TV, where her unbridled ambition is on full display.It's their manager (Taylor Sele) who suggests getting the band back together as part of a televised event, and the lure of a quick payout is enough to erode the resistance on several fronts. But this is a series, after all, so the reunion won't end there, with the challenge of mounting a formal comeback and all the soapy doings that go with it.As noted, the idea of one-time stars nursing old grudges and grasping for another few minutes of fame is hardly a new one (Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" is an ode to one-hit wonders), but the hip-hop backdrop and casting gives ""Queens"" a relatively fresh feel. The disclaimer would be that once you get past the premise, the series becomes another soap set against the backdrop of the music world, a la ""Empire,"" meaning it will only be as good as the situations that the writers can continue to conjure.Produced by ""Scandal"" alum Zahir McGhee (who wrote the pilot) and directed by Tim Story, ""Queens"" appears to be in pretty good hands on that score, even if the content and actually-not-that-explicit lyrics can only be as nasty as ABC's standards will allow. The show also figures to get a boost, in old-fashioned TV scheduling terms, from having ""The Bachelorette"" as its opening act.For now, ""Queens"" has done an admirable job assembling the pieces. Keeping them from flaming out the way that the show's fictional group did could be another matter.""Queens"" premieres Oct. 19 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.",0
1580,"OF THE ESTIMATED 55m people living with dementia around the world, only one-quarter have been formally diagnosed with the condition. There are many reasons for this. Two are enduring: many patients and clinicians alike wrongly believe that dementia is an inevitable part of the ageing-human condition and, being incurable, is hardly worth diagnosing; and some people experiencing cognitive impairment fear hearing what sounds like a sentence of brain-death, and so do not seek help.
Some of the reasons for non-diagnosis, however, may be about to change. During the covid-19 pandemic many people have delayed consulting their doctors about non-urgent conditions, and as lockdowns ease, they may begin to ask for professional guidance (moreover, evidence suggests that covid itself heightens the risk of dementia). In addition, diagnostic techniques, hitherto unreliable, time-consuming and costly, are becoming available, and for some forms of dementia hopes are emerging of more effective treatments.

Dementia is normally diagnosed by testing cognitive functions such as memory. If mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often a precursor to dementia, is detected, a patient may then be referred for tests to identify which of the dozens of causes of dementia are to blame. By far the most common is Alzheimer’s disease, accounting for 60-80% of cases.
Fear of the needle
Identifying Alzheimer’s normally requires a brain scan, and perhaps a lumbar puncture (the insertion of a needle into the lower spine), to extract cerebrospinal fluid, so as to measure its levels of two proteins that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, known as beta-amyloid and tau. Some patients are reluctant to undergo the intrusive procedure. The scans are usually by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), to look at the size of the brain, along with a positron-emission tomography (PET) scan to measure the build-up of beta-amyloid. PET and MRI scanners are expensive pieces of kit, running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For most people in the world, they are unobtainable.
That explains the excitement at the development of simple blood tests to distinguish Alzheimer’s from other neurodegenerative conditions. One, announced last year and likely to be validated for routine use within 12 months, according to Serge Gauthier, professor of neurology and neurosurgery at McGill University in Montreal, measures a form of tau called p-tau217. It has been found to predict Alzheimer’s with 96% accuracy.
It is already possible using mass spectrometry, which detects how atoms and molecules are deflected by magnetic fields, to measure the level of beta-amyloid in the blood. But it is not certain how this relates to levels in the brain. The accuracy of the procedure rises to 94% if two other risk factors are considered: age and the presence of a form of the APOE gene, known as APOE4, which heightens the risk of developing Alzheimer’s (and also appears to increase vulnerability to heart disease and covid). This can also be detected by a blood test, so Dr Gauthier envisages symptomatic patients giving blood samples for simultaneous tests for both tau and APOE4.
Other approaches aim to detect asymptomatic people years or even decades before they begin to show obvious symptoms. George Stothart at the University of Bath in Britain leads a team that has developed very quick passive tests that hold great promise for detecting cognitive impairment early. These tests use electroencephalographic caps which are worn on the head to compare brainwave responses to a series of images. The caps are relatively cheap and the test can be conducted using a tablet computer.
Taking the exam
Meanwhile, machine-learning and AI are enabling big improvements in cognitive testing, which, like other sorts of pencil-and-paper exams, has been prone to cultural and educational bias, and to a “learning bias” (lessened accuracy as practice improves the participants’ results). Cognetivity Neurosciences, for example, a firm launched by two academics at the University of Cambridge, produces an “integrated cognitive assessment” that has already been deployed by some regions of Britain’s National Health Service. It has also been approved by America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by regulators in the European Union.
The Cognetivity test relies on a series of flashing images, among which some animals have been embedded for the person being tested to identify—rather like the CAPTCHA tests used by some websites to weed out robots trying to log on, only these are conducted at rapid speeds. So rapid, indeed, that the tests cannot be conducted remotely, but are done on tablets in memory clinics or at doctors’ surgeries. Already, however, a variety of do-it-yourself cognitive tests of various standards are available online, and some of these could become important diagnostic tools.
Even before the explosion in the use of AI, scientists could detect evidence of dementia from how people use words. A study in 2011, for example, found clear retrospective evidence in the writings in her 40s and 50s of Iris Murdoch, a novelist, of the Alzheimer’s she was to die with in 1999, aged 79. The research arm of IBM, a computing giant, has used data from the Framingham heart study, which has tracked three generations of people in a town in Massachusetts since 1948 to improve knowledge of cardiovascular health. Ajay Royyuru, who heads IBM’s health-care and life-sciences research, says that studying the use of language by participants in the study suggests that changes over time can be used to predict which of them will acquire dementia, seven and a half years before they are diagnosed even with MCI.
Such data—and the massive amounts people compile every day on their smartphones, using various services such as messaging or navigation—could help enable much earlier detection of dementia. This might be possible with apps, although the ethics of any non-consensual diagnosis and the willingness of people to use such services are another matter. One way or another, though, Paola Barbarino, chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International, an advocacy group, expects a “tsunami” of demand for treatment.
For health-care systems around the world all this may pose more problems than it solves. The main one is the lack of proven treatments. In June the FDA approved Aduhelm, the first drug to treat Alzheimer’s. A monoclonal antibody shown to reduce accumulations of beta-amyloid, it has so far been little used, because it is expensive and insurers are reluctant to approve reimbursement when there are doubts as to whether it actually slows cognitive degeneration. But it is the first in a queue of drugs, for which Alzheimer’s specialists hold out great hopes.
The second difficulty is in assessing when MCI requires medical intervention. As Dr Gauthier points out, some mental decline is indeed part of ageing. People find ways of coping. Telling the difference is hard to do through blood tests or the use of AI. It still requires time and human intervention. This is part of the third and biggest difficulty: that, as the world ages, the number of people with dementia is going to rise rapidly, to more than 80m by 2030 and more than 140m by 2050. Even today health services are buckling. Who knows how they will cope in the decades ahead. ■

1581,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Media entrepreneur Byron Allen has raised $10 billion in preferred equity and debt for his bid for U.S. regional TV station operator Tegna Inc (TGNA.N), hoping to prevail over a rival offer from investment firms Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) and Standard General LP, people familiar with the matter said.
The financing is backed by a consortium of 14 banks and 10 investors, including Ares Management Corp (ARES.N), Fortress Investment Group, Oaktree Capital Management and Michael Milken's family office, one of the sources said.
Ares is leading a $2.2 billion preferred equity investment in support of Allen's financing package, another of the sources added.
Tegna could choose a winning bidder as early as this month, the sources said.
Spokespeople for Tegna, Apollo, Oaktree and Michael Milken declined to comment.
Allen, who acquired the Weather Channel TV network for $300 million in 2018, made a $23 per share offer for Tegna in September, while Apollo and Standard General offered $22 per share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tegna wants both bidders to raise their offers, one of the sources said. It also expects assurances from both bidders that they will entertain all regulatory demands necessary to complete the acquisition, and views the Apollo/Standard General bid as most likely to raise antitrust concerns, the source added.
Apollo owns 33 TV stations in 20 markets through its portfolio company Cox Media Group, while Standard General owns four TV stations, according to their websites.
Tegna reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday and said on a call with analysts it was still evaluating acquisition proposals versus its stand-alone prospects.
The company recorded $756 million in revenue in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. It has 64 television stations in 51 U.S. markets, and a market value of $7.75 billion including debt.",3
1582,"THE BEIJING International Book Fair, which takes place in August, gives the better-known view of China’s publishing industry: state-controlled and gargantuan. The organiser, China Publishing Group, owns 40 of the 580 government-run firms that dominate the country’s $15bn book-publishing market—second in size only to America’s. But another book jamboree, held one month earlier in the capital, shows a less familiar aspect. The abC Art Book Fair, which this year ran for three days from July 9th, is all that the other is not: independent, eclectic and lean. Readers piled in to buy and browse the works of 140 independent publishers (last year’s event is pictured). It reflects a small but lively indie-publishing scene.
The government tightly controls printed matter. Publication codes, such as ISBNs, that must be used by all books and periodicals sold in China are allocated only to state-run publishers (half of them based in Beijing). Censors pore over works before they go to print. The government gives another 200 privately owned publishers special permits to operate.

There are other small unofficial publishers scattered across China. They may be legally registered as businesses, but lack publishing licenses. At the latest abC fair, an event dating back to 2015, the majority of exhibitors were illustrators, comic-strip authors, photobook makers and publishers of what the industry calls zines (small pamphlet-like magazines). Some were papermakers, or studios offering high-quality printing by letterpress, silk screen or, more affordably, by Risograph.
For decades until “reform and opening” began in the late 1970s, only one retailer was allowed to sell books to the public: Xinhua Bookstore, a state-run firm. But under Deng Xiaoping private publishers and bookshops were allowed to operate again, under close watch. Some bypass restrictions on circulation by designating their magazines as neibu, or for “internal” reading. That allows distribution among a limited group: neibu materials may not be sold to the public. Non-government producers of periodicals have to rent the required codes from state entities that no longer need them because the journals using them are defunct. Independent book publishers have to buy ISBNs from state counterparts, an arduous procedure. Small publishers sometimes purchase them in Hong Kong, where doing so is cheaper and far simpler. Such an ISBN does not give automatic access to China’s market.
But independent publishers who keep their content free of anything the Communist Party might seriously dislike, and who limit their print-runs to just a few hundred, can still manage to thrive. “No one is doing this to resist” authority, says a magazine-maker in Shanghai. Another, in the southern city of Guangzhou, says she devoted one issue to technology, but avoided mention of debate about facial recognition. “I can’t risk the magazine for one sentence,” she says. “I want to survive.”
Some publications are more daring. One is Missionary,a thoughtful magazine about gay life in China. (Official tolerance of gay rights is limited.) A recent issue was on sale at abC. It included discussion of the stigma surrounding pornography. Photography books sometimes push boundaries. Buried in the pages of one at the fair were a few scenes from the Cultural Revolution, showing people being persecuted by a crowd. The book’s editor checked them with a friend at a state-run publisher, who did not think they would cause trouble (a few independent publishers scoff at the ability of censors to spot subtle censure). Some print in a mixture of Chinese and English, in part because they hope this will deflect criticism. State publishers have little interest in illustrated books for adults. So in 2018 Aki Jiang set up AKIPRESS to give herself and fellow artists an outlet. “Publishing through formal channels is so hard in China,” says Ms Jiang. “I wanted to draw freely.”
Officials appear fine with that, within limits. State publishers attend indie book fairs to scout for talent. One such event, called UNFOLD, which was first held in Shanghai in 2018, even receives subsidies from the local district-level government. Officials there are eager to jazz up the derelict industrial zone where the fair takes place. Such co-operation involves added scrutiny by censors. Missionary does not participate in UNFOLD.
Most authors and illustrators feel that Shanghai offers a more relaxed environment than the strait-laced capital. Indie publishers there, lacking the requisite codes for selling their work in conventional bookstores, instead put them in the city’s cafés and boutiques. Officials overlook this transgression.
Independent book fairs have also sprung up in bigger inland cities where demand is growing among young, well-educated inhabitants. Bookshops are booming: 4,000 opened in China last year, despite the pandemic. Sisyphe, a big private chain, has spread to hundreds of malls. Chengdu in the south-west, home to more bookshops and libraries than any other Chinese city, subsidises new bookshops.
But the public can be a problem. Some readers use city-government hotlines to report on books they deem unsuitable for circulation. One customer at Bananafish, a bookshop in Shanghai, complained that it was selling a magazine from Taiwan, the government of which China loathes. In fact, the publication had been cleared for sale in China. Another called the hotline about an 11-page book, printed locally, called “The Old Man and the Pigeon”. It is unclear how the work had offended. Perhaps the reader had seen sexual innuendo in an illustration of two birds, above a line that read: “mating pigeons”. Local censors visited the shop. But they chuckled at the story. They took one copy away with them, and left the others. ■",2
1583,"BRAZIL SEEMS the sort of place where vaccination against covid-19 should have taken off quickly—and not just because it is suffering heavily from the disease. Impressive vaccine-making institutes—Butantan in São Paulo and Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro—provide excellent support for its existing immunisation programmes. Natália Pasternak, a microbiologist at the University of São Paulo, says that if it had put its mind to it, her country could have developed a vaccine all of its own.
Even though it did not take that route, Brazil has been intimately involved in the validation of covid-19 vaccines developed elsewhere, hosting four phase-three trials—in part, alas, because the high infection rate meant such trials could expect fairly quick results. One might have thought that would put the country first in line for deliveries. But as of the first week of January Brazil, a country of 212m, had just 6m doses of a covid-19 vaccine within its borders. Because that vaccine has yet to be approved by the country’s regulators, not one dose has been used.

Since December three covid-19 vaccines made by Western companies have been approved for use by regulatory bodies that the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers “stringent”. American and European regulators have endorsed two vaccines, one created by BioNTech, a German biotech company and produced by Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical firm, and one made by Moderna, an American biotech company. A vaccine created at Oxford University and produced by AstraZeneca, an Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, has been approved in Britain and India—the country which produces most of the vaccines used in developing countries. Vaccines made by Russia and China have also been authorised for use in their home countries and some others (see chart 1).

For there to be any vaccines, let alone a plethora of them, less than a year after the first cases of covid-19 were reported is an unprecedented achievement. It also brings new challenges. In rich countries, where most of the vaccine development went on and was paid for, these are primarily in manufacture and distribution: how to manage the logistical task of getting vaccines into the right people as fast as possible. Middle-income and poor countries face problems of acquisition. And everywhere disparities within and between countries are highlighting pre-existing inequalities and political dysfunction.
Brazil’s plight shows the damage that politics can do. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, has consistently mocked and minimised concern about covid-19. In early June João Doria, the governor of São Paulo, signed a deal with Sinovac, a Chinese biotech company, to host phase-three trials of its CoronaVac vaccine in his state; the deal gave the state 6m doses and the right to make 40m more at the Butantan Institute in São Paulo. Mr Bolsonaro, who had ignored overtures from vaccine-makers, scoffed at his rival’s move and poured scorn on the Chinese vaccine. In late July the central government did order 100m doses from AstraZeneca. But it is not as yet approved in Brazil, and production there, which will be handled by Fiocruz, will take months to certify and ramp up.
“No health secretary could imagine in his worst nightmare that this could happen,” says Fábio Vilas-Boas, the health secretary of Bahía, a state of 15m people in Brazil’s poor north-east. It is among dozens of cities and states that are following São Paulo’s lead in negotiating directly with vaccine-makers to guarantee supplies. Bahía has agreed to host trials of Sputnik V, a vaccine developed in Russia, in exchange for priority access to 50m doses. A group of private Brazilian clinics has agreed to buy 5m doses of Covaxin, an experimental vaccine developed by India’s Bharat Biotech which, to the surprise of many, was recently given approval for emergency use by Indian regulators.
This disturbing public-health scavenger hunt reflects a more general dynamic. The demonstrated efficacy of the three vaccines developed by Western pharmaceutical companies has made vaccination feel like an urgent possibility around the world, especially in middle-income countries like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa. But supplies of those vaccines have, by and large, been snapped up by the countries where they were developed and their rich-world neighbours.
What is more, two of those vaccines, the ones from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are delicate enough to require special treatment—and also pretty expensive. Seth Berkley, the boss of Gavi, a public-private initiative that distributes vaccines in low-income countries, says that outside the rich world the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is likely to be used only in very small populations, such as health workers in big cities.
It is the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine that has the most to offer the world at large. It is cheaper and more robust, and the expertise needed to manufacture it is reasonably widespread. There are plans for it to be manufactured at nine “nodes” around the world, allowing a great deal to be made. The node that matters most to Dr Berkley is that in South Korea. It will be producing the vaccine for COVAX, a consortium set up by Gavi and others that is devoted to providing covid-19 vaccines around the world.
Unfortunately, only the nodes in Britain and India have so far received regulatory approval and started production, and most of their production is slated for domestic use. Regulatory approval for the others, including Fiocruz in Brazil, may take some time. Dr Berkley expects approval for the South Korean node to take 40 days. After that the WHO will still have to weigh in before COVAX can get moving.

In a world where the supply of a cheap Western vaccine along these lines was already plentiful there would be little interest in the less well-attested vaccines from China, India and Russia. As it is, they provide a welcome option for some countries, as well as a fillip for their originators (see chart 2 ).
China and Russia see their vaccines as offering a boost to their prestige and soft power as well as providing them with trade and diplomatic opportunities. China wants to “project a narrative that it’s taking care of countries that have been left behind,” says Oliver Stuenkel of Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university in São Paulo. This kind of vaccine diplomacy could shape the geopolitics of 2021 and beyond.
Sigue Sigue Sputnik
In August Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, announced that the Gamaleya Centre in Moscow had developed the world’s first covid-19 vaccine: its precedence was underlined by naming it Sputnik V, a reference to the epoch-making satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. As Elena Amelina, who runs a research laboratory at Russia’s Pulmonology Research Institute, explains: “The goal was not just to produce a working and reliable vaccine, but to be seen as being ahead of the planet—as if it was an arms or a space race.”
The analogy, though, had a fatal flaw. No one doubted there had been a great leap forward when the Soviet Union launched the world’s first satellite: the pings Sputnik gave off as it circled Earth could be picked up on transistor radios. When it came to Sputnik V, though, you had to take Mr Putin’s word for it. The need for a speedy announcement had not allowed time for full trials; the data were scanty.
The Russian government thinks perception is everything. The human immune system takes a different view, and independent regulators try to follow its lead. The lack of reliable trial data prevented any acceptance of Sputnik V in the West. The same was true for the Sinovac vaccine which Chinese authorities approved for emergency use in August, and the vaccine from Sinopharm approved for general use there in December.
This does not mean that those vaccines do not work; just that they had not been shown to do so when first approved. Since then trials in various places have persuaded some regulators in other countries that the non-Western products are worth buying and safe enough to use. Others are waiting for further trials to report before taking the plunge.
In Bahrain, which has the second-highest vaccination rate globally, people have enthusiastically taken to the Sinopharm vaccine after supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab ran low; trials in the UAE have found it to have an 86% efficacy rate. Trials in Turkey and Indonesia suggest that CoronaVac provides protection, but data on its efficacy remain thin. Indonesia has since started vaccinating people of working age with CoronaVac—though not older people, because the data do not as yet seem to support it. The results of the São Paulo CoronaVac trial, which were due after The Economist went to press on January 7th, are eagerly awaited beyond Brazil.
Other forms of approbation are also available. Sputnik V is similar in its design to the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine—both use a harmless adenovirus to deliver a genetic transcript describing SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein—and in December AstraZeneca and the Gamaleya Centre agreed to work on trials that combine the two vaccines. Dr Amelina sees this as a chance for the Russian vaccine to improve its reputation, a view echoed elsewhere; Russian state media, meanwhile, have portrayed it as the West coming begging for help. If further investigations work out well, it is possible that the vaccine will end up more warmly received abroad than at home, where in December 58% of the Russian people, used to being lied to, told pollsters they would be unwilling to take it.
There is domestic hesitancy in China, too—and not without reason. The country has a long history of vaccine scandals. But the 1.5m vaccine doses that were distributed last year did not all go to people obliged by the government to take them, such as soldiers, party officials and labourers being sent abroad; some of the rich and well connected happily snagged doses for themselves. Mass vaccination programmes are now being introduced with ambitious goals but no great sense of urgency. The number of cases of covid-19 is tiny and life is close to normal.
Europe’s regiments

It is possible that in time Western governments will increase the amount of vaccine available to others. Many ordered more than they needed from various suppliers in order to be sure that they would get their hands on at least one that worked (see chart 3). Canada has dibs on enough doses to immunise 505% of its population; Britain and America have coverage of 290% and 200%, respectively. When they feel assured of a supply that will meet the needs of their fully up and running vaccination programmes, such countries will probably redirect what is surplus to requirements.
At the moment, though, a fully up-and-running programme is a rarity. This is particularly true in continental Europe, where vaccine roll-out has been much slower than in America and Britain (let alone Israel, which is leading the world). One reason seems to be that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is giving conditional approval for the vaccines, rather than simply authorising their emergency use. This higher standard has benefits, including not having to indemnify suppliers against lawsuits, but requires more data and takes more time. American and British regulators have been quicker.
Another problem is that the EU, acting as a bulk purchaser for its member states, plumped much more heavily for AstraZeneca’s product than for Pfizer’s—and the EMA has yet to approve the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. The EU also ordered a lot of the vaccine being developed by Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical company, in collaboration with GSK, a British one. Unfortunately, trials showed this vaccine to be poor at generating immunity in older patients. A new formulation may well put matters right. But it is unlikely to be approved and available much before the end of the year.
The final reason for low vaccination rates in Europe has to do with planning, logistics and the availability of appropriate workers. Most of the planning did not envisage the urgency which soaring case rates have added to the first weeks of the campaign. France’s plan, for example, involved repeated medical visits to ensure care-home residents gave informed consent, a time-consuming step which in the current circumstances has driven frustration. The speed of action varies not just from country to country but also from region to region. Some bits of Italy have already administered more than three-quarters of their initial allocation of vaccine. Others have barely managed a third of that.
The pace of vaccination may improve as a sense of urgency works its way through the system. President Emmanuel Macron has berated French ministers and health authorities, repudiating their public calls for patience as vaccination programmes are ramped up. Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, has put pressure on the EMA to pick up the pace. A fresh order of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is in the works.
America is doing better. Even so, only about a quarter of the 17m doses distributed up to January 5th were recorded as having been used by that date. Even allowing for a reporting lag, that means many sit untouched in the freezers. One reason is that a lot of planning focused on cold-storage capacity—needed by both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines—rather than actual administration. “We should have been focusing on ‘How many can you vaccinate today, tomorrow, the day after?’,” says Claire Hannan of the Association of Immunisation Managers.
Some states and cities are now adopting what California’s governor Gavin Newsom has called a “much more aggressive posture” in order to get vaccines used. His state is working to set up more vaccination sites, to enroll the National Guard to help and to allow dentists, pharmacists and other health professionals to do the jabs. Some states are drawing up rules whereby vaccines a health-care provider does not use after thawing are reallocated. Some other states in which health-care providers are not getting through all the vaccine allocated to them, including Florida and Texas, have started offering shots to everyone over 65, leading to a chaotic scramble for vaccination appointments at pharmacies and hospitals.
It is in Britain, though, that a sense of urgency has driven the most radical change from established procedure. A more infectious variant of covid-19 which was first identified in September has led to an unprecedented increase in cases and driven a new vaccination strategy. Following the advice of experts on the country’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the government’s chief medical officers have advised it to prioritise delivering first doses of vaccine over providing the expected second doses to those who have already received one. Second doses will still be supplied, but later.
Second doses increase the level of protection offered by the first dose and should extend that protection’s duration—both good for the person involved. Nevertheless, in the short term first doses on their own do more for the unvaccinated than second doses do for the vaccinated. So for every 1,000 people not given a second dose, and thus deprived of a marginal improvement in protection, 1,000 people can be given the substantial initial protection offered by a first dose alone. Half as much vaccination for twice as many people should slow both the rate of new cases and the spread of the disease.
On the question of whether delaying the second dose puts long-term protection at risk, the JCVI points to evidence from the trials of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine that longer gaps do not do any such harm, and may even improve protection. There is no information of this kind for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. On the question of how well the initial protection lasts if it is not boosted, though, there is little evidence to go on. In the trials, almost everyone who got a first dose got a second dose after three to four weeks.
The British government plans to vaccinate all of its four top-priority groups—care-home staff and residents, front-line health- and social-care workers, everyone over 70 and those with conditions that make them highly vulnerable—with a first dose by mid-February. Second doses may then take as long as three months.
Most of the criticism of this move has come from overseas, which may reflect a wariness by British scientists to cut across the government’s public-health messaging at a crucial time. There is a valid concern that patients will have much more certainty about the protection they will receive if they are vaccinated in exactly the same manner that trial participants were. And many patients consented to their first dose on the expectation they would get a second shot. Another worry is that the presence of a fairly large population of only-partially immune patients might encourage the development of viral strains that can get around the sort of protection that the different vaccines offer.
A last hurrah
That has to be measured against the fact that, before any of the trial data were in, the lowest acceptable efficacy for candidate vaccines was put at just 50%. First dose efficacy—which the JCVI puts at 90% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 70% for the AstraZeneca-Oxford one—would have to drop off fairly steeply to offer lower protection than that.
The outcome will be watched carefully. In various places, including Germany and Quebec, there are discussions of doing something similar. If it works, it will speed up the protection offered to whole populations. If it does not work, though, it may risk damaging confidence in vaccination well beyond Britain—damage that the world can ill afford.

In France, where anti-vaccine feeling has long been strong, only 40% of the population tell pollsters they are willing to be vaccinated (hence the high level of concern over consent). In Brazil, where vaccination has generally been popular, the number of people saying that they do not wish to be vaccinated has reached 22%, up from 9% in August; 50% do not want to be vaccinated with the Chinese vaccine on to which Mr Bolsonaro has poured scorn.

In America, a national survey conducted in December found that 29% of people working in health-care settings were hesitant about taking a covid vaccine. “For the most part we are seeing good uptake with health-care workers”, says Ms Hannan. But there are pockets of resistance. In Ohio, anecdotal evidence suggests that more than half of workers in nursing homes have turned down the jabs; in some counties in California 40-50% of front-line workers have said no. Rates of refusal are particularly high among black and Latino workers.
It is this background of distrust which makes it so important to get vaccination roll-outs, and the public-information campaigns around them, right. Mistakes—such as, in the worst case, the use of a batch of vaccines that proves harmful, or the discovery of a side-effect to a vaccine that regulators missed—could derail efforts in many countries.
But if there are risks of fear and distrust spreading quickly from country to country, a connected world also offers benefits when it comes to fighting a pandemic. The high level of support for COVAX shows that rich nations have a new willingness to help ensure that high-risk populations across the world have access to vaccination. It seems likely that Joe Biden’s administration will sign up to COVAX—Donald Trump’s had no interest in such things—improving the situation further. If America comes to see value in competing with Russia and China for the soft power bestowed by providing vaccines beyond its borders that will be all to the good.
This is the first global-health emergency in which new treatments are being rolled out to poor countries at about the same time as in richer ones. That process will undoubtedly be fraught with inequity. It is still worth celebrating. It is not, perhaps, as profound a break with the past as the ability to develop a quiver full of brand new jabs in less than a year. But it is impressive, and heartening. ■

1584,"Boris Johnson has refused to say whether his father Stanley will be probed by the Tories after two women made claims of inappropriate touching.
The PM said it was 'absolutely right' women feel they can make complaints with confidence.
It comes after it emerged Stanley could be fired from a prestigious role as an environmental ambassador over the sexual assault allegations.
The powerful Conservative Environment Network, of which he is international ambassador, said: 'The alleged behaviour is not acceptable.'
The 81-year-old allegedly assaulted Conservative MP Caroline Nokes who said he had smacked her 'on the backside about as hard as he could' in 2003.
Her revelation earlier this week promoted political journalist Ailbhe Rea to come out and say he 'groped me'.
But as calls grew for a probe, a supporter of the 'charming' former MEP vowed it should not be a police matter if he was 'a little over-friendly, indeed handsy'.
Asked about the claims against his father, Mr Johnson said today: 'First of all, it's absolutely right that everybody, women in particular, should be able, have the confidence, to come forward and make complaints.'
The Prime Minister added: 'I'm obviously not going to comment on individual cases.'
He also declined during a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, North Yorkshire, to say whether he has spoken to his father about the allegations.
Last night it emerged Stanley could lose his role as international ambassador of the Conservative Environment Network.
Yesterday in an excruciating exchange in the Commons, the PM found himself being grilled by MP Miss Nokes about government policy on sexual harassment.
She did not mention her own claims against his father, but asked Mr Johnson if women would have more confidence 'if public sexual harassment was a specific crime', and if early intervention might stop 'those harassing women becoming sex offenders?' 
Stanley ignored questions on the matter as he left his house in north west London yesterday.
He had previously told Sky News: 'I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all – but there you go.'
Labour has called for 'criminal authorities' to investigate the claims, which emerged on Monday when Miss Nokes named Stanley during a panel discussion on Sky News.
She said during the Tory Party conference in 2003, when she had been the Tories' candidate for Romsey, Stanley slapped her bottom and said: 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat.'
After the allegation was broadcast, political journalist Miss Rea, who writes for the New Statesman, tweeted: 'Stanley Johnson also groped me at a party at Conservative conference in 2019.'
Yesterday another political journalist, Isabel Oakeshott, tweeted a photo of herself with the PM's father.
But she wrote: 'The charming Stanley Johnson can be a little over-friendly – indeed handsy – but I don't believe this is one for the police.
'Officers should focus their limited resources on investigating real crimes.'
She was deluged with replies from Twitter users accusing her of 'excusing' sexual assault. One said: 'I don't think 'Handsy Stanley' is the defence you think it is.'
Sky News political correspondent Kate McCann tweeted: 'You might be OK with someone being handsy but other women would find that uncomfortable...
'Your tweet suggests… it's their problem if they're offended, not his for being 'over-friendly'.'
Lifelong conservationist Stanley was made international ambassador at the think-tank the Conservative Environment Network in February.
But the organisation has now distanced itself from him, saying: 'We take all allegations of inappropriate behaviour very seriously.
'We have clear internal processes for managing allegations of this nature. The alleged behaviour is not acceptable to CEN.'
The chairman of CEN is Ben Goldsmith, a family friend of the Prime Minister's wife Carrie.
Yesterday the PM was grilled about sexual harassment when he appeared before Parliament's liaison committee of senior MPs.
They included Miss Nokes in her capacity as chairman of the women and equalities committee.
Miss Nokes – two days after accusing his father of smacking her bottom – put it to the Prime Minister.
She said: 'Isn't it fair to say that if public sexual harassment was a specific crime, you might see women with more confidence to come forward?'
Mr Johnson replied: 'All women should have confidence to come forward… and there are proper procedures for those claims and complaints to be investigated.'
The MP asked: 'Should we not intervene earlier, before those harassing women become sex offenders?'
The PM said: 'We need to prosecute people more effectively for things that are already criminal.'
Earlier Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the International Trade Secretary, said if Mr Johnson Snr had touched her inappropriately, 'I'd have probably slapped him'.
She told Sky News: 'This is something women have, for far too long, had to tolerate – the casual sexism, the wandering hand.'",-2
1585,"THE DARKENED rooms of Mexico’s Museum of Anthropology contain countless relics of civilisations that rose and fell long ago. So it was an eerily suitable setting for the latest round of talks designed to move Venezuela beyond its current, wretched era. With a Norwegian mediator and Mexico’s foreign minister looking on, representatives of Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorial regime and the opposition signed a memorandum of understanding on August 13th, laying out a framework for further talks. The stated goal is to hold fair elections in return for the lifting of international sanctions.
The new negotiations were due to begin on September 3rd (after The Economist went to press). They may go on for months or even years. In Venezuela many people are sceptical. “It’s the same ‘blah blah’ we’ve heard before,” says Nordelys, a teacher in the city of Maracay. It will be the fifth time the government and the opposition have held formal negotiations since Mr Maduro took over from the late Hugo Chávez in 2013. Previous efforts have come to naught. Instead Mr Maduro has consolidated his authoritarian rule, and further impoverished his country. Since 2013 GDP has shrunk by over 75%.


Those behind the negotiations insist that this time is different. “A lot of hard work—on many fronts—has gone on to get us this far,” says a European diplomat in Caracas. Unlike previous talks in Barbados in 2019 and the Dominican Republic in 2017, which were low-key affairs, the meetings in Mexico have international backers. Russia, which has close ties with the Venezuelan military, will attend as one of a “group of friends” of the regime. The Netherlands will assist the opposition.
Optimists note that Donald Trump is no longer in the White House. His policy towards Venezuela was one of “maximum pressure”. That meant ramping up sanctions and vaguely threatening military action. His administration was also instrumental in forming an international coalition of almost 60 nations which recognised Juan Guaidó, an opposition leader, as Venezuela’s legitimate president, on the basis that Mr Maduro had stolen elections in 2018 and was ruling as a dictator. The ambition then was to topple Mr Maduro, not to talk to him.
That policy failed. Although Mr Maduro is supported by only 16% of Venezuelans, according to Datanalisis, a pollster in Caracas, he has all the guns and is prepared to use them. The opposition are exhausted, hungry and scared. Mr Guaidó, who in 2019 was able to bring a million supporters out onto the streets, is no longer a threat. The number of countries that still refer to him as president has dwindled to eight. The army remains solidly behind Mr Maduro, not least because he gives officers golden opportunities to enrich themselves. Nearly 6m people—a fifth of Venezuelans—have emigrated in despair.
That raises the question of why Mr Maduro would bother to send a delegation of negotiators to Mexico. The most basic motive is Machiavellian: a desire to divide his enemies and end the declared “interim presidency” of Mr Guaidó. Perhaps it is no accident that the lead negotiator on the regime side is Jorge Rodríguez, a former vice-president and a trained psychiatrist. Some suggest Mr Rodríguez enjoys playing mind games with an opposition which, for months, agonised over whether it should take part in the talks.
Mr Guaidó and Leopoldo López, an exiled politician who is his mentor, were especially wary. Both have previously argued that Mr Maduro, whom they call a “usurper”, should stand down before serious negotiations about the future of Venezuela can begin. Other members of the opposition, notably Henrique Capriles, a former presidential candidate, have taken a more nuanced stance, arguing that engagement, including participation in far-from-perfect elections, should continue, to avoid becoming politically irrelevant. Mr Guaidó finally agreed to be part of the talks in May. That decision was influenced by the conclusion of President Joe Biden’s administration that there is no quick fix to Venezuela’s disaster. “It’s been an enjoyable spectator sport for us,” admitted a regime ally, referring to the opposition’s dithering.
But beyond taunting a weakened opposition, Mr Maduro also has plenty to gain from successful talks. The main advantage would be at least a partial lifting of sanctions, which have been progressively stacked up against his regime since 2015. Those imposed by the United States target the oil industry, access to capital markets, and on an individual level almost all of the regime’s top brass. The economy has little hope of recovery so long as the sanctions remain in place.
The Biden administration has said it is prepared to offer some relief. It will do so once Mr Maduro’s regime, which has spent the past eight years hijacking all democratic institutions, shows it has changed its ways. The first test of that will come on November 21st, when regional elections are scheduled to choose the country’s 23 governors and 335 mayors.
Most of the opposition stopped participating in elections after those in 2017, in protest at rampant rigging. However on August 31st Unity Platform, an umbrella group of all the main opposition parties, declared it would take part in the vote, while also conceding that the process would probably not be “fair or conventional”. The decision appears to be a show of goodwill towards the talks.
Similarly, earlier that day Freddy Guevara, a prominent politician in Mr Guaidó’s party, unexpectedly called for an end to the combative strategy against Mr Maduro’s regime. “For years, one of the sides has felt strong and has believed it could smash or completely displace the other,” he said. “This dynamic, this vicious circle, has to stop. We need a process of coexistence.” Days earlier he had been released from prison, after being arbitrarily arrested by state security forces in Caracas in July. He may now form part of the opposition’s negotiation team.
Few ordinary Venezuelans expect the Mexico talks to achieve much. But the participants seem strangely confident that change is possible.■",2
1586,"TO FREE-THINKING users of WeChat, a social-media platform, it was a depressingly familiar event. Late on July 6th, those who tried to browse accounts run by LGBT societies at several universities in China were greeted with messages saying the forums, which had been used to publicise events such as webinars and film nights, had been closed for violating unspecified rules. The accounts had probably offended the government, which has little regard for the rights of sexual minorities and even less for freedom of speech.
In the past, such clampdowns have met resistance. In 2018 Weibo, a Twitter-like service, announced a three-month campaign to eradicate pornographic, gay and violent content from its services. In 2019 the platform shut down a discussion group called Les, aimed at homosexual women. It had 140,000 members. In both cases, online anger prompted Weibo to rethink. The service conducted the clean-up, but decided not to suppress content simply for being gay-themed. It allowed the lesbian group to reopen.

This time the online reaction has been more mixed. Many social-media users hailed the closure of the LGBT accounts as a victory for patriots. “External forces are trying to weaken China’s competitiveness by spreading propaganda about LGBT to reduce China’s fertility rate,” wrote one blogger, gathering more than 66,000 views. Some accused LGBT groups of trying to promote a “colour revolution” in China, a reference to uprisings against other autocratic regimes. Hongwei Bao of Nottingham University says popular nationalism in China sometimes adopts the language of the far right in the West. That includes anti-Semitic drivel: one Weibo user with nearly 150,000 followers described LGBT activism as “a culture war initiated by the Jewish elite and the white left”. The term “white left” was coined in China a few years ago to describe Western liberals obsessed with identity politics. Now it is also used to insult Chinese who are deemed to sound like woke Westerners.
Homosexuality has long been vilified as foreign in China. But in the 2000s, as China grappled with rising rates of HIV/AIDS, the government dialled back the bigotry. In 2001 it removed homosexuality from an official list of mental disorders. Since then, at the UN and other international forums, it has gone further by endorsing the rights of LGBT people. At least in big cities, gay people have reported growing acceptance of their sexuality among fellow citizens. “The government doesn’t really care,” says Eric Wang (not his real name), who works for an LGBT-rights organisation in mainland China. “They’ve got more important things to do than oppress us.”
But rising anti-Western sentiment is hampering this progress. Nationalists, egged on by the Communist Party, have become even more vocal during the covid-19 pandemic. They have trumpeted China’s success in controlling the virus while heaping scorn on the West’s fumbling response. Mr Wang says a growing number of Chinese, even those who know gay and transgender people, have started “believing in conspiracy theories”. One is that all LGBT groups are funded by Westerners.
Seker Ma, a graphic designer in the eastern city of Suzhou who was involved with LGBT groups during his recent time at university, says the atmosphere for gay people in China has worsened in the past few months. “A lot of the current wave of patriotism takes this view: ‘Whatever the West supports, we must oppose,’” says Mr Ma.
A worker at an LGBT-rights group in Beijing says that even some gay people think that Western countries use LGBT issues to attack China. Very few such organisations are officially recognised as NGOs—the government views them with deep suspicion. Most are able to operate only by registering as youth centres or charities related to HIV/AIDS. In the build-up to celebrations of the party’s 100th birthday on July 1st, officials warned leaders of such groups to lie low. “We are very vulnerable,” says the LGBT activist. Now nationalism may be posing an even greater threat to their work than the interference of security-obsessed bureaucrats. ■",2
1587,"“THE DISTINCTIVE function of the banker ‘begins as soon as he uses the money of others’; as long as he uses his own money he is only a capitalist,” wrote Walter Bagehot in 1873, quoting Ricardo. This distinction may seem outdated. Institutional investors (hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, private equity) all use other people’s money. Yet Ricardo’s point matters.
Modern institutions are the interface between individuals and their capital. Gains (or losses) are returned to individuals. By investing in this way, people typically deploy their own money, with the fund acting as a mere tool. Banks also use deposits, the money of others, to extend loans. But customers expect to get their deposits back in full: they do not expect to bear the bank’s loan losses in bad years, nor to reap greater rewards in good ones. It is the banks that take both losses and gains.

This process may make banks unstable, but it also gives them a big advantage in financial services, since deposit-taking and lending are complementary. Banks have as a result become providers of any and all financial services that a client needs, from a credit card to a mortgage to investment advice.Yet all these are now under threat. The clout of non-bank financial firms is growing, making the balance-sheets that banks use to support lending less valuable. And tech giants are using the competitive power of their platforms to muscle into banks’ main business. It is as if the entire industry were in a pincer grip that might one day kill it.
Consider such tech apps as Grab in Singapore or Gojek in Indonesia, which both started as ride-hailing services, or Mercado Pago, the financial arm of MercadoLibre, Latin America’s largest e-commerce site. Their model of financial services starts by being a dominant provider of a service that customers use daily. The most advanced examples are AliPay and WeChat Pay in China. Ant Group, the financial offspring of Alibaba, was born out of the fact that shoppers flocking to Alibaba lacked a safe payment method. Alipay was initially just an escrow account to transfer money to sellers after buyers had received their goods, but it was soon launched as an app for mobile use. In 2011 it introduced QR codes for payments, which are trivially easy to generate. Now a shop owner need only display the code to accept money.
This means of payment proliferated, supercharging Alipay’s growth. It has more than 1bn active users and handled $16trn in payments in 2019, nearly 25 times more than PayPal, the biggest online-payment platform outside China. A competitor arrived in 2013 with Tencent, which added a payment function to WeChat, China’s main messaging app. Together the two process some 90% of mobile transactions in China.

The first blow to banks is that both companies earn as little as 0.1% of each transaction, less than banks do from debit cards. Interchange fees around the world have tumbled because of such firms. “It was very lucrative for fintechs to come in and compete these fees away,” says Aakash Rawat of the bank UBS. “In Indonesia they have fallen from 200 basis points to just 70.” But the bigger threat is that payment platforms may become a gateway allowing tech platforms to attract more users. Using data that payment transactions provide, Ant, Grab and Tencent can determine a borrower’s creditworthiness. Ant began consumer lending only in 2014. By 2020 it had already grown to account for about a tenth of the consumer-finance market in China, though regulators are now reining it in.
Banks have traditional ways to assess borrowers’ creditworthiness, such as credit history or current wealth. Often they secure loans against collateral, like homes or cars, minimising the need to monitor an individual borrower. Bob Hope, a comedian, quipped that “a bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it.”
Yet as Agustín Carstens, boss of the Bank for International Settlements, a club of central bankers, said in March, “Data can substitute for collateral.” The information that payment platforms have on users is so plentiful and, until recent crackdowns, the restrictions so lax in China, that Markus Brunnermeier, of Princeton University, talks of “an inverse of the information asymmetry”, in which lenders know more about whether borrowers will repay than borrowers themselves. Big tech and fintech firms have lent $450 per head in China, around 2% of total credit, in five years.
As banks found decades ago, there are synergies between loans and other financial products, like asset management and insurance. Ant muscled into asset management in 2013 with the launch of Yu’e Bao, where shoppers with cash in Alipay earn a small return by parking it in a money-market fund. In 2019 Yu’e Bao briefly became the world’s biggest money-market fund by size, before the central bank put pressure on Ant to shrink it.Ant supplemented this with other investment options and also expanded into life, car and health insurance in partnership with other firms.
Tech firms are using their platforms to reverse-engineer banking.This has even caught on in America, where credit-card sweeteners keep users hooked and payments tech has lagged. Enthusiasm for payment platforms has accelerated during the covid-19 pandemic, which forced shoppers online. PayPal has almost doubled in market value over the past year to more than $310bn, making it the world’s most valuable payment platform.
Stripe, a business-payment provider, is now valued at $95bn, making it the largest private tech company in America.Stripe’s success as a business platform suggests it is not just retail banking that might be under threat, but corporate banking as well. The firm won favour with tiny businesses by making it easier to embed payments in their websites. It has expanded into payroll and cash-management services.
Knowledge can be power
Such platforms cannot do everything a bank does, because they do not have a balance-sheet to sustain lending. A bank’s advantage lies in having deposits to exploit, even if they do not know whom they should lend them to. Tech firms’ advantage is that they know whom to lend to, even if they do not have the funds. So some platforms have decided they would like a balance-sheet. Grab, which is about to go public at a valuation of some $40bn, has acquired a banking licence. If many others took this path banks might remain at the heart of the financial system, though the biggest could be Ant, Grab or Mercado Pago, not HSBC, DBS or Santander Brasil.
But most tech firms have opted against banking licences. They are instead skimming the cream off the top. “Core banking”, the heavily regulated, capital-intensive activity of banks, makes around $3trn in revenue worldwide, and generates a 5-6% return on equity (ROE). Payments and product distribution, the business of the tech firms, yields $2.5trn in sales but with a ROE of 20%.
Ant initially made loans and packaged them as securities sold to other financial institutions. But Jack Ma, its founder, fell foul of the government and regulators. So they demanded that originators of securities hold capital against them, trimming Ant’s margins. The firm’s next approach was to act as a conduit, connecting borrowers with banks, which made the loans. But regulators worried that Ant had too little skin in the game, so demanded it hold more capital. Ant must now rethink its business model.

Banks are not the only institutions that may bid for loans or securities that tech platforms want to flog. The balance of power has shifted towards non-banks. According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a group of regulators, the capitalists are often bigger players. In 2007 global assets of non-bank financial firms stood at $100trn, equivalent to 172% of gross world output and 46% of total assets. In 2019 these assets, at $200trn, constituted 228% of gross world output and half of the total. “The banking system is smaller, as a share of finance, than it was before,” notes Jamie Dimon, boss of JPMorgan Chase.
Banks still dominate the holding of credit and lending assets. Just shy of 40% of all credit assets, including securities and loans, are held by non-banks, though their share is growing fast. It rose by nearly 9% in 2019, whereas banks’ credit assets grew by just 4.6%. Yet banks remain the largest source of specific loans, holding 83% of global lending assets at the end of 2019.
The switch is most obvious in America, which has a history of capital-market growth as far back as the 1940s, when the pots of money raised by mutual-fund managers swelled. The 1980s brought a rush of debt issuance, especially of junk bonds, by companies. And there was a boom in household debt via securitisation, the bundling of loans into bonds that can be bought and sold. Yet nervousness about securitisation after the financial crash means that now, in America, just 20% of financial assets are on banks’ balance-sheets.
Other countries are following America, not least because regulators want banks to reduce their holdings of risky assets. In the euro area, the share of financial assets held by banks fell from around 60% of the total in 2007 to below 40% in 2019. Much of the world still has a long way to go. “In emerging markets, it is a different story. They are very bank-dependent with very limited capital markets. Some of their capital markets are still in their infancy,” says Carmen Reinhart, chief economist at the World Bank.
The rise of tech firms and capital markets is mostly good news. Access to banks can be costly. Some 7m households in America are unbanked, relying on cheque-cashing firms, pawn shops and payday lenders. Credit and debit cards levy fees of 1-4% on merchants, which are remitted to the rich via air miles and credit-card points. This means that the average cash-using household in effect pays $149 over a year to card users, and each card-using household receives $1,133 from cash users, partly in the form of rewards, said a paper in 2010 by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
New payment systems are also easier to use. UPI in India, which links mobile-phone numbers to biometric data and bank accounts, has helped provide cheaper access to financial services for millions of people. Between 2014 and 2018, 315m previously unbanked Indians have opened accounts, depositing more than 800bn rupees ($12bn), and received 237m debit cards.
Most non-banks do not undertake the maturity and liquidity transformation that makes banks vulnerable to runs. According to the FSB, 29% of the $200trn in assets held by non-bank financial institutions take risks typical of banks, though the share is growing. Most assets are held in investment funds that promise more liquidity. They try to match maturities: a pension fund paying retirement income in 30 years is happy to lock its money up in a private-equity fund for a decade or more.
The triumph of these competitors brings clear benefits, but also some risks. There are economies of scale for both banks and tech firms. Big banks spread the fixed costs of branches and marketing over many customers. Payment platforms spread costs over many users. The value proposition for a customer to join a bank scales with size. A bank can offer cheaper products because it has lots of customers. Yet the value proposition for a payment platform grows exponentially with the network, as each new user makes the system more valuable.
Regulators often complain about concentration in the American banking system, but there are four large banks and thousands of smaller ones. Payment platforms’ comparative advantage makes these businesses more likely to reach a winner-take-all end state (rather like Facebook).
Tech monopolies
Today’s debate over technological monopolists focuses on interoperability, particularly of user data. If online behaviour were able to uncover helpful information about whether a customer qualifies for a loan, it would be more useful if it could be accessed by all potential financial providers. The idea of sharing data in this way, called “open banking”, has already been embraced by regulators in Europe. Another concern could be that platforms might exploit their market dominance to create silos that made it easy to do things within a platform, but well-nigh impossible to use stored money elsewhere.
Regulators in China have turned sharply against its fintech giants. Ant’s troubles began last November when they kiboshed its initial public offering. The firm and its peers are now being forced to retract some credit products, to obtain new business licences and to raise more capital—in short to look and act more like a traditional bank. In Europe regulators are similarly nervous. “The authorities are facing the prospect that an increasing amount of data will be collected through payments for other use,” says Jean-Pierre Landau, a former deputy governor of the Banque de France. “Then it becomes impossible to think of the organisation of payments separately from data priorities, which in Europe are focused on protecting the privacy of individuals.”
The risks from the rise of capital markets are different. It may be that bank balance-sheets will fund a smaller share of lending in future, but as banks are the only institutions that can take deposits their role would not disappear. Yet the arrival of a wider range of participants makes life harder for regulators. In 2007-09 the Federal Reserve intervened in capital markets, but went to much greater lengths to prop up commercial and investment banks. In March 2020, banks went unscathed when capital markets seized up. Rather than acting as lender-of-last-resort only to banks, the Fed became market-maker of last resort, intervening directly in credit markets. The scale of this quantitative easing, to the tune of $23.5 trn, surpasses any other in the Fed’s history. Such efforts to stabilise financial markets make it harder for the Fed to avoid picking winners and influencing credit. As the world changes, regulators’ toolkit will have to adapt.■",2
1588,"STARING GLUMLY at his paddy field in the depths of rural Sri Lanka, B. R. Weeraratne sighs. The regular incursions of greedy elephants have been bad enough. But the government’s outright ban on agrochemicals will, he fears, slash his yields of nadu and samba, two of the most popular varieties of rice. Though the 56-year-old likes the idea of organic farming in principle, he thinks “the soil, the plants and the farmers all need time to learn it.” It should be phased in. Otherwise farmers like him may be flung into destitution.
But Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka’s president, is adamant. The former army officer was elected in 2019 largely on his reputation for ruthless dynamism. In 2009, as secretary of defence under his brother Mahinda, then the president, he brutally ended a long civil war against Tamil rebels. As urban-development secretary he “beautified” cities by kicking thousands of people out of slums. As president he has taken a military approach to tackling covid-19 by bringing in the army alongside medical staff. More than 70% of over-11s have been double-jabbed.

Mr Rajapaksa’s military approach to turning Sri Lanka into the world’s first fully organic producer of food overnight looks less encouraging. For sure, his manifesto (“Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”) did promise a revolution in fertiliser use. But it was to have taken ten years. So it was a shock to Mr Weeraratne when a total ban was announced earlier this year. No more agrochemical imports are to be allowed after stocks run out. The Planters’ Association predicts a drop in tea production and export revenue by around 25% in the next six months and thereafter by nearly a half. Sri Lanka is the world’s fourth-largest grower of tea, exporting $1.24bn of the stuff last year, or 1.5% of GDP.
More than 90% of Sri Lanka’s farmers use chemical fertiliser and 85% of them expect crop losses in the coming season, according to Verité Research, a local think-tank; nearly two-thirds broadly back Mr Rajapaksa’s policy but 80% of those say they need at least a year to adjust.
Meanwhile people still need to eat. Inflation is hovering near 6% and food prices are up more than 11%. Rising global commodity prices, declining foreign reserves and ceilings on domestic retail prices have been causing shortages of essentials such as sugar and milk powder. On August 31st the president declared a state of emergency and appointed an army officer to regulate the market, among other things by confiscating stockpiles.
As foodstuffs began to run out, on September 29th he lifted the ceiling on the price of rice, which promptly jumped 17-32%, depending on the variety. Price controls on milk powder, sugar, wheat flour and domestic cooking gas were lifted on October 8th. The government has also, at last, allowed some more imports. Yet its preferred solution for shrinking a trade deficit that has grown to 42% of GDP has been to curb imports, such as fertiliser.
Foreign reserves, at just $2.6bn or enough for six weeks of imports, are shrinking. Between now and July the government must pay $7bn to service its foreign debts. With short-term liabilities so far outweighing reserves, notes Deshal de Mel, an economist at Verité, and Sri Lanka’s credit rating cut to junk by the main agencies, borrowing in global capital markets is all but impossible. Basil Rajapaksa, the finance minister (another brother of the president), admits the situation is bleak. Covid, he says, has contributed to a loss of $8.6bn in revenue. Earnings from tourism, usually $3bn-4bn a year, have collapsed. Remittances from Sri Lankans abroad have fallen 35% compared with a year ago.
Most independent economists reckon that an IMF-backed restructuring programme is the least bad way out. But the government would find it hard to accept conditions that undermine the country’s much-vaunted sovereignty—and above all would squeeze voters such as Mr Weeraratne, who are already disenchanted. Like the country’s crops, the Rajapaksas are, to put it mildly, in need of a pick-me-up.■",2
1589,"IN AN INTERNAL memo to staff in 2016 JPMorgan Chase relaxed its dress code. The American bank’s 240,000 employees could hang up their suits and don business-casual attire—once reserved for casual Fridays—all working week. Some garments remained beyond the pale (T-shirts, flip-flops, tank tops, yoga pants). But many—polo shirts, skirts (of appropriate length), dress sandals—became fair game.
JPMorgan was, sartorially speaking, ahead of its time among stuffy corporate giants (turtlenecks and hoodies have long been the fashion choice of Silicon Valley titans). Others followed suit, as it were. Men’s corporate uniform—and the female power suit designed to mirror it—increasingly came to be seen as a vestige of the male-dominated offices of yore and no longer fit for purpose in a world of greater (though still imperfect) workplace equality. As more and more people ran or cycled to work, they found that changing into a full suit was impractical, since jackets folded into rucksacks tend to lose their crispness.

These days ties are no longer de rigueur in client meetings even for pinstriped investment bankers at Goldman Sachs. Purveyors of formal wear have fallen on hard times. Last year Brooks Brothers, which had been sewing button-down shirts since 1818, filed for bankruptcy. Last month Marks  Spencer, a British retailer, announced it would no longer sell men’s suits in more than half of its bigger stores.
As the pandemic completely decoupled work and presence in the office, employees at many companies switched into something even less starchy. Unlike JPMorgan, however, most have not put any guidelines in place as to what is and isn’t appropriate. Although the Delta variant is forcing companies to delay a return to the office, that day will come. When workers are back at their desks, at least some of the time, new sartorial rules may be required.
Much has been written about what people wore on Zoom calls during lockdowns (and what they did not wear: some retailers report that tops significantly outsold trousers in the past year and a half). Fashion designers like Giles Deacon in Britain have launched “work from anywhere” fashion collections, aiming for slightly looser-cut clothing that nevertheless looks smart. Two Japanese companies, Aoki and Whatever Inc, created pyjama suits—a hybrid of a suit and soft, comfy loungewear—perfect for the video conference attended from home. Aoki uses the same fabric as pyjamas but with a suit-like cut. Whatever Inc’s WFH Jammies are “business on the top, loungewear on the bottom”.
That is not to say that business-casual Fridays have given way to athleisure work weeks. Indeed, some workplaces are already experiencing a backlash against informality. In 2017 Britain’s House of Commons decided that male MPs were no longer required to wear ties when attending debates; previously they could go tieless only on hot summer days. But at the beginning of September this year Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, announced that he expected all parliamentarians to smarten up. Jeans, chinos and sleeveless tops are out.
Looked at in the aggregate, individuals’ clothes speak to more than just personal preferences. People’s sartorial choices add up to a zeitgeist. It is no accident that the cheerful glitz of the 1920s came right after the despondency of the first world war and the Spanish flu. Today’s tailoring brands hope that when the pandemic recedes at last male and female professionals will feel a renewed desire to dress up.
So does Bartleby. Like Sir Lindsay, she would recommend that employees maintain a degree of formal presentation. Yes, some people can pull off a dishevelled look—but not everyone. Dressing with taste and elegance does not have to involve designer clothes or expensive watches. It signals commitment and seriousness. A freshly laundered, crisp shirt announces to the world that you have made an effort; a tracksuit does not.
And if going to the office is a ritual, styling an outfit can be a pleasure, not a chore. The way one dresses is part of his or her self-expression. It also separates the public and the private. Peeling off formal office clothes and slipping into something cosy marks a daily transition from work to non-work. That line was blurred during lockdowns and could do with some sharpening. A man in a suit and tie is a man loosening his tie at the end of the day.

1590,"THE STORY of the Trojan war, as told by Homer and related down the centuries, is one of intrigue and heroes. And, as is the way of characters from Greek mythology, the names of many of those involved have ended up attached to objects in the sky.
In the early 20th century astronomical photography showed that Jupiter, the solar system’s largest planet, was accompanied not only by its moons, but also by more distant acolytes. These were clusters of asteroids that followed the giant planet’s orbit precisely, but either led or trailed Jupiter itself by about 60° of arc.

 Those clusters are centred on places called Lagrange points L4 and L5, after the mathematician who predicted their existence. L4 and L5 are traps in space caused by the interaction of the gravitational fields of Jupiter and the sun. Once in one of them, an asteroid is generally stuck there. Given the division of these captured asteroids into two camps, it amused their early discoverers to call bodies discovered at L4, which leads Jupiter, after Greek heroes of the war, and those at L5, which trails that planet, after Trojans (though each camp also has a spy from the other in its midst).
The siege of Troy
Most known asteroids reside in a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Spectroscopic analysis of sunlight reflected from these, and comparisons with chunks of space rock that have fallen to Earth as meteorites, suggest that some are fragments of dwarf planets which subsequently collided with each other (a few such dwarfs, for example Ceres, remain intact), while the rest are conglomerations of material from the early solar nebula, often including pebbles of once-molten rock called chondrules. Many of the conglomerate-based asteroids are rich in carbon, which makes them dark and vaguely reddish in colour. In particular, their spectra resemble those of chondrule-bearing meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites.
Certain asteroids in the outer part of the main belt are, however, redder still—carbonaceous chondrites on steroids, as it were. These types are also abundant in a second, more distant set of asteroids and dwarf planets, the Kuiper belt, found beyond the orbit of Neptune, of which Pluto is the best-known member. The nuclei of active comets are often objects of this sort. And they constitute, too, the bulk of the members the Greek and Trojan camps.
The distant orbits of these asteroids mean that they do not seem to contribute to the mixture of meteorites that fall to Earth, so there is nothing to compare them with directly. Their colour, though, is suspected to be caused by complex organic molecules similar to terrestrial kerogen collecting on their surfaces. This material’s exact chemistry will reflect where in the solar system these asteroids formed, and thus cast light on how objects moved around in the system’s early days. That makes the Trojans (as the two groups are known collectively) of special interest to those who study the formation of planetary systems. So, on October 16th NASA, America’s space agency,  launched a probe to have a look at them.
Lucy, as this planetary-ancestor-investigating mission is dubbed, after a well-known specimen of Australopithecus, an early hominid, blasted off from Cape Canaveral, in Florida, and will now follow one of the most complex paths around the solar system yet devised by NASA’s orbital navigators. The diagram which shows Lucy’s journey, indicates how the craft will first pick up speed using two velocity-boosting fly-bys of Earth. It will then head for the Greek camp, passing, for a practice run at observation, by way of a convenient main-belt asteroid that the mission’s scientists have named Donaldjohanson, in honour of the discoverer of Lucy the Australopithecine. When it arrives at L4 in 2027, it will encounter five bodies: Eurybates and its tiny satellite Queta, Polymele, Leucus and Orus.
Having examined each of these, it will leave the Greek camp in 2028 and cross, via another velocity-boosting fly-by of Earth, to the Trojan camp at L5. Its final planned encounter, when it reaches L5 in 2033, is with Patroclus and Menoetius.
These were thought to be a single object until 2001, when an examination by the Gemini North telescope, in Hawaii, showed they were actually a pair of rocks, each about 100km across, in orbit around one another. Classicists will recognise Patroclus, the name used when the pair were believed to be one, as the Greek spy in the Trojan camp. It is now the name given to the larger of the two. Menoetius, hurriedly pressed into service to designate the smaller, was Patroclus’s father. (For the curious, the Trojan spy in the Greek camp is Hektor, which is not on Lucy’s itinerary.)
The most widely used classification of asteroids, invented by David Tholen of the University of Hawaii, now recognises 14 spectral types, each called by a letter of the alphabet. Main-belt asteroids are mostly types C (carbon-rich, as with carbonaceous chondrites), M (believed to be metallic, and derived from the cores of dwarf planets) and S (silicaceous, or stony, and either other types of conglomerate or fragments of the outer layers of dwarf planets). Some Trojans are also type C. But the deep-red ones are of rarer types known as D and P—the difference between them being the exact shapes of the curves of their spectra.
To look at its targets in detail (Polymele, Patroclus and Menoetius are type P; Orus and Leucus are type D; and Eurybates and Donaldjohanson are type C), Lucy is equipped with three instruments: a high-resolution camera, an optical and near-infrared spectrometer, and a thermal spectrometer. Together, these will be able to map the various asteroids the probe encounters, and analyse the chemical compositions of their surfaces.
That, in turn, will test the ideas of Harold Levison, the mission’s principle scientific investigator. Dr Levison, who works at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, helped create the Nice model of the solar system’s early days. This hypothesises that the largest planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, have moved around a lot since they formed.
The gravitational effects of all this movement would have scattered asteroids like leaves in a gale, ejecting many of them from the solar system altogether and moving others far from their places of origin. Dr Levison suspects the Trojan D and P asteroids to be such travellers, and that their surface chemistry will show they formed much farther from the sun than Jupiter’s current orbit. The Nice model suggests such distant asteroids would have been scattered, in particular, by the movement of Neptune, which began life closer to the sun than Uranus but is now farther from it, and that some would then have been ensnared by Lagrange’s gravitational traps. If the D and P types Lucy encounters did indeed form far from the sun, that would add weight to the Nice model.
Once Lucy has visited Patroclus and Menoetius its formal mission will be over. These days, however, space probes often have an afterlife beyond the period intended. The New Horizons mission to Pluto, for example, has gone on to observe a second Kuiper-belt object, Arrokoth, and Opportunity, an American Mars rover that had a design life of 90 Martian days, actually operated for 57 times that period. In Lucy’s case, the craft’s final orbit will take it on an endless loop from L5 to L4 and back again. Each loop will take six years. So, if the hardware holds up, there is sufficient fuel left for manoeuvring, and someone is willing to pay to keep the mission team together, other Trojans might yet receive a visit. ■

1591,"A former Target employee has gone viral for quitting in spectacular fashion with a profanity-laden announcement over the PA system at his Chicago store.
Edwin Pos, 21, shared a TikTok video of himself making the exit speech, which he managed to complete before anyone stopped him.
In the clip, he announces to the store that he is quitting 'this f***ing whole-a** job' and calls out several employees by name, including 'that b**** Jessica' and 'Karen-a*** Lucifer Linda.'
The video shows Edwin talking on speaker phone into a phone in an office appears to be connected to the PA system. 
'Attention Target guests. The time is now nine whatever and I quit, I'm quitting this f***ing whole-a** job,' he begins.
'F*** that b**** Jessica and f*** your p**** a** email, that no-lip b**** Linda who [harasses] the style team daily, which is why we call her that Karen-a*** Lucifer Linda. And your mannequins look like s***,' he said.
He also called out a woman named Mary because 'she's a s*** boss and doesn’t give a f*** about her employees,' and said others were 'unprofessional as f***.'
He concluded: 'F*** Target, f*** this store that never has s*** anyways, and f*** management. I quit, now go write an email about that, b****. '
Edwin captioned the video: 'Felt soooooo good. F South loop. But s/o to Harvey for not trynna stop me.'
He later uploaded several follow-up videos, including one of the 's***' mannequins he references. He also said he didn't face any consequences.
'Nothing actually ended up happening after this, I just put on my jacket, I put on my backpack, and I clocked out, and then I walked out. And then as I was walking out, I walked past security, and I heard Amanda, this b***, tell them to go to channel three [on their walkie-talkies] and then they went to channel three and she was telling them something about that she heard something on the speaker.
'But I was already walking out, so I'm sure as I was walking out they were putting two and two together,' he said.
He also shared that one of the things that 'drove me insane': how, during one shift, he got in trouble for retrieving his water bottle from another part of the store when he got thirsty.
'And this f***ing b**** stops me as I was getting my water and was making it seem as if I was loafing or doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing.
'And we had a meeting about it,' he went on, where he recorded what she said.

1592,"CASEY ROSENGREN has been fascinated by religion since he joined (and left) a 12-step recovery group in his early 20s. Since then, the 30-year-old has explored mindfulness, Western Buddhism, the Quakers and mega-church Christianity “to see what all the buzz was about”. One of his most recent forays involves an 83-year-old nun in a convent.
He was introduced to Janet Marchesani, a member of the Dominican Sisters of Hope in New York, by Nuns  Nones, an organisation that sets up meetings between Catholic sisters and people with no religious affiliation in 13 cities. Mr Rosengren and Sister Marchesani became pen pals. Mr Rosengren, an agnostic, says he has no intention of joining a church but has learned “more about what brings life richness in a religious order”.

Nuns  Nones was established by a group of nones in response to two phenomena: the fast-growing number of Americans of no religion—nearly half of millennials say they are “nones”—and the rapid decline of a once-prominent religious tradition. In 1965 there were 180,000 sisters, many of them working in a large network of hospitals and schools. By 2020 they numbered just 41,000. With an average age of over 80 and few vocations, nuns in America are disappearing.
The nones who founded Nuns  Nones say the purpose is not to spark religious conversions but to introduce one generation of “seekers” to another. Brittany Koteles, a co-director, says sisters can offer an example to young people looking for “meaning” thanks to their vow of poverty and social activism (though most nuns don’t call it that). After the Second Vatican Council reforms of the 1960s many sisters, who had held leadership roles as doctors, nurses and teachers when such work was unusual for women, moved into work with the poor. Some became politically outspoken, campaigning for civil rights.
In 2012 the Vatican took over their main umbrella group, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, because it worried that they were focusing on social justice at the expense of the church’s social and sexual teachings. (In 2015 under Pope Francis, the Vatican restored control to the women.) This history has won nuns some fans among young idealists, whether they are interested in the idea of God or not.",2
1593,"ROME, July 13 (Reuters) - Italy on Tuesday banned cruise liners from Venice lagoon to defend its ecosystem and heritage, moving to end years of hesitation and putting the demands of residents and culture bodies above those of the tourist industry.
The government decided to act after the United Nations culture organisation UNESCO threatened to put Italy on a blacklist for not banning liners from the World Heritage site, cabinet sources said.
The ban will take effect from Aug. 1, barring ships weighing more than 25,000 tonnes from the shallow Giudecca Canal that leads past Piazza San Marco, the city's most famous landmark.
""I am proud of a commitment that had been honoured,"" Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said in a tweet announcing the cabinet's approval of the decree, confirming a previous Reuters report.
The legislation, which is likely to affect the business of cruise companies such as Carnival Cruises (CCL.N), provides compensation for firms and workers involved, a culture ministry statement said.
Carnival cruises was not immediately available to comment.
Venice residents and the international community have been urging governments for years to ban large ships passing through the lagoon, polluting and threatening the stability of its buildings and fragile ecosystem.
Such concerns clash with the interests of port authorities and tourist operators who say the city needs the business offered by the cruise industry.
The 25,000-ton threshold will mean only small passenger ferries and goods vessels can use the Giudecca, excluding all cruise liners which typically weigh at least four times as much and can reach more than 200,000 tons.
Francesco Galietti, Italian director of the international cruise industry trade association CLIA, said the group welcomed an alternative route for cruise ships and he called the latest government move ""a major step forward"".
NO DOCKING POINT
Rome has passed legislation numerous times in the past to limit liners' access to one of the world's most famous tourist sites, but an alternative docking point is not yet ready.
Residents protested in June when the 92,000 tonne MSC Orchestra sailed through the lagoon en route for Croatia and Greece, attracting the attention of international media.  read more 
In April, Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government approved a decree to build a terminal outside the lagoon where passenger vessels over 40,000 tons and container ships can berth. The call for bids to build the terminal was published on June 29.
In the meantime, large boats were told to dock at the industrial port of Marghera, but this intermediate solution is not yet ready because Marghera lacks a suitable docking point for liners.
The government's decree appoints a special commissioner to fast-track the docking station at Marghera.
Alessandro Santi, who heads Federagenti, a national shipping lobby, said the government was taking no account of the industry with an approach that was ""regrettable and creates resentment"".
He accused Rome of listening to UNESCO and international culture lobbyists while ignoring local ""citizens and business people"".
""Limiting the passage of ships won't solve the difficulties of Venice as a city,"" he said.",3
1594,"WHEN THE office of Moon Jae-in releases the names of people the South Korean president will pardon on National Liberation Day on August 15th, as is customary, Lee Jae-yong, the de facto boss of Samsung, will not be on the list. That is in keeping with the president’s promise not to use his powers to pardon prominent white-collar criminals “for the good of the economy”, as is also customary.
The absence from the list of Mr Lee’s name should not, however, be seen as evidence that the president has been true to the spirit of his promise. That is because Mr Lee no longer needs the pardon. On August 9th the justice minister said that the erring Samsung boss would be released on parole on August 13th. The decision, he said, took into account the formal requirements for granting parole as well as—what else—the difficult economic situation in the country.

Mr Lee was sent to prison for bribing Park Geun-hye, the previous president, to obtain her government’s support for a merger in 2015 that solidified his control over Samsung. Other leaders of South Korea’s chaebol, or conglomerates, had been lobbying Mr Moon to pardon Mr Lee so he could return to the helm of Samsung and steer the company through intensifying competition with rival chipmakers. They welcomed the decision. So did the conservative opposition, which said it showed that the government cared about fixing the pandemic-pummelled economy.
By contrast, corporate-governance activists and critics from Mr Moon’s own camp were incensed. PSPD, a group that is close to the governing Minjoo party and played an important role in protests that brought down Ms Park in 2017, called the decision a “death sentence” for justice. It said it would encourage business leaders to continue to commit crimes in the expectation that they would get off lightly. Senior Minjoo members said the decision showed the government had betrayed its principles and cared little for fairness.
They have reason to gripe. Formally, Mr Lee has fulfilled the conditions for parole, because the justice ministry changed them in April. Inmates are now required to have served at least 60% of their sentence to become eligible, rather than 80%, as used to be the case.
Unlike the formal requirements, softer criteria for parole, such as admitting the crimes and showing remorse for them, are less obviously fulfilled in Mr Lee’s case. Park Sang-in, an economist at Seoul National University who studies the power of the chaebol, considers freeing Mr Lee extremely unusual given the serious nature of his crimes, let alone the fact that he is still on trial for charges related to the ones for which he was sent to prison in the first place (Mr Lee denies the charges in the case that is still pending). “This is just a way for Moon to let him out without explicitly breaking his election promise,“ he says.
The justice ministry has yet to say whether it will grant Mr Lee an exemption from the employment ban imposed on those convicted of economic crimes and allow him to return to his day job at Samsung. But he is widely expected to do so eventually, even though it is unclear whether his absence has actually had any negative impact on the company’s day-to-day business.
Most South Koreans apparently do not mind much. In two polls conducted in late July, around two-thirds said they were in favour of releasing Mr Lee. They were feeling less generous about crooked politicians, some of whom have in the past been pardoned for their misdeeds by their successors. The majority of respondents in both polls thought Ms Park, who is in prison for taking Mr Lee’s bribes and abusing her power, or Lee Myung-bak, her predecessor, who is there after being convicted in a separate corruption case, should remain locked up. Neither is therefore likely to appear on Mr Moon’s list this time around, reckons Mr Park. As yet ineligible for parole, the pair will probably have to celebrate Liberation Day in their cells—unlike the boss of Samsung.■",2
1595,"THE GAP between astrology and European politics is alarmingly narrow. Both are more art than science, to put it charitably. Both involve professed experts making wildly inaccurate predictions, with metrics that turn out to be nonsense. Because of the peculiarly nocturnal habits of EU leaders, both require work at night.
What astrology and EU-watching most have in common is the need to wait for mysterious bodies about which they know little to align. Where astrologers look to the heavens, Eurologers consult electoral calendars to see their prospects. Just as a person’s future is written in the stars, so the EU’s destiny is shaped by the order of its national votes.

Elections provide the political constellations from which EU officials divine their future, with as much say over the outcome as a pensioner reading a horoscope. Germany, the club’s most important member, heads to the polls on September 26th. Coalition negotiations are predicted to drag on for months, perhaps until January or even spring. At that point, the French presidential election hoves into view with the first round in April 2022, throwing the European zodiac into flux once more.
The EU is often criticised for having a democratic deficit. At the moment it has a democracy surplus. If Brussels truly were a bureaucratic bulldozer, smashing through the wishes of national capitals, officials would not be twiddling their thumbs waiting for a new German government to be formed. Progress on the EU’s most substantial legislation, such as its spending rules, has paused while Germans vote. National politics and European politics may appear far apart, yet they are linked to each other, just as the Moon pulls the oceans’ tides.
But a Copernican revolution is under way in European politics. The EU’s centre of gravity is shifting. For the past 16 years the EU’s grandees have revolved around Angela Merkel. The chancellor, for all her faults, leaves office a remarkably popular politician at home and the dominant force on the continent. Whoever replaces her will not be either. Mrs Merkel’s party won 33% of the vote in 2017. Her successor, whether a Social or Christian Democrat, will be lucky this time to hit 25%. That successor will be so much less experienced than the battle-hardened Mrs Merkel that a vacuum could open up in European politics.
Jupiter is rising to fill it. Emmanuel Macron once promised a “Jupiterian” presidency, resembling not just any god, but the king of the gods. Events dragged him back to Earth. Still, if Mr Macron wins, he becomes the most powerful leader in the club. He would be the first second-term French president in almost 20 years. Jacques Chirac was re-elected mainly due to French disgust at the idea of electing the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen, who sneaked into the final round of voting. This disgust has since waned, but not to a point where it would trouble Mr Macron.
The more optimistic Eurologers see a perfect alignment. Mr Macron is the most ambitious leader when it comes to European reform. If re-elected, his clout may match that ambition. The most likely successor to Mrs Merkel now appears to be Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat who is receptive to the idea of more spending, in coalition with a Green party set on further European integration. In Italy Mario Draghi, the former boss of the European Central Bank, runs a government wedded to overhauling the country’s economy in exchange for some €190bn ($225bn) of EU funds. For the first time in years, governments in the EU’s three biggest countries would see the continent’s future in a similar way.
Much depends on whether Mr Draghi will stay in office long enough. Mr Draghi and Mr Macron are natural allies. A recent one-on-one dinner in Marseilles dragged on well past midnight, with the pair discussing European policy and a Franco-Italian treaty, along the lines of similar agreements between Paris and Berlin. An Italian prime minister with the ear of governments in Germany and France is a rare thing.
Some forecasters are glum. Nationality trumps politics when it comes to finance, warns one commission official. A German Social Democrat may have more in common with his Christian Democrat counterpart than with, say, a centre-left Italian MP. After all, Mr Scholz is campaigning as “continuity Merkel” in a bout of political cross-dressing. Circumstances of birth count for a lot in both European politics and the zodiac.
When you wish upon 12 stars
With so many moving bodies in the political firmament, it is little wonder that Eurocrats wait for a crisis to pursue bold reform. Rather than wait for the perfect moment when action is easy, wait for a terrible moment of dark and deadly portents, when action is necessary. The impression it leaves—that the EU is a body that springs to life only when things go wrong, rather than another level of everyday politics—is an unhealthy one.
But the idea that the EU can be bold only in crisis is a myth. It is sometimes so when the stars are peaceably positioned. During the 1990s and 2000s, when things were comparatively benign both economically and politically, the EU went through a bout of revolutions. It expanded east, introduced the euro and ripped up and rewrote its treaties every few years. It was only in the wake of the financial and covid-19 crises, when panicked constitutional reforms were shunted through by exhausted leaders before markets opened, that the crisis model truly came to the fore.
A political conjunction between Paris, Rome and Berlin is a rare thing. It may not come again soon. Indeed, it may not come at all. Italian politics may revert to its volatile mean. More than 40% of Italian voters look set to back hard-right parties at the next election, due no later than 2023. Mr Macron could bungle the French election, while anything could now happen in Germany. But another asteroid will be along soon enough. Astrologers and Eurologers alike rarely see them coming. ■",2
1596,"“WE WILL BE the guinea pig,” said Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s president, before trade talks with America opened last year. A deal would make Kenya only the second African country after Morocco to sign a free-trade agreement with the United States. Officials in the Trump administration called the proposed deal “a model” for future ones. But such bilateral talks jar with Africa’s push for regional integration and with President Joe Biden’s emphasis on multilateralism. Negotiations are now on hold while America works out what to do next.
The pause reflects a sense of drift in Africa’s trade relations with the West, as both America and Europe rethink how they do business with the continent. In the past they granted concessions, such as lower tariffs on African exports, without requiring African countries to reciprocate. Now they are increasingly looking to negotiate two-way agreements which will open up African markets, too. The old approach was paternalistic and gave Africans little say. But the new one, handled badly, could put Africa’s own integration at risk.

Since 2000 American policy has been built around the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which grants duty-free access to thousands of products exported from around 40 eligible countries. It was a law passed by Congress, not a treaty negotiated between governments, so African countries have no control over the eligibility criteria. That creates friction. Rwanda, for example, was partially suspended in 2018 because its ban on imported second-hand clothes, intended to boost local production, irked the American firms that export them.
Now African countries must wait anxiously to see if Congress will extend AGOA beyond its current expiry date in 2025. The uncertainty makes business “too unpredictable”, sighs a Ugandan technocrat. Kenya’s push for a fully fledged trade deal with America is an attempt to seize the initiative. It also draws on the promise of AGOA itself, which was always envisaged as a stepping stone towards negotiated pacts.
But there is a snag. Kenya is part of the East African Community, which is, on paper, a customs union. If Kenya were to lower barriers to American products, then the other five countries in the bloc would either have to let those products leak into their own markets or tighten border checks to keep them out. Negotiating with countries as a group, rather than individually, would be a less divisive way forward.
Whoever is at the table, many American businesses now favour moving away from AGOA-like trade concessions and towards reciprocal agreements. They do not want to “lose out” while other countries strike deals, says Witney Schneidman, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs. For instance, a refrigerator made in America enters South Africa with a far higher tariff than one made in the EU, notes Mr Schneidman.
Meanwhile European countries are stuck in a quagmire of their own. They once gave preferential access to exports from their former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. That clashed with World Trade Organisation rules. So in 2000 the EU started touting reciprocal deals called “economic partnership agreements”, negotiated with regional blocs. Britain is adopting a similar model in its post-Brexit trade with Africa.
A southern African pact with the EU came into force in 2016. But countries such as Nigeria (in the west African bloc) and Tanzania (in the east) have refused to sign deals in their respective regions. They worry, with some justification, that dropping tariffs would expose nascent industries to a flood of European competition.
The incentive to cut a deal with Europe is also undermined by existing systems of trade preferences, which overlap like onion skins. Peel off one layer, as the EU is doing, and countries like Kenya lose access to European markets—unless they sign up for an economic partnership agreement. But poorer countries such as Tanzania can export duty-free without a deal, thanks to a different layer of benefits. Unsurprisingly the two neighbours in the same east African bloc find themselves at odds.
Yet the whole continent is supposed to be pursuing its own ambitious agenda for integration. This year 37 countries started the gradual process of trading under an African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). They want to kick-start Africa’s stalled industrialisation by selling manufactured goods to each other, rather than raw materials to distant continents. Kenya’s solo negotiations with America “may undermine the AfCFTA”, says Prudence Sebahizi, the African Union’s chief technical adviser on the pact. He fears that American goods may displace African ones in Kenya’s market.
Influential voices urge a rethink. “Rich countries should not be picking African integration apart,” says David Luke of the London School of Economics. Carlos Lopes, the African Union’s representative on future relations with Europe, suggests trade talks with the rest of the world could wait until the AfCFTA is embedded and Africa is ready to negotiate as a single bloc.
Others think that strategy unrealistic. An EU official says Europe shares the vision of an Africa that “can speak with one voice”. But the best way to get there, he says, is to build on existing deals. The AfCFTA is still being assembled. “It’s only when we get an African customs union that Africa can negotiate as a bloc,” says Trudi Hartzenberg of the Trade Law Centre, a South African think-tank, “and that’s a long way off.” Free-trade areas can, and do, overlap.
African countries are caught in a contradiction. Politically they demand to be treated as equal partners, but the economic order remains profoundly unequal. “A Goliath is negotiating with a David,” says Africa Kiiza of SEATINI, a Uganda-based campaign group. “Reciprocity between unequals can’t work.” ■",2
1597,"THIS WEEK’S signing of a trillion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill brought a glimpse of the politics Joe Biden promised to restore. Leaders from both parties gathered on the White House’s south lawn to praise the bulging spending package for roads and bridges. “I ran for president because the only way to move this country forward, in my view, was through compromise and consensus,” said Mr Biden. Conservative talking-heads were meanwhile rowing with his secretary of transportation over whether the concrete structures earmarked for attention were racist.
Pete Buttigieg suggested last week that some were. “If a highway was built for the purpose of dividing a white and a black neighbourhood, or if an underpass was constructed [too low to allow a] bus carrying mostly black and Puerto Rican kids to a beach…that obviously reflects racism.” Tucker Carlson—who claimed the infrastructure bill was not about infrastructure but is a “weird climate scheme/power grab/race-based redistribution plan”—called Mr Buttigieg one of “the dumbest people in the world”.

The 39-year-old, who used the mayoralty of Indiana’s fourth-biggest city to launch an improbable and impressive presidential run, is cerebral. An alumnus of Harvard and Oxford, he was interviewed on the trail in half a dozen languages (including Norwegian, which he learned to read a favourite novelist in the original). He is also right about infrastructural racism. Non-white communities were often bulldozed to make way for the national highway system. It is one of the reasons a typical white family is eight times wealthier than a typical black one—a staggering disparity.
The disdain on the right reflected not only unconcern about racial injustice, but how much the Biden administration has riding on the spending bill. Even if the Democrats pass a $1.85trn companion bill, covering social and climate policy, the infrastructure package will represent much of the legislative record Mr Biden will take into the mid-terms. Mr Buttigieg’s appointment to the Department of Transportation, whose budget has just been increased by over half, was made with that prospect in mind. A large but unglamorous agency, known inside the beltway for geekish efficiency and outside it hardly at all, the department has never before been run by such a rising star. And the similarly geekish Indianan’s task of selling the infrastructure splurge as a presidency-defining triumph has become even more important as Mr Biden’s ratings have slumped. Rarely has the workaday business of fixing bridges and potholes been invested with such desperate hopes.
Alas for the Democrats, even the sexiest lawmaking does not predict mid-term success. Voters responded to the arrival of Medicare in 1965, the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 and Obamacare in 2010 by punishing the president’s party. And they will feel the benefit of better roads far more slowly than they enjoyed those measures. Yet it should be acknowledged that generating wild enthusiasm for humdrum ideas and governing is Mr Buttigieg’s speciality.
A new film about his campaign, “Mayor Pete”, highlights the incongruity between his ordinariness and the passions he stirred. It shows his supporters joyously celebrating as he appeared—dressed like a dapper science teacher, in crisp shirt and tie, no jacket—and thronging to him. He won Iowa, came second in New Hampshire and stirred more excitement than any other candidate except Bernie Sanders. Some of the enthusiasm concerned the historic nature of his candidacy, as an openly gay man. But it was also testament to his ability to spin his thin résumé, as South Bend’s chief rubbish-collector, and unremarkable centrism into a compelling message of moral force and generational change.
Mr Biden, whose own campaign was less memorable, has his best talker where he needs him most. Mr Buttigieg has already visited a dozen states to cheerlead for the impending spending. This has sparked gossip about his future. Vice-president Kamala Harris, whose presidential campaign was even less inspiring than Mr Biden’s, is looking like an increasingly outside bet to succeed him. Some Democrats want to sideline her, whenever Mr Biden bows out, for the more talented Mr Buttigieg. It is crushing for the Democrats that such talk is afoot. (Less than a year into Mr Biden’s first term, they seem less sure of the identity of their next presidential nominee than the Republicans are.) It is also premature; not least because Mr Buttigieg’s increased exposure carries risks.
One concerns the management of the impending splurge. He understands that policy and messaging are only loosely related (with characteristic precocity, he corresponded with the linguist George Lakoff on the subject while still at Harvard). But few messages can survive a failed policy, and his department’s limited control over its resources makes embarrassments inevitable when so much money is sloshing around. Its main responsibilities are to pass safety regulations and funnel cash—mostly under tight congressional guidelines—to state and city governments. How well they spend it will be largely out of Mr Buttigieg’s hands. At the same time, a massive increase in the amount of discretionary spending he will have at his disposal—it will amount to roughly $42bn next year—will both consume him and make him appear more responsible for the entire spending package than he is. Mr Buttigieg used to argue that managing South Bend’s little budget was ideal training for federal leadership. He’d better hope it was.
A bridge to nowhere
Another vulnerability is the administration’s determination to justify all it does in terms of racial justice—as Mr Buttigieg’s recent remarks illustrated. However well-intended, they raised a question of redress for racist planning that he has no answer to. The bulldozed communities cannot be reassembled. He is not planning to favour poor minorities in his spending. Righting historic wrongs does not seem to be part of his remit; so it would be better if he did not raise expectations on the left and blood pressure on the right by suggesting it is. He already has enough on his plate.■

1598,"ONE YEAR ago, America’s Democrats were celebrating: Joe Biden had just made Donald Trump a one-term president. This year’s (much smaller) election day left them in a considerably grimmer mood. In Virginia, Glenn Youngkin became the first Republican to win a gubernatorial race since 2009. Democrats are on course to lose the lower chamber of the statehouse, as well as races for lieutenant-governor and attorney-general. In New Jersey, Phil Murphy, the incumbent governor, came within just a percentage point of losing despite winning by 14 points in 2017. The party’s progressive wing fared even worse: voters in Minneapolis rejected a measure to replace the city’s police department with a “Department of Public Safety,” and a socialist mayoral candidate in Buffalo, New York lost to her defeated primary opponent who was running as a write-in candidate. Partly these results simply hew to form: the party in power tends to fare poorly in off-year elections. But the size and shape of the defeat augurs ill for Democrats’ chances of holding their congressional majorities in next year’s midterm races.
A few factors may have exacerbated the Democrats’ poor performance. Mr Biden had hoped to have Democratic candidates boasting about all the party has accomplished so far. But his congressional agenda has stalled amid factional party infighting, which may have depressed the base. Terry McAuliffe, whom Mr Youngkin defeated, ran a flat-footed campaign focused almost entirely on Mr Trump, who was not on the ballot. Moderate Republican voters who supported Mr Biden last year to get Mr Trump out of office may have found their way back home.

Mr Youngkin, by contrast, appeared moderate enough for moderates and Trumpy enough for farther-right voters, running up Belarusian margins in white rural counties. His campaign focused on parents’ rights and education; he vowed to ban critical-race theory from being taught in schools (which it is not). Mr McAuliffe called that tactic a racist dog-whistle, but failed to muster a more persuasive response or present a broader positive vision for the state. New Jersey’s race followed a similar pattern. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor, ran a moderate campaign focused on cutting taxes, and he avoided mentioning Mr Trump. That may have helped him win independents, while Mr Murphy’s low-key style (perhaps along with some complacency) may have kept Democratic turnout low.
The bigger force at play, however, is the typical backlash against the party that controls the White House. The off-year Virginia governor’s race has swung against a newly elected president in every contest since 1981. The average swing in vote margins against the incumbent party is about ten percentage points, though the penalty can be as high as 17 in rare cases. In comparison, the two Democrats’ margins in New Jersey and Virginia were 14 percentage points lower on average than Mr Biden’s margin against Mr Trump there in 2020. In other words, the merits or detriments of individual candidates notwithstanding, Democrats faced predictable patterns of revolt against the ruling party.
Democracy in America is “thermostatic”, observed Christopher Wlezien, a political scientist, in a 1995 journal article establishing a theory of politics bearing the same name. He used data on preferences and levels of government spending to show they move in a slightly inverse relationship. As the government spends more money, people want it to spend less—and vice versa. And elections are also somewhat thermostatic. Once a party takes power, its members tend to become the target of peoples’ dissatisfactions about whatever grievances they have against their government, and they get voted out. The nationwide swings against Democrats on Tuesday are further evidence of this trend. Covid-19 and supply-chain woes, for instance, may not be Mr Biden’s fault, but the president takes the blame.
Yet this implies Democrats are powerless to combat electoral losses, which they are not. Though results from elsewhere in the country seem to offer hints on the surface, they do not offer a clear answer to the party’s dilemmas. Much has been made of the results of a referendum to replace the police department in Minneapolis, Minnesota with a “Department of Public Safety” that would have been focused less on punishment and traditional law-enforcement tactics and more on addressing social inequities and causes of crime. The failure of such a “woke” pipe-dream in a liberal city could be seen as a rebuke of the Democratic Party’s most left-leaning members and their toxicity to the brand, were it not for the results of a vote in Austin, Texas, where voters rejected a proposition that would have increased the funding and staffing for their own cops. More than anything the mood among America’s voters seemed to be a reflection of the general unpopularity of the Democratic Party and its leader.
The thermostat will probably continue to get colder. Not only have voters tended to side against presidents in off-year governors’ races, they also tend to punish them in mid-term elections to Congress. Since 1934, the party controlling the White House has lost an average of 28 seats in the House and four seats in the Senate. A thermostatic backlash threatens the party’s control of Congress for at least five years, and perhaps the next four after that.
Were Mr Biden or Kamala Harris, his vice-president, to win the presidential election in 2024 but lose in 2028 (presidents usually win two terms), thermostatic dynamics would not favour the Democrats until the first mid-term of a Republican presidency in 2030. But even in the scenario Mr Biden or some other Democrat were to lose in 2024 and Democrats regain control of Congress in 2026, that would still leave them without legislative power for two cycles after next year’s mid-terms. If the results on November 3rd stem largely from the typical patterns of American politics, they portend a dark decade ahead for the Democrats, notwithstanding Mr Biden’s plummeting approval ratings. And this week’s shellacking suggests that the party has no sound strategy for how to combat such trends.

1599,"FOR SEVERAL big reasons it is misleading, even morally indecent, when commentators assert that China is embarking on a new Cultural Revolution. It is true that the Communist Party is today more visible and assertive than at any time since Mao Zedong’s death in 1976. After Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012, he unblushingly re-emphasised the party’s authority over everything from the machinery of state and the armed forces to the judiciary, universities and news media.
It is also true that the rich and famous are under harsher scrutiny than they have known for decades. Tycoons and film stars have received painful reminders that they enjoy their success at the party’s pleasure. Some have lost fortunes or seen careers ended for defying China’s leaders, or for provoking public opinion with displays of swaggering privilege. Others have hastened to donate money and time to patriotic causes. New rules ban effeminate actors from television and curb how many hours youngsters spend on video games. State power is now invested in one man, Mr Xi, in a way not seen since the Mao era. Whether issuing textbooks in Xi Jinping Thought to six-year-old children or using smartphone apps to ensure that officials study Mr Xi’s wisdom, the leader’s sternly paternal presence is felt in every corner of life.

Yet this is not a return of the Cultural Revolution. Most simply, between 1966 and 1976 Mao and his inner circle unleashed such horrors on China that it dishonours their victims to take that decade’s name in vain. Scholars outside China, drawing on often-secret official reports from the 1980s, estimate that 1.6m died, with the lives of many millions more ruined. Much attention has been paid to the youngest Red Guards: Mao-revering students or youths who persecuted everyone from ex-landlords to intellectuals and artists, religious believers and, not least, officials accused of being reactionary. But more casualties died in fighting between rival, adult Red Guard factions or with army units. The violence at times resembled a civil war, set in motion after Mao came to doubt the loyalty and revolutionary fervour of the ruling establishment. In contrast, Mr Xi and his inner circle are iron-fisted party-builders, not friends to rebels. They have purged internal rivals, dissenters and the corrupt. The party is now attacking what it deems the excesses of capitalism. The goal is stability and conformity, with all China marching in lockstep towards national greatness.
Those are large reasons to avoid miscasting Mr Xi as a second Mao. But there are myriad smaller ones, too. By way of a case study, consider an ongoing campaign against “superstitious” ways of mourning the dead, specifically by burning imitation banknotes and paper models of goods that loved-ones might need in the afterlife. In addition to funeral offerings, goods are burned for the dead at various annual holidays. One coming soon is Hanyi Jie, or the Winter Clothing Festival, when paper replicas of warm clothes may be seen burning on city pavements or in village courtyards. In August nationwide debate was sparked by news reports that Shanxi, a northern province, had drafted rules banning the making or selling of funeral supplies, such as paper models of people, horses and houses; or imitation money. This was not the first such online uproar. Other provinces, cities and counties have tried to stop or restrict the burning of paper offerings several times. Officials call the practice superstitious, a source of air pollution, a fire hazard and extravagant, scolding citizens to spend money on caring for the old, not when burying them.
China’s best-known paper funeral-goods come from one place. Mibeizhuang, an unlovely village in Hebei province 120km south of Beijing, was famed for silk flowers as far back the Qing dynasty. Locals boast that wreaths at Mao’s funeral came from Mibeizhuang. The village became a nationwide hub for funeral-goods when market reforms began in the 1980s. When Chaguan visited on a recent weekday, shopkeepers had bundles of paper suits and fur-collared coats ready for Hanyi Jie. A group of four men, funeral organisers from Wu’an, a rural town 400km to the south-west, loaded a small truck with cardboard models of trees covered in gold coins, food-stuffed fridges, televisions and pink, colonnaded mansions. A set of such models sells for less than 50 yuan ($7.76).
For centuries in China, honouring the dead lay at the heart of codes of virtuous behaviour. In imperial times, children studied models of filial piety including Dong Yong, a man so poor that he sold himself into servitude to bury his father properly. During the Cultural Revolution, ancestral and clan temples were ransacked, while family altars in Chinese homes were smashed by Red Guards or hidden for safety by their owners. When victims of Maoist violence were burned or buried without ceremony, the lack of proper rites was an extra stab of agony for grieving families.
The party will not admit it, but Mao traumatised China
Today, once-cherished customs have a markedly weaker grip. Asked whether customers believe that burned funeral-goods reach relatives in the afterlife, traders in Mibeizhuang are incredulous. “What day and age is this? It is just a tradition,” says one. A third-generation seller of paper offerings scoffs: “I don’t even believe in it. Spending money on this stuff is like throwing it away.”
The traders have watched injunctions against their industry tightening for years, especially in cities. They are cynical, saying that officials who oppose burning funeral-goods will sneak home to burn paper models for their own parents. But they are resigned to the possibility that their trade may end one day. “We set off firecrackers for thousands of years. Now it is not allowed and has stopped,” explains one, calling modern-day Chinese “obedient”.
It is hard to start new rows about feudal superstition, precisely because the Cultural Revolution tore up so many roots that tied Chinese to the past. Today’s China is bossy, socially conservative and relentlessly controlling. Its rise as an authoritarian giant is disruptive enough without mistaking it for Maoist fanaticism.■",2
1600,"THREE MONTHS after Mr Bolsonaro became president, he ordered the army to mark the 55th anniversary of the coup. His press office distributed a video in which a man explains that the 1960s were a “time of fear”. Communists were “killing their compatriots” in the name of a leftist ideology. The public took to the streets, begging for intervention. Then “Brazil remembered that it had an army.” Black and white shifts to colour as the music picks up and Brazil’s flag appears. “The army saved us,” the man says.
Brazil’s military dictatorship killed 434 people, far fewer than regimes in Argentina and Chile did. That partly explains how, after handing power back to a civilian government in 1985, the army became the institution Brazilians trust most. It is also why Mr Bolsonaro was able to exploit his military past to be elected.

The generals who joined his government hoped to advance the army’s agenda. Instead they hurt its reputation. They were complicit in Mr Bolsonaro’s mishandling of the pandemic, which led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. They failed to get him to sign vaccine contracts or to stop him greeting supporters when he caught covid-19. Under Mr Pazuello, the health ministry resembled a boca de fumo (drug den) for hydroxychloroquine. At one point it launched an app for doctors that recommended the drug to nearly everyone, including infants and people with hangovers.
Yet the army has so far held Mr Bolsonaro back from an anti-democratic “adventure”, in the words of Mr Santos Cruz. How long it can do this is less clear. Mr Bolsonaro may try to cling to power if he loses next year by claiming he has won and inciting protests. “Only God will remove me,” he has said. He says electronic voting is subject to fraud and he has eased gun laws to “arm the people” against “dictators”. His fans include police and thugs. The army may find it has to choose between democracy and Mr Bolsonaro.
Other Brazilian institutions have survived his assaults, though their resistance can resemble a game of whack-a-mole. In May, after police began a defamation investigation into a YouTuber who had called Mr Bolsonaro a “genocidaire,” a judge threw out the case. Another judge quashed a probe into Almir Suruí and other indigenous leaders accused of “lies” about government failings in the pandemic. Folha de S. Paulo, a newspaper, denounced censorship by printing an op-ed of 185 insulting names for the president, including “tyrant”, “butcher” and “donkey”.
But while the courts have rebuffed Mr Bolsonaro’s authoritarianism, other institutions have suffered at the hands of his loyalists. After Congress blocked two decrees to give the agriculture ministry control over indigenous land claims, Funai changed its policy to allow farmers to claim ownership of tribal lands not yet officially demarcated. Police and prosecutors are investigating allies and sons of the president, but that has cost some their jobs. Mr Bolsonaro has named one pliant supreme-court justice and will be able to pick another this year.
If he manages to win re-election (by fair means or foul) he could nominate two more. His attacks on democracy would then become more brazen. His more radical fans shun institutions and see him as their saviour. The bolsonarista who said she wants civil war once camped outside Mr Moro’s court. When he quit and accused the president of obstructing justice, she replaced her pro-Moro T-shirt with one saying, “I would go to war for Bolsonaro”.
Four more years of him in charge could devastate the Amazon, where much of the rainforest could turn into dry savannah. Mr Bolsonaro prefers losing a trade deal with the EU to changing his environmental policy. That would be bad for the whole country, which has been going in the wrong direction for a decade. Growth is stuck, jobs are scarce, millions of people are hungry and politicians think only of themselves. For a country that likes to party, there is little to celebrate.
In 2018 only 14% of Brazilians said they trusted the supreme court “a lot” and 3% trusted Congress. Mr Bolsonaro exploited such disillusion to win election. His rivals in 2022 must turn it against him. Polls suggest Lula would win a runoff. But as vaccination and the economy pick up, the president may regain ground. Lula must show how his handling of the pandemic has cost lives and livelihoods, and how he has ruled for his family not for Brazil. The ex-president should offer solutions, not saudades (nostalgia).
On March 31st, the anniversary of the coup, six potential challengers to Mr Bolsonaro signed a manifesto saying democracy was “under threat.” Saving it will take more than manifestos. Politicians need to tackle overdue economic reforms. Courts must crack down on corruption. And businesses, NGOs and ordinary Brazilians must protest in favour of the Amazon and the constitution. But it will be hard to change Brazil’s course so long as Mr Bolsonaro is president. The most urgent priority is to vote him out.■

1601,"LOCALS CALL it “lover’s paradise”. Upvan, a picturesque lake in Thane, a satellite city of Mumbai, attracts its share of joggers, cyclists and pot-smoking college students. But mostly the lane surrounding the lake is filled with young couples getting cosy under umbrellas. Every Indian city has such spots, where skittish lovebirds find privacy out in the open. A socially conservative culture, small flats, joint families, pricey hotels and uptight hotel-owners mean that there is often nowhere else to go.
That is starting to change. “Love hotels”, which offer (very) short-stay rooms to unmarried couples, are a well-established concept in other Asian countries. But they have been a hard sell in India, says Prateek Singh, a co-founder of Brevistay, an app for hourly bookings at some 1,500 hotels. “The challenge was not convincing hotel owners of the business model, but changing their mindset.”

What couples need is a room, not judgment, says Amit Sharma of StayUncle, a similar service that offers rooms, including gay-friendly ones, in some 1,800 hotels. That is not a popular opinion in a country where moral policing is common. For years couples celebrating Valentine’s Day in Mumbai would be harassed and sometimes rounded up by the police. In March the chief minister of Uttarakhand, in northern India, bemoaned the state of the country after encountering women “showing their knees” in ripped jeans. Last month a state-run park in Hyderabad erected a notice announcing that “unmarried couples are not allowed inside the park”. It was taken down after a public uproar. “We need to be mature about the whole thing,” says an exasperated Amit Chakrabarty, who works at a hotel in Kolkata.
As in any other business, pleasing customers is the key, says Sikender Yadav, whose hotels in Delhi are listed on StayUncle. About one in ten bookings involve extra services, such as room decoration packages. Errant lovers sometimes ask management to spell out “sorry” with flower petals on the bed.
Apps do their bit to spice things up too. “We are all clean for you to get dirty,” runs a StayUncle slogan. The outfit supplies some rooms with a free “love kit” that includes chocolates and condoms. Mr Sharma says he intends to elevate the “in-room experience” by providing smart speakers and Spotify accounts. More ambitious plans include trying to convince hotels to soundproof their rooms. “We are not in the hotel business,” he says, “but in the freedom-of-expression business.”",2
1602,"FROM MONTE CARLO to Marbella to Milan, no glamorous destination is complete without a Nobu. The chain of gourmand-luring Japanese-Peruvian restaurants has become a staple in practically every tourist hotspot. In each location, a well-off clientele stuff themselves with chunks of black cod soaked in miso and yellowfin-tuna tartare while a DJ in expensive-looking spectacles plays unobtrusive house music.
Last summer Warsaw became the latest and, at first appearances, least likely addition to the list. Varsovians took to it well. With dishes from 25 zloty (€5.50 or $6.50) for edamame beans to 170 zloty for the signature black-cod dish, the place was crammed most nights, lockdowns permitting. Nobu’s stash of sake was designed to last for 18 months; it was downed in three. The average spend on opening was higher than in the branch in Monte Carlo.

Rich Poles devouring sashimi reveal more than just a latent love of raw fish. Ultimately they tell a story of European convergence. At the EU’s heart is a simple bet: thanks to the magic of the free movement of goods, capital, services and people, its 27 divergent economies will move together, until a life lived in, say, France is of a comparable standard to one lived in Poland. Normally, convergence is shown by a line marked Poland on a GDP chart grinding its way towards ones marked Italy, France and (still quite far out of reach) Germany. But convergence is about more than just capital. To understand it better, look at a city’s restaurants.
Nobu is the top end of Warsaw’s booming restaurant scene, which has turned from a stodgy affair into one of Europe’s most vibrant. Nolita, a fancy restaurant, allows patrons to feast on wasabi- and teriyaki-covered octopus. A glut of vegan restaurants has made the city an unlikely mecca for those who spurn animal products. Venues serving Polish fare have flipped a once joyless culinary culture into one that is varied and, at times, excellent.
This helps convergence in a few ways. Playing catch-up with neighbours is difficult to do if a country’s brightest are tempted to leave. Wages are still about three times higher in Germany and the Netherlands. But ambitious young Poles head to places like Berlin or Amsterdam not just so they can earn more, but because they are fun places to live. There is less incentive to leave when there is a throbbing city at home.
There is also a greater push to return. After working in Michelin-starred restaurants in Britain and Denmark in the first half of his career, Robert Trzópek returned to Poland a decade ago. At that time, it was still tricky to find a market for fine dining. Now, however, his restaurant, Bez Gwiazdek, which each month serves food exclusively from a different region of Poland, is packed on a Tuesday night in August. Varsovians tuck into small plates of tomatoes with fermented strawberries along with potatoes, cottage cheese and caviar.
Better nosh also offers an incentive to potential new arrivals, rather than returnees. If places such as Warsaw are to attract well-paid commodities traders as well as back-office staff, then they must become better places to live. It is a way of solving the footballers’-wives conundrum. Roy Keane, a former manager of Sunderland AFC, a football club in an unfashionable city in north-east England, complained that players were reluctant to sign as their spouses would rather live in London or Manchester. Nicer grub is one part of the solution.
Restaurants provide the starkest example of Poland’s demographic convergence with the rest of the EU. Poland has, like its Western neighbours, become a country of mass immigration. Before the pandemic, in 2019, Poland issued 724,000 residency permits to people from outside the EU—around 260,000 more than Germany, the second-highest. To see the inflow’s effect, head to a bar or a restaurant in Warsaw, where the staff will usually be Belarusian or Ukrainian. Order a takeaway and the rider delivering it will often hail from South Asia.
Convergence can also be a question of changing social mores. Again, restaurants demonstrate it best. Poland’s ruling right-wing Law and Justice party are enthusiastic homophobes, while local politicians bait gay people with “LGBT-free zones”. Eateries in Warsaw are leading the riposte. At Youmiko, a vegan sushi restaurant, a pride flag on the door is captioned “You’re at home here”. Politics even lurks behind the rise of vegetarian and vegan restaurants, argues Alex Webber, who edits Warsaw Insider, a city guide. In 2016 Poland’s then foreign minister spelled out a vision of a nightmarish future with a “mix of cultures and races, a world of bicyclists and vegetarians”. Eating vegan ramen is a small but delicious act of resistance.
Europe will be forged in ceviche
The drawback of convergence is homogenisation. Eating in Warsaw is sometimes a disorienting experience. In some venues one could be in Berlin, or Madrid or Amsterdam: the food would be the same, as would the furniture and the font on the menu. Even the waiter would sport the same tattoos and beard. Some in Warsaw worry the city is losing its sense of self. Ironically, that fear of homogenisation is shared by the right-wing government. If liberals worry about restaurants becoming samey, conservatives fear being dragged into the European mainstream when it comes to gay rights or abortion, which is almost completely illegal in Poland.
Convergence via consumption can go only so far. It will take higher wages, better schools and bigger prospects for those who stay before Poland can catch up with its neighbours. Would a high-flying Polish woman want to stay in a country where the government sees her as little more than a baby-machine? Would a gay person be content in a society determined to deprive him of certain rights? Still, Warsaw can be a cosmopolitan dream, even if the Polish government is, at times, a nightmare. A plate of black cod and a bowl of vegan ramen is not much. But it is a start. ■",2
1603,"ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, master tactician? The president of Belarus has brought thousands of migrants from the Middle East to the EU’s doorstep on the eve of winter, daring the bloc to abandon its humanitarian instincts as the world looks on. Mr Lukashenko seems to have intended to reignite the internal division and political upheaval that followed the influx of migrants to Europe in 2015. He has instead forged a consensus in favour of the swift punishment of his regime.
The scenes that have unfolded at the Polish-Belarusian border since November 8th were his concoction. Belarusian travel agents in Iraq offer flights, a visa and the sham promise of an easy path to a new life in Europe in exchange for thousands of dollars. Arrivals in Minsk are whisked through the woods to a spot on the border where, far from swiftly crossing into Poland and embarking on the supposed opportunity to move around the Schengen free-travel zone, migrants end up squeezed between the EU’s razor-wire fences and Belarusian men with guns, unable to go forward or back. As The Economist went to press on November 11th, some 2,000 were trapped near the current main point of concern, the Kuznica crossing (see map). There have been a number of attempts to breach the border there. An estimated 20,000 migrants are thought to be elsewhere in Belarus, with more still continuing to fly in via Istanbul and other Middle Eastern cities on Belavia, the Belarusian state carrier.

Mr Lukashenko’s foreign policy has increasingly resembled that of a mafia boss since his theft of elections last year. He has sent goons after dissidents who fled abroad. He is angry at the countries sheltering them, chiefly Poland and Lithuania, and at the entire EU for the sanctions it has imposed on his regime. The ambition of those sanctions was scaled back thanks to lobbying by affected industries, from Austrian banks to Lithuanian railways. Now the political will to deter Mr Lukashenko has hardened. The EU is hinting at fresh sanctions, including on Belavia, possibly as soon as next week. The hitherto hesitant Irish government, whose firms lease planes to the airline, has come on board.

That does not mean that keeping migrants off the route to Belarus will be easy. The EU wants to install officials at airports across the Middle East to prod Iraqi passengers with awkward questions before they embark. But that will take time. Angela Merkel, Germany’s outgoing chancellor, has asked Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to talk Mr Lukashenko out of his plotting. Her chances of success seem slim.
Poland sees deterrence as the best way to stem the influx, and so is determined not to admit any of the migrants gathering at its gates. Its populist government has waved away offers of help from Frontex, the EU’s border agency. A camp has sprung up on the Belarusian side, and a lengthy battle of wills is likely. Meanwhile, the migrants are in danger. A freezing winter approaches. And Mr Lukashenko is willing to make people suffer, if the television footage causes problems in Europe. ■",2
1604,"LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The standard setter for global trade finance flows has proposed a new set of rules to define sustainability in the trade finance arena, worth some $5 trillion a year, an executive told Reuters.
While governments and business sectors move quickly to set guidelines for some types of sustainable finance, there are no standards for trade finance. Those rules would apply to a third of global trade.
Agreeing on a common rulebook could help direct more trade flows toward efforts that reduce climate-warming emissions and that also meet the United Nations' development goals, said Andrew Wilson, policy director at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
While others have begun to set definitions for parts of the sustainable finance industry, such as green bonds, ""none of those frameworks can be easily or reliably applied to the financing of trade,"" Wilson said on the sidelines of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.
A framework for trade finance is considered more complicated as more parties are involved and entire supply chains need to be monitored, he said.
Banks and companies are assessing the sustainability of their trade deals in different ways that can be hard to reconcile.
On Wednesday, the ICC released a position paper that it expects to be formalised as guidelines in 2022. The paper was produced with the Boston Consulting Group based on input from more than 200 companies and banks including HSBC (HSBA.L), Santander (SAN.MC) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE).
More input would be sought, including with civil society and governments, before the framework is finalised to ensure support and consistency between the banks in how they classify transactions.
If the framework is considered workable, the ICC would look to develop sectoral standards for specific types of transactions, Wilson said.
While the ICC rules are not compulsory, the group is a recognised standard-setter, Wilson said, noting that its decisions are often referred to in court decisions.
He said he expected the framework to be under consultation until the second quarter of 2022, when a more detailed framework would be delivered. Final rules would then come in the third quarter.",3
1605,"A school which sparked outrage by cancelling Winston Churchill and JK Rowling for not being diverse insisted the change was 'led by pupils' as it begged parents 'Hope you will support us'. 
Holy Trinity Church of England Primary School in Richmond previously had houses named after the Prime Minister and the Harry Potter author - alongside Sir David Attenborough and Emmeline Pankhurst.
The school - which caters for young children aged three to 11 - claims pupils had asked for the house names to be more diverse. 
It then replaced Churchill and Rowling with England star Marcus Rashford and nurse Mary Seacole.
After MailOnline broke the story, school chair of governors Michele Marcus desperately tried to shore up backing from mothers and father of pupils.
In a newsletter today she urged: 'The change was entirely driven and led by our pupils and they feel proud of having effected this change and knowing their views were heard.
'There may be further interest in the subject and I hope you will support the school in our position.' 
The school, whose headteacher is Alison Bateman, timed the announcement of the changes to coincide with Black History Month in October.
While some are happy with the recognition of school meals campaigner Rashford and Crimean War lifesaver Seacole, parents think the school decided to cancel Churchill and Rowling because they are deemed controversial figures.  
Earlier in the day one parent told MailOnline:  'A lot of us are quite shocked that the school authorities have decided that the contributions of Churchill and Rowling deserve to be erased from the records without so much as a consultation with parents.
'Presumably this has happened party due to the supposed thoughtcrimes committed by these two national figures. For context, the other two – unchanged - house names are 'Pankhurst' and 'Attenborough'.
'I am not alone in feeling appalled that this cowardly action has been taken.'
Churchill - voted the Greatest ever Briton in previous national polls - has recently been accused of racism over his alleged inaction in the 1943 Bengal Famine in India and views on Indian independence.
Rowling has been accused of transphobia after commenting on an online article about 'people who menstruate', questioning why they were not just called 'women'. 
Members of the school's Junior Leadership Team drew up a list of names for possible replacements, which the children then voted on.
The school - which is affiliated to the Diocese of Southwark - announced the changes in a recent newsletter.
It said: 'The children across school have been keen to change some of the names of the school houses to be more diverse.
'The JLT compiled a shortlist and the children have been involved in voting.
'We are pleased to be able to announce the name changes during Black History Month. Churchill has been replaced by Rashford and Rowling by Seacole.'
MailOnline contacted the school to ask why Churchill and Rowling had been selected for replacement and by whom.
It was also asked which other names were on the shortlist and whether the diocese was consulted over the changes.
Head teacher Ms Bateman said: 'The changing of our school's house names was an activity that our children began discussing last year as they did not feel the names reflected the diverse community of our school.
'There was much discussion in classrooms before children voted for the names they wanted to change, and then the new names they wanted to use. 
Mary Seacole is regarded as the greatest black Briton, a woman who did more to advance the cause of nursing - and race relations - than almost any other individual.
On the bloody battlefields of the Crimea, she is said to have saved the lives of countless wounded soldiers, and nursed them back to health in a clinic she paid for out of her own pocket.
But some historians have long complained that she has become almost as famous as that other nursing heroine, Florence Nightingale.
For decades after her death in 1881, Seacole's story was largely overlooked, but for the past 15 years, her reputation and exploits have undergone a remarkable rehabilitation.
Every schoolchild is taught about her achievements, she is a statutory part of the National Curriculum, and for many, she is seen as a secular saint.
Numerous schools, hospitals and universities have rooms or buildings named after her, and shortly she will get her greatest tribute yet: an 8ft tall bronze statue was erected to her memory in the grounds of St Thomas's Hospital, facing towards the Houses of Parliament.
'It is important to us that we reflect what is important to our pupils and their families, not just through their learning, but in the environment they learn in. It is important that childrens' voices are heard and this is why we supported their choice to have our house names reflect diversity, equality and the environment.
'We have a lot of support from parents, some of whom have themselves challenged us in the past about the lack of diversity in the names. We also have the full support of our Governors and the Diocese of Southwark.'
Churchill and Rowling have been victims of cancel culture among a number of organisations for the past few years.
In September Downing Street condemned the 'absurd airbrushing' of Sir Winston's full name from the charity set up in his memory and urged its bosses to reverse the decision also branded 'ridiculous' and 're-writing history'.
The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust removed pictures of the wartime leader from its website and is changing its name to the Churchill Fellowship.
It also started carrying a statement on its website calling the wartime PM's views on race 'unacceptable today, a view that we share'. 
Loyal volunteers at the trust said it was 'rewriting history' and pointed out the former prime minister has frequently been voted the greatest Briton of all time.
One said: 'It beggars belief that the man who saved this nation in our darkest hour finds himself cancelled in this way.' 
Yesterday it was announced the cast and crew of the Harry Potter movies were coming together for a reunion, without the author, JK Rowling.
HBO Max announced on Tuesday it would bring together the cast members from all eight Harry Potter films for a retrospective special entitled Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return To Hogwarts. 
The release said it would feature stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint - who have not made a public appearance together since the premiere of the last premiere of the franchise, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2, in July 2011, as well as filmmaker Chris Columbus, who directed the blockbuster film. 
But the release does not mention the person responsible for the creation of the characters, author JK Rowling, who has been criticised for her views on transgender people.
She had been accused of transphobia after saying that only women can menstruate.",-2
1606,"ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD can seldom be stood up by mere insinuation of fishiness. But with scant evidence, one Republican Party poll-watcher in Detroit fell back on that in 2020. In a notarised statement presented by the Trump campaign, the onlooker noted that most of the military ballots he “saw were straight ticket Democrat or simply had Joe Biden’s name filled in on them”. “I had always been told that military personnel tended to be more conservative, so this stuck out to me as the day went on,” he added. Although military voters and their families do tilt conservative (see chart), there is little evidence that they are a Republican constituency. In fact, analysis by The Economist suggests that Mr Trump performed far worse in 2020 across precincts that map onto military bases than he did four years earlier.
The political leanings of service members are difficult to measure. The Department of Defence–reluctant to poll active duty soldiers about their commander-in-chief and his party—rarely approves external political surveys. And while today’s soldiers are encouraged to exercise their right to vote, for some, including a number of America’s most distinguished generals, non-partisanship has precluded boots in the ballot box. General George C. Marshall once wrote, “I have never voted, my father was a Democrat, my mother was a Republican, and I am an Episcopalian.”

“There’s a broader narrative that the military is monolithically conservative or Republican, and that just really isn’t the case, or at least is not any more”, says Danielle Lupton, a scholar of civil-military relations at Colgate University in New York. Enlisted soldiers are drawn from, and thus generally reflective of, the American public, although they have greater racial diversity (a constituency that leans Democratic) and far more men (who tend Republican). As voting patterns shift nationwide, so too do they shift among the armed forces.

The Economist’s analysis of precincts that map closely onto military bases found a median swing of nearly eight points towards Joe Biden, compared with a nationwide shift of a little over two points in the same direction. On average, Mr Trump still won these precincts, though his margin shrank by nearly half. Patrick Air Force Base—located on Florida’s Atlantic coast and since renamed Patrick Space Force Base—supported Mr Trump by a 17-point margin in 2016. By 2020, his lead there shrank to 11 points. This method is inexact: two-thirds of enlisted service members who vote send in absentee ballots and military bases are often sprawling compounds where spouses, civilian contractors and other support staff reside and vote.
But so too is this finding borne out in the limited available polling of active military personnel. Shortly before the election of 2020, the Military Times and the Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) at Syracuse University augured an even more extreme swing. Whereas in October 2016 their joint poll showed Mr Trump outpacing Mrs Clinton by 20 points, four years later Mr Biden was ahead of the incumbent by four points. “In 2020, one of the interesting developments was that Trump himself...tried to drive a wedge...and claim populist style that it was the rank and file who liked him, not the senior brass,” noted Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University.
The Military Times-IVMF polling before the election showed Mr Trump lost ground among both enlisted soldiers and the officer corps, the latter of whom had historically voted disproportionately Republican. Looking ahead to 2024, for Republicans to regain what was lost of the military vote, Mr Feaver speculates the best thing would be “for Trump to shuffle off stage”. ■",2
1607,"Gary Gensler, the chairman of America’s Securities and Exchange Commission, called for more protections for investors in the cryptocurrency markets, which he described as a Wild West rife with fraud and swindlers. Mr Gensler wants federal securities laws to apply to digital currencies and more powers for the SEC to oversee the market. If not, he worries that “a lot of people will be hurt” by bad investments.
Another challenge to traditional banking is emerging from “buy now, pay later” (BNPL), which enables shoppers to spread their payments for goods, sometimes with no interest or credit check but a fee for late instalments. Square, a payments firm run by Jack Dorsey, has offered to buy Afterpay, based in Melbourne and a global pioneer in BNPL, for $29bn, Australia’s biggest-ever takeover. Regulators have expressed concern about BNPL’s lax lending rules. The industry has ballooned during the pandemic. Apple is said to want to enter the market.

The meme machine
Robinhood’s stock had a rollercoaster ride after the firm floated on the stockmarket. The share-trading app had a terrible IPO, with its share price closing 8% down. A few days later the multitude of small investors who favour the app, especially to buy and sell “meme” equities, rushed to buy share options. The frenzied trading pushed the stock up by 85% over the offer price.
General Motors reported net income of $2.8bn for the second quarter and raised its profit forecast for the year. The carmaker was boosted by its lending business. GM Financial benefited from accelerated demand for used cars as output of new vehicles stalled amid a global dearth of semiconductors. GM kept up production of its bestselling models by diverting chip supplies from its less-popular ones, but warned the shortage could affect future profits.
The proposed $40bn takeover of Arm, a chip designer based in Britain, by Nvidia, America’s most valuable semiconductor manufacturer, was reported to be in trouble. The British government is said to be worried about the national-security implications, though no decision on scrapping the deal has been taken.
The euro zone’s GDP grew by 2% in the second quarter compared with the previous three months, a better showing than America and China, which grew by 1.6% and 1.3% on that measure. Germany’s economy expanded by 1.5% and France’s by 0.9%.
Big energy companies reported bumper quarterly profits, boosted by the higher price of oil, still their main source of income despite the industry’s move to cleaner fuels. ExxonMobil, which recorded a loss in every quarter last year, made a net profit of $4.7bn.
PepsiCo agreed to sell a majority stake in its Tropicana and Naked fruit juice brands to a private-equity firm for $3.3bn. Although packed with vitamins, fruit juices also have a high sugar content; Pepsi wants to focus on zero-calorie and healthier energy drinks.
Taming the dragon

Tencent was forced to bring in new restrictions on the amount of time that children can play its video games following a backlash from Chinese state media. The Chinese internet conglomerate said that the authorities had told gaming companies to live up to their social responsibilities, adding more pressure on tech firms in China as the government confronts the industry’s growing clout. Tencent’s share price fell sharply. A measure of Chinese tech stocks listed in New York, the Golden Dragon index, has had its worst month since the global financial crisis of 2007-09.
An early target of China’s regulatory crackdown, Alibaba, reported a 34% rise in revenue for the second quarter, year on year. Profit was down, however, as the group spent cash on rejigging its various digital platforms. Like others in the Chinese tech industry Alibaba is also adapting to the government’s new edicts. It will “respond positively with actions”, said Daniel Zhang, the chief executive.
More companies in America announced that they will require staff to be vaccinated against covid-19, a policy that was first adopted by big banks but is spreading across all industries. Following similar moves recently from Google and Facebook, Microsoft will now ask all employees and guests to show proof of a jab, (and will not re-open its offices fully until October), as will Walmart, Disney and Tyson Foods, a meat supplier. Netflix wants the actors and crew on its film sets to be inoculated.
Zoom reportedly agreed to pay $85m to settle a class-action lawsuit that accuses it of sharing customers’ data with third parties, including Facebook and Google. Part of the settlement requires the video- conferencing company to take extra steps to prevent Zoombombing, where hackers crash a meeting to display pornography, racist imagery and other items that are definitely not on the agenda.",2
1608,"A MEME THAT circulated recently on Twitter in Brazil depicted the economy minister, Paulo Guedes, as a footballer facing a wide-open goal. He shoots. The ball soars over the crossbar. The meme refers to a proposed tax reform that Mr Guedes has been trying to get through Congress but it also reflects growing pessimism about the government’s entire economic agenda. After a pensions revamp in 2019, the year Brazil’s populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, took office, most reforms stalled amid political turmoil and covid-19. Latin America’s biggest economy is weakening, squeezing the government’s budget. Markets are getting queasy. With next year’s presidential elections drawing near, time for reforms is running out.
Brazilian investors were remarkably forgiving in 2020, when the government threw money at the pandemic, says Arthur Carvalho of Truxt Investimentos, a hedge fund in Rio de Janeiro. In order to pass health-and-stimulus spending worth 8% of GDP, Congress suspended a constitutionally mandated “fiscal ceiling”, which limits annual spending growth to the rate of inflation. The real fell by nearly a quarter early in the pandemic but then stabilised. Public debt grew to 89% of GDP in 2020 but, thanks to the stimulus, the economy shrank by only 4.1%, less than in most emerging markets.

Economic liberals hoped that this year, lawmakers would at last approve Mr Guedes’s proposals to boost growth and curb spending. In January allies of Mr Bolsonaro gained control of both houses of Congress. Tax and public-sector reforms started to advance. The government celebrated some victories, such as a law that formalised the independence of the central bank and a constitutional amendment that allowed private investment in sewerage works. The lower house approved a watered-down tax reform on September 1st. Despite a brutal second wave of covid-19, the main stockmarket index hit a record high in June after news that GDP grew by 1.2% in the first quarter. Public debt fell to 84% of GDP.

External factors also helped. Rising prices for commodities such as iron ore and soyabeans, among Brazil’s leading exports, boosted growth and tax revenues. Low interest rates in rich countries like the United States drove investors to emerging markets like Brazil.
“Everything is getting better,” said Mr Guedes. Markets seemed to agree. “Guedes is a hero,” says Pedro Albuquerque, the CEO of TradersClub, a startup that erected a statue of the minister dressed as the Mandalorian, a bounty hunter from a television series. But Brazil has its own version of Wall Street v Main Street. Amid cheers on Faria Lima, an avenue in São Paulo that is home to big banks, unemployment eased only slightly from a record of 14.7% in the first quarter of this year to 14.1% in the second quarter. Household consumption is still below the level of early 2019. Year-on-year price inflation is 9% overall and more for staples like rice (40%) and sugar (30%), owing to the increase in commodity prices. “My youngest son drinks a lot of milk but I have less and less to give him,” says Thais Santos Nascimento, who lost her job cleaning long-empty offices in June. Mr Bolsonaro’s approval rating has been falling since monthly cheques to poor people were slashed at the beginning of the year. It is now less than 30%.
In an attempt to regain support, Mr Guedes has turned his attention to his boss’s orders to “turbo-charge” Bolsa Família (“Family Fund”), a cash-transfer programme to reduce extreme poverty. The government wants to expand the pool of recipients from 14.6m to 16m, raise the average monthly payment from 189 reais ($36) to 284 and give the programme a new name, Auxílio Brasil (“Brazil Aid”), so that voters associate it with Mr Bolsonaro rather than ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10). Lula was president when Bolsa Família was first launched and is expected to run for the office again against Mr Bolsonaro next year. (Polls show him winning.)
But as Congress heads into budget talks, Mr Guedes is struggling to figure out how to dole out more cash without busting through the reimposed spending cap. At first he wagered that inflation would slow in the second half of the year. This would provide a fiscal boost, since the spending cap rises in line with the inflation rate in the middle of the year, whereas increases in some salaries and benefits paid by the government depend on the inflation rate at the end of the year. But inflation has stayed high.
Mr Guedes’s next idea was a constitutional amendment that would postpone court-ordered debt payments to lower tiers of government to circumvent the spending cap. This strikes many as fiscally reckless. Marcos Mendes of Insper, a business school in São Paulo, helped design the cap. He says it was needed because prior laws to promote fiscal responsibility had been amended to the point of irrelevance. “The worry is less about the numbers and more about what would happen to the debt trajectory if the mechanism were to fail,” he says. Neither the controversial amendment nor extra spending for Auxílio Brasil were included in a budget draft submitted to congress on August 31st, but both are still on the table.
Other worries are also contributing to a worsening outlook. Brazil’s worst drought in 90 years has curbed hydropower, sending electricity prices soaring and raising fears of blackouts. The tax reform faces uncertainty in the senate; other reforms have stalled again. In June Congress was consumed by an inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic, which turned up allegations of corruption in vaccine deals. More recently it has been distracted by Mr Bolsonaro’s threat to suspend next year’s elections if legislators don’t pass a bill to introduce paper ballots. When such a bill was rejected, the president called for protests on September 7th.
For the past three weeks, the central bank’s poll of economists has trimmed their prediction for growth in 2021, to 5.2%. The markets have gone into reverse. Share prices have fallen by 11% since June and the real has depreciated by 6%. The sell-off followed a dip in commodity prices and fears that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates, again sucking money out of Brazil and other emerging markets. Those fears have eased but they exposed “problems Brazil was sweeping under the rug”, says Zeina Latif, an economist. The government’s borrowing costs are rising: the yield on its ten-year bonds hit double digits for the first time since the election in 2018.
Still, financial markets are fickle and Brazil’s economy always seems to be “on the edge of a precipice”, points out Joaquim Levy, a former finance minister. It usually manages to pull back. In 2015 he was in a similar position to Mr Guedes, working for a president, Dilma Rouseff, who backed away from economic reforms. That deepened the recession of 2014-16. Mr Levy reckons that Brazil is better off now because lawmakers and society better understand the need for fiscal restraint.
If reforms do pass before attention shifts to the election, they are likely to be half-hearted. Congress is considering several tax-reform bills. The one that succeeded in the lower house on September 1st is not the business-friendly bill that would merge several levies into a simplified value-added tax, but rather a populist proposal to lower income tax for middle-class Brazilians. It broadens the tax base by introducing a tax on dividends but also adds new distortions. Meanwhile, a bill to reform the public sector by making it possible to fire deadbeat workers, among other things, would provide long-term savings but is a longshot. Privatisation of the postal service, which passed the lower house in August, is set to be voted on by the Senate in September.
Second-quarter GDP figures, which were released on September 1st, showed a decline of 0.1%. Of 30 large economies tracked by the OECD, a club of rich countries, Brazil was the only one that did not grow. Itaú, a bank, predicts that annual growth will fall to just 1.5% next year, “as the factors that drove growth this year wear out”. That may be enough to keep Brazil away from the cliff, but for those who expected Mr Guedes to lead it to sunny uplands, it is a disappointment. Once again Brazilians will have to lower their expectations. ■",2
1609,"ON SEPTEMBER 11TH 2001, when al-Qaeda attacked America, almost 3,000 people died. In response the government overhauled national security and, for better or worse, struck a new balance between liberty and security. On the 20th anniversary of 9/11 roughly 3,100 people in America died because of covid-19. Another 3,100 died on September 12th. And again on the 13th.
By our estimates, based on excess deaths, the pandemic has claimed 860,000 lives in America. Yet measures to curb the virus by mandating vaccination, which the Biden administration announced on September 9th, are being treated by senior Republicans as a terrifying affront to liberty. “This is still America,” tweeted Tate Reeves, the governor of Mississippi, “and we still believe in freedom from tyrants.” That is fatally wrong-headed. The details of the Biden mandate could be improved on, but in democracies public health sometimes requires some coercion.

Across the world, governments from France to Australia are using pressure of one sort or another to boost vaccination. That should be no surprise. Ever since vaccines were invented, the state has asked some people to be jabbed to keep viruses such as yellow fever at bay. The justification for this intrusion was set out by America’s Supreme Court as long ago as 1905: even if in most cases you are free to refuse treatment, you are not thereby free to infect other people.
The question is whether each country’s requirement is proportionate. That depends on the threat and the costs and benefits of pressure. The calculus differs from one place to another.

What should not be in doubt is the danger posed by the Delta variant of covid-19. It is too infectious to be stopped simply by tracking cases. Vaccinated people, especially the elderly, gradually lose protection. If infected they can die, albeit at only one-tenth the rate of the unjabbed. Waves of infection overwhelm hospitals. Treating the unvaccinated cost $3.7bn in America, or $20,000 a patient, in August—a waste of resources.
For all these reasons, your choice over vaccination is everyone’s business. It matters that only 63% of Americans aged over 12 have had two doses of a vaccine, compared with 76% of French and 85% of Danes. Delta’s rapid spread through the population can be slowed by vaccination, sparing hospitals from overload and protecting vulnerable vaccinated people—for instance, the residents of old-people’s homes.
Academics worry that mandates merely sort the hesitant from the hardliners. You get a rapid increase in vaccination, but only to a level at or below what it would anyway have reached. One reason for this is that those convinced of a government plot see coercion as proof. That is why it is wise to keep punishments light and to offer free tests as an alternative to jabs—something the Biden plan fails to provide, but should.
However, the evidence from France is more encouraging. In July, to much grumbling, the state required a vaccine passport or negative test for a range of activities, including visiting bars, restaurants, sports stadiums and shopping centres (see Europe section). A month later nearly 10m people had rushed to be vaccinated—and today the total share is 20 percentage points higher. Our World in Data reports that the share of French who say that they definitely will not be vaccinated fell from 35% in mid-June to 23% in mid-August, the most recent figures.
A survey of over 50 countries in August by Johns Hopkins, an American university, found that over half of unvaccinated respondents said they definitely or probably will not get a jab. Governments cannot rely on mandates alone to get them to change their mind. Instead they also need to focus on their country’s particular hang-ups: Turks doubt covid-19 vaccines will work, Czechs don’t like vaccines in general, Americans worry about side-effects. The one thing elected officials should not do is to reinforce vaccine hesitancy by falsely presenting all mandates as an attack on constitutional liberties. ■

1610,"THE TIDE was pleasingly high, the seaweed on the white sands of the Cornish beach carefully combed out of sight. Seven world leaders sauntered back from their seafront photo for talks. As they walked, only one was treated to the American presidential arm, a full across-the-back hold, and for a total of 37 seconds: the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The high art of diplomatic choreography renders such fleeting gestures priceless. Was it not a kind of consecration? Britain’s Boris Johnson may have hosted the G7 meeting in June. But France’s president got the honours.
When Joe Biden was elected, France saw a rare chance to establish itself as America’s favourite European interlocutor. Brexit, went the argument, had relegated Britain’s usefulness in its transatlantic ally’s eyes. Germany was about to lose to retirement Angela Merkel, the continent’s de facto leader and Americans’ European of choice. Who better to step in than Mr Macron, an English-speaker who had once been selected as a French-American “young leader”? None other than Barack Obama, Mr Biden’s old boss, had called the French candidate in 2017 to wish him good luck. “Is this Emmanuel?” Mr Obama’s voice boomed through on speakerphone in the campaign office in Paris, urging Mr Macron to keep campaigning hard right to the end.

Moreover, France, a fellow child of revolution and America’s oldest ally, seemed to have unusually good links to the new administration. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, was educated at a lycée in Paris, as was Robert Malley, the special envoy for Iran. America supplies intelligence and logistics to French-led counter-terrorist operations in the Sahel. French and American navies train together, including in the Indo-Pacific, where France keeps over 7,000 troops (and has nearly 2m citizens). France’s pursuit of its own strategy in building up a geopolitical presence in the region in the face of an assertive China was “good for America”, notes Michael Shurkin, an American security analyst.
So it was with a mix of consternation, anger and pique that the French learned—just hours beforehand—of America’s new defence pact with Australia and Britain, which torpedoed an existing French contract to sell submarines to Australia. To lose a big defence deal was one thing. To be kept in the dark for months by three close friends, who evidently saw no place for you, was quite another. “Allies don’t do this to each other,” snapped Jean-Yves Le Drian, Mr Macron’s foreign minister, calling it a “stab in the back” and accusing the trio of “lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt”. France recalled its ambassador to America (as well as its one to Australia) for the first time since 1793. This week it was Boris Johnson who jetted off triumphantly to the White House, while Mr Macron sat nursing his wounds in the Elysée.
It is as hard to overstate the depth of the colère in Paris as it is to fathom America’s failure to anticipate it. France is as capable as anybody of acting with ruthless self-interest and disregard for others. A prickly, proud nation, it does not hesitate to say out loud what others keep to themselves. But the secret pact was as brutal a blow as any Western ally has landed on another in recent times. Trust is the first casualty. It took seven days for Mr Macron to accept Mr Biden’s call. Mr Biden agreed that there ought to have been “open consultations among allies”. Mr Macron agreed to send his ambassador back to Washington. Confidence-building talks will be launched. But the scars will remain.
What might be the consequences of all this? In the short run, a slighted France will be a more distrustful, irascible partner on other matters, less willing to compromise or give ground on trade, say, or over regulatory disputes. France cannot dictate what the European Union does; public European sympathy for France has so far been notably scant. But it can shape and block positions. Postponed meetings and summits may feel like poor tools of retaliation, but the cumulative effect can be corrosive.
The episode will also force the French, if not to rethink their ability to pursue their own Indo-Pacific strategy, then at least to confront the limits of it when measured against an Anglophone alliance. Some voices outside government, especially on the political right, are calling for a more dramatic, de Gaulle-like flourish. In 1966 the general distanced France from NATO and went off to sweet-talk the Russians. Ahead of the French presidential election next April, rival candidates are calling for some sort of replay. Gérard Araud, a French ex-ambassador to America, warns of “a Gaullist temptation”.
The ghost of de Gaulle
Mr Macron has indeed argued that France should act as a “balancing power”. Following America’s shambolic retreat from Kabul, the submarine episode has weakened the voice of French Atlanticists. But Mr Macron is no anti-American. He may not seek full-on confrontation with China, but he has long urged Europeans to consider it a strategic rival on industrial and security matters.
The geopolitical conclusion that he will probably draw from all this, rather, is that he was right. That America is an unreliable ally for continental Europeans at a time of a rising China; that this is not a fleeting trend; and that Europe needs greater self-reliance. Which brings France back to its persistent but generally thankless efforts to build European “strategic autonomy”.
During their call, Mr Biden acknowledged that European defence “is complementary to NATO”, as Mr Macron has always argued. But the concept still unnerves fellow Europeans. Most of them, especially those near the Russian border, are happy to rely on America’s security guarantee. Few share France’s willingness to splurge on defence, or its expeditionary military culture. (Germany, especially, does not.) Nobody agrees what “strategic autonomy” actually means. Low odds, however, seldom deter Mr Macron. After the latest snub, the unhugged French president will doubtless conclude that he has little choice but to keep trying. ■",2
1611,"As much as everyone loves seeing a cute dog while on their lengthy commute there's one thing that far surpasses it - and that's an adorable canine in a bag.
People from around the world have shared the cutest puppies they have spotted while going about their day, with the very best collated in a gallery by Bored Panda. 
One photo shows a dog far too big to be carried, with his legs poking out the bottom of an IKEA bag, while another lies down in a tote bag and appears to have been 'spilled'.
Elsewhere, a little Cavalier King Charles could be seen hanging in a bag from a toilet stall quite happily.

1612,"Sean Penn has been pictured donning combat gear and a helmet as he arrived in Ukraine to film a documentary about Russian aggression in the region.
The Hollywood actor and producer, 61, met with Ukrainian military service personnel as he visited positions near the frontline with Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk area.
Ukraine has been fighting a years-long proxy-war against Russia, which supports separatist rebels in the country's eastern regions. 
It is understood Penn is shoot a documentary about how the Donbas region has been impacted by battles with pro-Moscow rebels.
He was followed by a camera crew and surrounded by military protection as he made the visit on Thursday.
The proxy-war stems from the 2014 rebellion which ousted pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych and led to Russian annexing Crimea in the aftermath.
The conflict has so-far claimed some 13,000 lives.
Crimea juts into the Black Sea and contains an important Russian naval port with easy access to the Mediterranean.
A post on the Joint Forces Operation Headquarters Facebook page on Thursday said Penn was visiting 'to see with his own eyes the consequences of Russian aggression'.
The post added that the idea of the documentary was to 'tell the general public about the events that are currently happening in our country'.
The actor made the visit to the settlement of Priazov, which has been at the forefront of the ongoing conflict.
Penn rose to fame as a leading actor with the drama Dead Man Walking in 1995, before winning two Academy Awards for his roles in Mystic River in 2003, followed by Milk in 2008. 
His arrival in the region came as Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the West of 'escalating' tensions around Ukraine by building up forces on his border, even as thousands of Russian troops, tanks and artillery pieces sit close by.
The Russian president said Europe and the US had carried out ship drills in the Black Sea and flown bombers close to the frontier - crossing 'red lines' and showing that Russia is not being taken seriously.
As he spoke, the Russian military test-fired an 'unstoppable' hypersonic Zircon missile at a target in the White Sea - saying it scored a direct hit.
He said: 'Western partners are escalating the situation by supplying Kiev with lethal modern weapons.' 
The comments were made after Ukraine's defence minister revealed he has asked Brussels and Washington for more military tech.
Putin said Moscow has been 'constantly raising concerns about this' but 'all our warnings and talk about red lines are treated superficially'.
Putin has been voicing concern about US naval exercises in the Black Sea for days, telling his French counterpart this week that they were 'provocative' and leading to 'increasing tensions' between Moscow and NATO.
He has also slammed Ukraine for using a Turkish-made drone against pro-Moscow rebels.
Meanwhile, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said he is in the process of agreeing a 'Russian containment package' with allies in Washington and Brussels including 'increased sanctions' as well as 'supplies of additional weapons'.",-2
1613,"Annastacia Palaszczuk was the target of a vicious slur from a fired up protestor at an  anti-lockdown march in Brisbane. 
A large crowd gathered at the Botanic Garden on Saturday as part of a co-ordinated nationwide protest against pandemic laws and vaccine mandates. 
During the protest, which was streamed on Facebook by attendee Justin Allen from the Botanic Gardens, a man could be heard yelling 'hang the b*tch'. 

The remark came after announcers asked the crowd what they thought of Ms Palaszczuk. 
There were other ugly scenes at the event, including a man toting a noose.
Announcers were seen asking the man clutching the noose to take it back to his car, telling him in no uncertain terms to 'take that crap down … this is not the place for stuff like that' before adding 'we don't want that crap here.'
The move was widely applauded by the majority of attendees.
Former MP Clive Palmer spoke at the rally in Brisbane, telling the crowd not to vote for major political parties at the next election.
He criticised a number of politicians, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison who he said has 'abandoned Australia'.
The ugly threat directed at the Queensland Premier comes after local MP Brittany Lauga contacted police this week after she and other members of state parliament received an email with 'threats of terrorism, extremism and violence'.
'I understand local doctors have been sent death threats and other threatening letters,' she wrote on Twitter.
'I unequivocally condemn these threats of violence, terrorism and extremism.'
Saturday incident in the heart of Brisbane involving the threat to Ms Palaszczuk followed a similar protest in Melbourne this week.
A gallows and noose were strategically placed outside Victorian parliament, with a prop of Premier Daniel Andrews nearby.
Mr Andrews was unimpressed by the stunt and called out the Prime Minister for pandering to extremists.
He told Channel 9 he has been subjected to personal threats, with his wife and kids also caught up in the drama. 
Mr Morrison on Friday condemned the protests, but 'understood' why scores of protesters were frustrated.
'I don't have sympathy for violence, I don't have sympathy for threats,' he said.
'I have sympathy for Australians who have had a gutful of governments telling them what to do over the last two years.'
Earlier on Saturday, anti-coronavirus vaccine mandate protests drew large crowds across Australia, with tens of thousands marching through city streets.
The rallies, purportedly part of a global 'freedom' movement, were also widely attended in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide.
In Melbourne, a crowd began to mass outside Victoria's parliament before midday and walked to Flagstaff Gardens.
The demonstrators opposed Covid-19 vaccines, mandates and the state's proposed pandemic laws, which stalled in the upper house this week.
Watched on by police, they chanted 'kill the bill' and yelled 'sack Dan Andrews' while carrying placards featuring a range of anti-government and anti-vaccine mandate slogans.
The crowd grew to several thousand at the gardens, where a band played John Farnham's You're the Voice.
In Sydney, police say about 10,000 protesters marched through the city centre to voice their concerns, while smaller, unauthorised protests also took place at Newtown and Newcastle.
No arrests were made and no infringement notices were issued.
'Overall, the protests were conducted peacefully with minimal disruption to the community, and I'm pleased to see that the vast majority of people complied with police directions,' NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell said.
The sound of bagpipes echoed through York St in Sydney's CBD as a man dressed in white screamed 'destroy the new world order' and others chanted 'walk with us'.
United Australia Party leader and federal MP Craig Kelly addressed the crowd at Martin Place after attending a Melbourne protest last weekend.
'We will hold every politician and every bureaucrat responsible for forcing injections upon the Australia population,' he said, drawing chants of 'sack them all'.",-2
1614,"FOR A DECADE after the financial crisis the world economy’s problem was a lack of spending. Worried households paid down their debts, governments imposed austerity and wary firms held back investment, especially in physical capacity, while hiring from a seemingly infinite pool of workers. Now spending has come roaring back, as governments have stimulated the economy and consumers let rip. The surge in demand is so powerful that supply is struggling to keep up. Lorry drivers are getting signing bonuses, an armada of container ships is anchored off California waiting for ports to clear and energy prices are spiralling upwards. As rising inflation spooks investors, the gluts of the 2010s have given way to a shortage economy.
The immediate cause is covid-19. Some $10.4trn of global stimulus has unleashed a furious but lopsided rebound in which consumers are spending more on goods than normal, stretching global supply chains that have been starved of investment. Demand for electronic goods has boomed during the pandemic but a shortage of the microchips inside them has struck industrial production in some exporting economies, such as Taiwan. The spread of the Delta variant has shut down clothing factories in parts of Asia. In the rich world migration is down, stimulus has filled bank accounts and not enough workers fancy shifting from out-of-favour jobs like selling sandwiches in cities to in-demand ones such as warehousing. From Brooklyn to Brisbane, employers are in a mad scramble for extra hands.

Yet the shortage economy is also the product of two deeper forces. First, decarbonisation. The switch from coal to renewable energy has left Europe, and especially Britain, vulnerable to a natural-gas supply panic that at one point this week had sent spot prices up by over 60%. A rising carbon price in the European Union’s emissions-trading scheme has made it hard to switch to other dirty forms of energy. Swathes of China have faced power cuts as some of its provinces scramble to meet strict environmental targets. High prices for shipping and tech components are now triggering increased capital expenditure to expand capacity. But when the world is trying to wean itself off dirty forms of energy, the incentive to make long-lived investments in the fossil-fuel industry is weak.
The second force is protectionism. As our special report explains, trade policy is no longer written with economic efficiency in mind, but in the pursuit of an array of goals, from imposing labour and environmental standards abroad to punishing geopolitical opponents.
This week Joe Biden’s administration confirmed that it would keep Donald Trump’s tariffs on China, which average 19%, promising only that firms could apply for exemptions (good luck battling the federal bureaucracy). Around the world, economic nationalism is contributing to the shortage economy. Britain’s lack of lorry drivers has been exacerbated by Brexit. India has a coal shortage in part because of a misguided attempt to cut imports of fuel. After years of trade tensions, the flow of cross-border investment by companies has fallen by more than half relative to world GDP since 2015.
All this might seem eerily reminiscent of the 1970s, when many places faced petrol-pump queues, double-digit price rises and sluggish growth. But the comparison gets you only so far. Half a century ago politicians got economic policy badly wrong, fighting inflation with futile measures like price controls and Gerald Ford’s “whip inflation now” campaign, which urged people to grow their own vegetables. Today the Federal Reserve is debating how to forecast inflation, but there is a consensus that central banks have the power and the duty to keep it in check.
For now, out-of-control inflation seems unlikely. Energy prices should ease after the winter. In the next year the spread of vaccines and new treatments for covid-19 should reduce disruptions. Consumers may spend more on services. Fiscal stimulus will wind down in 2022: Mr Biden is struggling to get his jumbo spending bills through Congress and Britain plans to raise taxes. The risk of a housing bust in China means that demand could even fall, restoring the sluggish conditions of the 2010s. And an investment boost in some industries will eventually translate into more capacity and higher productivity.

But make no mistake, the deeper forces behind the shortage economy are not going away and politicians could easily end up with dangerously wrong-headed policies. One day, technologies such as hydrogen should help make green power more reliable. But that will not plug shortages right now. As fuel and electricity costs rise, there could be a backlash. If governments do not ensure that there are adequate green alternatives to fossil fuels, they may have to meet shortages by relaxing emissions targets and lurching back to dirtier sources of energy. Governments will therefore have to plan carefully to cope with the higher energy costs and slower growth that will result from eliminating emissions. Pretending that decarbonisation will result in a miraculous economic boom is bound to lead to disappointment.
The shortage economy could also reinforce the appeal of protectionism and state intervention. Many voters blame empty shelves and energy crises on the government. Politicians can escape responsibility by excoriating fickle foreigners and fragile supply chains, and by talking up the false promise of boosting self-reliance. Britain has already bailed out a fertiliser plant to maintain the supply of carbon dioxide, an input for the food industry. The government is trying to claim that labour shortages are good, because they will raise economy-wide wages and productivity. In reality, putting up barriers to migration and trade will, on average, cause both to fall.
The wrong lessons at the wrong time
Disruptions often lead people to question economic orthodoxies. The trauma of the 1970s led to a welcome rejection of big government and crude Keynesianism. The risk now is that strains in the economy lead to a repudiation of decarbonisation and globalisation, with devastating long-term consequences. That is the real threat posed by the shortage economy. ■",2
1615,"DEMOGRAPHY IS NOT quite destiny, but it certainly creates possibilities. A country with a large share of young adults will benefit from a demographic dividend if it can create jobs for them, as South Korea managed to in the 1980s and 1990s. Alternatively, it can become violent and unstable. The surge of military aggression in 19th-century Europe, the rise in homicide beginning in the 1960s and the Arab Spring a decade ago have all been blamed on youth bulges.

Now Britain has one, bucking the trend in the rich world. It is more subtle than those colossal demographic shifts, but is significant nonetheless. The number of 18-year-olds, which fell during the 2010s, has begun to rise sharply. Britain had 715,000 of them in 2020 and expects to have 893,000 in 2030—a 25% increase. It will take a decade for the number to begin to fall again (see chart).

A few other European countries, such as Ireland and Sweden, are going through similar gyrations. But Britain’s youth bulge is much more pronounced than the one in the EU as a whole (where the number of 18-year-olds will grow by a mere 2% between 2020 and 2030) or the one in America. It is product of historic demographic trends and immigration, and is likely to transform the country as it ages.
Britain’s post-war baby boom was odd. Although births jumped immediately after the war, the surge did not endure, as it did in America. Instead, the baby boom really got going in the second half of the 1950s. It peaked in 1964, when 876,000 babies were born. When that large cohort got around to having children, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was another baby boom, known as the “echo boom”. Many of the youngsters alive today are their children—an echo of the echo boom.
Economics and government policy increased the size of the bulge. Real wages rose from the mid-1990s until the financial crisis of 2008, persuading people they could afford to have children. So did immigration, points out David Coleman, a demographer at the University of Oxford. Britain opened its doors to eastern Europeans in 2004, earlier than most other European countries, and got lots of young workers who soon became parents. Between 1991 and 2011 the proportion of births in England and Wales to women born outside Britain doubled to 25%.
Schools have been the first to notice the bulge. There were more than 600,000 applications for secondary schools this year, 16% more than seven years ago. But because births declined after 2012, primary schools are quieter. The number of applicants is the lowest for seven years, meaning 92% of children this year got into their parents’ first-choice school. In east London, Tower Hamlets council is amalgamating primary schools, citing a “sudden fall” in applications.
Universities have been exposed to demographic fluctuations since 2015, when the government abolished caps on the number of students they were allowed to recruit. The youth bulge has just reached them. A combination of higher grades and a large cohort drove up applications from British 18-year-olds by 10% this year. That is nice for them and for the Unite Group, a student-housing firm with 74,000 beds in 173 buildings. Richard Smith, its chief executive, says that he has another 5,000 in the pipeline. But it worries the Treasury, which writes off many student loans.
As the swollen generation enters the workforce, businesses will benefit—beginning with the hospitality industry, which depends on young people. Bars, hotels and restaurants blame their present recruitment difficulties on Brexit, which has reduced the flow of immigrants from continental Europe, and on the indolence engendered by covid-19 lockdowns. But the decade-long decline in 18-year-olds has added to their difficulties. Hiring will soon become easier.
Over the longer term, the bulge of young adults will help support the welfare state. In 2020 Britain had 29 people aged 65 or over for every 100 people aged 15-64, which is almost exactly the same as the European average. The United Nations estimates that in 2050 the ratio in Britain will reach 43 per 100. That will cause difficulties, but Europe as a whole will be in a worse state, with 49 retirees for every 100 working-age people.
The impact on politics will be less pronounced, thinks Will Jennings, a political scientist at the University of Southampton. A rise in the number of young people should help the Labour Party, but only slightly, because the new voters will cluster in the cities and university towns where it is already strong. Besides, he says, it will act only as a “gentle brake” on the overall ageing of the electorate—a more powerful trend, which currently benefits the Conservatives.
Subtly, the bulge will also affect post-mortems on the earthquake that hit Britain in 2016. The big question about the country is how it will be affected by leaving the EU. The most satisfying answer will come not from looking at brief fluctuations in trade, investment and output but from comparing economies over many years. Anybody who attempts to do that must first answer a question, however. Should they control for Britain’s increasingly distinctive demography, and if so, how? ■",2
1616,"NEXT MONTH world leaders will gather at the COP26 summit, saying they mean to set a course for net global carbon emissions to reach zero by 2050. As they prepare to pledge their part in this 30-year endeavour, the first big energy scare of the green era is unfolding before their eyes. Since May the price of a basket of oil, coal and gas has soared by 95%. Britain, the host of the summit, has turned its coal-fired power stations back on, American petrol prices have hit $3 a gallon, blackouts have engulfed China and India, and Vladimir Putin has just reminded Europe that its supply of fuel relies on Russian goodwill.
The panic is a reminder that modern life needs abundant energy: without it, bills become unaffordable, homes freeze and businesses stall. The panic has also exposed deeper problems as the world shifts to a cleaner energy system, including inadequate investment in renewables and some transition fossil fuels, rising geopolitical risks and flimsy safety buffers in power markets. Without rapid reforms there will be more energy crises and, perhaps, a popular revolt against climate policies.

The idea of such a shortage seemed ridiculous in 2020 when global demand dropped by 5%, the most since the second world war, triggering cost-cutting in the energy industry. But as the world economy has cranked back up, demand has surged even as stockpiles have run dangerously low. Oil inventories are only 94% of their usual level, European gas storage 86%, and Indian and Chinese coal below 50%.
Tight markets are vulnerable to shocks and the intermittent nature of some renewable power. The list of disruptions includes routine maintenance, accidents, too little wind in Europe, droughts that have cut Latin American hydropower output, and Asian floods that have impeded coal deliveries. The world may yet escape a severe energy recession: the glitches may be resolved and Russia and OPEC may grudgingly boost oil and gas production. At a minimum, however, the cost will be higher inflation and slower growth. And more such squeezes may be on the way.
That is because three problems loom large. First, energy investment is running at half the level needed to meet the ambition to reach net zero by 2050. Spending on renewables needs to rise. And the supply and demand of dirty fossil fuels needs to be wound down in tandem, without creating dangerous mismatches. Fossil fuels satisfy 83% of primary-energy demand and this needs to fall towards zero. At the same time the mix must shift from coal and oil to gas which has less than half the emissions of coal. But legal threats, investor pressure and fear of regulations have led investment in fossil fuels to slump by 40% since 2015.
Gas is the pressure point. Many countries, particularly in Asia, need it to be a bridge fuel in the 2020s and 2030s, shifting to it temporarily as they ditch coal but before renewables have ramped up. As well as using pipelines, most import liquefied natural gas (LNG). Too few projects are coming on stream. According to Bernstein, a research firm, the global shortfall in LNG capacity could rise from 2% of demand now to 14% by 2030.
The second problem is geopolitics, as rich democracies quit fossil-fuel production and supply shifts to autocracies with fewer scruples and lower costs, including the one run by Mr Putin. The share of oil output from OPEC plus Russia may rise from 46% today to 50% or more by 2030. Russia is the source of 41% of Europe’s gas imports and its leverage will grow as it opens the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and develops markets in Asia. The ever-present risk is that it curtails supplies.
The last problem is the flawed design of energy markets. Deregulation since the 1990s has seen many countries shift from decrepit state-run energy industries to open systems in which electricity and gas prices are set by markets, supplied by competing vendors who add supply if prices spike. But these are struggling to cope with the new reality of fossil-fuel output declines, autocratic suppliers and a rising share of intermittent solar and wind power. Just as Lehman Brothers relied on overnight borrowing, so some energy firms guarantee households and businesses supplies that they buy in an unreliable spot market.
The danger is that the shock slows the pace of change. This week Li Keqiang, China’s premier, said the energy transition must be “sound and well-paced”, code for using coal for longer. Public opinion in the West, including America, supports clean energy, but could shift as high prices bite.
Governments need to respond by redesigning energy markets. Bigger safety buffers ought to absorb shortages and deal with the intermittency of renewable power. Energy suppliers should hold more reserves, just as banks carry capital. Governments can invite firms to bid for backup-energy-supply contracts. Most reserves will be in gas but eventually battery and hydrogen technologies could take over. More nuclear plants, the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, or both, are vital to supply a baseload of clean, reliable power.
A more diverse supply can weaken the grip of autocratic petrostates such as Russia. Today that means building up the LNG business. In time it will require more global trade in electricity so that distant windy or sunny countries with renewable power to spare can export it. Today only 4% of electricity in rich countries is traded across borders, compared with 24% of global gas and 46% of oil. Building subsea grids is part of the answer and converting clean energy into hydrogen and transporting it on ships could help, too.
All this will require capital spending on energy to more than double to $4trn-5trn a year. Yet from investors’ perspective, policy is baffling. Many countries have net-zero pledges but no plan of how to get there and have yet to square with the public that bills and taxes need to rise. A movable feast of subsidies for renewables, and regulatory and legal hurdles make investing in fossil-fuel projects too risky. The ideal answer is a global carbon price that relentlessly lowers emissions, helps firms judge which projects would make money, and raises tax revenues to support the energy transition’s losers. Yet pricing schemes cover only a fifth of all emissions. The message from the shock is that leaders at COP26 must move beyond pledges and tackle the fine print of how the transition will work. All the more so if they meet under light bulbs powered by coal. ■

1617,"“A DEBT THAT we owe to the global community” is how Santiago Wills, Colombia’s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva, described the talks he has been chairing on ending subsidies for fishing that damages global stocks. Sadly, he was announcing a default. The aim of finalising an agreement by the end of this year will be missed. Negotiations have dragged on for two decades. They had been given some impetus by the decision in 2015 to include in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the aim of eliminating subsidies “by 2020”, a target missed and reinterpreted to mean the end of the year. But environmentalists are despondent that the last vestige of a hard deadline has now vanished. “Missing the SDG target is really important,” says Annabelle Bladon of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a think-tank in London.
The talks are intended to eliminate subsidies that contribute to “illegal, unreported and unregulated” (IUU) fishing, estimated to account for a remarkable 20-50% of the global catch, as well as those that sustain legal overfishing and the building of overcapacity. Many fish stocks are collapsing. It is estimated that the proportion of the total stock of fish in the oceans that are overfished—ie, exploited at such a pace that the fish population cannot replenish itself—has risen from 10% in 1974 to 34% now. This is endangering coastal communities that rely on fishing. Roughly 39m people depend on capture fisheries for their livelihood. And fish provide 20% of animal-protein needs on average for 3.3bn people.

A big reason why it remains profitable to fish when stocks are low (and hence more expensive to catch) is that governments subsidise the industry—in a wide range of ways from cheap boats and gear to free ice, but above all, through cut-price fuel. Of the $35bn a year lavished on the industry, about $22bn ($7.7bn of which is for fuel) is estimated to contribute to the destruction of fish stocks. Some environmentally devastating practices—such as China’s bottom-trawling off the west African coast—are especially fuel-intensive both in the distance sailed and the type of fishing itself. A study published in 2018 in Science Advances, a journal, found that, without subsidies, 54% of high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable. Another study, by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has calculated that ending all harmful subsidies could result, by 2050, in a 12.5% increase in global fish biomass and a 3.5% rise in the annual global fish catch.
Mr Wills laid much of the blame for the failure to meet the deadline on the pandemic. It is certainly true that covid-19 has preoccupied governments, sucking attention, resources and political will away from many other concerns, including obscure and long-running talks at the WTO. It did not help that Switzerland in March banned all but very small gatherings, interrupting the process. The postponement of the WTO’s biennial ministerial meeting, due to be held in Kazakhstan in June, was a further setback to hopes of a political push for a deal. So had been the failure to appoint a new director-general after Robert Azevêdo relinquished the role in September, leaving the organisation with no high-profile advocate of a deal.
Big differences still remain between the parties despite the circulation of a revised, “consolidated” draft text last month. At issue are such basics as the scope of the agreement (should it cover all sorts of subsidy?) and the definitions of “overfishing” and “overfished stocks” (with environmentalists complaining they rely on vague, unscientific language). And should a ban on subsidies apply just to individual vessels engaged in overfishing, or to the operators of fleets (since a cash subsidy for fuel to an innocent vessel is fungible)? Then there is the handling of “unassessed” fish stocks, ie, those not sufficiently surveyed to be judged sustainable or not, which by some estimates account for more than 70% of the global catch, and many of which are believed to be severely overfished. Even the definition of “fish” has proved contentious.
But the issue that has probably generated the most heat is that of “Special and Differential Treatment” (SDT) for poorer countries—ie, exemptions. It has always been accepted that some such carve-outs would be needed. It is even included in the wording of the missed SDG, and is one of the “pillars” of the talks. But if too much is excluded from the agreement it will become meaningless. China for example wants SDT and counts itself a developing country. It is by far the most important fishing nation, with the largest fleet, accounting for about one-fifth of the global catch. It is also the world’s biggest exporter of fish and, predictably, the biggest subsidiser. But other countries too—in particular, India, another big fishing country, but one with a fleet confined largely, unlike China’s, to its own waters—have also argued hard for big exemptions. And India is pushing for a weak dispute-settlement mechanism. Rich countries, too, subsidise their fishing industries and, as the issue’s curious prominence in the fraught Brexit negotiations show, it is one where nationalist and protectionist sentiments run deep.
So, despite the disappointment, few who have followed the talks are surprised by the failure to meet the deadline. Mr Wills insisted on an optimistic take, preparing to circulate a new draft and chair resumed negotiations next month. Even some outside observers, like Isabel Jarrett, manager of the programme to end harmful fisheries subsidies at the Pew Charitable Trusts, point to progress, saying the parties “are closer than they have ever been” to success. Getting them to the finishing line may require the pressure of a WTO ministerial meeting, and even then, the outcome might be an agreement riddled with loopholes. Meanwhile, as Mr Wills pointed out, that debt keeps getting bigger.",2
1618,"FIFTEEN YEARS ago Richard Layard, an economist at the London School of Economics, put together a pitch. “We now have evidence-based psychological therapies,” he noted. But they were rarely available on the National Health Service. The result was lost lives and, he argued with an eye on the Treasury, lost money, since people with poor mental health were often jobless. A new branch of the health service was needed.
That branch is now firmly established. Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) has grown fast. Last year the service, which helps those suffering from anxiety, depression and similar illnesses, treated 1.2m people, a number which is planned to rise to 1.9m by 2023-24. It has inspired imitators in Australia and Norway. And it has got better at its job, with recovery rates rising from below 40% in 2010 to 54% in early 2019.

Since then, however, they have refused to budge, remaining around the 50% target. The trend predates the covid-19 pandemic, when the number of referrals fell by more than half (they have now recovered to normal levels). It may be that the figures are the best that can be expected of a service sucking up “anybody and everybody who has symptoms of anxiety and depression”, says Helen Gilburt of the King’s Fund, a think-tank. Indeed, they are similar to those in well-funded clinical trials.
David Clark, IAPT’s clinical adviser and chair of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford, nevertheless thinks the service “can go further”. Critics bemoan the “McDonaldisation” of therapy. Like the hamburger purveyor, IAPT is careful about what is on its menu, using therapies found effective by NICE, an outfit that assesses clinical evidence. Improvements are driven by analysis of customer data—in IAPT’s case, data on outcomes, which it is the only part of the mental-health system to collect.
Targets push providers to see patients in six weeks, after which recovery rates slump. Any longer and they “come to therapy quite negative, quite angry”, says Marc McDonagh, the IAPT lead at Somerset Foundation Trust. “They want to have that all out with the therapist. The first couple of sessions have that shadow over them, with the patient ranting against the service.” The IAPT manual urges providers to text reminders of appointments in order to reduce no-shows, and to provide a diagnosis. The value of the latter is disputed by some therapists, but is associated with better outcomes.
Professor Clark hopes similar prods will raise recovery rates still further. Old people are both unlikely to come forward for treatment and particularly likely to benefit from therapy, so providers are encouraged to hire “older champions” and to leaflet libraries, post offices and pharmacies. The average number of sessions is a little below the ideal number of nine or ten, suggesting more should be offered.
Recent years have seen a rise in the amount of therapy done through digital services. These include ones from SilverCloud (which offers cognitive-behavioural therapy) and Ieso (which offers therapy through an online-messaging service). Ieso applies a deep-learning model to the transcripts generated by sessions, to find out what is associated with success (“therapeutic praise” comes out top; “therapeutic empathy” last), which is fed back to therapists. These services offer convenience and in some cases work as well as in-person offerings, but have yet to prove they can consistently outperform them.
They also provide extra competition for staff who are already in demand. In Somerset it is a struggle to recruit advanced therapists, says Mr McDonagh, making it hard to cut waiting lists. Parts of the country do not offer the full range of treatments for depression recommended by NICE, including counselling and short-term psychoanalytic therapy. Things have improved since Lord Layard’s report—but people are still missing out on treatment that would improve their lives. ■",2
1619,"Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets all over Cuba. They have a long list of complaints, from the communist dictatorship’s inept handling of covid-19 to empty supermarket shelves and power cuts.

Many of these are thought to have been arrested.
It remained unclear who was behind the murder last week of Jovenel Moïse, the president of Haiti. The national chief of police declared that a Haitian doctor who lives in Florida plotted the attack. More than a dozen former Colombian soldiers said to have been involved in the plot were paraded on Haitian television. Conspiracy theories abound, involving senior Haitian politicians. A power vacuum has been created; three men are vying for the top job.

In South Africa scores of people were killed and hundreds of shops, factories and warehouses burnt in riots instigated by allies of Jacob Zuma, a former president who was jailed for refusing to appear before a commission investigating corruption during his term in office.

1620,"IF PERCEPTION IS a construct of language, as an American anthropologist called Benjamin Lee Whorf argued, how Joe Biden’s party must rue the phrase “Democrats in disarray”. Ever since its first appearance, in local newspapers during the 1960s, journalists have reached for the alliterative term whenever Democrats have argued among themselves—whether existentially, as during their 1980s wilderness years; or in the normal course of hammering out a consensus among their many parts. Perusal of the New York Times website finds Democrats in deep disarray during the 1992 presidential primary, shortly before they nominated Bill Clinton, and straight after the 2006 mid-terms, at which they became the first party to control the House and Senate in over a decade.
Their recent performance on the Hill—to which the epithet has also been applied—might appear more deserving of it. After Senate Democrats struck an impressive bipartisan infrastructure deal, the party’s slightly bigger majority in the House failed to pass it. Left-wingers insisted the bill had to move in tandem with a partisan budget bill, containing trillions of dollars of climate and social-policy spending that had been making some moderates queasy. Together the bills represent most of Joe Biden’s domestic policy ambitions. Yet Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, was forced to set them aside.

For Representative Josh Gottheimer, this was a case of the “far left” of his party employing “Freedom Caucus tactics” to “destroy the president’s agenda”. Strong stuff—which must have resonated with Mr Gottheimer’s many conservative constituents (he became in 2017 the first Democrat to win his New Jersey district since 1933). Yet it was inaccurate. The contents of the budget package are also Mr Biden’s agenda. Harnessing the two bills, as the president himself later acknowledged, has made it likelier that both will eventually pass. Moreover, far from aping the headbangers of the Republican Freedom Caucus, House left-wingers, led by Pramila Jayapal of Washington, have suggested they will make whatever compromise is necessary.
At the outset of this process, the left demanded that the budget bill contain $6trn worth of largely unfunded tax cuts and spending. After moderates demurred, they came down to $3.5trn, paid for by tax rises and spread over a decade. Most Democrats were happy with that. But among a handful of holdouts, Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative and opponent of ambitious climate-change policy, said he could not countenance a package costing more than $1.5trn. Ms Jayapal suggested this week she would settle for $2.5trn, and Mr Manchin, an inveterate wheeler-dealer, that he “ruled nothing out.” Without underestimating the difficulties the party still faces in trying to push through its agenda, this looks less like a genuine crisis than the cut and thrust of legislating.
That is something, as the infrastructure deal briefly recalled, that the parties used to engage in together. The idea was that by winning over a sufficient number of sensibles from the other side the governing party could render its own radicals irrelevant. The fact that the Democrats now have no option but to go it alone on climate change and other big problems that the do-nothing Republicans ignore has therefore given the party’s extremists a bigger say. Especially considering its tiny majorities: to pass the budget bill, the Democrats can afford to lose only three votes from their caucus in the House and none in the Senate. Yet the intra-party wrestling this has occasioned is distracting from another big change. The Democrats are for the most part unanimous.
According to score-keeping by the website FiveThirtyEight, House Democrats are the most unified caucus of the past three Congresses; 203 of their 223 members have voted with Mr Biden 100% of the time. So, for that matter, has Mr Manchin. There are a few reasons for this strange togetherness.
Lacking a central creed—of the sort that Republicans once found in conservatism and now find in Donald Trump—the Democrats are more a collaboration of interest groups. Hence their periodic quarrelsomeness. Yet they have in recent years become less ideologically diverse, especially on economic policy, on which they have reached an interventionist consensus. Moderates and leftists still disagree—often wildly—about the details. Yet Mr Biden, the Democratic centre-of-gravity made flesh, has set parameters that both seem able to live within. During last year’s primary, left-wingers spoke of abolishing private health insurance. Their current wrangle with Mr Manchin over renewable-power incentives seems constrained by comparison.
That is less a testament to Mr Biden’s authority (which has been tested in recent weeks, as his ratings have plummeted) than the fact that all Democrats are keen to govern. The party’s base expects them to; no Democrat has been elected on a promise to torpedo its agenda as members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus were. Even the most ardent left-wingers have therefore, in the end, proved willing to compromise. And the spectre of Mr Trump—whose rise Democrats often attribute to the failures of the governing system over many years—makes it even likelier that this pattern will endure. “We will get it done,” Ms Jayapal assured your columnist, when asked whether she would in any circumstance be willing to let the bills fail. Even with such little margin for slippage, that still seems the likeliest outcome.
The wages of governing
Whether such a victory would improve Mr Biden’s miserable ratings is another matter entirely. Among the many depressing truths lurking in political-science books is the fact that voters mostly ignore a government’s legislative record. Elections are decided by tribal emotions and fundamentals, not by child-tax credits. The increasingly tribal Republicans—who released no manifesto ahead of the last election—have taken that on board. By comparison, it is good that the Democrats are still overlooking it. ■

1621,"THE TAGLINE for the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association (APSA) held in Seattle last weekend read “Promoting Pluralism.” Under the sunny geometric windows of the city’s convention centre, and through the poorly lit rectangles of Zoom rooms, scholars met to discuss, among other things, the various threats to American democracy, and whether the country’s polarised political parties could peacefully coexist. Like experts on the use of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, the spectre of some disastrous future hung over the discussions and was made only slightly less alarming by the technical language used to describe it.
Scholars of American politics are particularly dismayed by rising levels of “affective polarisation,” the political science term for the hostility one person feels towards members of the other party relative to the feelings they have towards members of their own party. Levels of affective polarisation have risen more than two-fold since the 1970s when the American National Election Studies, a quadrennial academic survey started at the University of Michigan, began asking citizens to rate how they felt about members of either major party. In 1978, according to the survey, the difference between Americans’ ratings of members of their own and ratings of members of the other party on a 100-point “feeling thermometer” scale was 27 points. The gap had widened to 56 by 2020.

Lilliana Mason of Johns Hopkins University calls this phenomenon “identity-based” polarisation. In her 2018 book “Uncivil Agreement” Ms Mason crunched a mass of survey data to reveal how ideological, religious and racial identities have become “sorted” into overlapping mega-identities captured almost entirely by the words “Democrat” and “Republican.” One result, she concludes, is that isolated and warring tribes have become “relatively unresponsive to changing information or real national problems.”
That problem—that people’s political affiliations determine what information they absorb, rather than the other way around—is bad enough. Yet the degree of contempt partisans have for each other is even more troubling. In a paper Ms Mason presented at the conference alongside Nathan Kalmoe and Julie Wronski, two of her frequent co-authors, the researchers conducted a series of experiments to gauge the extent to which Americans thought certain groups deserved life-saving aid if they were infected with covid-19; if the economy should be reopened even if it would hurt certain groups; and whether disproportionate deaths among the opposing party were deserved or not. They found that respondents were much likelier to say disproportionate deaths among supporters of the other party were more acceptable than deaths among their own.
Discounting suffering on the other side destroys the empathy that liberal democracies require. In a 2019 paper, Mr Kalmoe and Ms Mason studied the extent to which voters rationalise partisan violence against their opponents or express outright support for it—what they call “moral disengagement” and “lethal partisanship”. They also found that 60% of partisans said the opposition was “a serious threat to the United States”, and 40% said opponents were “downright evil”. People with strong attachments to either political party were more likely to exhibit such views.
Between 5% and 15% of Americans in either party endorse violence depending on the circumstances. Mr Kalmoe and Ms Mason are updating their work on partisan violence for an upcoming book, “Radical American Partisanship”. According to new data, Americans of both parties have become more morally disengaged and more likely to endorse violence since the authors’ first study in 2019. They also find that since the 2020 elections Republican voters have become more likely to hold these views, and to endorse violence against political leaders—presumably because their champion lost.
Even though the strength of these feelings is striking, polarisation is such a familiar problem that merely mentioning it can act as a mental sedative. Suggestions as to how to lessen polarisation sometimes have the same quality, though the assembled political scientists deserve credit for trying. Erin Rossiter, of the University of Notre Dame, has found that even imagining a conversation with an opponent can cause at least a temporary reduction in hostility to supporters of the other party. Ms Mason and Mr Kalmoe find, in a final set of experimental studies, that telling Republican voters that Mr Trump had asked them to abstain from violence decreased the share of them that thought it was acceptable in pursuit of political goals. What party leaders say, and how they conduct themselves, really matters.■",2
1622,"THE COVID-19 pandemic has done nothing good for the mood of Park Ha-young, an undergraduate at Seoul National University. She spent much of last year worrying about the disease, and her chances of spreading it: “I was terrified of becoming the person to cause a huge outbreak.” Her freedom has been drastically curtailed. The government determines whether she can see friends or attend classes, leaving her frustrated and unable to make plans. She is beginning to worry about finding a job after she graduates.
Politicians and officials frequently talk about how covid-19 affects public health and the economy. But for most people those are abstract considerations. What they experience each day are moods—the sense of being anxious and sad, or, if they are lucky, cheerful and optimistic. To mark World Happiness Day on March 20th, researchers linked to the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network have tried to pin down these moods and examine how the pandemic has changed them.

Gallup, a pollster, asks the same questions in scores of countries. The most revealing one tells people to imagine a ladder, with steps numbered nought to ten. The top rung represents the best life you could have, the bottom rung represents the worst. What rung are you on now?
People’s responses to that question, known as a Cantril ladder, suggest (rather surprisingly) that the world was about as happy in the teeth of an awful pandemic as it was before the coronavirus struck. The average score across 95 countries, not population-weighted, crept up insignificantly from 5.81 in 2017-19 to 5.85 in 2020. But the pattern of life satisfaction has changed. Covid-19 has made old people more cheerful. A few countries have had some of the happiness squeezed out of them; others have amassed more of it.
Covid-19 threatens the old far more than the young, with the risk of death after contracting the disease doubling for every eight years of life. Yet the old have cheered up. Globally, between 2017-19 and 2020 happiness was boosted by 0.22 points on the Cantril ladder among people over the age of 60. Celina Beatriz Gazeti dos Santos, a 64-year-old psychologist in São Paulo, ticks off a list of things that might dampen her mood—the pandemic, widespread corruption, a dislikeable government, others’ misery. Yet she proclaims herself increasingly happy and optimistic all the same.

In Britain, a country with excellent happiness data, everyone has slipped, but some more than others (see chart 1). There, and in other rich countries, the age profile of happiness before the pandemic struck was roughly U-shaped when plotted on a graph. People began their adult lives in a cheerful state. They became glummer in middle age. Then, after about the age of 50, they started to became happier again. If they made it to a very advanced age, however, they fell back into the doldrums.
Today the pattern is an upward slope. The young are less satisfied than the middle-aged, who are less satisfied than the old. That might be put down to Britain’s vaccination programme, which has targeted the old first. But the pattern has barely changed over the past year. Months before Britons became familiar with what some call “the Pfizer” and “the AstraZeneca”, something had shifted.
Video-conferencing software has enabled many old people to stay in touch with their families—sometimes better than before the pandemic. In countries that locked down, they have the pleasure of knowing that society made sacrifices to protect them. And as John Helliwell, an economist at the University of British Columbia who wrote part of the World Happiness Report points out, the old feel healthier. Globally, 36% of men over the age of 60 said they had a health problem last year, down from an average of 46% in the three years before. Among women, the share with health problems fell from 51% to 42%. Old people probably are not actually healthier. Rather, covid-19 has changed the yardstick. They feel healthier because they have dodged a disease that could kill them.
Meanwhile the young have had a rough year. Many lost their jobs—in America the unemployment rate for people aged 20 to 24 shot up from 6.3% in February 2020 to 25.6% two months later (it fell back to 9.6% last month). In some rich countries young women have had a particularly hard time. They often work in sectors, such as hospitality, which have been shut down. When schools close, many are lumbered with more than their fair share of child care.
They also have busy social lives. Having lots of friends seems, counter-intuitively, to have made the pandemic harder. One study of Britain by Ben Etheridge and Lisa Spantig, both at the University of Essex, found that women with at least four close friends slumped more than anyone during the spring 2020 lockdown. “People who are used to seeing lots of friends really suffered—and women and younger people have more friends,” says Xiaowei Xu of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Some countries have fared better than others (see chart 2). Whereas Britons’ happiness slumped in 2020, Germany rose from being the 15th happiest country in the world to the seventh happiest. Britain has endured long lockdowns and an excess-death rate of 190 per 100,000 people since the start of the pandemic. Germany’s excess-death rate is just 77 per 100,000. For most of last year Germany fought covid-19 much better than most of Europe, although it has gone on to fluff the vaccination endgame—leading Bild, a tabloid newspaper, to declare in February: “Liebe Briten, we beneiden you” (dear Britain, we envy you).
Strikingly, the countries that were at the top of the happiness chart before the pandemic remain there. The three highest-ranking countries in 2020—Finland, Iceland and Denmark—were among the top four in 2017-19. All three have dealt well with covid-19, and have excess-death rates below 21 per 100,000. Iceland has a negative rate. It helps to be a remote island.
The most intriguing suggestion in the World Happiness Report is that some links between covid-19 and happiness operate in both directions. The authors do not suggest that happiness helps countries resist covid-19. Rather, they argue that one of the things that sustains national happiness also makes places better at dealing with pandemics. That thing is trust. Polls by Gallup show that many of the places that have coped best with covid-19, such as the Nordic countries and New Zealand, have widespread faith in institutions and strangers. Large majorities of their inhabitants believe that a neighbour would return a wallet if they found it.
Countries have failed to see off covid-19 for many obvious reasons. Some are poor; others are poorly led. They lack recent experience with diseases such as SARS. They cannot police their borders. But Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Columbia University, suggests another reason: politicians and officials in many rich European and American countries decided they could not ask too much of the public. A combination of individualism and less-than-solid institutional trust meant they felt unable to insist on quarantines or mask-wearing until the situation grew desperate.
People who don’t need people
If that is right, it might help explain a broad regional change: the falling happiness of Latin America and the rising happiness of East Asia. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico all became less happy in 2020; China, Japan and Taiwan became happier, although South Korea slipped a bit. It is as though Latin American countries had the wrong kind of happiness before 2020, says Mr Helliwell—a happiness sustained by people’s close social connections, not by high levels of social trust. A global poll in 2019 found that only 52% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean thought a neighbour would return a wallet; just 41% thought a cop would. That is the lowest share of any region.
The pervasive lack of trust made it harder for Latin American countries to tackle covid-19 in a comprehensive way. People can and do keep their distance from each other, but that is emotionally tough in countries where people are normally so sociable. Mexicans have been deprived of their leisurely Friday lunches and Sunday family gatherings (though some carry on anyway). “The pandemic has changed a lot,” laments Edmilson de Souza Santos, a builder in Barueri, a São Paulo suburb. “You have to stop living your life.”
There remains a big national puzzle. America responded poorly to covid-19 and has suffered more than 500,000 excess deaths. Yet the Gallup poll detects a slight rise in Americans’ happiness level in 2020. A panel survey by the University of Southern California shows that mental stress and anxiety shot up in America last March and April, but then subsided. Two subsequent waves of infection and death appeared not to disturb them further.
Many American states have had rather lackadaisical lockdowns, at least for adults—for schoolchildren restrictions can seem unbending. That could have kept people’s spirits up. Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University and other researchers found that the first wave of lockdowns, last spring, lowered women’s moods. It could also be that extreme partisanship helps. Many Americans have spent the past year in an alternate information universe in which covid-19 is just like flu. It is hard to get too worked up about fake news. ■",2

1624,"ACROSS MUCH of Asia, the pandemic has given national leaders an excuse to unleash authoritarian instincts—think Thailand, the Philippines or India. Australia, though, provides a stark contrast. There, authority has conspicuously ebbed away from the federal government and to the vast country’s six states.
The shift is clearest in the way states have imposed their own quarantine rules. Australia closed to the outside world at the outset of the pandemic. But individual state governments also saw out-of-state Australians as a peril. Backed by state police and pursuing a zero-covid policy, they slammed their borders shut. They have since opened and closed them on states’ individual whims, depending on the perceived threat of infections from other states.

No more striking exercise of state power has occurred since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919, when states last closed themselves off from each other. But then the Commonwealth of Australia was not even 20 years old. Regional identities were stronger than national ones. Canberra was not yet then the federal capital. And the role of the prime minister of the federation had not yet been properly construed: the premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, the most populous states, wielded more power.
This time the federal government is stronger. But it has also bungled. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, looked witless early on by insisting he would attend a rugby match. His government joined a suit brought by a mining tycoon challenging Western Australia’s popular decision to close its borders. More recently Canberra insisted on overseeing Australia’s vaccine rollout but failed to lay on sufficient supplies. It struggled to get what jabs it had into arms after blocking state health authorities from taking the lead. These have since stepped in, with mass-vaccination clinics, but the political harm has been done. Mr Morrison’s ratings languish. In contrast, the premiers of the two most isolationist states, Western Australia and Queensland, have won landslide re-elections.
The pandemic has given people “a lesson in how real the states’ sovereignty is”, says Frank Bongiorno, a historian at the Australian National University. A sense of state identity has re-emerged among citizens. Australians tune in to state leaders’ daily press briefings on the pandemic. A new “national cabinet” that includes state premiers has been formed to co-ordinate the response. Greg Melleuish of the University of Wollongong says these days they enjoy “the limelight they don’t normally get”. Perhaps for the first time, Australians are familiar with premiers of other states.
Much of the ground for states’ re-emergence, argues Geoff Gallop, a former premier of Western Australia, had already been laid. Once home to corrupt political machines, reformed state capitals have in recent decades earned a better reputation. More sleaze attaches to governments in Canberra. States have taken the lead in areas that the federal government has wilfully neglected, Aboriginal affairs and climate change above all.
Yet does this all amount to a permanent shift in relative power? Perhaps not. Who holds the purse strings still counts. The government in Canberra began accruing power after the second world war with the introduction of a federal income tax. Closing borders and imposing lockdowns is an easier call with the federal government’s promise of massive support for state economies.
Nor is a permanent shift away from federal authority always desirable. Take climate: Australia’s international commitments to cut carbon emissions can only be made in Canberra, not state capitals. As for the new national cabinet, it does not behave as a cabinet should, by assuming collective responsibility. Rather, individual premiers like to grab the microphone. Besides, its importance will fade with the pandemic.
Right now, the federal government must push more forcefully for reopening, not just between states but to the outside world, too. Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, warns that inter-state rivalry risks curdling national unity. As it is, isolation has caused Australia to turn inward. It is shut off from its huge diaspora and it has halted the immigration on which the country was built. A “fortress Australia”, anxious about the world and inclined to throw up barriers against it, is, as Mr Fullilove warns, a smaller Australia. If ever the federal government had a case to make against the states’ perspective, it is that one.",2
1625,"FRESH FROM victories in Tokyo, Russian Olympic medalists were preparing for a reception with Vladimir Putin earlier this month when they were told they would spend a week in quarantine before meeting the president. “I still can’t believe I’ll have to sit in one room for seven days,” Angelina Melnikova, a gymnast, wrote on social media. But the requirement wasn’t new: senior officials, journalists and even veterans of the second world war have had to self-isolate before coming within breathing distance of the man who has stood at Russia’s helm for over two decades, and who next week turns 69.
When Russia first recorded a surge in coronavirus cases in March last year, Mr Putin donned a yellow hazmat suit to visit Moscow’s main covid-19 hospital. State TV cameras captured him taking selfies with staff and shaking hands with the hospital’s chief physician, Denis Protsenko. “No head of state has so far dared to come so close to the infected,” gushed the Kremlin’s chief propagandist, Dmitry Kiselyov, on his Sunday night news show. All par for the course for a strongman who has built his reputation on action-man stunts.

But in the months since then, perhaps no world leader has been as shielded from the virus. Days after Mr Putin’s hospital visit, Mr Protsenko announced that he himself was sick with covid-19, and Mr Putin holed up in his residence outside Moscow, haranguing officials by video-link as his approval ratings sank. Special tunnels were installed at the residence to douse visitors in disinfectant. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s main opposition figure, who is now in jail, coined a new nickname for his political foe: “grandpa in a bunker”.
In March, the BBC reported that the Kremlin had spent $85m on quarantine accommodation for staff and visitors coming into contact with Mr Putin and other measures to ensure his well-being. That figure is all the more startling when you consider that Russia has had a working vaccine since last August, when the president approved the Sputnik V jab. On September 14th Mr Putin announced he was going into self-isolation after covid cases were detected in his inner circle, less than three months after he revealed he had been vaccinated. He emerged two weeks later, to be seen meeting Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan on September 29th. But Muscovites are not expecting to see him around the place.",2
1626,"MOLECULAR BIOLOGY is not a popularity contest. But if it were, it would be a partisan one. The evolutionary biologists would pledge their allegiance en masse to DNA. The sequences contained in its regular coils knit together the stories of almost all life on the planet. Pharmacologists, being of a more practical bent, would instead vote for proteins. Proteins are not about sequence, but about shape; their complex, irregular outlines, and the ways that they can change, allow them to do almost all of the biological work that gets done in cells. And it is thanks to the way that particular drug molecules fit into those shapes that almost all drugs have their effects.
There would be only a small following for ribonucleic acid (RNA), widely seen as a helpmeet molecule. It could be argued that the production of RNA is DNA’s main purpose; it is certainly true that the production of proteins would be nowhere without it. But it is a backstage operator, not a star; hewing wood and drawing water, hard working but hardly glamorous, appreciated only by devotees.

Or at least that was the case until vaccines made of RNA started giving protection against covid-19 to millions of people around the world every day. Now Cinderella has gone to the ball. Not only are RNA vaccines being considered for all sorts of other diseases, some of which have yielded to no other approach; other pharmaceutical uses of RNA look set to come into their own, as well. The way molecular biology is applied to medicine seems to be in the throes of revolution.
Incarnation incarnate
The great unifying truth of molecular biology, uncovered during the intellectual revolution which followed the discovery of DNA’s double-helix structure, is the way in which the worlds of shape and sequence are linked. The shape of a protein depends on the intricate way in which the chain of amino acids of which it consists is folded up. That depends in turn on the order in which amino acids of different types are strung together on that chain. And the order of the amino acids is a crucial part of the genetic information stored in the DNA sequences of the cell’s genome.
The transfer of information from the staid archival form it takes in the genome to its active physical instantiation in the machineries of the cell depends on RNA, a molecule in which both sequence and shape play crucial roles. The gene sequence is first copied from DNA to RNA; that RNA transcript is then edited to form a molecule called a messenger RNA, or mRNA (see diagram).

The end of the mRNA molecule is formatted into a distinctive shape which is recognised by ribosomes, complex pieces of machinery composed of dozens of proteins draped around another set of RNA molecules. With the help of yet more RNA molecules—little ones called tRNAs which stick to the mRNA sequence three letters at a time—the ribosome translates the genetic message into the protein it refers to by creating a chain of amino acids as it moves along the message.
This is the mechanism exploited by the RNA vaccines developed by BioNTech, a German biotechnology company based in Mainz, and Moderna, an American one from Cambridge, Massachusetts, against SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes covid-19. The companies mass produce the RNA sequence describing the distinctive “spike” protein, which studs the outer membrane of the virus, formatted so as to look like a natural mRNA. These RNA molecules, wrapped in little fatty bubbles called liposomes are injected into patients, where the liposomes smuggle the mRNA into cells. Ribosomes pick up on the mRNA format and read the sequence, thus producing the spike protein. The immune system learns to recognise the spike which the vaccinated cells are producing and stores away the memory of how to do so. This allows it to mount a swift response if it later comes across the same protein on the surfaces of viral particles and infected cells.
This ability to get cells to churn out proteins for which their DNA contains no genes is, in itself, enough to open up swathes of new therapeutic territory. But it is not the whole story. Cells make vast amounts of RNA that does not describe proteins. Its ability to recognise specific genetic sequences makes it useful for all sorts of processes, including turning the translation of genes on and off. Its ability to fold itself into particular forms—hairpins, loops and the like—makes it good at interacting with proteins.
This alphabet soup of RNAs (see table) seems to function a bit like a computer’s operating system, mediating the relationship between the cell’s hardware and its software. Many of the details of how this works remain obscure. But some are understood well enough for a lot of brainpower and money to have been poured into attempts to hack the operating system for therapeutic purposes.

These abilities should enable drugmakers to head upstream from the proteins whose shapes they have long studied into the realms of sequence. Where previously they targeted proteins which were already present, now they can in principle target the processes which control which proteins get made in the first place, adding helpful new ones to the roster and crossing harmful old ones off. There are RNA-based drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, heart disease and numerous inherited disorders—as well as brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
Moreover, RNA’s mixture of sequence and shape means that in many of these areas the once-haphazard process of drug discovery, long dependent on matching the shape of small synthetic molecules to the crannies and crevices of the proteins they targeted, can itself be systematised. A sequence which recognises, or forms a part of, one gene can be switched out for a sequence tailored to another. When what an RNA drug does depends on its sequence, its target and action can be modified by the click of a mouse.
The medicine is the message
Both the firms with mRNA vaccines on sale had other vaccines in the pipeline before covid-19 struck. It is part of the appeal of the technology that they were able to turn on a sixpence and refocus their efforts on SARS-CoV-2 as soon as the sequence for its spike gene was released last January. Now they are both getting on with what they had planned beforehand. Moderna is looking at vaccines to fend off infection by cytomegalovirus (a herpes virus which causes neurological problems in newborns), three lung viruses which cause respiratory disease in young children and Zika, a mosquito-borne virus found mainly in the tropics. BioNTech is focusing more on developing vaccines, and other treatments, with which to treat a wide range of cancers.
Cancer cells tend to have peculiar constellations of proteins on their surfaces, including both normal ones that are overexpressed and, more intriguingly, mutant forms peculiar to the development of that tumour. Comparing the genes expressed in a patient’s healthy cells with those used by their tumour cells reveals which mutant proteins the cancers are producing; mRNAs for those proteins can then be incorporated into a vaccine.

Produced as a result of vaccination, the proteins can engender a vigorous immune response the cancer itself does not—part of being a successful tumour is deploying mechanisms that stop the immune system from coming to grips with you. According to Ozlem Tureci, BioNTech’s co-founder, the firm has 500 patients enrolled in clinical trials for cancer. Moderna is pursuing similar ideas.
BioNTech is also testing mRNA vaccines aimed at overexpressed but unmutated proteins. Moderna, meanwhile, is looking into vaccines that train the immune system to recognise proteins created by common mutations in KRAS, a gene implicated in about 20% of human cancers. CureVac, based in Tübingen, an mRNA firm which also has a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in trials, is conducting trials of a vaccine for non-small-cell lung cancer.
Vaccination is not the only way that mRNA injection might fight viruses and tumours. The technique could also be used to get cells to produce therapeutic proteins that are currently administered through injection or infusion: interleukins and antibodies. Designer antibodies are a massive faff to make in industrial quantities; getting patients’ cells to take on the manufacturing duties instead would be a great step forward if it proved practical.
There are many other sorts of proteins which can be stimulated to therapeutic effect. A project on which Moderna is collaborating with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical giant, delivers the mRNA for a protein which encourages the regrowth of blood vessels. The idea is that the therapy, now in phase 2 clinical trials, could stimulate the growth of new cardiac blood vessels after heart attacks.
Getting the body to produce a protein it needs just for a short while—an antibody, say, or a growth factor—is one thing. But what about a protein that it needs on an everyday basis, but lacks the gene for? Such genetic diseases have always been the most obvious targets for gene therapy—treatments which add a missing gene to a patient’s cells, or repair a broken one, thus allowing them to make a protein they have hitherto lacked. But at least some such conditions might instead be treated with mRNA. Inserting a gene might be more elegant—but getting it in the right place and regulated in the right way is challenging. If mRNA treatments get the job done, they might offer a nice alternative.
There are thus mRNA treatments being studied for phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder which requires sufferers to restrict their diets for their entire lives; glycogen-storage disease, which enlarges the liver and kidneys and stunts children’s growth; and propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, two illnesses in which the body cannot properly break down proteins and fats. All are conditions that gene therapists are looking at, too.
That BioNTech, Curevac, Moderna and some others now have all these projects on the go is largely down to the fact that they have spent many years developing the basics of their platforms. Many hurdles had to be crossed before they could get cells to accept and act on messages from beyond; the RNA had to be subtly toughened up so that it would not itself fall prey to the immune system or get dismantled inside cells; the right lipids had to be found for delivery, sometimes tailored to particular tissues like those of the liver or lymph nodes. The potential inherent in the idea meant that their work was not completely ignored; in 2018 Moderna’s IPO valued the company at $7.5bn, a record for the biotech sector. But biotechnology has a long history of proving biology to be messier and more contrary than those seeking to exploit its loopholes expect.
Stop making sense
Scepticism was also warranted, it seemed, by the fact that messing around with RNA had been through bursts of popularity before. One of the very oldest companies in the field, Ionis Pharmaceutials (known as Isis until that name was appropriated by a would-be caliphate) was founded in 1989. Its intention, then and now, was not to make use of mRNA, but to hobble it.
The sequence of an mRNA molecule carries the same information as can be found in the gene which served as its template; but thanks to the way RNA is made it carries it in a complementary way. Where the DNA has a letter called C for cytosine, the RNA will have G for guanine; where the RNA has a C the DNA will have a G, and so on. Complementary strands stick together; that is what keeps DNA molecules paired up in double helices. If you introduce an mRNA to a molecule with a complementary sequence the two will stick together, too, rendering the mRNA useless (see bottom deck of diagram above).
Again, getting the neat idea to work in ways that helped proved hard. It took Ionis a quarter century to start getting its “antisense” drugs to market on a regular basis. It now has three: nusinersen, approved in America in 2016 and Europe in 2017 for use against childhood spinal muscular atrophy, a muscle-wasting illness; inotersen, approved in 2018 for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR), which damages the peripheral nervous system; and volanesorsen, approved in Europe in 2019, which lowers levels of triglyceride fats in the blood of people with a metabolic error that makes them far too high.
Ionis currently has a further 37 antisense molecules in clinical trials for conditions including Huntington’s disease (a study being carried out in collaboration with Roche, a large Swiss pharma company); amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (in collaborations with Biogen, a specialist in treatments for neurological disease); beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder similar to sickle-cell anaemia; and cystic fibrosis.
The firm is also developing, in collaboration with Novartis, another Swiss company, a way of reducing levels of lipoprotein(a), a particularly damaging form of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Lipoprotein(a) levels are untreatable with existing medicines; Pelacarsen, as the drug is known, is in phase 3 clinical trials to see if it can change that.
Unlike molecules of mRNA, which can tolerate only a small amount of chemical tinkering before becoming ribosome-unfriendly, antisense molecules can be tweaked quite a bit, and thus made long-lasting. Ionis’s researchers have worked out how to stabilise them so that they will hang around inside cells for months. This is important because most of Ionis’s targets are chronic diseases that require continuous treatment. The fewer injections per year the better.
While biotech companies were beavering away at antisense molecules in the 1990s, researchers elsewhere discovered that nature had a similar technology of its own: gene silencing, a process guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The early 2000s saw a gene-silencing biotech boom led by Alnylam, founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2002, and Sirna Therapeutics, which got going in San Francisco the following year.
Established pharma companies, including Abbott, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche and Takeda, waded in, too, with Merck buying Sirna for more than $1bn in 2006. For almost a decade, attention and money were showered on the field. But though there were many promising leads, they failed to turn into drugs. By the early 2010s it seemed that the party was over.
Nonlinear, nonvisual and inclusive
Alnylam, though, kept dancing. In 2014 it bought what was left of Sirna from Merck for a knock-down price. It launched its first product, patisiran, a treatment for hATTR, in 2018. It now has two others, givosiran and lumasiran, which also address rare genetic disorders.
A fourth substance developed using its technology has broader appeal. This is inclisiran, developed to treat an inherited disorder that pushes the concentration of LDL cholesterol in the blood to dangerous levels; around 30m people worldwide suffer from it. A firm called the Medicines Company licensed Inclisiran from Alnylam to bring it to market. With approval looking likely (it was given in Europe late last year) Novartis bought the Medicines Company for $9.7bn in January 2020.
According to Akshay Vaishnaw, Alnylam’s head of R, the firm has another 14 siRNA drugs in clinical trials. These including potential treatments for haemophilia, hepatitis B and recurrent kidney stones. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, of Pasadena, California, has eight potential siRNA drugs in trials, including one directed at cystic fibrosis. Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, of Lexington, Massachusetts, has three.
These siRNAs work by straddling the worlds of shape and sequence. Their shape fits them into a group of proteins called an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). But a bit of the siRNA is left sticking out of this complex; this tail contains a sequence complementary to that of the RNA to be silenced. When siRNA and mRNA meet, the proteins in the RISC chop the messenger to pieces. (A conceptually similar mechanism for the RNA-guided protein-executed chopping up of genes found in bacteria is the basis of the CRISPR tools now revolutionising gene editing.)
In plants and invertebrates the natural function of the siRNA mechanism is clear: cutting up mRNAs associated with viruses. They do not seem to serve that function in vertebrates, and no one is quite sure what they do instead. But that does not stop them from looking like promising drugs.

So do another set of RNAs associated with RISCs: micro-RNAs, which use their complementary sequences not to destroy mRNAs but to regulate them. The human genome seems to contain about 2,600 of these miRNAs, and they are thought to be involved in regulating the rate at which about 60% of the genes describing proteins get transcribed. Several look like promising therapeutic targets.
Since the active bit of an miRNA is a single-stranded sequence-specific tail, the obvious way to target them is with antisense. Regulus Pharmaceuticals, a firm that started life as a collaboration between Ionis and Alnylam, is trying to develop antisense molecules aimed at miRNA-21 to treat two kidney-related genetic conditions in which that miRNA plays a role. When you start targeting miRNAs, though, things get positively baroque. Santaris Pharma, a Danish firm, has developed Miravirsen, an antisense suppressor for miRNA-122 which the hepatitis C virus uses for its own unhelpful ends. The drug has now been taken on by Roche.
The innovation continues. MiNA Therapeutics, a startup in London, is working on the potential of saRNAs, which activate genes which otherwise stay silent. Others are investigating systems for “self-amplifying” mRNA drugs. These mRNAs would inveigle a cell’s ribosomes into producing not just the protein that was meant to be delivered, but also a second protein, called RNA-replicase, which would make more of the mRNA, thus leading to even more protein being expressed. There is surely further cleverness to come.
Could be so exciting

Even if only a fraction of these possibilities pan out it looks certain that, in popularity contests to come as in stockmarkets today (see chart), more people will be plumping for RNA. Their support will be welcomed by the small band of biologists with an interest in the very earliest history of life that has long formed the discerning core of the molecule’s following. Life needs both a way of doing things in the now—catalysing the reactions on which its metabolism depends—and of passing information into the future. Of the molecules known today only RNA, in its shape-and-sequence versatility, can do both those things, dealing with the needs of the everyday at the same time as encoding instructions for its own reproduction in the form of a legible sequence. This suggests to many that early life spent some time in an “RNA world” before the division of labour allocated doing things to the proteins and storing data to DNA, reducing RNA to a supporting role in the world it had created.
The application of RNA has met many obstacles over past decades, and the fact that it has proved itself in vaccines does not mean it will not meet more in the future. But it does seem that medicine now has a way to target drugs not just at proteins, but at the processes that make them, and that opens up new realms of possibility. The next RNA world awaits. ■

1627,"By the time you get to the end of this column it is possible that I will have been nicked by the boys in blue. I have been sent a 'warning notice'.
My crime was to buy a car 27 years ago and keep it. I boasted that I was doing the right thing by the environment. 
Replacing a medium-sized car like mine with a new one generates a carbon footprint of 17 tonnes —the equivalent of three years' worth of gas and electricity in a typical UK home.
Since the average motorist changes their car five or six times in 27 years, I've practically saved the planet from global warming single-handedly.
It's not that I expected a knighthood. I just didn't expect to be punished for it. 
But Transport for London has changed emission rules so we OACs (Owners of Ancient Cars) who live within the North and South Circular roads must now fork out £12.50 every time we drive anywhere. All day and every day (except Christmas).
That meant setting up an account to pay the charges. So I did as I was told and got an email confirming that my account was active. 
Off I drove. A few days later, the Warning Notice arrived.
I was puzzled, so I checked the website and got nowhere. The password I'd used for the account was suddenly not accepted. 
So I phoned the number on the website. And got nowhere. This time the problem seemed to be my PIN. 
Or maybe my account number. Or maybe my customer ID. Or my PCN number. Whatever that was. The recorded message didn't really care. I gave up.
I had become the innocent victim of the new digital age in which the algorithm reigns supreme.
There was a time when a human being with a problem talked to another human being who helped to get it sorted. Those days are gone. 
The lives of big companies and government officials are made so much easier if we customers or clients can be kept at arm's length. 
It began long before the pandemic struck. Covid has given it a rocket booster.
It's so much easier to cite Covid if you're dealing with a customer who wants to complain about the heating engineer not turning up.
Easier for them, that is. Not for you. 
You just have to keep listening to the recorded message telling you that your call is important to them, but unfortunately they are receiving a very large volume of calls and, due to Covid restrictions, there will regrettably be some delay in getting to you.
What a load of rubbish. Even if it were true that 'Covid restrictions' still existed and call handlers were forced to work from home, modern technology means calls could very easily be patched through to them. 
But it's not true. Not any longer. Five minutes in the rush hour on any Tube or bus proves that if you want to go to work, you can.
But that's assuming your company actually wants you to go to work. 
The statistics show that many firms are saving loads of money by encouraging office staff to sit at computers in their own homes rather than occupy expensive space in their city centre office block.
At least with private companies we customers retain the merest smidgeon of power. We can always take our custom elsewhere.
It worked for me, sort of, when my home alarm system kept going wrong and my long-suffering neighbour was being woken up in the middle of the night by it.
I spent endless hours on the phone listening to their recorded messages warning me, amongst many other things, that an engineer couldn't visit unless there was somewhere for him to wash his hands and wondering how many homes don't have washbasins.
Eventually, I cracked and told them I was switching companies. Result. The engineer came. Not on the day promised, but let's be thankful for small mercies.
That option does not exist, however, if it's a government department you are forced to deal with. Especially if it's the dreaded HMRC.
You'd have needed a heart of stone not to share the pain Ben Wilkinson described in this paper a few days ago. 
It took him one hour and 44 minutes of being forced to listen to the hideous music and even more hideous recorded messages telling him the delays were 'due to coronavirus' before he was able to speak to an actual person.
And then the human told him she could not help him because she had 'not been trained' to deal with his particular problem. 
So he had to start all over again. The really scary part of this is that Ben is not alone. 
And it's not as if HMRC can claim that they are getting an abnormally high number of calls.
Their own annual report, published this month, shows they received 33 million calls in the past financial year. 
That's 8 million fewer than the year before. Four years ago, only 15 per cent of callers had to wait more than ten minutes. That figure has more than trebled.
This is more than just an inconvenience. The taxman has enormous powers. Quite right, too. 
Nobody enjoys paying tax and even the most diligent citizen might make the occasional mistake. 
Plus there are many fraudsters out there — sometimes aided and abetted by dubious accountants — who should be in jail rather than their Caribbean tax haven.
But there are also many entirely innocent people being threatened with fines and visits from debt-collection agencies over money they do not owe.
And on the other side of the balance sheet are those who are forced to wait months for refunds of money they should never have been made to pay in the first place.
Ironically, the HMRC website offers a service called 'Where's my reply?' I say 'ironically' because I've just checked it out. 
I logged onto the website and claimed (a modest white lie) that I'd made a query about my self-assessment a few days ago.
It told me I could expect a reply by June 2. That's six months. Oh … and if I still hadn't had a reply I could try phoning. To which there is only one response: a hollow laugh.
It's a bit like your doctor telling you not to worry about his rather bleak diagnosis because you'll probably be dead soon anyway.
I suppose we should applaud HMRC for admitting that it's not exactly covering itself in glory. 
Or, to use its own language, 'not fulfilling the ambition to be a trusted, modern tax and customs department'.
Perhaps it would help if their customer-service staff were not working from their offices only one day a week.
I suspect there's something else going on here. Covid is a convenient excuse for forcing us to abandon any hope we might have had of talking to a living, breathing human being who might actually help us with our problem.
The Institute of Customer Service says that for the first time more than half of all our interactions with companies or public services are being made digitally.
Incidentally, you might like to know that I have just learned that 'they' won't be coming to take me away after all.
I have managed to make contact with a real human being at Transport for London who was both courteous and competent. 
It helped, of course, that I have the advantage of a public platform in the shape of this newspaper. Most do not.
Increasingly, we are being deprived of even a semblance of what we once thought of as customer service.
We are left talking to a computer screen behind which sits not another human being, but an algorithm. Or a recorded telephone announcement that may or may not respond to our pleas for help.
It's as though any human compassion in the relationship between customer and provider has simply disappeared. And that's very sad.",-2
1628," (CNN)With less than one month until the Army's deadline to vaccinate its active-duty force, the service will begin barring soldiers who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 without an exemption from reenlistment, promotions, and other ""favorable personnel actions.""In a memo dated November 16, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said soldiers who refuse the vaccine would be ""flagged,"" preventing them from ""reenlistment, reassignment, promotion, appearance before a semi-centralized promotion board, issuance of awards and decorations"" and more.The Navy and the Marine Corps issued similar guidance last month, paving the way for the discharge of service members who refuse to be vaccinated.Soldiers who have received an exemption or whose exemption request is pending will not be flagged.The guidance, which also applies to the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard, was sent as the head of the Oklahoma National Guard finds himself in dispute with the Pentagon for refusing to enforce the vaccine mandate.The Army's deadline for all active-duty military members to get vaccinated is December 15 while National Guard soldiers are required to be vaccinated by June 30, 2022. Soldiers, including Reserve and Guard, can be flagged even before these deadlines for refusing the vaccine.""The Soldier will remain flagged until they are fully vaccinated, receive an approved medical or administrative exemption, or are separated from the Army,"" Wormuth wrote.A soldier is flagged on the date they make a ""final declination"" to be immunized after meeting with a medical professional and receiving a second order from a commander to get the Covid-19 vaccine.Flagged soldiers will also be ineligible for tuition assistance, attending military or civilian schools, and being paid their enlistment bonuses.Though the Air Force hasn't issued specific guidance about reenlistments or promotions, Secretary Frank Kendall made it clear Thursday that airmen who refuse the vaccine will be discharged.""The bottom line is that willfully disobeying a lawful order is incompatible with military service and to get a vaccination is a lawful order,"" Kendall said in a Facebook event when asked about the vaccine mandate.Last month, the Navy made it clear that it will pursue discharge for any sailors who refuse vaccination without a pending or approved exemption. ""Commands shall not allow Sailors refusing the vaccine to promote or advance, reenlist, or execute orders with the exception of separation orders,"" the Navy said in a press release in October.Shortly thereafter, the Marine Corps followed suit, saying in its vaccination guidance that Marines refusing the Covid-19 vaccine without an exemption would be processed for administrative separation. ""A Marine who has not yet been fully vaccinated is not considered worldwide deployable and shall be assigned or reassigned, locally, to billets which account for health risks to the unvaccinated marine and those working in proximity to the Marine,"" the guidance said. ""Marines refusing the vaccine shall not reenlist or execute order, with the exception of separation orders.""Vaccination requirements for the military have led to a debate between the Pentagon and the commander of the Oklahoma National Guard over the chain of command in the military and the federal government's authority. Pentagon officials have said that all National Guard members are subject to military readiness requirements, including vaccines, even when they are not called up under federal authority. But Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino has argued that he answers to Oklahoma's Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt who ordered him not to enforce the Pentagon's vaccine mandate, The Washington Post reported. ",0
1629,"Schoolies has well and truly kicked off on the Gold Coast as thousands of teenagers flock to the city for a week of partying.
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
With a kiss and a hug goodbye to mum, many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning.
Others had already gone to the local supermarket to stock up on food and drinks for the week ahead.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",-2

1631,"THANKS ESPECIALLY to ubiquitous camera-phones, today’s wars have been filmed more than any in history. Consider the growing archives of Mnemonic, a Berlin charity that preserves video that purports to document war crimes and other violations of human rights. If played nonstop, Mnemonic’s collection of video from Syria’s decade-long war would run until 2061. Mnemonic also holds seemingly bottomless archives of video from conflicts in Sudan and Yemen. Even greater amounts of potentially relevant additional footage await review online.
Outfits that, like Mnemonic, scan video for evidence of rights abuses note that the task is a slog. Some trim costs by recruiting volunteer reviewers. Not everyone, however, is cut out for the tedium and, especially, periodic dreadfulness involved. That is true even for paid staff. Karim Khan, who leads a United Nations team in Baghdad investigating Islamic State (IS) atrocities, says viewing the graphic cruelty causes enough “secondary trauma” for turnover to be high. The UN project, called UNITAD, is sifting through documentation that includes more than a year’s worth of video, most of it found online or on the phones and computers of captured or killed IS members.

Now, however, reviewing such video is becoming much easier. Technologists are developing a type of artificial-intelligence (AI) software that uses “machine vision” to rapidly scour video for imagery that suggests an abuse of human rights has been recorded. It’s early days, but the software is promising. A number of organisations, including Mnemonic and UNITAD, have begun to operate such programs.
This year UNITAD began to run one dubbed Zeteo. It performs well, says David Hasman, one of its operators. Zeteo can be instructed to find—and, if the image resolution is decent, typically does find—bits of video showing things like explosions, beheadings, firing into a crowd and grave-digging. Zeteo can also spot footage of a known person’s face, as well as scenes as precise as a woman walking in uniform, a boy holding a gun in twilight, and people sitting on a rug with an IS flag in view. Searches can encompass metadata that reveals when, where and on what devices clips were filmed.
Zeteo was developed for the UN, with input from its investigators, by Microsoft. The American software giant has built a few such programs as part of a project it calls AI for Humanitarian Action. The goal is to accelerate prosecutions, says Justin Spelhaug, Microsoft’s head of “technology for social impact”. Half a dozen organisations are now using specially developed Microsoft software to comb video for potential evidence of war crimes and the like. Microsoft provides the technology at little or no cost.
A recent achievement hints at how such capabilities can help. The Atlantic Council, an American think-tank that sees great promise in its tests of machine vision, sought to identify a man who had been photographed in Syria, his face blurred out, holding chopped-off heads. The outfit’s Digital Forensic Research Lab ingeniously studied how squiggly patterns in the man’s camouflage met at seams. After scouring the web for imagery of people in similar fatigues, the researchers found non-blurred images of a man wearing those very fatigues. The researchers have identified the man and his affiliation with the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary firm.
Developing software that spots certain objects or actions in video is often straightforward. It involves feeding algorithms for object recognition with masses of imagery of whatever is to be found. This means it is relatively easy to train software to recognise leaping cats or other things that abound online. But footage showing a violation of human rights is rarer. This makes it hard to assemble a collection of visual examples that is big and diverse enough to teach software to find similar fare. But there is a creative workaround.
Banned cluster munitions have been dropped on civilians in Syria, and Mnemonic wants to pull together video clips that show that the bombardment has been systematic. To help with that, a programmer in Berlin, Adam Harvey, is developing software called VFRAME. Training it requires at least 2,000 distinct images of each type of cluster munition, and five times as many would be better. Finding that would take ages. Mr Harvey therefore produces the imagery himself.
With funding from Germany’s government and other sources, Mr Harvey 3D-prints replicas of prohibited bomblets such as the AO-2.5RT, a Russian-made submunition dropped in Syria. He adds markings and, for some of the replicas, rust, scuffs and other damage. The replicas are then photographed, from many angles and in different lighting, amid rubble, rocks, leaves, mud and sand. For the realism of greater chromatic variation, a handful of old and new camera-phones, as well as multiple lens settings, are used.
The approach is paying off. In tests on portions of Mnemonic’s Syria and Yemen archives, VFRAME catches roughly 65% of clips that show one of the handful of types of cluster munitions modelled. Mr Harvey expects the detection rate to reach 80% by mid-June. VFRAME will then be unleashed on Mnemonic’s full archives. As for scanning the “firehose” of video posted on social media, Mnemonic’s Dia Kayyali says testing with VFRAME has begun.
Mnemonic sends video to legal bodies. So far, these have included a Belgian court, war-crimes investigation units in France, Germany and Sweden, and several UN legal teams. But Daanish Masood of the UN’s Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs also envisages a use for software that scours online video for violence and its aftermath as a source of operational intelligence, requiring less than legal certainty. He hopes VFRAME will eventually help UN peacekeepers track marauding armed groups.
Similar software seems to have already been put to another intelligence use. The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), an R body for America’s spooks, gave Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh $9m to develop machine-vision software called E-LAMP. How that software has been put to use by intelligence agencies is unknown, but it probably includes finding terrorist videos for training and propaganda. Alexander Hauptmann, one of E-LAMP’s creators at Carnegie Mellon, says the software had to be able to spot, among other things, cake-making and cellphone repair, likely proxies for mixing explosives and building detonators.
E-LAMP finds those activities, he says. Even so, such programs can be fiddly. E-LAMP was also given to a Washington, DC non-profit, the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre (SJAC), that seeks video evidence of war crimes. But SJAC stopped using the software after two years. It required too much processing power and maintenance, says its director, Mohammad Al Abdallah. Accuracy was patchy, too. SJAC’s queries for video of small missiles positioned for launch would typically also find electricity poles.
A new trick promises greater accuracy. SJAC is adopting a program called JusticeAI that seeks matches between a video’s audio and a sound library. JusticeAI recognises things such as a missile’s hiss, the popping of cluster munitions, a siren near gunfire and protest chants that turn to screams. Its users include Mnemonic and the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The software was developed by a Silicon Valley charity called Benetech with funding from America’s government. Microsoft contributed code and $300,000.
Heady stuff, to be sure. But efforts to archive as much video of abuses as possible, be it for prosecutors or historians, face an additional hurdle. Facebook, YouTube and other big online platforms also use such software as a more efficient way of spotting and removing unsavoury images that some regulators claim could inspire copycats. Compared to those companies, human-rights groups are mere “poor cousin” users of such technology, laments Sam Gregory of Witness, a Brooklyn charity that helps people film abuses.
It adds up to a paradox. The software advances that are now helping human-rights groups document atrocities are also making it easier for social-media platforms to suppress potential evidence. Mr Gregory argues for the creation of “evidence lockers”—repositories that would keep grisly video out of the public eye but available for authorised viewing. The proposal seems sensible. Momentum, however, has yet to build, even though the matter has become more urgent. On April 29th the European Parliament approved a rule that threatens online platforms with eye-watering fines for not removing, within an hour, content a member state deems terrorist. As a result, automated deletions are up.",2
1632,"THE BOYS from Pale should be dead by now. Armed with little more than homemade rifles, in June the group of some 2,000 fighters, most of them farmers unversed in war, began attacking soldiers in their rural township in Sagaing state, in north-west Myanmar. The army they were up against, known as the Tatmadaw, last seized power in a coup in February but has been fighting rebels for the past 70 years. It deployed its usual tactics to crush the uprising in Pale. Soldiers looted homes, raped women and set a village on fire, according to Bo Nagar, the rebels’ commander. Yet the militia claims to have ejected the army almost entirely from Pale, killing 400 troops in the process and losing just five of their own. Tatmadaw soldiers “are like walking dead”, says Mr Nagar. “I think they are not willing to fight this war.”
Such claims are surely exaggerated. But Mr Nagar’s swagger contains a kernel of truth. Fighters resisting the Burmese army have fared far better than many analysts predicted. Since the coup some 250 rebel groups have emerged, ranging from small urban underground cells to militias comprising thousands. Anthony Davis of Janes, a defence-intelligence firm, counts around 50 that conduct “sustained operations”.

These forces clash with army units, assassinate low-level junta officials, and bomb strategic routes, army bases and infrastructure. At least 120 telecom towers partly owned by a military conglomerate have been destroyed over the past two months. Guerrillas are increasingly targeting bridges and railways, presumably to obstruct the flow of army troops and supplies around the country.
The resistance enjoys several advantages. “Revolutionary fervour”, as Mr Davis puts it, has inspired thousands of Burmese to take up arms. Doing so during the rainy season, when the army cannot conduct big operations, has bought the militias time to forge informal alliances with experienced ethnic-minority rebels (some are even going into battle together). It also helps that the top brass did not expect widespread opposition, least of all in the Burmese heartlands. The region is home to the ethnic-majority Bamar, from which the Tatmadaw draws most recruits. The army has not fought there in decades, if ever. Soldiers do not know the terrain, and being told to kill their own saps morale. And their informants are being assassinated.
The Tatmadaw is struggling. Between February and September, “conflict incidents”, from battles and bombings to defections, took place in 250 out of Myanmar’s 330 townships, according to Matthew Arnold, an independent analyst. To put out these fires, the army has spread itself thin. More than 1,700 soldiers were killed by anti-coup forces in the three months to September, according to the National Unity Government, a shadow cabinet made up of deposed lawmakers. Some 1,500 troops have defected, and the army is struggling to recruit officers. That alone should not hurt the Tatmadaw, which may have as many as 300,000 troops. But many are poorly trained and equipped. Morale is low. Forced, in effect, to cede swathes of the country to rebels, the junta “is facing an existential crisis”, says Mr Arnold.
Yet things may soon look up for the army. Since August, it has been sending reinforcements to the country’s north-west, where resistance is fiercest, in anticipation of the dry season, which has just begun. The Tatmadaw is said to be preparing for a long campaign there. It may be planning to conduct “clearance operations”, a tactic used against the persecuted Rohingya minority in Rakhine state, in which soldiers raze villages, forcing civilians to flee, in order then to hit exposed rebels with overwhelming firepower. “The scale and geographical breadth of the impending campaign is…arguably unprecedented” in the Tatmadaw’s already bloodstained history, writes Mr Davis.
There is a strong chance resistance in this region will be crushed. But that still leaves all the guerrilla fighters in the rest of the country. A long and bloody civil war increasingly looks inevitable. ■",2
1633,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",3
1634,"THE LATE Donald Rumsfeld once sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to accompany his tax filing. “The tax code is so complex and the forms are so complicated”, he wrote, “that I know that I cannot have any confidence that I know what is being requested and therefore I cannot and do not know, and I suspect a great many Americans cannot know, whether or not their tax returns are accurate.” This is probably the least controversial statement that George W. Bush’s secretary of defence ever made. Yet despite the widely shared terror of the federal tax-collection agency, Democrats in the Senate are proposing to increase its budget. Is this wise?
The political logic for doing so is clear. To make the arithmetic of a big spending bill just about add up, Democratic senators reckon that some of the required revenue can be found through more energetic enforcement of the tax code. Increasing tax revenue without imposing any new tax increases sounds too good to be true. But the Congressional Budget Office is game, estimating that an extra $20bn spent on enforcement over ten years would bring in $61bn, and that $40bn over the same period would yield $103bn, without any changes to the tax code.

For anyone who has ever filled out an American tax return, the prospect of beefing up the tax-collection agency certainly sounds alarming. For Republicans, some of whom also suspect it of being a tool exquisitely designed to harass conservatives, it is especially sinister. Yet the answer to the maddening complexity of the tax code cannot be to load more and more responsibility onto the IRS while simultaneously cutting its budget. And that is what has been happening.
Since 2010 the IRS’s budget has fallen by 20% in real terms. Meanwhile the tax code has become still more complicated. And in addition to the task of trying to work out who has, and who has not, followed this lengthening set of rules, the agency is also being asked to make decisions over questions such as which organisations deserve non-profit status (and therefore tax breaks), as well as to play a role in the administration of an expanded array of tax credits.
One result has been a decline in the enforcement of tax laws. The share of individual tax returns that the IRS examined fell by almost half in 2010-18; the share of corporate tax returns it scrutinised fell by close to 40%. For those who take a Rumsfeldian view of tax, that sounds like something to cheer. It is not. Conservatives are usually keen on seeing laws enforced consistently. When it comes to tax, though, the combination of unfathomable rules and an overstretched agency means that compliance is encouraged through semi-random acts of menace. Low-income Americans who rely on tax credits are, if anything, more likely to be subjected to audits than wealthy ones.
The decline in enforcement is also an invitation to rule-bending. A probe by Manhattan’s district attorney has thus far revealed that the Trump Organisation paid for the private-school fees, cars and apartments of loyal employees, which had the effect of reducing their individual tax bills. It is not clear how widespread these sorts of practices are, nor even whether they actually break tax law. But for Americans with less rococo tax arrangements, such schemes reinforce a notion that undermines the general support for capitalism: that the rich do not just have more money but are also subject to less onerous rules.
The argument over increased funding for tax collection has become a proxy for a fight over whether taxes should be higher or lower. This is mistaken. Even those who favour lower taxes should want the system to be properly administered. Increasing funding for the IRS therefore makes sense. But Congress should also separate the task of deciding which organisation deserves what tax status from the processing and auditing of tax returns and tax credits. And, most important, the tax code itself needs a radical simplification, so that a former defence secretary and CEO of a pharmaceutical firm can file a return without having to resort to epistemological disclaimers. ■",2
1635,"THE GOLDEN mean in California’s one-party politics can be caricatured, only a little unfairly, as the art of sounding progressive while acting conservative. Take housing. Homeowners may recognise that housing affordability and homelessness are acute social problems. But the obvious remedy—more construction—seems unappealing, because it might hurt property values and spoil neighbourhoods. Thus the progressive-conservative position is to insist on building housing at below-market rates, which sounds compassionate but, in practice, means that little new housing actually gets built. This is why it is so encouraging that two days after Gavin Newsom handily defeated a Republican attempt to boot him from office, the governor signed two contentious measures, SB9 and SB10, aimed at increasing housing supply.
In the past decade median home values have surged 165% in both Los Angeles and San Francisco Counties to $830,000 and $1.85m, respectively. Median home prices nationwide increased by 64% to about $375,000. Before covid-19, San Francisco was the costliest city for renters; New York now barely claims the top spot. Californians make up 12% of America’s population, but 28% of its homeless.

The more controversial law of the two is SB9, which ends single-family zoning in the state. This means Californians will now be able to convert their houses into up to four units, depending on the size of their plot. California isn’t the first place to eliminate single-family zoning. Minneapolis and Oregon did so in 2019. As for SB10, that will make it easier for cities to build up to ten apartments on land currently set aside for single-family homes near busy public-transport corridors.
California has built fewer than 100,000 homes a year, on average, in the past decade. Permits issued for new construction plummeted in 2007 when the housing bubble burst, and have not yet returned to their previous level. Estimates for the number of homes the state needs to build just to keep up with population growth vary wildly. The state thinks it needs to build 1.8m homes by 2025; McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons it will need 3.5m. Ben Metcalf of the Terner Centre for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says the magic number is probably somewhere between the two.
If California so badly needs more housing, why is ending single-family zoning controversial? For a long time, making it in America meant having a house in the suburbs with the white picket fence, says Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, a think-tank. Single-family homes are also ubiquitous. As of 2019, they made up 61% of all housing units in the country. San Francisco is America’s second-densest city after New York. Yet 51% of residential land in the county is zoned for single-family homes (see map).

Although single-family homes are everywhere, they were not initially meant for everyone. Today the Bay Area is a laboratory for some of the country’s most progressive policies. Yet in 1916, Berkeley was among the first places to enact single-family zoning. Banning apartments and commercial buildings was a way to exclude poor Americans from desirable neighbourhoods. At best, the practice was snobbish. At worst, it helped segregate cities by class and race. After the Supreme Court struck down explicitly racial zoning ordinances in 1917, zoning by land-use became widespread. Metal gates still ring Berkeley’s upmarket Claremont neighbourhood today; it was one of the first places zoned for single-family homes.
The new laws will bring incremental change rather than revolution. An analysis from the Terner Centre found that SB9 could make new development possible on 5.4% of existing single-family lots. That may sound very little, but it would still create about 700,000 new units, 40% more than would otherwise have been developed. The units will also probably be built slowly, since the law depends on Californians voluntarily renovating their homes.
Even so, SB9 and SB10 have incensed the state’s vocal NIMBY constituency. NIMBYs and their YIMBY nemeses have become tribal factions in California politics. Groups seemingly removed from housing policy scream their opinions. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation runs a housing advocacy outfit that took out a full-page ad in the Sacramento Bee beseeching Mr Newsom not to sign the bills.
Among the staunchest opponents of SB9 are those who liken the law to a power grab by the state that takes planning decisions away from cities. Some local officials in southern California talk about Sacramento, the state capital, with a prickly disdain usually reserved for faraway Washington, DC. Bill Brand, the mayor of Redondo Beach, a small city south of Los Angeles, has proposed an amendment to California’s constitution that would reassert local control over land-use decisions.
Opponents also argue that the law will hasten gentrification by allowing firms to buy up single-family homes, renovate them and sell them at higher cost. A requirement for property owners to live in one of their redeveloped units for three years should help assuage fears of rampant speculation. Some gentrification will probably still happen as neighbourhoods change, says Mr Metcalf. But it would come from homeowners being enticed to sell, rather than tenants being forced out because they can no longer afford the rent.
The biggest criticism levelled at SB9 is that it does nothing to create affordable housing. The new duplexes will be cheaper than the single-family homes that predated them, but may still be too pricey. Yet market-rate housing is also badly needed. “You’re criticised for having too many affordability requirements, or not enough affordability requirements”, says Scott Wiener, a state senator and the perennial author of California housing bills. “No matter what you do, people are going to nitpick at the bill. Frankly that is one explanation for why we have a housing crisis.”
To turbo-charge homebuilding, California might take a lesson from improv comedy and adopt a “yes, and” approach to housing. Yes, end single-family zoning—and build affordable housing, streamline the permit process, help cities navigate tricky policy and crack down on municipalities that are not building. These laws alone “are not going to end the affordability crisis in California,” says Jason Elliott, Mr Newsom’s housing tsar. “No one is suggesting they are.” But it’s a start. ■",2
1636,"MEETINGS ABSORB more time and drain morale more consistently than any other corporate activity. Before the pandemic managers were spending an average of 23 hours a week in meetings. Since then the barriers to calling people together have come down. Now that calendars are routinely shared, an empty diary slot attracts invitations like picnics do wasps.
Ideas abound for how to make meetings better. Make people stand up, so they cannot settle in for the long haul. Write a memo on the topic at hand that everyone silently reads together at the outset. Toss a ball to each other to make it clear who has the floor and to stop the loudmouths from dominating. Most desperately of all, set aside time at the start for “fun”.

Yet there is a form of meeting that reliably results in good decisions and that commands general respect, even reverence. That meeting is the jury. Any system in which people still believe after more than 800 years is worth a closer look. In its broad principles, if not in its details, it has five lessons for meeting-throwers and meeting-goers.
First, its purpose is clear. “Why are we here?” is a question that humans grapple with not just in the depth of their souls but also during most Zoom calls. No jury doubts the point of its existence, the nature of its task or the need for multiple people to be involved. That level of shared understanding is something to aspire to in other settings.
Second, its size is right. The 12-person formula dates back to 12th-century England and the reign of Henry II. Temporary courts known as assizes summoned this number of men to hear land disputes. It has largely stuck ever since. For good reason. More people would add voices, but not value. Fewer people would mean less diversity of views. The advantages of keeping meeting numbers tight are not lost on Jeff Bezos, who operated a two-pizza rule at Amazon to limit how many people were in a meeting. The one-jury rule works just as well.
The third lesson concerns the agenda. Jurors have one, very important, question to consider, and a limited number of choices to make. Clarity keeps people focused. No juror is likely to suggest backing up a bit in order to brainstorm what the criminal-justice system should look like. And whereas many pundits advise keeping meetings short, time is not a constraint: jury members do not leave until a decision is made. “Putting a pin in it” is just not an option.
The fourth lesson is about membership. Jurors are less prone to groupthink than the attendees of the average meeting. Prospective members are deliberately drawn from a wide pool, and anyone whose mind is already made up is supposed to be weeded out. Companies cannot convene a bunch of strangers to make decisions for them. But they can consciously try to bring in unfamiliar faces and call on different perspectives. And just as a jury foreman is not chosen by rank, a moderator need not always be the most senior person in the room.
The final lesson concerns psychological safety, the willingness of people to speak up. That can be hard when your boss is frowning at you. But structure helps. Trials are expressly designed to weigh lots of evidence and to take in opposing views. Before juries make decisions, they get to weigh competing accounts of what happened. The best firms echo this approach by structuring discussions in order to test arguments properly. Investment decisions at Blackstone, a private-equity titan, are probed at meetings that systematically focus on the risk factors surrounding a potential deal, as well as what makes it attractive.
Things can go wrong in juries. Jury selection can rig outcomes rather than improve them. Domineering personalities can sway meeker ones. Also, people really can be idiots. A murder conviction in a British courtroom in 1994 was quashed after it was found that some members had used a Ouija board to ask the obvious question of one of the deceased. (The defendant was reconvicted at a second trial.)
Evidently, firms are not the same as courtrooms. Many corporate pow-wows are designed to transmit information and build culture, not to deliver verdicts. Unanimity is no way to run an enterprise. And deciding the fate of a fellow citizen is bound to be more engaging than the average business call. But serving on a jury is not an interruption to work. If you get summoned, you can both do your duty and see what makes for a really good meeting.

Ms Yellen’s initial seeming support for an increase spooked markets. She offered further assurances that she is not worried about persistent inflation, but does think prices will rise in the short term as economic activity picks up.

1638,"A gang of 14 thieves stole about $120,00 worth of merchandise in broad daylight from a Chicago-area Louis Vuitton store as the Windy City's rampant crime spreads to its posh suburbs, police said. 
Shocking video shows the gang entering the store at the Oak Brook Center one at a time on Thursday after an armed guard went on a short break.  
Once they were all inside, the thieves pulled out trash bags from their coats and jumped to every corner of the store, stuffing their bags full of designer products. 
Some of the thieves took everything they could carry by hand, and in seconds, they all ran out of the store, located about 18 miles west of downtown Chicago.
So far this year in Chicago, thefts have seen a 14 percent spike, jumping to 11,093 from 9,424 in 2020.

Officers were able to find one of the vehicles, a Dodge Charger, on Friday, which had been reported stolen last month in Chicago. 
The other two vehicles were believed to be a silver Lincoln MKZ and a red sports car.  
Oak Brook Police Chief James Kruger said police now have vehicle and license information on the suspects.
'We're nailing down all those leads now, our detectives are out working those leads,' he told Fox. 
The incident mirrored a robbery at a Louis Vuitton store last month only 30 miles away in Northbrook. 
Northbrook Police said a gang of 13 thieves and three getaway drivers targeted the Louis Vuitton in the Northbrook Court Mall, stealing about $66,000 worth of products on October 7. 
'We don't know if there is a connection yet, but certainly there are similarities and our investigators are talking to their investigators,' Kruger told ABC 7.
Oak Brook police are working with the Illinois attorney general to see if the two robberies are connected. ",-2
1639,"AT FIRST SIGHT one might have thought Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi was running for president of Palestine. Dozens of billboards (one is pictured) appeared overnight in Gaza this May, each bearing the face of the Egyptian president and an emphatic quote. “The Palestinian cause is the central issue for Egypt,” read one. Main roads were lined with Egyptian flags. A crowd of young men stood outside a seaside hotel to cheer the arrival of Abbas Kamel, Mr Sisi’s intelligence chief, whose motorcade sped into Gaza on a sweltering summer morning. “You’d think it was Abdel Nasser come to liberate Palestine,” quipped an elderly bystander.
The scene would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Along with Israel, Egypt has maintained a blockade on Gaza since 2007, when Hamas, a militant Islamist group, took power. Relations deteriorated further in 2013, when Mr Sisi overthrew an elected government led by the Muslim Brotherhood. His military-backed government saw Hamas as an outgrowth of the Brotherhood and was keen to strangle it. It flooded hundreds of tunnels that ran between Egypt and Gaza, cutting off a conduit for goods (and weapons) into the territory.

But Mr Sisi’s tone has changed since the brief war between Israel and Hamas that killed more than 250 Palestinians and 13 people in Israel. Egypt brokered the ceasefire that ended the fighting on May 21st. It has pledged $500m for reconstruction in Gaza and sent convoys of aid. All of this is helpful for Palestinians—but it is more helpful still for Mr Sisi’s reputation. “Sisi was the biggest winner in the war,” says Omar Shaaban, a political analyst in Gaza.

For a start, it gave him a needed diplomatic boost. Mr Sisi had been friendly with America’s former president, Donald Trump, who referred to the Egyptian ruler as “my favourite dictator”. Mr Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, has been less effusive. Many Democrats and some Republicans are critical of Mr Sisi’s ruthless authoritarianism. Since he took power in 2013 police have swept up tens of thousands of Egyptians, including a number with American citizenship (one, Mustafa Kassem, died in prison last year after a sham trial).
Mr Biden did not speak to Mr Sisi during his first four months in the White House. The conflict in Gaza changed that: Mr Sisi received two presidential phone calls in one week, then a visit from America’s secretary of state. According to the official summaries, Mr Biden made only passing reference to human rights.
At home, too, Mr Sisi used the war to his benefit. Egypt dispatched more than 120 trucks carrying aid shortly after the ceasefire. State media described the convoy as a “gift” from the president, whose face was emblazoned on some of the containers. Much of the aid was financed by the Tahya Misr fund, which was set up to pay for Mr Sisi’s pet projects. On June 9th Egyptian state television broadcast its morning show from Gaza, the two presenters smiling incongruously in front of a ruined building festooned with Egyptian flags. They spoke effusively of Egypt’s efforts—described again as a personal initiative by the president.
Hamas has changed its tune as well. The group cut ties with the Muslim Brotherhood in 2017, declaring itself a strictly local movement, partly in an effort to placate Egypt. Hamas officials now talk of their commitment to Egypt’s security, which reflects another change. After Mr Sisi’s coup they allowed jihadists fighting the Egyptian government on the Sinai peninsula to slip into Gaza for medical treatment and use it as a haven. Understandably, that enraged the government. The policy was quietly halted a few years ago.
If the current bonhomie between Egypt and Hamas feels a bit forced, it is also a necessity. Egypt plays a unique role in the region. Qatar, which has given Gaza more than $1bn in aid since 2012, has influence over Hamas. The United Arab Emirates announced diplomatic ties with Israel last year. But only Egypt is both influential in Gaza and trusted by Israel’s security establishment. So it was better placed than any other country to negotiate the truce between Hamas and Israel.
Sustaining the ceasefire in Gaza, though, will be difficult. After four rounds of conflict and 14 years of blockade, conditions in the territory are dire. Without a serious effort to ease the blockade and rebuild, another war seems inevitable. Mr Kamel’s trip to Gaza, the highest-level visit by an Egyptian official since the coup, was meant to sort out that problem. Since then he has hosted Israeli officials and Hamas leaders in Cairo for follow-up talks.
But progress is scant. Israel is loth to allow reconstruction in Gaza until Hamas releases two Israeli civilians held prisoner and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed during the previous war, in 2014. Hamas is open to a deal, but it wants to swap its prisoners for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, not for reconstruction aid. Mr Sisi got what he wanted from the war. Many Palestinians are sceptical that they will. ■",2
1640,"Civil rights activist and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has called Kyle Rittenhouse a 'white supremacist' after the 18-year-old was found not guilty at his murder trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Friday.
'We just witnessed a system built on white supremacy validate the terroristic acts of a white supremacist,' Kaepernick tweeted after the verdict was revealed. 'This only further validates the need to abolish our current system. White supremacy cannot be reformed.'
Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges after pleading self-defense in the deadly Kenosha shootings that became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the US. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26 were shot dead and a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, was wounded by Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020, during protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of African-American man Jacob Blake. 
The verdict in the politically combustible case was met with anger and disappointment from those who saw Rittenhouse as a vigilante and a wannabe cop, and relief and vindication from those who regarded him as a patriot who wanted to stop lawlessness and exercised his Second Amendment right to carry a gun and to defend himself.
Kaepernick was not the only athlete to condemn the verdict.
Robert Griffin III, another free agent quarterback, referenced the case of Julius Jones, whose death sentence for murder was commuted in Oklahoma this week. Jones, an African-American inmate, was scheduled to be killed on Thursday for the 1999 shooting death of Paul Howell. His sentence was commuted to life in prison, although many still maintain that he has been falsely accused.
'Kyle Rittennhouse can kill without a sliver of doubt & walk free but Julius Jones is in jail for life without the chance for parole after being on death row for 20 years with all types of doubt in his case,' Griffin tweeted. 'What is Justice? God help us.' 
Chiney Ogwumike, a star player for the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, called on social justice advocates to continue to protest: 'Yet again, a necessary reminder that social justice is not a moment, it is a movement.'  
African-American NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace also weighed in: 'Ha, let the boy be black and it would've been life…hell he would've had his life taken before the bulls*** trial.. sad'
Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant wrote that he was 'not surprised at all.'
Kaepernick has been the face of athlete activism since 2016, when he famously began protesting racism and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games.
He has remained a free agent since March of 2017, sparking accusations that the NFL has colluded to blackball Kaepernick, who has since settled a grievance with the league for an undisclosed amount.
The former University of Nevada star continues to train in hope making a comeback.
Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering for killing two men and wounding a third with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle in the summer of 2020 during a tumultuous night of protests over the shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake, by a white Kenosha police officer. 
Rittenhouse, a then-17-year-old former police youth cadet, said he went to Kenosha to protect property from rioters. He is white, as were those he shot.
The anonymous jury, whose racial makeup was not disclosed by the court but appeared to be overwhelmingly white, deliberated for close to 3 1/2 days.
Rittenhouse could have gotten life in prison if found guilty on the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide, or what some other states call first-degree murder. Two other charges each carried over 60 years behind bars.
Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said his office respects the jury's decision, and he asked the public to 'accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.'",-2
1641,"FEW FIRMS have spawned an industry. Warby Parker, a millennial-chic spectacles firm, has a decent claim to be one of them. A decade ago the startup pioneered selling products directly to shoppers online, using the internet to avoid the costs of bricks-and-mortar shops and chip away at clunky consumer-goods incumbents that relied on distributors and retailers. Thousands of direct-to-consumer (DTC) companies followed in its footsteps. Venture-capital (VC) firms threw money at them; Warby Parker’s latest funding round gave it a valuation of $3bn. On August 24th, in the biggest test yet of market appetite for the business model, it opted to go public—appropriately, selling shares directly to investors rather than through intermediaries as in a conventional initial public offering (IPO). A week later Allbirds, an online trainers-seller, said that it, too, will float its shares.
Such apparent successes stand out in a graveyard of casualties. Even the survivors struggle to make money. Warby Parker’s net loss more than doubled from $23m in 2018 to $56m in 2020. Allbirds lost $40m in the past two years. Casper, a mattress-maker, has yet to recover from a lacklustre IPO in 2020. Its market value of $205m is a fifth of its pre-IPO private valuation. Away, which sells suitcases, and Outdoor Voices, a clothing company, have lost a string of bosses. For others, covid-fuelled shopping sprees—e-commerce grew by as much in the first quarter of 2020 as it did in the previous decade—will not last for ever.

The playbook used to be simple. At its inception Warby Parker faced few DTC rivals and enjoyed low costs and readily available capital. The rise of Shopify and Amazon enabled aspiring entrepreneurs to open shops with a few clicks and a few dollars. Operating digitally opened a treasure chest of data on customer behaviour and allowed precise targeting on platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Sans serif fonts, neat designs, millennial lingo and socially conscious mission statements still seemed novel. “It couldn’t have been easier to start a DTC brand,” says Len Schlesinger of Harvard Business School. “You didn’t even need a good idea.”
Life is now harder. Casper faces over 175 online competitors. The cost of an ad on Instagram and Facebook more than doubled between 2018 and 2020. Large retailers have responded by buying or launching their own lines designed to appeal to younger customers. Unilever is said to have acquired 29 DTC firms between 2015 and 2019. Even with plenty of funding, the number of deals has begun to plateau. “It’s now less about innovation and more about execution,” notes Kirsten Green of Forerunner Ventures, a VC firm. Lerer Hippeau, another VC firm, which invested early in Warby Parker, Allbirds and Casper, says its priorities have shifted from growth and fancy logos to profitability from the first purchase.
This has benefited a new set of DTC firms trying to brand the unbranded pockets of consumers’ lives. FIGS, valued at $7bn, built its business by selling snazzy medical scrubs that, it says, “empower” a dedicated following of 1.5m health-care workers. Selling cheap goods at luxury prices is lucrative: FIGS boasts gross operating margins of 27%, compared with 7% for Warby Parker.
Other humdrum products and services are ripe for “decommoditisation”, thinks Trina Spears, co-founder of FIGS. Many such niches are, as Lerer Hippeau puts it, “sleepy total addressable markets” without ruthless competitors. Backdrop offers house paints in cool millennial-friendly colours. Sunday sells pest control packaged in monthly subscriptions for the aspiring classes. Tend sweetens a visit to the dentist with Netflix and aromatherapy. Thrasio has been snapping up hundreds of dull-looking DTC brands among third-party sellers on Amazon with the aim of turning them into “profit-doubling machines”. It has helped a firm that makes a pet-odour eliminator increase sales eightfold in two years by improving marketing and distribution. It claims to be the fastest company in America ever to reach a valuation of $1bn—while also making a profit. ■

1642,"ESCALANTE, A coal-fired power station north of New Mexico’s Zuñi mountains, is designed to produce some 250MW of electricity. Since August, however, it has produced none. Nor will it ever do so again.
The economic slump brought on by the covid-19 pandemic hit electricity demand around the world; non-renewable generators of all sorts reduced their output. But in many places the owners of coal-fired plants went further. Britain shut a third of its remaining coal-fired generating capacity in the first half of the year. In June Spain closed seven coal-fired stations from A Coruña to Córdoba, halving the country’s coal capacity. Even in India, where coal generates nearly three-quarters of all electricity, the crown slipped a tiny bit: 300MW of Indian coal-fired power was retired in the first half of the year, according to Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit, and no new coal plants were built.

Consumption of coal has been on a slightly downward-sloping plateau for some years. But the capacity to burn it continued to increase, suggesting that things might change. Now the world’s capacity to generate electricity from coal, too, has begun to drop (see chart 1). It is a significant milestone in the fight against climate change.

For the world to meet the ambitions it set itself at the Paris climate summit five years ago, that milestone needs to quickly vanish in the rear-view mirror: coal’s decline needs to be made both steep and terminal. Coal-fired generation typically emits a third of a tonne of carbon dioxide for every megawatt-hour of electricity generated, around twice the emissions from a natural-gas plant. And although coal is used directly in some industrial processes, such as steelmaking, two-thirds of the stuff is burned to generate electricity—a role that many other technologies can fulfil more cleanly and even more cheaply.
Eliminating coal-fired electricity generation is thus a big but doable deal. Failing to get that deal done will see the world blaze past the Paris agreement’s goal of keeping global warming since the Industrial Revolution “well below” 2°C.
A tale of three continents
The global peak in coal-fired capacity masks divergent stories in different countries. In the West, countries whose economic ascent was powered by coal and colonialism have been reducing their coal use for years and are shedding capacity with gusto. In South America and Africa—South Africa apart—coal has never been a big part of the energy mix. But Asia’s largest countries depend overwhemingly on coal for the electricity their economies need, and they are still adding capacity.
Merely using the capacity they already have in place could easily push the world past the Paris limits. According to Dan Tong, a researcher at University of California, Irvine, coal plants operating and proposed in 2019 would, if operated to the end of their lives, emit 360bn tonnes of carbon dioxide—a total dominated by Asia.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculates that if the world is to have a decent chance of keeping warming below 1.5°C—the Paris agreement’s stretch goal—it has to keep all future emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases down to the equivalent of 420bn-580bn tonnes of carbon dioxide. Today’s coal plants could use up 60-85% of that budget on their own. The 2°C budget is more generous: 1,170bn-1,500bn tonnes of carbon dioxide. But if existing coal plants use up between a quarter to a third of that allowance, the chances of staying within the bounds are slim.
Coal’s decline in the West has been made possible by three mutually reinforcing developments: government policy, cheaper alternatives and restricted access to capital.
A growing number of governments have adopted policies designed to support clean energy and/or to eliminate coal. In 2013 Britain imposed a “carbon-price floor” on emissions by electricity generators which made coal a more expensive fuel. In 2015, in the run-up to Paris, the country mandated that coal-fired power in England, Wales and Scotland be phased out within a decade. Sixteen countries in the European Union either have a plan to phase out coal or are mulling one; even in those that do not, the carbon prices imposed by the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme have made burning coal more expensive in recent years. Some owners of coal-fired stations have chosen to shut them rather than make the investments necessary to comply with new environmental standards which enter into force next year.
They can do so because of the increasing availability of other sorts of power. In America the alternative which started coal’s rout was a glut of gas created by the country’s fracking boom. But at both federal and state level America has also supported renewables, as has Europe. And as those policies have increased the scale at which renewables operate, their costs have plunged. BloombergNEF, a data group, calculates that better technology and cheap capital mean that, if you divide the amount of energy that can be expected over the lifetime of a new solar farm in Germany by the cost of building and operating that farm, the “levelised cost of electricity” (LCOE) you get is lower than the marginal cost of electricity from a German coal plant. The same is true for onshore wind in Britain; BloombergNEF expects new American wind and solar to pass the threshold next year.
Banks have tightened finance for coal, too, wary of stricter regulation, stranded assets and continued pressure from green investors. In all, more than 100 financial institutions, from Crédit Agricole to Sumitomo Mitsui, have set limits on the financing of coal projects, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
The effects have been impressive. In Britain the share of electricity generated by coal fell from 40% in 2013 to 2% in the first half of this year; the country now burns less coal than it did when the first coal-fired power station was built in 1882. In the EU coal-fired power generation nearly halved between 2012 and 2019. In America President Donald Trump’s promise that he would save the nation’s “beautiful” coal industry proved as worthless as it was misguided. Coal-fired electricity generation was 20% lower in 2019 than in 2016, when he was elected. Peabody Energy, an American company that digs more coal than any other listed firm, warned in November that it might file for bankruptcy for the second time in five years.
This displacement needs to be speeded up and prolonged. The unique circumstances of 2020 have seen a 7% drop in coal consumption. According to a report published this week by the UN and an international coalition of climate researchers, hitting the 2°C Paris target would require coal consumption to drop by the same amount every year for a decade. To hit the 1.5°C limit would require cuts of 11% year on year.
Prevaricate not
Those reductions would need to be even steeper were it not for the report’s assumption that, by 2030, a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide produced in power stations and industrial plants will be captured on site and sequestered away underground, a process known as carbon capture and storage, or CCS. At the moment the world’s CCS capacity is 4% of that. The technology could definitely be useful in steelworks and the like. Adding it to coal-fired electricity plants, though, is a pricey undertaking in which companies have very little experience. What is more, CCS has a long history as what Duncan McClaren of Lancaster University calls a “technology of prevarication”. Holding the possibility of emissions-free coal open but not realising it simply prolongs the status quo. Easier, cheaper and more definitive just to generate electricity by other means, such as renewables and nuclear.
Analysis like this has led António Gutterres, the UN secretary-general, to call for coal-fired electricity to be eliminated worldwide by 2040; he says the OECD, a club of rich countries, should get to zero by 2030. That would require a huge increase in effort. Japan currently envisages getting 26% of its electricity from coal in 2030. Germany plans to go on using coal until 2038. Though American coal use has fallen, its outright abolition will be staunchly opposed by some.
That said, the fall so far has been deeper and faster than most expected. Portugal, which had planned to be coal free by 2030, now looks like hitting that target in 2021. Perhaps political pressure, industrial momentum and business opportunity can speed things up elsewhere, too.
If Mr Gutterres’s exhortation gives non-OECD countries a decade longer, it reflects the fact that many, especially in Asia, have a lot more to do. Asia is currently home to nearly 80% of coal consumption. Most of that—52% of the global total—takes place in one country: China. India, Asia’s second-biggest market, consumes less than a quarter as much.
The growth in China’s coal-fired generating capacity between 2000 and 2012 helped reshape the global economy and drive a 200% increase in Chinese GDP per person. It also nearly tripled the country’s carbon-dioxide emissions, making it the largest emitter in the world. Its effects on air quality hastened millions of deaths.

Though new installations have never stopped, concerns over pollution and a glut of generating capacity have seen their rate decrease (see chart 2). The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, which oversees several large coal companies, has drafted plans to reduce coal capacity by one-quarter to one-third. Meanwhile alternatives are on the rise. The government’s spending on nuclear power handily outstrips that of any other country, and it has built up a massive renewables sector. The LCOE from new coal plants in China is already higher than that for solar and onshore wind farms, according to BloombergNEF. By the middle of the decade, the firm’s analysts calculate, the LCOE of onshore wind and solar will be less than the marginal cost of operating existing coal plants (see chart 3).

Add to all this the country’s recently promulgated target of carbon neutrality by 2060 and the future of coal in China might seem to be one of rapid withering. Yet coal-plant construction shot up in 2019. And in the first five and a half months of 2020 provincial governments, keen to boost employment and economic growth, gave companies permission to add a further 17GW of new coal capacity. Various state-owned companies such as State Grid, the country’s giant utility, China Electricity Council, the coal industry’s main lobby, and some provincial governments want to see this growth sustained, even though a lot of current capacity is underutilised. One argument is that more electricity will be needed to supply demand from the electrification of heating and cars. Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a research institute, estimates that the China Electricity Council’s statements imply a net increase in national coal capacity of 150-250GW.
Two eagerly awaited documents should reveal how much influence these pro-coal lobbies have. One is China’s 14th five-year plan, which will be published early in 2021. The other is the new “nationally determined contribution”, or NDC, required of the country under the Paris agreement—a list of its emission-reduction plans. If the five-year plan includes a near-term cap on coal capacity and the NDC calls for a peak in carbon emissions by 2025 it will signal a real turning away from coal (though perhaps not one fast enough for Mr Gutterres).
Other countries’ coal
Chinese interests in new coal plants do not stop at the country’s borders. Chinese-financed coal plants in other countries are on course to add 74GW of coal capacity between 2000 and 2033, according to Kevin Gallagher and his colleagues at Boston University. Chinese-funded foreign fossil-fuel plants—the vast majority of which burn coal—account for 314m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. That is nearly as much as the total annual emissions from Poland. The past decade has seen Chinese companies seek new opportunities for coal-plant construction in Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Bangladesh, though Bangladesh and Vietnam have both started considering cuts in their plans for future coal capacity. If China limits coal at home, those concerns will work even harder to find growth elsewhere while the country’s miners, too, look for new markets.
In Japan a similar dynamic is at play as the coal industry and its financiers look for new opportunities. This year the country set new limits on the financing of foreign coal plants, but loopholes remain. In November development banks from around the world issued a statement that they, too, would consider ways of reducing fossil-fuel investments. But they resisted pressure from Mr Guterres and others to eliminate such investments entirely.
In India, as in China, significant new coal-fired capacity is planned on top of ambitious government targets for boosting solar power, the intermittency of which policymakers worry about. As India contemplates surging future demand for power, it has fewer alternatives to coal than China. The infrastructure for importing natural gas is underdeveloped and the fuel itself pricey; nuclear capacity is growing only slowly.

Ajay Mathur of the Energy  Resources Institute, in Delhi, argues that low utilisation rates of existing coal plants mean there is little rationale for further construction. But coal remains a political force. India’s state-owned banks have financed much of its development. Power markets give coal-fired plants fixed payments, which lessen their incentives to work flat out but also make it harder for solar power to break in. In states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand jobs provided by Coal India Limited, the state-owned coal behemoth, are vital to the economy. And the government has recently authorised the development of new privately owned mines to reduce India’s imports of foreign coal. With new miners come new constituencies to advocate for coal’s future.
Similar political obstacles exist elsewhere. Fitch, a ratings agency, pointed out earlier this year that for all Indonesia’s professed desire to limit pollution, its price caps on coal for domestic power generation are designed to keep coal-fired power cheap and promote economic growth. This limits competition from other fuels. Markets rigged for coal in countries with expanding energy needs will not necessarily last all that long. But the new coal capacity they bring into being may stick around for decades.
If it can be made politically feasible, redesigning electricity markets—easing rigid power-purchase agreements in India and Indonesia, for instance—can quickly boost renewables, and the batteries which smooth out their contributions. Carbon prices, too, make coal less competitive, and if designed in such a way that their benefits are visible to all—perhaps as dividends—they may offer a counterbalance to the concentrated political power of coal lobbies.

Perhaps most important, though, is support for those who will suffer from coal’s demise. “If you’ve got 30 years, one can plan a phase-down,” says Mr Mathur. “If you’ve got ten years, it is shutdowns and large financial transfers.” Mine closures must include support and retraining for affected workers. And there is scope for more creative assistance from the West—which has an interest in reducing coal emissions wherever they come from. The private arm of the Inter-American Development Bank recently helped a Chilean developer replace coal assets with wind turbines by means of a low-interest loan. The Sierra Club, Carbon Tracker and Rocky Mountain Institute, three green groups, suggest paying for reverse auctions in which developing-country coal-plant owners bid for debt-forgiveness to retire their coal stations early in favour of clean power. Only if alternatives are made attractive to incumbents can coal be crushed as speedily and completely as the world requires. ■

1643,"FOR THE industry’s critics, it is a scandal that exposes exactly what they have been warning about. Many people have an almost instinctive distaste for the business in selling long-term-residence rights in a country or even citizenship there for cash, usually in the form of an authorised investment. So a documentary this month on Al Jazeera, a Qatar-based television channel, seeming to uncover corruption in an “investment migration” scheme offered by Cyprus, did not not seem especially shocking. It showed Cypriot politicians filmed in a sting operation, apparently willing to sell their country’s passport to a (fictitious) Chinese businessman who, in the cover story, had been convicted to seven years in jail for money-laundering, and so should have been ineligible.
For the industry’s practitioners—the consultants, accountants, bankers, wealth managers, lawyers and government departments selling their country’s charms—this is a blow. Although the politicians involved have protested their innocence, Cyprus has suspended its “golden passport” scheme from November 1st. European Union officials in Brussels and members of the European Parliament were already hostile to such schemes. And in response to the latest scandal, the European Commission has begun legal action (“infringement procedures”) to investigate both Cyprus’s scheme and one offered by Malta. It is an extremely sensitive issue for the EU. On the one hand, no issue is more jealousy guarded as a “national”  competence than whom a country allows to be a citizen. On the other hand, a passport from an EU member confers the right to live and work anywhere in the EU; and a “Schengen” visa allows free travel to 22 EU members and four other countries.

Defenders of the schemes insist that criminals seeking a bolthole are the exception, and that they are making great strides in imposing stricter “due diligence” standards. The vast majority of their customers, they argue, are honest, respectable people with a legitimate hankering after an alternative to the passport and residence rights they acquired by the lottery of birth. The loss of Cyprus restricts their options. But there are plenty of others, and demand is booming, despite the huge decline in global mobility brought by the pandemic. Indeed, covid-19 has spurred interest in investment migration.
“The industry is not merely robust in turbulence,” says Christian Nesheim, editor of Investment Migration Insider, a trade journal, “it thrives on it.” Indeed it really took off partly as a response to the global financial crisis of 2007-08. Like so many other businesses, it ground to a halt in the early days of the pandemic, as travel became impossible for much of the world and governments stopped processing paperwork. But since then it has enjoyed “more demand than we have ever seen”, in the words of Paddy Blewer of Henley  Partners, which advises both individuals seeking new residence or citizenship and governments designing programmes for them. People in countries with high infection rates and creaking health services began to see that as a reason to move elsewhere. And people with passports that had previously found themselves able to travel the world more or less unimpeded found their countries on banned or quarantine lists. At the beginning of the year, for example, according to Henley’s research, an American passport entitled its holder to travel to 185 countries without first securing a visa. That number has since shrunk to fewer than 75. 
Around the world, nearly 100 countries offer a “residence by investment” programme, including many of the world’s richest countries, such as America, Australia, Britain and New Zealand. Only a dozen or so countries offer citizenship—including five Caribbean island-states (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominic, Grenada, St Kitts and St Lucia), a Pacific one (Vanuatu), Jordan, Turkey and, within the European Union, Austria, Bulgaria and Malta (as well as, until the end of the month, Cyprus). The citizenship or residence by investment (CRBI) business traces its ancestry to a law passed in 1984 in tiny St Kitts and Nevis, offering citizenship to foreigners who made a “substantial” investment. How substantial varies from country to country. In Cyprus's case at least €2m ($2.3m) in investment, usually in property, is required. Malta demands a “donation” of €650,000 to a government fund, €150,000 invested in government bonds and a property purchase or long-term lease. Research this subject online, and you will soon be seeing advertisements offering a choice of Caribbean citizenships “from $150,000”.
Al Jazeera’s choice of a Chinese applicant made sense, China is by far the biggest market for most CRBI schemes. Much the most popular destination for Chinese investment migrants is America. But the waiting-list for Chinese applicants to America’s “EB-5” long-term visa programme is 10-15 years. The EU is a good second choice. The commonest reason Chinese people want residence elsewhere is education. Parents want to spare their offspring the gruelling university-entrance exam, the gaokao. And they believe that a foreign education will open up opportunities unavailable at home. Even childless Chinese also see the attractions of a “plan B” should they find the political or economic climate in China inhospitable.
China’s success in containing the virus and the deterioration in its relations with America and some other countries have done nothing, apparently, to dent demand this year. A worsening climate of repression continues to make the option of an alternative residence abroad seem desirable. That is especially true in Hong Kong since the imposition in June of a draconian national-security law. In fact, many Hong Kong residents already have a second potential home. In the 1980s and 1990s, as the handover from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 loomed, Hong Kong was a big driver of the growth of the CRBI industry.
Bruno L’ecuyer, chief executive of the Investment Migration Council, an industry lobbying group, says demand is also increasing during the pandemic in other big markets such as India and Russia. And the Middle East seems to be behind the rapid growth in Turkey’s citizenship by investment programme, which granted 4,000 passports between March and May. Worldwide, says Mr L’ecuyer, the business is “slowly becoming more mainstream”. It is no longer just for the “ultra” and “very high net-worth” individuals. These days, it seems, merely very rich will do.
What has been new during the pandemic is burgeoning interest from countries previously seen as destinations rather than sources of investment migration, such as Britain, and, in particular, America, which has, as Mr Nesheim points out, far more very rich people than any other country. In Britain, interest in second passports or residences has been increasing ever since the country voted for Brexit in 2016. In America, the election of Donald Trump that year had a similar effect. In both countries, the pandemic has accelerated the trend. Henley reports an increase of 238% in inquiries from Americans in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 2019, though they still make up only a small percentage of the global business’s overall numbers. 
Indeed, those numbers themselves are fairly small—about 5,000 passports a year, and several times that number of long-term resident’s visas. And the industry likes to point to the good done with the large sums of money raised from investors—facilitating the rebuilding of Dominica after Hurricane Maria in late 2017, for example; or Cyprus's recovery from the financial crisis. In Dominica the citizenship by investment programme was forecast by the government to make up 51% of  recurrent government revenue and 25% of GDP this year. Doubtless, as minds turn to the cost of recovery from the pandemic, many governments will find investment migration’s attractions hard to resist. The industry is confident Cyprus’s scheme will be back.

1644,"LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Five members of the U.S. House Judiciary committee wrote to Amazon.com Inc's chief executive Sunday, and accused the company's top executives, including founder Jeff Bezos, of either misleading Congress or possibly lying to it about Amazon's business practices.
The letter also states that the committee is considering  ""whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate.""
Addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, the letter followed a Reuters investigation last week that showed that the company had conducted a systematic campaign of copying products and rigging search results in India to boost sales of its own brands - practices Amazon has denied engaging in. Jassy, a longtime Amazon executive, succeeded Bezos in July.
The letter states that ""credible reporting"" in the Reuters story and recent articles in several other news outlets ""directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon's top executives – including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos.""
""At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon's representatives misled the Committee. At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law,"" the letter states.
In response, an Amazon spokesperson issued a statement that said: ""Amazon and its executives did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question.""
It added: ""As we have previously stated, we have an internal policy, which goes beyond that of any other retailer's policy that we're aware of, that prohibits the use of individual seller data to develop Amazon private label products. We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action.""
Since 2019, the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating competition in digital markets, including how Amazon uses proprietary seller data from its platform, and whether the company unfairly favors its own products.
In sworn testimony before the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee last year, Bezos said the company prohibits its employees from using data on individual sellers to benefit its own private-label product lines. In another hearing in 2019, Nate Sutton, Amazon's associate general counsel, testified that the company does not use such data to create its own branded products or alter its search results to benefit them.
Asked during the 2019 congressional hearing whether Amazon alters algorithms to direct consumers to its own goods, Sutton replied: ""The algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy regardless of the seller.""
The lawmakers' letter gives Jassy ""a final opportunity"" to provide evidence to corroborate the company's prior testimony and statements. It also notes that ""it is criminally illegal to knowingly and willfully make statements that are materially false, conceal a material fact, or otherwise provide false documentation in response to a congressional investigation.""
It gives the CEO until Nov. 1 to provide a sworn response to clarify ""how Amazon uses non-public individual seller data to develop and market its own line of products"" and how Amazon's search rankings favor those products.
It also requests copies of all documents mentioned in the Oct. 13 Reuters investigation.
""We strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity to correct the record and provide the Committee with sworn, truthful, and accurate responses to this request as we consider whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate,"" the letter states.
The Reuters probe was based on thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents – including emails, strategy papers and business plans. They showed that, at least in India, Amazon had a formal, clandestine policy of manipulating search results to favor Amazon's own products, as well as copying other sellers' goods – and that at least two senior company executives had reviewed it.
In response to the Reuters report, Amazon said, ""We believe these claims are factually incorrect and unsubstantiated."" The company did not elaborate. The company said the way it displays search results doesn't favor private-brand products.
The lawmakers' letter also cites other recent stories in the Markup, the Wall Street Journal and the Capitol Forum about Amazon's private-brand products and use of seller data.
The letter's sharp wording ratchets up the rhetoric between Washington and Big Tech. Companies including Amazon, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google have been under growing scrutiny in Washington, Europe and other parts of the world, fueled by concerns among regulators, lawmakers and consumer groups that the firms have too much power and are engaging in unfair practices that hurt other businesses.
The lawmakers' letter was signed by a bipartisan group, and included the judiciary committee's chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler, and four members of the antitrust subcommittee – its chair, Democrat David Cicilline, vice chair Pramila Jayapal and Republicans Ken Buck and Matt Gaetz.
On Wednesday, following publication of the Reuters investigation, U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent critic of Amazon, called for breaking up the company. In India, a group representing millions of brick-and-mortar retailers urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to take action against Amazon.",3
1645,"AMERICAN AND Chinese officials often talk of expanding the array of weapons they have to confront one another. China studies its opponent’s moves and responds in kind. America is learning from its adversary, too. On June 12th the White House said that America and members of the G7 would launch a scheme to help finance infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, in poor countries. The plan, dubbed Build Back Better World (B3W), is an explicit counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a programme that began to take shape in 2013 with many of the same goals.
Competition with China has dominated Joe Biden’s agenda since he took over as America’s president in January. His administration has promised to use “all available tools” to push back against what it describes as China’s unfair trade practices. The B3W plan takes aim at a global initiative closely associated with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Although BRI does not have a central planning body, more than 100 countries that are in need of infrastructure have signed up to it. The initiative has been criticised for burdening poor countries with unsustainable debts. But it has helped to strengthen bonds between China and the developing world.

B3W would offer financing for cleaner projects, in contrast to some of those backed by China, which include coal-fired power plants that contribute to global warming. America’s vague plan notes that projects will be developed in a sustainable and transparent manner—a dig at the opacity common in BRI contracts. It will also mobilise private capital where China has mainly used state-owned firms.
The idea appears half-baked. It is not clear whether Mr Biden or other G7 leaders will be able to extract substantial additional funding from their governments. The White House says it will work with Congress to “augment our development finance toolkit”. Yet Mr Biden is still struggling to get Republican votes for spending on domestic infrastructure. It is not even evident that the plan involves much more than the rebranding of projects that are already being considered. These include numerous green infrastructure schemes in poor countries that were promised as part of the Paris climate agreement of 2015. Easing this backlog will be costly.
Increasingly, China and America are replicating each other’s munitions. Days earlier, on June 10th, China’s legislature passed a law that allows the government to take action against individuals and companies for complying with other countries’ sanctions against China. America and the European Union have hit China with various punitive measures because of its mistreatment of ethnic Uyghurs in the western region of Xinjiang and its demolition of freedoms in Hong Kong. Donald Trump barred investment in several firms with links to the Chinese armed forces. His successor, Mr Biden, has doubled down on those rules by strengthening the legal foundations of the sanctions.
China’s new law says the government can seize the assets and block the transactions of firms complying with American or EU measures against China. Unlike the European Commission’s statute on foreign sanctions, which prohibits compliance with them, the Chinese law does not explicitly make such activity illegal. Instead it is intended as a deterrent that provides the authorities with a legal means to impose countermeasures, say state media.
The competing regimes put multinational firms in a bind. Fund managers have been attending webinars on how to navigate increasingly complex American and Chinese sanctions, says Kher Sheng Lee of the Alternative Investment Management Association, an industry body. Companies have had little choice but to follow American sanctions. China’s new bill could make that choice more difficult.
Likewise, poor countries have had few alternatives to China’s BRI project, until now. If executed well, the B3W plan could provide healthy competition to that, says Wang Jiangyu of City University of Hong Kong. But those countries now face a dilemma, he says. They may be “forced to choose between B3W and BRI”. ■",2
1646,"“NERDS WILL invent the future,” declared Vinod Khosla in 2010. The venture capitalist was not talking about the sorts responsible for e-commerce sites, games apps or social-media platforms. Rather, his speech at the California Institute of Technology was intended to inspire brilliant engineers and scientists to pursue climate-related innovation. The “clean tech” investment bubble had just popped, so it seemed an unsexy career option. But if top talent took on the hard engineering challenges involved, he argued, commercial successes and rising public awareness would produce a “Netscape-like” moment, referring to the web browser that ushered in the consumer internet in the mid-1990s. “Ten years from now,” he predicted, “the level of invention will explode.”
The billionaire investor, who has since backed Impossible Foods (which makes low-carbon alternative protein and is valued at $10bn) and QuantumScape (which develops batteries and last year raised $680m via a special-purpose acquisition company or SPAC), got the timing about right. The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental group, calculates that new patents related to core technologies like batteries, hydrogen, smart grids and carbon capture are far outpacing those in other technologies, including fossil fuels.

Money has followed innovation. BloombergNEF, a research firm, reckons that last year investors poured more than $500bn into the “energy transition” (shorthand for decarbonising everything from energy and transport to industry and farming), twice as much as in 2010 (see chart 1). A slug of that has come in the form of risk-tolerant venture capital (VC) flooding into many fields (see chart 2). PwC, a consultancy, estimates that between 2013 and 2020 VC investments in climate tech grew at five times the rate of global startup funding overall. In 2021 these investments may near $60bn in America alone (see chart 3), up from $36bn last year. Can this boom avoid the fate of the previous one and give rise to a blockbuster industry?


The short answer is: quite possibly. The modern climate-tech business looks fitter and more financially sustainable than a decade ago, when VC firms lost over half the $25bn invested in clean-tech startups between 2006 and 2011. Abe Yokell of Congruent Ventures, an investment firm, recalls that in those dark years, “If you walked into a VC boardroom and said you are working on clean tech, the senior partners left the room.”

Now they are all ears, encouraged by success stories such as Beyond Meat, a rival to Impossible Foods that made its early backers a tidy sum when it went public in 2019 at a valuation of $1.5bn and is now worth nearly $8bn, and especially Tesla, the electric-car pioneer whose market capitalisation has ballooned from $1.7bn when it went public in 2010 to around $700bn. The S Global Clean Energy Index has generated annualised total returns of more than 40% over the past three years, more than double those of the benchmark S 500 index of big American firms.
Climate tech now makes up about a tenth of new investments made by Sequoia Capital, a legendary Silicon Valley VC firm. This month Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital, a high-flying internet investor known for early bets on Uber, Instagram and Twitter, said he would launch climate-tech VC funds worth $800m. Nancy Pfund of DBL Partners, another VC veteran, reports that whereas in 2004 she barely scraped together $75m for a clean-tech fund, her new climate-tech vehicle raised $600m—and was oversubscribed.
Just as significant, Mr Yokell’s listeners have grown more diverse. Besides VCs they include states, philanthropists, Wall Street and big business. And the newcomers are investing in new ways.
Take governments first. On August 12th America’s Department of Energy (DoE) announced a $1.5bn partnership with Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, part of a network founded by Bill Gates (which includes Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a $2bn-plus blue-sky investment fund the billionaire has set up with a few chums, including Mr Khosla). It aims to accelerate development of novel technologies in sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, direct air capture and long-term energy storage. This augments the $20bn-plus loan programme that the DoE has available to boost clean energy and transport. If Joe Biden’s infrastructure and climate proposals win final congressional approval, more funding for deployment and scale-up of projects may be on the way.
Europe’s governments are splashing out, too. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has teamed up with Breakthrough Energy Catalyst on a $1bn initiative to build large-scale demonstration projects for clean technologies. Britain has unveiled plans to invest $235m in climate-related technologies. Climate is a sensitive issue in China. Nonetheless, says Peggy Liu of JUCCCE, a clean-energy NGO, it is the world leader in climate tech. Much of its official spending on “smart” technologies for more efficient factories, better batteries and motors is green-tinted.
States are not the only converts to climate investing. Charities and family investment firms are channelling capital into early-stage firms and offering patient capital willing to stick with “tough tech” for longer than a typical VC. By one estimate, family offices of the super-rich account for roughly 10% of total climate-tech VC deals, up from perhaps 5% a decade ago.
Elemental Excelerator, a Hawaii-based outfit part-funded by the Emerson Collective, a philanthropically minded firm set up by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple’s co-founder, Steve Jobs, looks to fund “first of a kind, transformational projects”. Elemental’s early-stage investments of $43m have garnered $3.8bn in follow-on funding, says Dawn Lippert, its CEO; 20 of its 117 portfolio firms have gone public or found private buyers. Ampaire, which develops hybrid-electric aircraft, was acquired in February for $100m. Stem, an energy-storage firm, went public via a $1.3bn SPAC deal in April.

Wall Street wants a look-in. Early this year JPMorgan Chase, America’s biggest bank, said it would commit $2.5trn to sustainable investing over ten years. Of that, $1trn, which includes the bank’s own capital and money raised from bond issues and flotations, is aimed explicitly at clean technologies. “Five years ago, we didn’t have the capability to invest in such firms or their VC sponsors,” says Brian Lehman of JPMorgan. Now the bank has dedicated employees like him who focus solely on climate and green issues. It is making smallish loans to pre-revenue firms in the sector and will expand into bridge financing between VC rounds and project finance for capital-intensive initiatives like indoor farms and solar-power plants.
Recent weeks have also seen the emergence of a few huge private-equity (PE) funds with a similar remit. In April BlackRock, one of the world’s biggest asset managers, teamed up with Temasek, a Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund, to create a $1bn decarbonisation vehicle. And in July alone PE firms committed over $16bn to climate tech. TPG, a Texan PE titan, said it had raised $5.4bn for its Rise Climate fund. Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management announced its own $7.5bn climate-focused fund, led by Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England. General Atlantic, another American PE giant, plans to raise $4bn for BeyondNetZero (BNZ), a fund focused on climate that will be led by John Browne, a former boss of BP, a British oil supermajor.

The final group of new climate investors comprises big companies. Many corporate giants are going beyond hollow commitments of greenery and “net zero” carbon pledges by investing directly in climate tech (see chart 4). According to Energy Monitor, a clean-tech web portal, between 2017 and 2020 such corporate venture investment surpassed $58bn in all.
It looks set to grow. Microsoft, the software giant founded by Mr Gates which last year vowed to remove all the greenhouse gases it has ever emitted—and more—by 2050, has set up a $1bn climate-tech fund. Its fellow Seattle tech titan, Amazon, has launched one worth $2bn, financed entirely from its balance-sheet. As such, says Matt Peterson of Amazon, investments need not meet any internal rates of return. “The focus is on decarbonisation, which is a strategic need for Amazon,” he explains. Success will be measured by how much investments reduce Amazon’s carbon footprint. The fund has backed startups such as CarbonCure, which injects captured carbon into cement, Redwood Materials, a battery-recycling firm started by J.B. Straubel, formerly Tesla’s chief technology officer, and Zero Avia, a hydrogen-fuel-cell aviation firm. Amazon has also given money to Elemental Excelerator.
Even carbon-cuddlers are getting in on the action. Koch Industries, America’s biggest private firm and a fossil-fuel powerhouse reviled by environmentalists, is putting around $350m of what it calls “long-term, patient capital” into the energy transformation. Early investments include EVBox Group, which develops the charging infrastructure for electric cars, and Freyr, a Norwegian firm that wants to build car-battery giga-factories in the Arctic.
On August 10th Reliance, an Indian power-to-phones conglomerate, led a $144m fundraising round for Ambri, an energy-storage startup founded by Donald Sadoway, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a few other clean-tech firms to his name. Reliance is in talks with Ambri (which also counts Mr Khosla among its backers) to build a big battery factory in India. And on August 17th Glencore, a Swiss mining giant with a big coal business, said it had bought a stake in Britishvolt, which is building a $3.6bn giga-factory in Northumberland.
Big businesses, startups and their VC backers have also learned from past mistakes, as well as recent successes. Their approaches to climate investments have become more sophisticated as a result. One lesson is to go after a large industry that lets people break the carbon habit without sacrificing their lifestyles, says Ms Pfund of DBL Partners. Tesla, on whose board Ms Pfund sat when it was a private company, is a perfect example. Another is Apeel Sciences, which uses plant-based lipids to limit food waste, responsible for more greenhouse-gas emissions than notoriously carbon-intensive cement-making, by extending the shelf-life of produce. On August 18th the company, which DBL has backed, unveiled a new funding round that lifted its valuation to more than $2bn.
Another novelty is the arrival of late-stage capital. BNZ will back companies from $50m to $500m or more in revenues. Lord Browne insists that, thanks both to supportive policy and growing public awareness of global warming, there is no longer a trade-off between tackling greenhouse gases and making a profit. On the contrary, he says, firms can reduce emissions while earning bigger returns. He is on the lookout for companies that could become “the Amazon of electricity”, and has no doubts that “some are going to grow to that size”.
The rise of late-stage VC and participation of PE firms is a healthy development for the climate-tech ecosystem, thinks Shaun Maguire of Sequoia. The industry needs innovative debt financing, so PE “can be quite useful”, he says. It could help the 95% of entrepreneurs who have historically failed to secure follow-on funding, agrees Laura-Marie Töpfer of Extantia, a Berlin-based climate-VC fund.
Plenty of late-stage and growth capital may give earlier-stage VCs more confidence with startups working on hard tech. And the strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments of PE funds will dramatically change founders’ incentives. To be an attractive investment, Ms Töpfer says, founders and their backers must ensure that ESG “is baked into firms from day one”.
The final lesson is the importance of collaboration. Where in the past VC firms backed startups chasing similar approaches to making thin-film solar panels, new climate-tech investors are open to working together to spread risk and speed up development. Glencore will provide Britishvolt with cobalt for its car batteries. Reliance would be a customer of the new giga-factory, not just its sponsor. Besides forking over $1bn to Rivian, which makes electric vehicles, Amazon has also ordered 100,000 vans to help decarbonise its e-commerce delivery fleet. No VC has that sort of purchasing power.
Brookfield wants to use the low-carbon know-how from its many investments in big renewable-energy projects to help big companies meet ambitious decarbonisation targets. Connor Teskey of Brookfield says the sort of partner his firm has in mind is ArcelorMittal. In July the giant steelmaker unveiled a strategy to cut its global carbon emissions by 25% by 2030 at a cost of $10bn. “A tech VC fund with just $100m can’t do this,” says Mr Teskey. Large firms want “a partner who can write you a $1bn cheque”.
This new spirit of co-operation matters because, in the words of Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures, “in climate tech, everything is hard.” Everything, that is, except raising capital. ■

1647,"THE MORNING after the September 11th attacks, as exhausted first-responders looked for survivors in rubble still wreathed in smoke, New Yorkers braced themselves for more attacks. The final death toll came to 2,743 people, almost all New Yorkers. America would later launch two long, costly wars in response and squander its moral authority in prisons in Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. In some ways the country is worse off now than it was on September 10th 2001, more anxious, more polarised, less trusting. New York City, though, is better. The resurrection of Lower Manhattan acted as a catalyst for rebuilding and rethinking well beyond the area destroyed on that terrible day.
The smoke, ashes and dust radiated outwards from the site of the attack. But so, more gradually, did the construction boom, which spread from Tribeca, up to Chelsea and eventually across the five boroughs to long-neglected neighbourhoods like Jamaica and Flushing in Queens, to Staten Island’s St George and along Brooklyn’s waterfront. New York City ended up “greater than ever”, says Dan Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor. Few would have predicted this outcome while a 16-acre pit burned for months. But for New Yorkers staggered by the shock of 9/11, rebuilding became a rallying cause, a way of not letting the terrorists win.

What followed was the reimagination of Lower Manhattan, one of America’s biggest business districts. Before, just 23,000 people lived in the area. It emptied out each evening, as office workers, who mainly worked in finance, insurance or property, went home. The World Trade Centre, now remembered with wistfulness, was not loved when it still stood. The complex around it blocked streets, cutting off the surrounding neighbourhood. Its underground shopping centre, popular with commuters, siphoned punters from street stores. “It was very rare to see anybody walking a dog and pushing a baby carriage,” recalls Robert McKay, a lawyer who worked in the area.

Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire media mogul, then a Republican, was elected mayor two months after the attacks and partly because of them: Republicans tend to win mayoral elections only when the habitually Democratic city is in crisis. He called on businesses to do their part by staying. “This is no time to leave the Big Apple,” he said in his inaugural speech. Some moved to nearby midtown, including Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 658 people—every employee at their desk on the 101st to 105th floors of the North Tower. Its new office was no higher than the fire department’s highest ladder. Only a few businesses left the city altogether. Some only threatened to go, among them the New York Stock Exchange.
It became an act not just of patriotism, but of self-interest, to operate downtown. As it turned out, the timing was fortuitous. Other American cities would revive their urban cores in the next 20 years as well. Yet that was not knowable at the time. Many companies that stayed in Manhattan availed themselves of new financial incentives. The federal government authorised $8bn in Liberty Bonds, a sort of tax-exempt financing. It also gave New York a $20.5bn aid package. George Pataki, the governor, appointed John Whitehead, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, to lead the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which was charged with guiding the revival of the area, including the rebuilding on the World Trade Centre site. At times, the task seemed hopeless. Almost everyone agreed that the area needed to be rebuilt, but they also seemed to have different ideas of what should be built where, by whom and with whose money.
Disagreements among insurance companies, developers and politicians delayed the project for years. The reconstruction had to navigate round a dozen subway lines and a New Jersey commuter line, as well as the feelings of victims’ families. But in 2006 the first office building, 7 World Trade Centre, was finished, along with an electricity substation in its lower floors. The memorial opened in 2011, and One World Trade Centre—built to the patriotic height of 1,776 feet—was finished in 2014. The Oculus, a gravity-defying train terminal and shopping centre, was completed in 2016. Two more skyscrapers and a performing arts centre are in the works. A Greek Orthodox church, which was also destroyed that day, will reopen next year.

The years after 9/11 proved to be an era of municipal ambition the like of which New York had not experienced in two generations. The subway was expanded for the first time in decades. Other projects, such as the High Line (an obsolete freight track converted to public space) and Hudson Yards (a massive redevelopment project on Manhattan’s West Side) might well not have happened without the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. To stimulate development, Mr Bloomberg re-zoned 40% of the city, something which would have been harder if not impossible without the crisis and subsequent sense of solidarity. Encouragement to other industries, such as tech and biotech, further diversified and boosted the city’s economy.
Lower Manhattan is now less dominated by finance. Before 9/11 financial services and property accounted for 60% of private-sector employment. Its share was down to one-third before covid-19 scrambled the data. “A different type of worker is there, and certainly is not running off to the suburbs at 4.30pm,” says Jessica Lappin, head of the Downtown Alliance, which advocates for the district.
And not only business moved in. The residential population of Lower Manhattan more than doubled between 2001 and 2020, as did the number of residential units. Some new residents were enticed to the area with months of free rent, but the district quickly became fashionable. Many of the old office buildings have been converted to condominiums. Children, rarely glimpsed below Canal Street in 2001, now make up 17% of the population. New schools were built to accommodate the new families. Tourists came too. Before 2001, only six hotels served the district. At least until covid-19 arrived, 37 hotels operated in the area.
Perhaps none of this would have happened if the feeling of safety, which disappeared so swiftly on 9/11, had not returned. The NYPD, which added 1,000 officers to its counter-terrorism division and worked closely with the FBI and the CIA to develop new capabilities, must take some credit for this. When London and Madrid suffered terrorism attacks, NYPD officers were soon on the scene. The department now has intelligence officers in 18 other cities. Ray Kelly, who was Mr Bloomberg’s police commissioner for 12 years, reckons the NYPD thwarted 16 attacks on his watch. Crime also declined, though the causes of that improvement are disputed.
For the past 18 months, as covid-19 has spread through the city, politicians and pundits have all said versions of: “We got through 9/11. We’ll get through the pandemic.” It would be unwise to dismiss that as mere New York bluster, given how unexpected the city’s revival looked when Lower Manhattan was coated in ash. Yet there are more dismal precedents to consider too. New York took far longer—25 years—to recover from the white flight and manufacturing decline of the 1970s. Then, 1.3m people and dozens of Fortune 500 companies left the city. “The question is,” says Mr Doctoroff, “is it going to be like 9/11, or is it going to be like the 1970s?” ■",2
1648,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",3
1649,"FOOL’S GOLD—pyrite, to give its proper name—may once have disappointed prospectors looking for nuggets. But modern miners have learned to love it, because inside its crystal lattice of iron and sulphur there is often actual gold to be found.
It is never much—at most a few tenths of a percent. And extracting it is hard work which involves grinding and heating the mineral, and then treating it with sodium cyanide, which is extremely toxic. But that can be worthwhile. Some 5-10% of the world’s gold production derives from pyrite. And this is likely to increase. According to estimates by McKinsey, a consultancy, 24% of the world’s gold reserves are “refractory”—meaning the gold must be yanked from the clutches of some mineral, in most cases pyrite.

To a large extent, however, this extraction process is flying blind. That is because it has never been properly established quite how the gold is lodged in the pyrite. One theory is that it forms tiny inclusions—nanonuggets, so to speak. Another is that it is integrated, atom by atom, within the crystal, thus forming a kind of iron-sulphur-gold alloy.
Nick Timms of Curtin University, in Perth, Australia, though, reckons he has found another explanation. As he and his colleagues write in Geology, they used a scanning electron microscope and an atom probe (a device which combines a field-ion microscope and a mass spectrometer) to investigate samples from a Chinese gold mine. They discovered that the gold in pyrite (along with many other “foreign” atoms, including arsenic, copper, nickel and lead) is concentrated in places known as dislocations, where the crystal, having been exposed to high pressure or high temperature at some point in its past, has got kinked.
Dr Timms suspects this concentration happens when foreign atoms, which because of their odd sizes do not fit properly into the crystal, migrate through the lattice to relieve the tensions that result when it is bent. That migration herds them towards particular places, and when there are enough of them in such a place the lattice buckles and the tension is released.
This process must be quite efficient. Aliens made up just over 1% of the metal atoms in the sample (the rest being iron). In the deformation zones they were three times as abundant.
That is useful information. Experiments with other types of crystal have shown that impurities in such deformed areas are easier to dislodge than those elsewhere in a lattice. If this is also true for pyrite, it might point the way to a more efficient way of extracting its gold—perhaps by using a harmless solvent like thiosulphate, rather than cyanide, or even employing bacteria to do the job. And only a fool would not be interested in seeing how that panned out. ■",2
1650,"ON A HOT and sticky day in the northern city of Tianjin, America and China held their highest-level meeting on Chinese soil since Joe Biden was sworn in as America’s president in January. But the encounter on July 26th between Wendy Sherman, America’s deputy secretary of state, and counterparts from China’s foreign ministry failed to clear the air. Instead, it merely deepened the gloom that hangs over the world’s most critical great-power relationship.
According to an American spokesman, Ms Sherman promised “stiff competition” with China and raised its “ongoing genocide” in the far-western region of Xinjiang, among other sore issues. She suggested co-operation on tackling problems such as climate change, narcotics and Afghanistan. But that olive branch was snapped by Xie Feng, a deputy foreign minister, who said relations were at a “stalemate” and thundered that America’s aim was to “bring China down”. His boss, Wang Yi, told America to choose between improving ties or “clashes and confrontation”.

Mercifully, the two nuclear-armed countries do not appear as close to military conflict as the Soviet Union and America sometimes did during the cold war. But as the diplomats were sparring in Tianjin, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), a research group, said it had spotted China building as many as 110 silos for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) near the city of Hami, in eastern Xinjiang (see picture). A month earlier, the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, an NGO in California, had identified 120 silos being built in Yumen, in the desert of Gansu, a neighbouring province. Both outfits found the sites by poring over satellite imagery from Planet, an American firm.
Nuclear wonks were shocked. For decades, China has hewed to a policy of “minimum deterrence”, involving the maintenance of a relatively small arsenal that would allow it to hit back at aggressors but not wage an elaborate nuclear war. The Pentagon reckons the country has 200 or so operational warheads—about the same number as Britain or France—and only 100 or so ICBMs. (America and Russia have nearly 12,000 warheads between them.)

The FAS says the satellite pictures suggest the “most extensive” building of silos since the construction of them by America and the Soviet Union during the cold war. On July 27th America’s Strategic Command, which is in charge of nuclear weapons, reacted with a tweet: “This is the second time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it.” America’s State Department said the discoveries were “deeply concerning” and demonstrated that China was “deviating” from its long-established nuclear strategy.
Experts believe the silos are designed for China’s newest ICBM, the DF-41, which can reach most of America’s mainland (see map). The question is why so many are needed. One theory is that they allow China to play a “shell game” with its missiles—an old conjuring trick in which a ball is placed under one of three cups that are shuffled to conceal where it is.

China would have good reason to bamboozle others about the precise whereabouts of its missiles. It has long feared that, in a crisis, America could use its large arsenal—or even a new generation of highly accurate conventional missiles—to wipe out China’s meagre forces on the ground. If some Chinese missiles were able to survive such an onslaught, they could be disabled in flight by America’s burgeoning missile defences, including interceptors in Alaska and California. In other words, China’s nuclear arsenal could be rendered useless. America stresses that its missile-defence systems are not directed at Russia, but makes no such commitment about their use against China.
If, however, missiles could be moved underground between silos, America would have no way of knowing which ones to strike. America’s “MX” programme, launched in the 1970s, could have inspired China to use such trickery. The idea was to shuffle 200 missiles among almost 5,000 bunkers in Utah and Nevada. The plan was shelved in 1981 by America’s then president, Ronald Reagan. He mocked it as a needlessly complex “Rube Goldberg scheme”—a reference to that American cartoonist’s drawings of fanciful contraptions for accomplishing simple tasks.
The layout of the Chinese silos may suggest a similar aim, says James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment, an American think-tank. He points out that China’s older silos, in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, are tens of kilometres apart, whereas the ones in Gansu are only about 3km from each other. Mr Acton also argues that because most DF-41s would probably have more than one warhead, China would not have enough fissile material to fill all the new silos with them, not least because of competing demand for its use in other nuclear weapons. The country is thought to have stopped producing plutonium in the 1980s. There is little evidence that it has resumed, although new nuclear-power reactors being built in Fujian, a coastal province, could do so in future.
Not everyone is convinced that China is merely planning a shell game. In theory, and in the long term, 230 new silos could support the deployment of 230 new missiles with several hundred warheads, since each missile can carry at least two of them and perhaps many more. American officials have long been arguing that China is rapidly expanding its nuclear forces. In its most recent annual report on China’s military power, published last September, the Pentagon said the country’s stockpile of warheads was projected to “at least double in size” over the next decade. In April the head of Strategic Command, Admiral Charles Richard, presumably aware of the silo fields, said that China’s programme was advancing so quickly that intelligence was becoming out of date within a month.
The discovery of the silo-building projects raises two broader questions. One is whether they will prompt a change in China’s nuclear posture. America and Russia keep some weapons on high alert, ready to launch at a moment’s notice. China does not. But silo-based ICBMs can be launched more quickly than those on mobile launchers, which have to be erected and, in some cases, fuelled. American officials argue that with plenty of instantly ready missiles to hand, and with the more advanced early-warning radar that China is beginning to develop (with Russia’s help), along with an early-warning satellite already in polar orbit, the country may adopt a policy of “launch on warning”. That means it would be ready to fire missiles at the first sign of a nuclear strike.
The other question is whether this will affect nuclear-arms control. The last remaining pact between America and Russia, the New START treaty, was renewed in February and will expire in five years. If the White House sees the new silos as confirmation of a rapid nuclear expansion, it may adopt the former Trump administration’s view that any future arms-control measures must involve all three powers.
For now, the State Department says that the construction of the silos “reinforces the importance of pursuing practical measures to reduce nuclear risks”. But China is reticent about exposing its arsenal to scrutiny. And the fractious meetings in Tianjin suggest there is little likelihood of negotiations over such a contentious matter, let alone a productive outcome.
Ironically, the most benign interpretation of the new structures—as a shell-game—is in one sense the least encouraging for arms control. America and Russia verify New START by sending inspectors to peer into one another’s silos. If China’s plan is indeed to shuffle missiles around, it would become much harder for others to be certain of its deployments. “So the best case,” says James Cameron of the University of Oslo, “is that China has gone some way to confirming how uninterested in arms control it is.” ■",2
1651,"ON MAY 6TH Wang Xing, a Chinese tech tycoon, posted a classical ninth-century poem on Fanfou, a social-media platform. The poem mocked an ancient Chinese emperor who tried to quell unrest by burning books. “The ashes of burnt books had not yet faded away but the Qin dynasty was already weak,” read the poem. For some reason, cynics suggested that the dynasty Mr Wang had in mind was not an ancient one at all, and the “emperor” he was mocking was Xi Jinping.
Mr Wang swiftly deleted the post, and censors wiped all comments. But the share price of Mr Wang’s firm, Meituan, a popular online platform for shopping and delivery services, promptly collapsed. In four days it declined in value by $26bn, wiping $2.5bn from Mr Wang’s personal fortune. He insisted that he had been referring to competition within the e-commerce industry. His firm is one of several that have come under recent close scrutiny from antitrust regulators.

Open criticism of the most important man in China is taboo. Last year Ren Zhiqiang, a retired property tycoon and vocal critic of the government, published an essay about a speech by Mr Xi in which Mr Ren said he was not an “emperor” showing off his new clothes but a naked “clown”. Shortly afterwards, Mr Ren was sentenced to 18 years in prison for corruption.
Even knocking lesser officials is risky. Jack Ma, the boss of Alibaba, another conglomerate, complained about China’s financial regulators last year. Authorities stopped the initial public offering of Ant Group, a fintech firm founded by Mr Ma, which would have been the largest ever.
Others have been more careful. In April Wen Jiabao, China’s prime minister from 2003 to 2013, published a remembrance of his mother in a Macau newspaper. It included lines calling for a China “filled with fairness and justice” and “respect for human hearts”. Some thought he might be suggesting that fairness and justice were currently lacking. Censors pounced.
Such is the current climate that even those who broadly support the government are sometimes nervous about mentioning Mr Xi’s name. Some employees at a state-run media group have taken to substituting the word “Trump” for Mr Xi in chat groups. At small social gatherings, people frequently stop short of uttering the name, even in the most benign contexts. They use instead phrases such as “you-know-who”, “big number one”, “the eldest brother” or “our big uncle”.
When, at a recent private gathering that included diplomats, executives and bankers, the talk turned to Chinese politics, it was suggested that all switch off their mobile phones. No one thought it likely that government snoops were really listening in and no one had anything particularly controversial to say. But all agreed it was better to be safe.
Electronic eavesdropping is not the only concern. The old-fashioned sort is also encouraged. Last month, the government launched a new system, with a website and hotline, for citizens to snitch on one another for making “harmful” political commentary. This can include “denying the excellent traditional Chinese culture, revolution culture and advanced socialist culture” as well as attacks on political leaders or their policies.
In 2014 the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors to Britain each fancifully declared the other’s country the “Voldemort” of Asia (after the Harry Potter baddy). Back then, an all-powerful leader known as “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named” was the stuff of fiction. Nowadays...shush! ■",2
1652,"APOSTOLIS, A RETIRED Greek-Cypriot dentist aged 78, tours his former clinic in Varosha, now a derelict shell of a building, for the first time in nearly half a century. His friend Despo wipes away tears in front of her grandfather’s old shop, where she would park her bike after school. Varosha was once home to some 39,000 Greek-Cypriots and swarms of tourists. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton strolled on its beaches. Four young Swedes, later known as ABBA, gave one of their first concerts here. Now it is a ghost town, overgrown by bushes and trees. Opposite Apostolis’s clinic, painted over the façade of what was once a Greek high school, are a pair of flags, one Turkish, the other belonging to the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (TRNC), set up after the island was split by a Turkish invasion in 1974 into Greek and Turkish portions.
Fenced off since the invasion, when its Greek-Cypriot residents fled the advancing Turkish troops, Varosha was partially reopened earlier this year. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ordered the army to hand the town over to the TRNC. This has allowed visits by Greek-Cypriots living in the southern part of the island, in the Republic of Cyprus, which the outside world considers the legitimate government of the whole place. But it also bolsters the TRNC, which no country but Turkey recognises, and paves the way for the development of property still claimed by displaced Greeks. That, in turn, further complicates the Herculean task of reuniting the island. That was the point: Mr Erdogan and Ersin Tatar, the Turkish-Cypriot leader, have insisted for the past year that a united Cyprus is no longer possible. In New York in September Mr Tatar and Nicos Anastasiades, president of the Republic of Cyprus, seemed to agree that they had nothing to discuss.

Northern Cyprus, home to 450,000 people, has never stood on its own feet. Turkey stations tens of thousands of soldiers in the enclave, props up its economy, and is the main conduit for its foreign trade. Though Turkey has always meddled in the north’s affairs, it has never done so as much as now. “Ankara treats us like one of its districts,” says Ozdil Nami, a former TRNC foreign minister. A new low came last year, when officials and goons dispatched by Turkey endorsed Mr Tatar, an Erdogan loyalist, ahead of presidential elections and threatened his opponents, including Mustafa Akinci, the incumbent. Mr Tatar won the vote by a sliver. “Those people”, he says at his residence, referring to the politicians and journalists who accused Turkey of interfering in the elections, “are traitors.”
Echoing Mr Erdogan, Mr Tatar says he has no faith in a proposed federal model, which would bring north and south under one roof, and that the only way forward is to keep the island divided. Yet analysts and diplomats say a two-state solution is a pipedream. Not even Turkey’s closest allies would want to jeopardise relations with the EU, of which Cyprus is a member, by recognising the north.
The risk is that a botched campaign for sovereignty would put Northern Cyprus on a slippery slope to full annexation by Turkey. That is not an outcome Turkish-Cypriots want. The vast majority of them welcomed the Turkish invasion in 1974, which foiled an attempt by a Greek junta to unite the island with Greece. They feel close to Turkey. But they also have a separate identity. Many are alarmed by Turkey’s authoritarian turn. Settlers from Turkey, who began arriving after the invasion and are now about a third of the north’s population, are a lot keener on Mr Erdogan.
Greek-Cypriots are also alarmed. “If we don’t find a solution, we'll end up having a border with Turkey, which for us is a worst-case scenario,"" says a senior Cypriot official. But they also have themselves to blame for the stalemate. It was Mr Anastasiades and his team who reportedly got cold feet during the most recent reunification talks, in 2017. And it was Greek-Cypriot voters who rejected a settlement in a referendum back in 2004, on the eve of the country’s accession to the EU.
There is room for hope. A big offshore energy find could breathe new life into the talks, though it could also trigger a standoff between Turkey, Cyprus, Greece and the EU. Turkey’s push for a two-state solution could be a ploy intended to rattle the Greek-Cypriots. But facts on the ground will be hard to undo. “We might have reached a point where it’s no longer possible to put the island back together again,” says Fiona Mullen of Sapienta Economics, a consultancy in Nicosia, the capital. “Varosha may be the final nail in the coffin.” ■",2
1653,"FEW THINGS spook a prime minister like a petrol crisis. In his autobiography, Tony Blair recalls one in 2000 caused by fuel protests. The Downing Street machine was moving at a glacial pace. Decisive orders were needed. “I would like the army to come in and if necessary drive your tankers,” he recalls saying, “and if they meet with any violence from protesters, I want you the police to deal with them very firmly, and if not, to let the army take care of them. They’re very good at it.”
Where Mr Blair had protesters to rage at, Boris Johnson has had to make do with gummed-up global supply chains. The Petrol Retailers Association, a lobby group, says that fuel is now returning to the pumps. But for the past week many Britons have been unable to fill their cars, and others have wasted hours queuing to do so. Although the crisis is in large part the result of temporary forces beyond ministerial control, it also highlights enduring problems with both British logistics and Mr Johnson’s government.

Global supply chains have been under stress for the past 18 months, thanks to lumpy consumption patterns caused by covid-19. An ageing workforce and grim conditions have created shortages of lorry drivers across Europe. Both problems are, though, especially acute in Britain. Supply chains have been stressed by Brexit-related form-filling. Tax tweaks have cut take-home pay for some lorry drivers, and the number from the EU has fallen by more than 12,000, or 10% of the total.
Throughout, ministers have insisted there is no shortage of petrol. The fact that rumours, which emerged from talks over driver shortages, led to a run on the pumps reflects two issues. One is a frazzled public. Recent weeks have seen surging gas prices and empty supermarket shelves. In the words of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s former adviser, “The stooges who trusted No 10, and those who trusted the stooges, now have no petrol.”
The other is the government’s abject communication. Studying past fuel crises, Eben Upton and William Nuttall of the University of Cambridge find that “unbiased propagation of information about inventory levels can help to reassure consumers”. On September 24th Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, tweeted, in a typical message: “There is no fuel shortage. I repeat, THERE IS NO FUEL SHORTAGE”, followed by a red-car emoji.
The government has propagated precious little information about petrol stocks. Its solutions have twinned the technocratic with the desperate. Migrant flows used to respond to the state of the economy, but under the post-Brexit immigration regime they have responded to ministerial diktat. The government spent the summer resisting pleas to allow in more workers, insisting that firms should improve conditions and raise wages instead. Data from Indeed, a job-listings website, suggests they did. Pay in advertisements for heavy-goods vehicle (HGV) drivers increased by 12.8% from February to August, compared with 1% for all jobs.
Still, problems persisted. Under the new immigration regime, drivers count as “low-skilled workers”, and are not welcome in Britain. In an attempt to reduce the pressure, on September 25th the government announced 5,000 visas for HGV drivers, as well as 5,500 for poultry workers (another industry suffering shortages). Although the extra workers will be welcome, they will not make an enormous difference given the small numbers involved. The visas expire on Christmas Eve.
Other measures kicked in more quickly. Before leaving the EU, officials drew up a “National Emergency Plan for Fuel”, which offers ministers a menu of escalating options. In July Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, increased the number of hours lorry drivers were allowed to work. On September 27th the government activated the “Downstream Oil Protocol”, which exempts firms from competition rules, allowing them to share data on shortages. Combined with the fact that there is only so much petrol that can fit in a car’s fuel tank, this was enough to get the stuff flowing once more.
The army was put on standby, with 150 soldiers preparing to drive tankers, but as The Economist went to press it had not been called into action. Given the difficult circumstances, it may not be the last time it goes on alert this winter. Indeed, Mr Johnson highlighted the possibility of problems until “Christmas and beyond”. There is, however, some reassurance for the government as it faces up to the possibility of festive disruptions. Despite a crisis that was partly created by its flagship policy and was mismanaged by ministers, it is escaping the blame. A poll by YouGov asked who was at fault. Some 23% said the government. Nearly half said the media. ■

1654,"BRIGHT GREEN, chocolate-studded delights sprout on store shelves across Japan every year as temperatures rise. Chocolate-mint ice cream bars; chocolate-mint cookies; chocolate-mint candies, chocolate-mint bubble tea, even chocolate-mint bagels. On Instagram, fans post pictures of their favourite “chocominto” items, tagging posts “#chocomintou”, a play on words meaning the “chocolate-mint party” (as in political party). And then, as suddenly as they appear, the chocominto snacks are gone, wilting away at the end of Japan’s hot summers.
Japanese cooking and traditional sweets have long placed a premium on seasonality. Contemporary candy and snack producers now tap into the seasonal mindset to great effect, peddling cherry-flavoured goods during cherry blossom season and sweet potato-flavoured snacks in the autumn. Chocominto is only the latest limited-edition snack fad to enthrall Japanese consumers. “The Japanese market moves with the season,” says Jérôme Chouchan, the boss of Godiva Japan, which uses ingredients and packaging to send seasonal signals, as with chestnut macaroons and brown or red packaging in the autumn.

Yet the proliferation of seasonal, limited-edition items in Japan has as much to do with the structure of the modern market as with age-old traditions. Japan’s ubiquitous convenience stores, or conbini, prize novelty. The selection in stores usually changes once a week, explains Phillip Sugai of Doshisha University in Kyoto: “Having the same exact chocolate bar on the shelves isn’t appealing to the convenience stores; novelty is exciting.”
Where big international confectionery firms tend to manufacture the same items consistently at scale to minimise costs, “the Japanese model is completely opposite,” says Takaoka Kozo, the former head of Nestlé Japan, a big food and drink company. Under his watch, KitKat, a chocolate-covered wafer, began churning out seasonal and limited-edition flavours; the company has produced hundreds of flavours exclusive to Japan, including salt lychee, red-bean paste and wasabi. (The same approach flopped in Britain, where retailers charged higher fees to carry new items.)
Another factor may be the difficulty of competing on quality in the Japanese market. “Every product tastes good,” says Okayama Takuya of Dataspring, a market-research firm. Instead manufacturers have to find other ways to stand out. “It’s very difficult for us to differentiate from our competitors by improving just taste, we have to have some special edition to do so,” says Yokoi Satoshi, head of the Japanese branch of Papabubble, a high-end Spanish sweet-maker.
The confectioner produces a sweet shaped like a chicken wing for stores in Nagoya, which is known for its fried chicken, and one for Osaka resembling a steamed pork bun, a local speciality. In May, it opened a chocominto pop-up shop in Tokyo’s trendy Aoyama district. Pumping out new flavours every few months can present challenges, especially for foreign companies used to producing high volumes of fewer products. But buzzy items make up for the additional costs in sales, says Mr Takaoka.
Few flavours have as devoted a fan base these days as chocominto, which has developed a cult following on social media. “People who like it really like it,” says Ushikubo Shintaro, an influencer who runs a suite of chocominto-themed social-media accounts and published a guidebook to chocominto offerings in Tokyo. The only downside is its fleeting nature. “It is a little bit sad when the chocominto period ends,” Mr Ushikubo admits. He soothes his sorrow with the strawberry-flavoured sweets that grow on shelves in the winter.",2
1655," (CNN)Stage parents seldom fare well in movies and TV, but ""King Richard"" bucks that trend, placing Will Smith on center court in an overwhelmingly flattering portrait of tennis patriarch Richard Williams. Smith aces the performance, which is the main attribute in elevating the story above the standard sports-movie conventions.The film actually follows a fairly concentrated stretch in the formative years of Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams (Demi Singleton) under the watchful eye and tutelage of their father Richard, who speaks frequently of the 78-page plan he mapped out for conquering the nearly all-White tennis world before they were old enough to hold a racquet.""I'm in the champion-raising business,"" Williams announces as he makes the rounds looking for a coach, met with dismissive and vaguely racist replies, including ""You ever think about basketball?""Williams can be imperious (hence the title) and overbearing, much to the occasional chagrin of his daughters and wife (Aunjanue Ellis), who is no wallflower when it comes to the coaching chores or speaking her mind.The portrait that emerges from director Reinaldo Marcus Green and writer Zach Baylin consistently paints him as a heroic figure, protecting his daughters from dangers in the community, stressing their education as well as their ground strokes and working tirelessly to advance their careers, perusing tennis magazines while holding down a job as a night watchman.Any excesses, such as having the girls practice in a pouring rain, are filtered through that prism. And obviously, Williams' determination to ""stick to the plan"" paid off handsomely, despite the irritation and exasperation of tennis coaches (the most prominent played by Tony Goldwyn and Jon Bernthal) riled by his refusal to follow the customary script, including his decision to pull Venus out of juniors tournaments.Smith not only captures the cadence of Williams' voice but the unwavering confidence that he embodied, absolutely convinced that he knew what was best for his girls. It's down the movie's final stretch, as those plans begin to bear fruit, that ""King Richard"" feels more and more conventional, from the stirring music to the questions of how and when to cash in on Venus' prowess while the younger Serena is left behind, but as we all know, not for long.Smith (who also produced the film) is receiving a vigorous push for awards consideration, and he certainly nails the role in a way that belongs in that conversation, even if the movie as a whole seems unlikely to join him.Perhaps foremost, ""King Richard"" is framed as a response to the criticism and second-guessing that the outspoken Williams faced as his daughters took the tennis world by storm, which might explain why both signed on as executive producers.Indeed, it's hard to escape the sense that ""King Richard"" exists in part to let the Williams family set the record straight. And when it comes to giving Williams his due as both a tennis guru and a father, in this case, love means everything.""King Richard"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters and on HBO Max, from Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia. It's rated PG-13.",0
1656,"J.R.D. TATA recalled it as his saddest day. In 1978 the illustrious Indian industrialist opened the newspaper to discover that the government had fired him as chairman of Air India, the airline he founded in 1932 and managed even after its nationalisation in 1953. He called his secretary to ask if the story of his sacking was true. She replied that his successor, a former air marshal, was already making himself comfortable in his chair.
Tata, who died in 1993, frequently said that his job at Air India was to protect the airline from the central government in Delhi. No doubt the sentiment contributed to his sacking—and was justified. After his exit the flag-carrier entered a spiral. In recent years it was losing nearly $3m a day. Operating costs far exceed the industry average. So do customer complaints. Perhaps realising this, the government began trying to offload Air India in 2001, but deals repeatedly foundered over financial terms and demands that the state retain a residual stake, and possibly residual control.

On October 8th the drawn-out process finally concluded. The airline would return to Tata Group, today still one of India’s biggest conglomerates. Its bid of $2.4bn (including $2bn in debt) beat the only other, from the owner of Spice Jet, a heavily indebted low-cost airline. Some of Air India’s non-core assets, and its remaining $6bn in debt, will be transferred to a separate government-run holding company.
Given what has unfolded in India’s aviation since J.R.D.’s inglorious dismissal, it is not entirely unfair to conclude the government did Tata Group a favour by taking Air India off its hands. Private carriers have emerged only to go bust. Covid-19 travel restrictions have caused the industry to wallow in losses. Indigo, the most successful carrier with a market share of 57%, is embroiled in litigation between its founders and has ejected multiple top executives.
On the surface, Tata Group’s desire to return Air India to the fold looks foolish. The group already controls two smaller airlines through an 84% stake in AirAsia India (an affiliate of a Malaysian carrier) and a 51% stake in Vistara (co-owned with Singapore Airlines). Both have consistently lost money. Adding Air India to the mix seemingly deepens Tata’s aerial woes. The carrier burns cash as fast as its old and frayed fleet burns kerosene. The workforce is unionised, difficult to manage and resistant to change. The terms of the deal prohibit redundancies in the first year and after that only through voluntary attrition.
Still, Tata’s move is not without reason. Its current management sees its existing aviation operations as irredeemably subscale. The deal will double Tata’s domestic market share to 27% and give it a platform for growth through Air India’s network of landing slots abroad, particularly in London and New York. Air India owns a low-cost airline based in the state of Kerala that does a booming business ferrying Indian workers to and from the Persian Gulf, and could dovetail with AirAsia India.
Tata in turn may be providing Air India with capital and even more desperately needed good management. A pandemic-era depression in global aviation means aircraft are available. Boeing and Airbus are doubtless already pounding Tata’s door. Tata Consulting Services, India’s largest information-technology consultancy, could help tie together the various entities and enable savings in areas such as bookings and loyalty programmes. Tata’s hospitality division, Indian Hotels, could benefit from marketing links.
Managing this process will not be easy. Singapore Airlines is thought to have opposed the deal and hoped that Vistara would feed its own global network. Managing no-frills and full-service divisions makes sense in theory but no large airline has done it well. Crucial support for Air India comes from the country’s tight restrictions on foreign carriers, negotiated as bilateral treaties with their home countries. Those may be eased now that the airline is in private hands, reducing its advantage. Having reclaimed J.R.D.’s chair, Tata may find it not entirely comfortable. ■

1657,"Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of Princess Charlene after her husband revealed she's left Monaco, despite only just returning from a 10-month absence, and hinted that she's struggling with her mental health. 
Speaking to Monaco-Matin yesterday, Prince Albert, 63, confirmed his wife, 43, who has appeared increasingly frail, has left the principality and is staying at a secret location while she 'recovers from tiredness', away from him and their six-year-old twins. 
'She is better but she still needs rest and peace,' he said in an article translated from French. 'She is not in the Principality but we will be able to visit her very soon.
'I cannot tell you more out of discretion. There is tiredness, not just physical, which can only be treated with a period of rest and monitoring.' 
He added their children, Jacques and Gabriella, had 'suffered from the absence of their mother' but that he had compensated by stepping up to take a more active role in their lives. 
'For me, it's pretty simple – my priority is my family,' the prince said, when asked about juggling the role of being a head of state and a father.  
He continued: 'This is an extremely important time in [the children's] life – the way they grow up helps them see the world.
'And if one of the parents is away for medical reasons, the other parent has to be there. I have heard too many friends and acquaintances telling me that they wish they had been there for their children, at a certain age, taken up by their work or their professional life. I don't want to have these regrets.' 
Asked if the children had been 'more protected' during their mother's absence, Albert added: 'They should be protected in general, but of course they suffered from the absence of their mother. But they had enough distractions and a family circle that made sure they were not lacking in affection.'
The prince also said rumours around the state of his marriage 'don't bother him too much'.
It comes after the House of Grimaldi confirmed Charlene will not attend Monaco's National Day celebrations - one of the biggest events in the royal calendar - on Friday.
Charlene, 43, returned to her husband and twins Jacques and Gabriella in Monaco last Monday following a 10-month absence while she recovered from surgery following a sinus infection she contracted during a solo charity trip to her native South Africa earlier this year.
In the days after her arrival, Charlene's sister-in-law Chantell Wittstock, told MailOnline the princess may not be returning to the palace and did not plan to immediately return to public engagements, although she later retracted the remark.
Before she left in January, Charlene had raised eyebrows in Monaco by living in a modest two-bedroom apartment above an old chocolate factory about 300m away, rather than in the 12th Century Palace itself. It is thought she could return to living at the property. 
Asked whether the Princess would now return to the arm's-length arrangement the couple had before her departure, Ms Wittstock, married to Charlene's brother Sean, who is on the board of her charitable foundation, said: 'Oh, we don't know yet. She'll probably be commuting between the two, wherever she's comfortable.
'And none of that is clear yet where she'll be settling or anything like that. I mean, she only just arrived back, so it's everybody finding their feet. The Princess is very excited to see her kids and they're very excited to see their mom again.
'So we'll see where she'll be settling. But it will be with her husband and her children.
Ms Wittstock, asked about media stories focusing on the state of her sister-in-law's marriage to Prince Albert, added: 'It is absolutely not something I can comment on. But what I can say is the princess is back in Monaco with her husband and children that should say it all.' 
She later retracted her statement, claiming that Charlene would be staying with her husband and children, but the latest comments from Prince Albert prove otherwise. 
Meanwhile, Prince Albert has continued to carry out royal duties on his own.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the couple said: 'The Princess is currently convalescing and will continue to do so for the coming weeks, allowing Her time to recover from a state of profound general fatigue.'
The statement said the couple have 'both decided that a period of calm and rest is necessary to ensure the very best recovery for Princess Charlene's health.'   
It continued: 'In order to protect the comfort and privacy essential to Her recovery, the Princess' location will remain strictly confidential.
'As soon as her health permits, the Princess looks forward to once again carrying out her Princely duties and spending time with the Monegasques.'    
The claims will inevitably cast a shadow of doubt over the staged photocall last week when Charlene was reunited with Albert, 63, and their children after a 10-month absence from Monaco. 
Charlene spent months without her family in her native South Africa while she recovered from surgery following a sinus infection she contracted during a solo charity trip earlier this year.
The reunion, shared on Instagram, was eyed with scepticism by French commentators amid feverish speculation about the state of the Grimaldis' marriage.
Charlene's time away followed fresh allegations last December that Albert had fathered a love-child (which would be his third, if proven) with an unnamed Brazilian woman during the time when he and Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer for South Africa, were already in a relationship.
On the question of Charlene's return to public engagements, she sounded equally equivocal, saying: 'She absolutely will - if everything goes well, if she is definitely still healing and recovering.
'That doesn't just happen overnight. She's definitely going to be taking it easy. And yeah, her main focus right now will be spending time with her children and her family.

'All we can say right now is all of her procedures in South Africa were a success. So medically the doctors have cleared her to fly back. And that's why she's obviously back in Monaco with her kids.' 
She said the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, which promotes water safety and wildlife conservation in Africa, would soon expand to cover the whole continent.
'The main reason for coming to Africa in the first place was to launch more Foundation projects, which is when she fell ill and the Foundation team in South Africa absolutely carried on with all of those, making sure that everything happened exactly the way she wanted it.
'Even during recovery, in between procedures, the princess still tried to be completely hands-on and on the ground and work with us. 
The foundation will also be expanding into the whole of Africa as of next year.
'As far as Charlene goes. The outlook is is positive and you know she's going to get back to full strength and be full steam ahead. It's not going to happen overnight.'
The new development will certainly add fuel to the intense speculation over the future of the marriage of Charlene and Albert.
Monday's photos were greeted with a hefty dose of scepticism by the French media.
Albert was waiting for her at the Monte Carlo helipad, along with their six-year-old twins, Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques. The family were joined by a hand-picked photographer inside the Palace walls for the 'reunion' photos.
But there was already doubt cast over the couple's living arrangements.
'Reunion of Albert and Charlene of Monaco: but where exactly do they sleep?' was the headline question in the respected French celebrity outlet Gala on Tuesday.
And Voici – another popular magazine read widely across Monaco and France – ran with: 'Charlene of Monaco back: the Princess breaks the silence and forgets to mention her husband'.
This was a reference to Charlene using a social media video to thank everybody who had helped her through months of ill-health, without name-checking Albert at all.
In the streets in the shadow of the 12th century Prince's Palace, people could not conceal their concern for Charlene this week, having seen the photos of her looking so obviously frail.
'We are glad to have her back, but she doesn't look well and it feels we don't yet have the full picture,' said one cafe owner on the Rock, in his 50s, who asked not to be named.
He admitted that in years past, he like many Monegasques, had expressed frustration at the way Charlene has been less visible than other royals.
'There was a while when there was a sense that she was a reluctant princess,' he said, 'but this is different - there's obviously something not quite right either with her or the marriage and for whatever reason we're not being told what.'
There certainly appears to be a wall of silence around Charlene, especially since she retreated behind the ramparts of the Palace, at least for the time being.
Her Palace press officer said she could not return calls from MailOnline and did not reply to a list of questions we sent her.
Doubts about the central relationship of Monaco's royal family are not new of course.
Several residents living in the narrow medieval alleys of Monaco Ville confirmed to MailOnline that before she left for South Africa Charlene was spending most of her time outside the Palace at the Chocolate factory apartment.
'We often saw her outside the Palace and she would usually be alone or with a bodyguard,' said one source, 'but she was never with Albert - it was obvious she chose to spend most of her time in the apartment rather than the palace.'
Another Monte Carlo source who knows the couple well told MailOnline: 'The way to stop all the friction and put an end to the speculation about their marriage is for Charlene to proudly move back into the Palace and start living like a proper Princess.
'That's what the people of Monaco want, because they love their Royals, and don't want them living separate lives.'
Charlene came in for criticism before she travelled to South Africa for dividing her time between several properties outside the Palais, the official residence of the Sovereign, Albert II.
Instead of enjoying palatial rooms overlooking the Mediterranean, and a domestic staff including butlers and cooks, Charlene chose the Chocolate Factory.
It only had two bedrooms, and had been used in the past by Albert's sister, Princess Stéphanie.
Stéphanie, 56, led an extremely turbulent personal life herself that included two divorces and high-profile affairs with security guards and an elephant trainer.
1987 - Bea Fiedler, a German topless model, claims her son Daniel was the prince's son.
1992 - An American national files a paternity lawsuit against the Prince, claiming that he was the father of her daughter, Jazmin Grace.
2000 - Princess Charlene meets Prince Albert at the Mare Nostrum swimming competition in Monte Carlo
2005 - In May, a former flight attendant claims that her youngest son, whom she named Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, was Prince Albert's child. She states that his parentage had been proven by DNA tests requested by the Monegasque government.
On 6 July, a few days before he was enthroned on 12 July, the Prince officially confirms via his lawyer Lacoste that Alexandre was his biological son.
2006 - After a DNA test confirmed the child's parentage, Albert admitted, via statement from his lawyer, that he is Jazmin Grace's father.
2010 - Princess Charlene and Prince Albert announce their engagement
2011 - Princess Charlene was said to have bolted two days before the royal wedding after hearing Prince Albert had a third love child during their relationship. It was alleged that Charlene tried to flee home to South Africa three times before her 'arranged marriage', at one point taking refuge inside her country's embassy in Paris.
Monaco officials were said to have coaxed her back by brokering a deal between the Prince and his reluctant bride that she provide him with a legitimate heir. After that she would be free to leave of her own free will.
During the wedding, Charlene was in floods of tears, while her husband looked on impassively. Later in the year, Princess Charlene confessed she felt 'very lonely' in Monaco
2012 - Princess Charlene was reported to be 'depressed' at her failure to provide her husband with a legitimate heir.
2014 - Pregnancy was announced in May. In December Charlene gave birth to twins Princess Gabriella and heir to the throne Prince Jacques.
2017 - Princess Charlene visits Africa, tells media: 'I am African and this is my heritage. It will always be. It's in my heart and in my veins.'
2019 - In a rare interview, Princess Charlene confessed it is 'sometimes hard to smile' and said the year had been 'very painful'In another interview, she said she found motherhood 'exhausting'
2020 - Charlene debuts a shocking half-shaved hairstyle. It is announced Prince Albert of Monaco will appear in court in the new year to fight explosive claims he fathered a third love child with a secret girlfriend before marrying his now wife Princess Charlene.
2021 - January 27 - Charlene is pictured with Albert for the Sainte Devote Ceremony in Monaco. It is the last time she has been seen in Monaco this year.
Charlene also escaped Royal protocol by staying at Roc Agel, a mountain retreat on the outskirts of Monaco originally restored for Albert's late mother, the Hollywood star Grace Kelly who became Princess Grace before her tragic death in a car crash on the treacherously steep road approaching Roc Agel.
Charlene was also a frequent visitor to a holiday home owned by friends on the Mediterranean island of Corsica.
Paris Match, the celeb bible, has always had particularly close ties with the Grimaldis – the ancient dynasty now headed by Albert and Charlene.
'Charlene and Albert on the Verge of Breaking Up?' was the lead headline in an edition of Match in August.
'There will be no photo for their 10th anniversary wedding anniversary,' it noted.
All the high-end French publications – the kind that Albert and Charlene would normally grant fawning interviews to – concurred.
The upmarket and very conservative Madame Figaro ran with the stark headline: 'Are Charlene and Albert II of Monaco on the verge of divorce?'
Historian and author Philippe Delorme told the magazine: 'Lots of people got the impression it was an arranged marriage, it's true.
'Albert chose a wife who resembled his mother and Charlene clearly felt very ill at ease in this Grace Kelly role they wanted her to play.
'As Karl Marx put it: History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.'
The 2011 wedding itself was an ostentatious three-day event featuring a concert by the Eagles. But onlookers were concerned by photos of the bride in tears with her husband appearing distant, but Charlene insisted later she was just emotional.
Charlene has been notable by her absence from every single flagship event in the tax haven principality this year.
They have included the Monaco Grand Prix on May 23, and the Fashion Awards hosted by the Princess's own charitable foundation on May 18.
Charlene infamously shaved half her head in the style of a punk rocker last December.
This was seen as the first public sign of a worsening crisis that could end in a multi-million pound divorce.
Charlene's exile in South Africa began a month after it emerged last December that Albert was facing yet another paternity suit.
A Brazilian woman who cannot be named for legal reasons said her 15-year-old daughter was the result of an affair with Albert in 2004.
Albert and Charlene were not yet engaged at this time, but they had known each over for four years after meeting at a swimming gala in Monaco in 2000.
Lawyers for the claimant were scheduled to demand a DNA test from Albert at a court in Milan earlier this year, while his own counsel branded the action 'a hoax'.
Neither party is now commenting, suggesting some kind of generous settlement may have been reached, as happened with Albert's earlier love children.
They are Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, who is now 29 and the result of Albert's affair with an American estate agent, and Alexandre Coste, 17, whose mother is a former Togolese air hostess.
Both children were struck off Monaco's line of succession in return for vast financial settlements.",-2
1658," (CNN)House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday that he would reinstate Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on committees -- potentially even ""better"" ones -- if Republicans win back the House after next year's midterms.""They'll have committees,"" McCarthy said at his weekly news conference. ""They may have other committee assignments, they may have better ones. ... Taylor Greene, she was just a freshman. She has a right to serve on committees.""The California Republican also hinted that a GOP majority may kick some House Democrats off their committee seats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.""Pelosi has set new policies here. Those same members that I talked about in my speech ... voted for these new policies,"" McCarthy said, alluding to Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters of California, Adam Schiff of California, Eric Swalwell of California and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. ""This isn't about threats, but it's about holding people accountable.""I think the majority is going to have to approve any of those members on the committees on which they can serve,"" he added.Pelosi told CNN's Manu Raju earlier Thursday that she is not concerned that Republicans plan to retaliate and strip Democrats from their committee spots should the GOP win the House majority next year.Asked by CNN if she was at all concerned about retribution, Pelosi replied, ""No, we would not walk away from our responsibilities for fear of something they may do in the future.""Gosar was censured for posting a photoshopped anime video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. He eventually took the post down but retweeted a tweet that contained the video hours after being censured Wednesday.Greene was stripped of her committee assignments in February in the wake of incendiary and violent past statements that were unearthed shortly after she was sworn in.She also pushed back on the possibility that Republicans take the chamber, saying that ""their behavior on the floor says they shouldn't have a gavel anywhere near them.""At his news conference, McCarthy bristled at the suggestion that the GOP is only willing to punish members of their conference who defy Donald Trump. He disputed the idea that Republican Rep. Liz Cheney -- who was booted from GOP leadership for calling out Trump's election lies -- was punished, saying she just ""lost an election.""""We hold our members to a high standard,"" he said. ""It's interesting to me how the Democrats want rules for thee, but not for me. That's not right. And we'll change that when we're in the majority.""McCarthy said the last time he talked to Trump was earlier this morning, saying the former President called him up from the golf course.""Catching up,"" McCarthy said of their conversation. ""Wasn't even campaign [related] either. I have lots of friends. I talk to lots of people.""",0
1659,"THE ASSESSMENT of the science of climate change released by the IPCC in August looked at various future-emission scenarios. In every one the best estimate for the difference in temperature between the mid-19th and the mid-21st centuries was above 1.5°C. Only two scenarios, both with close to net-zero emissions by mid-century and net-negative ones thereafter, had best estimates lower than 2°C for the final two decades of the century.
What the report did not say was how the world would pay for the net-negative decades needed to provide a climate both stable and within the Paris temperature limits. In a net-zero economy, it is possible to imagine “polluter-pays” schemes under which emitters pay for the negative emissions that cancel out their activity. They might conceivably evolve from emission-trading schemes like the EU’s. But once you need to remove more CO2 than is being put in an insufficient number of polluters makes things trickier.

Some companies, including Microsoft and Ikea, plan to go net-negative at their own expense. Microsoft aims to remove from the atmosphere an amount of carbon equivalent to all the emissions it has been responsible for over its corporate life. But it is hardly likely that all big emitters will volunteer to behave so admirably.
An imaginative group of academics writing in the journal Nature recently described a polluter-pays scheme which might force companies to become at least somewhat carbon-negative. Well before net zero is reached, emissions would start to attract a “carbon-removal obligation” requiring later removal. To incentivise companies to act promptly, the obligations would grow over time: leave a tonne up in the air long enough and you would have to pull two tonnes out. It is an ingenious idea. But it would do nothing to remove emissions made before the scheme began.
It is hard to imagine negative emissions on a scale large enough to make up for overshooting the carbon budget being paid for by anyone except governments. Any agreement on how that should be done would surely reflect some version of “common but differentiated responsibilities”: countries disproportionately responsible for using up the carbon budget in the first place would be asked to take on most of the burden of dealing with the overshoot.In a world where rich countries had already invested heavily in helping poorer ones reduce emissions, that added expense might be borne willingly. But it is also possible that it would not.
What is more, in a world where some, presumably richer, countries have enough negative-emissions capability to get to net zero and beyond, other countries—either poorer or just more bloody-minded—might abandon further emissions reduction, gambling that the countries with negative-emissions capability would rather increase their use of that capability than see the CO2 level continue to rise.
They might win that gamble; they might not. It is all too easy to imagine a world where most people in poor countries continue to think that climate change is not their fault and someone else should sort it out, while people in richer countries don’t want to shoulder the full burden of doing so. A stand-off develops in which the overshoot is never sucked down and temperatures eventually stabilise at a level considerably higher than 2°C over pre-industrial levels—if they stabilise at all.
The alternative to this game of chicken would be to meet the Paris temperature limits through other means. Solar geoengineering is an approach to the climate that concentrates not on making it easier for the Earth to cool itself, as removing carbon dioxide does, but stopping it from warming so much in the first place. The way of doing this which has been studied in most detail, albeit almost entirely in models, is to create a thin layer of reflective particles in the stratosphere that reflects sunlight back into space before it warms the surface. Studies suggest that, for good or ill, such a scheme could be implemented by a relatively small fleet of purpose-built aircraft.
These ideas have, for understandable reasons, long been marginalised in policy circles. They reek of hubris and the potential for unintended consequences. And if, by providing another way of limiting temperature rises, they reduce the perceived urgency of curbing emissions, they might weaken or even stall the commitment to emissions reduction.
That would be disastrous. Though it has the opposite effect on temperature, the cooling offered by solar geoengineering is not, in physical terms, an exact counter of the warming created by greenhouse gases. One difference is seen in the world’s hydrological cycle; solar geoengineering tends to suppress precipitation. The more the world came to rely on it, the more this and other mismatches would become harmful. This, alongside the fact that it does nothing about ocean acidification, is a strong part of the reason why researchers looking seriously at solar geoengineering never advocate using it instead of mitigation. Those not turned off by it completely see it as a possible complement to mitigation, not as an alternative.
In this it is very like negative emissions—one reason they are sometimes called “carbon geoengineering”. The way a solar-geoengineering capability might reduce the incentive to continue with emissions reduction is similar to the way existing negative-emissions capacity might work. And in both cases that reduced ambition might well come about even if the proposed geoengineering did not.
A crucial difference between the two, though, is the cost of instigating them. It seems likely that putting a veil into the atmosphere would be comparatively cheap (in the tens of billions of dollars a year, perhaps even less), though the externalities not included in the cost might be high. Another difference is that negative emissions would affect the climate in more or less the same way whoever undertook them; the world’s carbon-dioxide level is what it is. Different sorts of solar geoengineering, though, would have distinctly different regional effects.
Design for living
If the world as a whole were able to design a solar-geoengineering scheme, studies suggest it could come up with one that provided climate benefits to almost everyone and serious problems to almost nobody. A plausible way to use such an optimal scheme might be to offset the temperature rise caused by overshooting the carbon budget. That would provide a sort of breathing space to allow the excess CO2 to be drawn down more slowly and cheaply than would be necessary if its warming effects were actually being felt. A comparatively gentle acceleration of chemical weathering, rather than a huge investment in DAC or other schemes, might prove sufficient. As those measures slowly wore the overshoot down the solar geoengineering could be reduced. When the CO2 level was low enough it would be phased out completely, leaving behind a stable climate.
But the world as a whole might not get to choose the wisest path. A small group of countries, or even a single large one, could undertake a solar-geoengineering scheme unilaterally. Such a club would be likely to optimise its own interests rather than those of the world. It might, for example, choose to cool some places to a degree that, because of geoengineering’s effects on the water cycle, risked desiccating others. That might lead to resentment, rancour or reprisals.
Nor would any given set of solar geoengineers be sure to get things their own way. The late Marty Weitzman, a pioneering economist of climate change, pointed out that though emission reductions (and by implication negative emissions), because of their cost, have a free-rider problem, solar geoengineering, because it looks cheap, has a “free-driver” problem. Where free-rider problems lead to underprovision (countries are unwilling to commit to cutting emissions when others do not, as 26 years of COPs has made clear) free-driver problems may lead to overprovision. Solar geoengineering looks cheap enough that countries wanting more of it can provide it unilaterally, whatever others think.
This implies that, other things being equal, the level of solar geoengineering would be a trade-off between the amount that the most enthusiastic countries wanted and the amount that the least enthusiastic would endure before taking decisive action, quite possibly through force of arms. Another game of chicken.
The difficulties involved in negative emissions and solar geoengineering are very different, and the second looks much more unfamiliar and threatening than the first. But in both cases the problem is fundamentally similar—and closely related to the contradiction between global temperature goals and national emissions-reduction commitments at the heart of the Paris agreement. The world has needs which can be agreed on; but the decisions necessary to meet those needs are made by countries which differ in their interests, their capabilities and the amount of persuasion they can exert or resist. The responsibilities may be common; the differentiation is endless.
Glasgow will show the degree to which national governments are able to deliver progress in terms of the increased ambition of their NDCs, the realisation of long-promised transfers of money from north to south, and workable rules for the parts of the Paris agreement which remain sketchy. The progress is unlikely to be spectacular, reinforcing the point that managing global issues like the climate purely through national lenses is impractical. But coming up with an alternative in which individual countries will allow the interests of others to be placed above their own is implausible. And if the world is to stabilise the climate at an acceptable level, something will have to give.
The climate crisis was brought about as part of the creation of a new world economy. Coming through it successfully may well require a new world politics. Failing to do so will be calamitous in terms of politics and economics alike.■

1660,"A global shortage of natural-gas supplies continued to convulse markets. Prices have soared in recent weeks, especially in Europe, following a convergence of adverse factors, such as booming demand in Asia coinciding with tight stocks of liquefied natural gas. In Europe some governments are stepping in to alleviate the pressure on spiralling household bills. The International Energy Agency pointed out that Russia’s gas exports to Europe are below their level of 2019, and urged it to “do more to increase gas availability”.
A fowl situation

One of the many knock-on effects of the turmoil in gas markets was a shortage of carbon dioxide as an industrial gas in Britain. A big producer of carbon dioxide had to close its factories because of soaring natural-gas prices, which in turn led to warnings from the chicken industry about a possible paucity of poultry. Carbon dioxide is used to stun hens for slaughter.
Evergrande, one of China’s biggest property developers, said it had “resolved” the payment of interest on a domestic bond amid a liquidity crisis. The highly indebted company has warned of a default and has reportedly missed interest payments to bank creditors. Investors are watching nervously. The central bank has been pumping liquidity into the financial system to shore up confidence.
The official statement from the Federal Reserve’s meeting this week prepared markets for the strong possibility that it will start to taper its pandemic-programme asset purchases in November. The central bank also hinted at an interest rate rise next year.
The OECD raised its forecast for inflation in the G20 countries, in part because of higher shipping costs and energy prices. The average annual inflation rate for the group is now expected to be 3.7% this year and 3.9% in 2022. Battling inflation that is nearing 10%, Brazil’s central bank raised its main interest rate for the fifth consecutive month.
America’s House of Representatives passed a bill that would extend the federal debt ceiling until December next year in order to avoid a government shutdown on October 1st this year. Democrats supported the bill and Republicans opposed it. The Senate will now have its say, amid warnings that markets will run out of patience the longer a resolution is delayed.
Douyin, a Chinese video-sharing app that has an international version called TikTok, said children under 14 in China would be limited to using it for 40 minutes a day. It is the latest move in China to tighten controls over children’s online behaviour.
Shell struck an agreement to sell its energy assets in America’s Permian Basin to ConocoPhillips for $9.5bn. The Anglo-Dutch energy giant is under pressure to quicken the pace of carbon-emission cuts. In May a Dutch court ordered the company to hit a specific carbon-reduction target by 2030 (it is appealing against the ruling). Shell described the sale of its Permian business as “disciplined stewardship of capital”. Some $7bn in proceeds have been earmarked for “shareholder distributions”.
Universal Music made a successful stockmarket debut on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. Its share price jumped by a third on the first day of trading, in Europe’s biggest listing this year. The music company, which counts EMI and Motown among its record labels, was spun off by Vivendi, though the French media conglomerate’s controlling shareholder, Vincent Bolloré, retains an 18% stake.
Entain, a British gambling company and owner of the Ladbrokes and Coral brands, said it had received a takeover approach, reportedly worth $25bn, from DraftKings, an American fantasy-sports and betting operator.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s biggest lender, is to sell its consumer-banking operations in America to US Bancorp in an $8bn deal. MUFG expanded into American retail banking when it took full control of Union Bank during the financial crisis in 2008. It will hold on to its corporate- and investment-banking businesses in America, important providers of income.
In a vote of confidence for the future of office working, Google announced that it would buy the building that serves as its hub in New York for $2.1bn, even though it expects some employees will continue to work remotely.
Return of the salad days
In Britain a different indicator—the financial health of Pret A Manger—also suggested a rosy future for the office. The coffee-and-light-meal chain, a favourite of the lunchtime crowd, has seen its sales rebound in London’s financial district. During the pandemic it closed stores across Britain, but now expects to open 200 new ones by the end of 2023. However, most of those will not be in city centres, Pret’s traditional habitat, but in suburbs and regional towns.",2
1661,"SARA DUTERTE had seemed destined to be swept to power on a wave of inherited popularity. But then she shunned her clear-cut opportunity to win the election next May and succeed her death-dealing father, Rodrigo Duterte, as president. Instead, Ms Duterte registered to run for vice-president, a position that has no power. In doing so, she appears to have messed up the Duterte dynasty’s chances of prolonging its grip on national government. So the president hastily made arrangements to preserve a measure of political influence once he completes the single six-year term in office the constitution allows him. He registered to run for a seat in the senate.
Father and daughter both put their names down just before the deadline of November 15th set by the election authority for the myriad political parties to rearrange their slates by substituting new candidates. Ms Duterte began by withdrawing her bid for re-election as mayor of the southern city of Davao, the Duterte dynasty’s bailiwick, and changing parties. But, dashing her father’s hopes, she registered as a substitute candidate not for president but vice-president. In remarks directed at supporters clamouring for her to run for the presidency, in the hope she would rule in the same manner as her father, Ms Duterte told them this was “an opportunity to meet you halfway”. President and vice-president are elected separately. Sometimes they are political rivals. Unless appointed to a government job by a sympathetic president, the deputy has nothing to do but wait to take over if the boss becomes unable or unwilling to carry on.

“I was puzzled,” her father said. “She was number one in the surveys, so why did she consent to running only for the vice-presidency?…I didn’t know what was going through her head. We don’t talk.” Within hours of Ms Duterte’s registering, her father had dispatched his right-hand man, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, to register as a presidential candidate. Two days after that Mr Duterte himself registered to run for the Senate. Their purpose is clearly to reverse the present arrangement whereby Mr Go serves as Mr Duterte’s alter ego in the legislature.
For this to work, Mr Go must win the presidential election. But the latest opinion survey, taken in October, does not give him much chance. The front-runner is Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, son of the late tyrant, Ferdinand Marcos, far ahead of the leader of the opposition, Vice-President Leni Robredo, and the mayor of Manila, Isko Moreno. The day after the substitution deadline, Ms Duterte and Mr Marcos acknowledged publicly that they had formed an alliance and each would support the other’s election campaign.
Ms Duterte may have sharper political acumen than her father. The survey put her second in the vice-presidential race, behind only Senator Vicente “Tito” Sotto, a former comedian. If Ms Duterte can win the vice-presidency, a similarly victorious Mr Marcos may include her in his government. This would put Ms Duterte closer to the seat of power than her father, even if he succeeds in reaching the Senate. But comfortingly for her father, of all the presidential candidates, Mr Marcos is the least equivocal about his intention to prevent the International Criminal Court from investigating Mr Duterte on suspicion that his campaign against illegal drugs, which has killed thousands of Filipinos, is a crime against humanity. ■",2
1662," (CNN)President Joe Biden pardoned two turkeys, named Peanut Butter and Jelly, on Friday during the first traditional turkey pardon ceremony of his presidency. In a joke-filled ceremony on the White House's Rose Garden, Biden pardoned the two birds, sparing them both from becoming a presidential meal this holiday season. ""Eventually, Peanut Butter and Jelly were selected based on their temperament, appearance and, I suspect, vaccination status,"" the President joked. ""Yes, instead of getting basted, these two turkeys are getting boosted."" Biden said Peanut Butter and Jelly were ""two names I couldn't agree on more,"" adding, ""I have to admit to you, my wife doesn't like me to admit it -- that's what I like for lunch."" The President also took a moment during the ceremony to acknowledge the Covid-19 pandemic and a return to Thanksgiving traditions with loved ones. ""In all seriousness, it's important to continue traditions like this to remind us how from the darkness, there's light and hope and progress and -- that's what this year's Thanksgiving, in my view, represents,"" the President said. ""So many of us will be gathering with our loved ones for the first time in a long time. And we'll be reconnecting with traditions, with our tables and our hearts full of grace and gratitude for everyone who made it possible."" Biden thanked scientists and front-line workers who developed and administered the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as essential workers, faith leaders and the workers who grow and harvest the food on Americans' tables. The outdoor ceremony, which was attended by White House staffers' families and children, comes two weeks after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed a recommendation to vaccinate children ages 5-11 against Covid-19.Following the ceremony, they will retire to their home state at Purdue University's Animal Sciences Education and Research Farm.The Indiana-raised birds flocked to Washington, DC, this week, staying at the luxe Willard Hotel and attending a news conference on Thursday with the National Turkey Federation ahead of their White House appearance.""Raising the presidential turkey flock has really been a lot of fun this year. As we all know, with another year of uncertainties with the pandemic, this project has really been something to look forward to,"" grower Andrea Welp said on Thursday.The National Turkey Federation became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947 and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since President Harry Truman. Truman was the first to accept a turkey from them -- however, he did not spare the bird.Rumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as the Lincoln administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln's young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.The first documented turkey pardon was given by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, though it didn't catch on right away. Even though President Gerald Ford pardoned President Richard Nixon, neither one of them decided to officially pardon any turkeys.Turkey pardoning became the norm in the White House in 1989 when President George H.W. Bush revived the tradition, now a staple of the White House holiday season.Biden's decision to go on with the tradition comes on a particularly momentous day. Early Friday morning, the President underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed Medical Center. Biden temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he was under anesthesia during the colonoscopy portion of his exam.House Democrats also voted to pass Biden's sweeping $1.9 trillion social safety net expansion legislation, which now faces a tough road ahead in the Senate.And on Friday afternoon, just hours before the pardon was supposed to take place, Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty of first-degree intentional homicide and four other charges on Friday in connection to the fatal shooting of two people and wounding of another during last year's unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.While the Biden administration notched a major legislative win this week with the signing of his infrastructure bill into law, the pardon comes amid inflation at the Thanksgiving table.A new survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation found that Thanksgiving dinner will cost 14% more for Americans this year, with several factors leading to the increased pricing, including more Americans expected to cook at home this year and other economic disruptions. While that survey found that turkey is up 24% since last year, that price is dependent on when the poultry was purchased.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement Wednesday that ""the good news is that the top turkey producers in the country are confident that everyone who wants a bird for their Thanksgiving dinner will be able to get one, and a large one will only cost $1 dollar more than last year.""",0
1663,"Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo misrepresented and manipulated the number of nursing home residents who have died across the Empire State due to COVID-19, according to a State Assemblyman who sits on the committee that is reviewing its  still-secret report.
Assemblyman Phil Steck is one of the Judiciary Committee members who reviewed the nearly 45-page report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, on Thursday and Friday, prior to its release to the public.
The report could be made public as soon as next week.
The report itself is said to cover everything from Cuomo's sexual harassment accusations to claims of his staff assisting in the writing of his book on the Coronavirus pandemic.
A lesser-known part of the report includes the Cuomo administration's misrepresentation of COVID-19 data related to the death toll of nursing home residents across the Empire State and manipulating numbers as presented to the public. 
The gaps in the state's COVID-19 fatality accounting included the decision to exclude nursing home death totals of thousands of residents who died after being taken from the homes to the hospital, according to reports in August.
That report came at the same time Cuomo resigned from office in disgrace, likely to avoid an impeachment trial in the wake of a separate investigation, led by two independent investigators hired by the state's attorney general, that found he sexually harassed 11 women in office.
The report's investigators included details that the state Department of Health had specifically requested that data on hospital deaths in relation to the state's nursing home COVID-19 death toll.  
'The investigation showed that as they were considering these matters, the book deal was going on, there's a chapter in the book about nursing homes,' said the lawmaker, a Democrat who represents part of the Albany area in Upstate New York. 
'They were trying to make it as what they thought was least damaging to the governor instead of just telling the truth.'
Assembly Member Mary Beth Walsh, a Republican, said that the timing of Cuomo's abrupt resignation hindered investigative efforts to interview witnesses regarding the misrepresentation and manipulation of the nursing home COVID data.  
'I believe that the timing of the governor's resignation really kind of truncated the investigation and the ability to investigate on that,' said Walsh, whose district includes parts of Saratoga and Schenectady counties. 
'Several individuals who were scheduled to be subpoenaed did not cooperate after the governor’s resignation.'
However, administration officials in Cuomo's office did acknowledge the state's nursing home fatality totals were not complete at the time, arguing the time it would take to verify the immense amount of data.
Meanwhile, health officials said the exclusion of data was not done to make the state's Coronavirus death count look better than it was, nor was it done in an effort to protect Cuomo's reputation.  
On Friday, Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesperson, said that the former administration has yet to see a copy of the Assembly's report, while hinting the results may be 'one-sided.' 
'The Assembly Judiciary Committee has chosen not to review their findings with us which is their prerogative, but it may once again result in a one-sided report,' Azzopardi said.  
Assembly Member Walsh claimed the report included 'overwhelming evidence' that the former governor sexually harassed the women who came forward. 
Cuomo, who is currently facing a criminal charge that he groped a female aide, has steadfastly denied touching anyone inappropriately since news of the accusations initially broke.
The report also touches on Cuomo's $5.1 million book deal, rules of which Steck says were 'very clear,' adding that the then-governor violated conditions set by the state ethics committee which barred Cuomo from using his staff to help write the book. 
The ethics committee rescinded their approval of Cuomo's book deal this week, an act Walsh says could 'open the door' to further fines for the disgraced former governor.",-2
1664,"Thousands of Year 12 students have descended on the glitter strip to kick off a three-week celebration notorious for out-of-control partying.  
The end of school celebrations began on Saturday - but almost didn't go ahead for the second year in a row after Covid-19 cases popped up in the Sunshine State last week.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk gave the green light for festivities on Thursday - a relief to thousands of Year 12 students that spent most of the year in and out of lockdowns and under Covid restrictions.
Many were seen unloading their luggage outside their accommodation in Surfers Paradise on Saturday morning before they hit the shops to stock up on supplies.
As the sun went down the celebrations kicked off with dozens of teens seen enjoying their new-found freedom.
Everyone appeared in high spirits with one girl seen enjoying a ride in a trolley and another having fun on a friend's shoulders. 
A handful of teens were seen chatting to police with some reciving on the spot fines. 
Like so many milestones missed for the past two years due to the Covid pandemic,  schoolies was very close to being added to the list.
The state recorded two new mystery infections last week but after 24 hours with no new infections on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk gave Schoolies the go-ahead.
In preparation for the influx of more than 20,000 teenagers at Surfers Paradise, police have set up a 'robust' system to ensure all are kept safe.
Pop up tents will be set up each night to help any Schoolies revellers that may require medical assistance.
Extra police officers will also be called in to patrol the streets and will this year have metal detectors to crack down on anyone carrying knives.
Acting Chief Superintendent Rhy Wildman said this year would mark the first time police will be carrying out operations in search for weapons or knives without needing to have any suspicion a person is carrying them.
'We will have an enforcement strategy for those coming in - there'll be policing around venues, hotels and intercepts of vehicles,' he said.
'Our operations are all about making sure children will be looked after as best as possible.' 
The Red Frogs volunteers will also be out in full force, offering lollies and pancakes to those who may have woken up with a sore head.
Meanwhile over in Western Australia, thousands are preparing for another Schoolies week which will kick off on Monday.
A controversial ban on bringing bags into the event sparked outrage among many with some labelling it 'sexist'.
While the ban would have affected both boys and girls, opponents say it was far more discriminatory against girls, who often have more items to carry and fewer pockets to carry them in.
An online petition calling for its removal quickly gained pace but the ban has since been removed.
The ban was introduced by Leavers WA, a joint venture between the state government and police to minimise harm to school leavers during the sometimes raucous celebrations. 
The organisation said the move was to prevent attendants bringing in alcohol or other substances but they have since said bags no larger than A5 will be permitted.  ",-2
1665,"SANJAY TICKOO fidgets in a small, yellow-walled room at a secret location surrounded by concertina wire and military patrols. The security forces tell Mr Tickoo that his confinement is for his own good, and he believes them. He is a Pandit, born to one of the 800-odd Hindu families in Kashmir who stayed on through a generation of deadly insurgency. This month unidentified militants have shot and killed at least 11 civilians—Pandits, Sikhs and non-Kashmiri migrants from elsewhere in India—for the apparent purpose of terrorising those minorities who still live alongside the Kashmiri Muslim majority.
India and Pakistan have been fighting over the state of Jammu  Kashmir since 1947. Each administers a part and claims the whole. But the region’s centre of gravity, the Kashmir valley, has always been held by India. It has been gripped by separatist fevers since 1989. Roughly half a million Indian troops have become a permanent presence. Tens of thousands of Kashmiris have been killed in the process. Millions more are angry about living in what has come to resemble occupied territory.

This was all supposed to change on August 5th 2019. Fresh into his second term, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, pushed two bills through parliament that cleaved the state in two and scrapped what autonomy it still enjoyed. Under the new regime, Kashmir is ruled directly from Delhi, the national capital. The reorganisation promised to replace corrupt politicians, to attract investment and prosperity and to bring lasting peace.
Two years on, none of these aims has been realised. No new political class has been mustered to represent the Kashmiri people at home or in Delhi; unemployment, at 21%, is the highest in India; and killings of all kinds rattle Srinagar, the former state’s capital. The pandemic could be blamed for some of these problems. Instead the central government pretends they do not exist. On October 12th the head of its human-rights commission praised the home minister for blessing Kashmir with “a new era of peace, and law and order”. A week earlier, a Hindu businessman named Makhan Lal Bindroo (pictured) had been shot point-blank at his pharmacy.
Not all bloodshed in Kashmir garners coverage. It is barely news when troops are ambushed—nine died on October 11th—or when Kashmiri Muslims are killed, as when paramilitary forces gunned down a young nomad named Parvez Ahmed Khan for failing to stop at a checkpoint, two days after Mr Bindroo’s death. But the current wave of assassinations targeting victims on the basis of religious and ethnic identity has reminded Kashmiris of old wounds.
Most Pandits fled during a grim insurgency in 1990s. There are also some 80,000 Sikhs, some of whom are now being murdered too. But by far the largest, most vulnerable group of potential targets are the migrant workers who have come from the rest of India, mainly the poor states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, over the past two decades. Some are Muslim; most are Hindu. None speaks the local language and almost all relocated to escape penury. There may be 300,000-400,000, including many now scrambling to flee.
An outfit calling itself the Resistance Front (TRF), which Indian security forces say has links to Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the killings. Most Kashmiris of all religions are appalled at the violence aimed at the defenceless. It may be that TRF or other groups are attacking civilians around Srinagar because their forces have been worn down from the fight against armed forces in the countryside and are finding softer targets.
Or it may be that the terrorists are trying to pre-empt an influx of Indian settlers into the valley. Their actions betray a broader obsession with demography in the territory, one in which Muslims are the majority. When Kashmir’s special protections were abrogated, Kashmiris were most alarmed to be losing a constitutional assurance that purchases of land would never be opened to outsiders, who could overwhelm them with sheer numbers. Mr Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government has hardly allayed those fears. Instead it has tested ways to minimise the demographic strength of the valley’s Muslims. First it made 400,000 Hindus displaced from Pakistan in 1947 eligible for permanent residency. Then it liberalised the criteria for more recent immigrants to settle. It also seems to be gerrymandering Kashmir’s future constituencies to the disadvantage of Muslims.
The government’s priority is to thwart the terrorists from provoking another exodus. In response to the murder of three Bihari workers, the territory’s police chief this week ushered vulnerable migrants into military camps for their protection. That will not be enough. Sandeep Koul, a young Pandit hunkering down at his mother’s home in Srinagar, complains, “We have done nothing to deserve this fate.” Mr Koul is 29 years old; he has lived under the shadow of militancy his whole life. “If the attacks continue,” he laments, “my family, too, will have to leave Kashmir.” ■",2
1666,"ALTHOUGH DRONES, or uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) as they are also known, were originally developed for military target practice and surveillance, the civilian versions that have emerged over the past decade have created a thriving new industry. Commercial UAVs, especially the hovering type, are used for jobs ranging from inspecting power lines, buildings and crops, to aerial photography, transporting medical supplies and even delivering pizzas. The value of this market reached $22.5bn last year, according to Drone Industry Insights, a German research firm with its eye on the business. By 2025 that figure is expected to exceed $42bn.
Something helping to accelerate this growth is a gradual relaxation of the strictures that aviation authorities, being naturally cautious about all these newfangled flying machines taking to the sky, have imposed on the industry. In most countries, drones may not be flown near people or over built-up areas, and must be kept within view of their operator. Exemptions may be sought for specific flights, but this can be a long-winded process, hedged with restrictions. For instance, regulators have usually insisted on ground observers being used to follow flights beyond an operator’s visual line-of-sight, or BVLOS as it is known. This means extra staff have to be hired and trained, which pushes up costs.

However, as companies build up their flying experience, things are starting to change. In January, for example, a firm called American Robotics became the first operator approved by America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly automated UAVs at specific sites without any pilots or observers being present. Staff at the company’s base near Boston oversee these flights, even though the drones operate as far away as Nevada and Kansas.
To infinity and beyond
At the moment, American Robotics’ flights take place in rural areas. Their purpose is to survey farmland. The company’s quadcopter Scout drones wait, charged up and ready to fly, in boxes located on customers’ farms. At the beginning of a mission the box lid slides open and the drone, sitting on its landing pad, is raised for take-off. Once flying, it scans the customer’s fields with a variety of sensors, gathering data on crops and growing conditions. When done, it returns to its box, the lid closes, the data are processed and passed to the farmer, and the drone is recharged.
To avoid aerial collisions, the Scout system employs ground-based acoustic sensors which can hear the engines and propellers of approaching planes from a distance of several kilometres. This allows the position of an incoming flight to be plotted and, if necessary, the drone is instructed to keep clear. The company also plans to survey buildings and other infrastructure. Up to this point, says Reese Mozer, its chief executive, the industry has been “scratching the surface of autonomous drone use”.
Something similar is happening in Britain. In April the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) authorised a firm called sees.ai to carry-out routine BVLOS flights, albeit at specified locations. These include a large construction site in Surrey, to the south-west of London. “It is a big step forward and allows us to fly as often as we like without prior authorisation,” says John McKenna, the firm’s chief executive. For the time being, an observer is required on site, but that person need no longer be in constant contact with the flight-monitoring team at the company’s base near Chichester, on the south coast. The firm hopes that this requirement will soon be lifted.
As its name suggests, sees.ai relies on artificial intelligence to operate its UAVs. To navigate, the craft employ several cameras and also other systems, including GPS, radar and lidar (which uses light instead of reflected radio waves) to build up three-dimensional images of their surroundings. The drones’ software is trained to recognise structures and obstacles, including other aircraft, and to take evasive action if needed. This also lets the craft fly inside tunnels and under oil rigs, where GPS and radio-control signals are easily lost.
Although the covid-19 epidemic has delayed some projects, it has spurred others along—especially the delivery of medical supplies. Antwork Technology, which in 2019 received the first licence granted by China’s Civil Aviation Administration for urban UAV trials, moved quickly from dropping off orders from Starbucks and KFC around its home town of Hangzhou to ferrying blood supplies and samples.
Antwork placed automated drone “ports” that resemble small shipping containers in the car parks of some of the region’s hospitals and laboratories. Medical staff post samples and supplies through doors in the sides of these ports. They are then loaded automatically into a drone sitting on top of the container. At the end of its journey, a drone lands on another port and deposits its cargo, which can then be picked up from the door.
Antwork’s drones, which navigate using GPS and cameras, are governed by a computerised scheduling and monitoring system. Two people at a flight-control centre keep an eye on up to eight drones simultaneously, though for the time being the company also uses some ground observers. Antwork says its drones have cut to a few minutes the time taken to make hospital deliveries that once took half an hour or more by road.
Several big outfits in the West are also keen on the drone-delivery business. Amazon, UPS and Alphabet, Google’s parent, all have projects in development. Some Nordic countries, where the skies are also relatively clear, have been especially drone-friendly. Alphabet’s drone-delivery subsidiary, Wing, has begun its third year of flights in Helsinki, dropping off groceries and food to homes and some public sites, such as picnic areas. Wing’s drones employ a hook on a cable to pick up goods from merchants and deliver them to customers. The drones fly at an altitude of 30-40 metres, which is well below that at which crewed aircraft typically operate. But just in case, the team overseeing the operation is plugged into a ground-based radio that monitors transponders broadcasting the positions of any aircraft in the area. Wing is also investigating the use of miniature transponders on its drones.
Over in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, one of the longest-established drone-delivery businesses is also still going strong. This is a partnership between aha, a local company, and Flytrex, an Israeli drone-service firm. Together, they have been delivering groceries and meals by UAV since 2017. Flytrex is now trying to get something similar off the ground in America, with a delivery service from a local Walmart to homes in Fayetteville, North Carolina. On May 25th it was given permission by the FAA to fly above people. For now, its remote pilots still have to keep their craft in view, but ground observers are no longer required. “This is a large step forward and allows us to significantly expand the number of front and backyards we can service,” says Yariv Bash, Flytrex’s boss. The firm’s drones navigate using GPS receivers and other sensors—but not cameras, because of fears that Americans might consider them to be intrusive.
Heaven sent
Four days earlier than Flytrex, on May 21st, Manna, an Irish drone-delivery company, obtained a new type of European Union operating certificate. Within certain limits, it allows the firm to authorise UAV operations on its own recognisance. Manna has been delivering food and groceries in suburban Galway for the past year, carrying out more than 35,000 flights, and now aims to set up operations in other cities.
For such progress to continue, operators will have to prove their UAVs have as good an ability as crewed aircraft to detect and avoid one another. “The levels of safety are not going to change between piloted aviation and remotely piloted aviation,” says David Tait, head of innovation at the CAA. Mr Tait is open to alternatives about how drones might do that, but thinks it will involve a mixture of technologies, including some that firms like sees.ai and Wing are developing.
One difficulty is that light aircraft flying in uncontrolled airspaces sometimes operate under so-called Visual Flight Rules. These absolve pilots of the obligation to carry transponders and other instrumentation as long as the journey is being made in conditions of clear visibility and they keep their eyes peeled.
Iris Automation, in California, thinks it has a solution to this problem, which is to give UAVs the equivalent of a sharp pair of eyes. These come in the form of five small cameras that create a 360° view around a drone. This panoptic image is scanned constantly by AI software which has been trained to recognise different types of aircraft from several kilometres away. The system can calculate an incoming aircraft’s range and heading, and automatically adjust the drone’s flight path if a collision looks likely.
Costing from $9,000, this is a reasonably inexpensive piece of kit in aviation terms. It is already fitted to some drones, but John Damush, Iris’s boss and himself a pilot, is also testing it on a two-seater Piper Cub. He thinks drone-tech like this could help crewed flight too, because, unlike Iris’s drones, pilots don’t have eyes in the backs of their heads. ■
Correction: An earlier version of this piece suggested that UPS Flight Forward is involved in working with groups delivering medical supplies by drone in Rwanda and Ghana. This is incorrect. It is actually the UPS foundation, a charitable offshoot of UPS, that is involved.

1667,"Editor’s note: The Economist is making some of its most important coverage of the covid-19 pandemic freely available to readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. To receive it, register here. For our coronavirus tracker and more coverage, see our hub
IN THE 1970s Mori Masahiro, a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, observed that there was something disturbing about robots which looked almost, but not quite, like people. Representations in this “uncanny valley” are close enough to lifelike for their shortfalls and divergences from the familiar to be particularly disconcerting. Today’s Chinese economy is exploring a similarly unnerving new terrain. And the rest of the world is following in its uncertain steps.
Whatever the drawbacks of these new lowlands, they are assuredly preferable to the abyss of lockdown. Measures taken to reverse the trajectory of the pandemic around the world have brought with them remarkable economic losses.

Not all sectors of the economy have done terribly. New subscriptions to Netflix increased at twice their usual rate in the first quarter of 2020, with most of that growth coming in March. In America, the sudden stop of revenue from Uber’s ride-sharing service in March and April has been partially cushioned by the 25% increase of sales from its food-delivery unit, according to 7Park Data, a data provider.
Yet the general pattern is grim. Data from Womply, a firm which processes transactions on behalf of 450,000 small businesses across America, show that businesses in all sectors have lost substantial revenue. Restaurants, bars and recreational businesses have been badly hit: revenues have declined some two-thirds since March 15th. Travel and tourism may suffer the worst losses. In the EU, where tourism accounts for some 4% of GDP, the number of people travelling by plane fell from 5m to 50,000; on April 19th less than 5% of hotel rooms in Italy and Spain were occupied. 

According to calculations made on behalf of The Economist by Now-Casting Economics, a research firm that provides high-frequency economic forecasts to institutional investors, the world economy shrank by 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020, driven by a 6.8% year-on-year decline in China’s GDP. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York draws on measures such as jobless claims to produce a weekly index of American economic output. It suggests that the country’s GDP is currently running about 12% lower than it was a year ago (see chart 1). 
These figures fit with attempts by Goldman Sachs, a bank, to estimate the relationship between the severity of lockdowns and their effect on output. It finds, roughly, that an Italian-style lockdown is associated with a GDP decline of 25%. Measures to control the virus while either keeping the economy running reasonably smoothly, as in South Korea, or reopening it, as in China, are associated with a GDP reduction in the region of 10%. That chimes with data which suggest that if Americans chose to avoid person-to-person proximity of the length of an arm or less, occupations worth approximately 10% of national output would become unviable.
The “90% economy” thus created will be, by definition, smaller than that which came before. But its strangeness will be more than a matter of size. There will undoubtedly be relief, fellow feeling, and newly felt or expressed esteem for those who have worked to keep people safe. But there will also be residual fear, pervasive uncertainty, a lack of innovative fervour and deepened inequalities. The fraction of life that is missing will colour people’s experience and behaviour in ways that will not be offset by the happy fact that most of what matters is still available and ticking over. In a world where the office is open but the pub is not, qualitative differences in the way life feels will be at least as significant as the drop in output.
The plight of the pub demonstrates that the 90% economy will not be something that can be fixed by fiat. Allowing pubs—and other places of social pleasure—to open counts for little if people do not want to visit them. Many people will have to leave the home in order to work, but they may well feel less comfortable doing so to have a good time. A poll by YouGov on behalf of The Economist finds that over a third of Americans think it will be “several months” before it will be safe to reopen businesses as normal—which suggests that if businesses do reopen some, at least, may stay away.
Ain’t nothing but tired
Some indication that the spending effects of a lockdown will persist even after it is over comes from Sweden. Research by Niels Johannesen of Copenhagen University and colleagues finds that aggregate-spending patterns in Sweden and Denmark over the past months look similarly reduced, even though Denmark has had a pretty strict lockdown while official Swedish provisions have been exceptionally relaxed. This suggests that personal choice, rather than government policy, is the biggest factor behind the drop. And personal choices may be harder to reverse.

Discretionary spending by Chinese consumers—the sort that goes on things economists do not see as essentials—is 40% off its level a year ago. Haidilao, a hotpot chain, is seeing a bit more than three parties per table per day—an improvement, but still lower than the 4.8 registered last year, according to a report by Goldman Sachs published in mid-April. Breweries are selling 40% less beer. STR, a data-analytics firm, finds that just one-third of hotel beds in China were occupied during the week ending April 19th. Flights remain far from full (see chart 2). 
This less social world is not necessarily bad news for every company. UBS, a bank, reports that a growing number of people in China say that the virus has increased their desire to buy a car—presumably in order to avoid the risk of infection on public transport. The number of passengers on Chinese underground trains is still about a third below last year’s level; surface traffic congestion is as bad now as it was then.
Wanting a car, though, will not mean being able to afford one. Drops in discretionary spending are not entirely driven by a residual desire for isolation. They also reflect the fact that some people have a lot less money in the post-lockdown world. Not all those who have lost jobs will quickly find new ones, not least because there is little demand for labour-intensive services such as leisure and hospitality. Even those in jobs will not feel secure, the Chinese experience suggests. Since late March the share of people worried about salary cuts has risen slightly, to 44%, making it their biggest concern for 2020, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. Many are now recouping the loss of income that they suffered during the most acute phase of the crisis, or paying down debt. All this points to high saving rates in the future, reinforcing low consumption. 
A 90% economy is, on one level, an astonishing achievement. Had the pandemic struck even two decades ago, only a tiny minority of people would have been able to work or satisfy their needs. Watching a performance of Beethoven on a computer, or eating a meal from a favourite restaurant at home, is not the same as the real thing—but it is not bad. The lifting of the most stringent lockdowns will also provide respite, both emotionally and physically, since the mere experience of being told what you can and cannot do is unpleasant. Yet in three main ways a 90% economy is a big step down from what came before the pandemic. It will be more fragile; it will be less innovative; and it will be more unfair. 
Take fragility first. The return to a semblance of normality could be fleeting. Areas which had apparently controlled the spread of the virus, including Singapore and northern Japan, have imposed or reimposed tough restrictions in response to a rise in the growth rate of new infections. If countries which retain relatively tough social-distancing rules do better at staving off a viral comeback, other countries may feel a need to follow them (see Chaguan). With rules in flux, it will feel hard to plan weeks ahead, let alone months.
Can’t start a fire
The behaviour of the economy will be far less predictable. No one really knows for how long firms facing zero revenues, or households who are working reduced hours or not at all, will be able to survive financially. Businesses can keep going temporarily, either by burning cash or by tapping grants and credit lines set up by government—but these are unlimited neither in size nor duration. What is more, a merely illiquid firm can quickly become a truly insolvent one as its earnings stagnate while its debt commitments expand. A rise in corporate and personal bankruptcies, long after the apparently acute phase of the pandemic, seems likely, though governments are trying to forestall them. In the past fortnight bankruptcies in China started to rise relative to last year. On April 28th HSBC, one of the world’s largest banks, reported worse-than-expected results, in part because of higher credit losses.
Furthermore, the pandemic has upended norms and conventions about how economic agents behave. In Britain the share of commercial tenants who paid their rent on time fell from 90% to 60% in the first quarter of this year. A growing number of American renters are no longer paying their landlords. Other creditors are being put off, too. In America, close to 40% of business-to-business payments from firms in the spectator-sports and film industries were late in March, double the rate a year ago. Enforcing contracts has become more difficult with many courts closed and social interactions at a standstill. This is perhaps the most insidious means by which weak sectors of the economy will infect otherwise moderately healthy ones. 
In an environment of uncertain property rights and unknowable income streams, potential investment projects are not just risky—they are impossible to price. A recent paper by Scott Baker of Northwestern University and colleagues suggests that economic uncertainty is at an all-time high. That may go some way to explaining the results of a weekly survey from Moody’s Analytics, a research firm, which finds that businesses’ investment intentions are substantially lower even than during the financial crisis of 2007-09. An index which measures American nonresidential construction activity 9-12 months ahead has also hit new lows.
The collapse in investment points to the second trait of the 90% economy: that it will be less innovative. The development of liberal capitalism over the past three centuries went hand in hand with a growth in the number of people exchanging ideas in public or quasi-public spaces. Access to the coffeehouse, the salon or the street protest was always a partial process, favouring some people over others. But a vibrant public sphere fosters creativity.
Innovation is not impossible in a world with less social contact. There is more than one company founded in a garage now worth $1trn. During lockdowns, companies have had to innovate quickly—just look at how many firms have turned their hand to making ventilators, if with mixed success. A handful of firms claim that working from home is so productive that their offices will stay closed for good. 
Yet these productivity bonuses look likely to be heavily outweighed by drawbacks. Studies suggest the benefits of working from home only materialise if employees can frequently check in at an office in order to solve problems. Planning new projects is especially difficult. Anyone who has tried to bounce ideas around on Zoom or Skype knows that spontaneity is hard. People are often using bad equipment with poor connections. Nick Bloom of Stanford University, one of the few economists to have studied working from home closely, reckons that there will be a sharp decline in patent applications in 2021.
Cities have proven particularly fertile ground for innovations which drive long-run growth. If Geoffrey West, a physicist who studies complex systems, is right to suggest that doubling a city’s population leads to all concerned becoming on aggregate 15% richer, then the emptying-out of urban areas is bad news. MoveBuddha, a relocation website, says that searches for places in New York City’s suburbs are up almost 250% compared with this time last year. A paper from New York University suggests that richer, and thus presumably more educated, New Yorkers—people from whom a disproportionate share of ideas may flow—are particularly likely to have left during the epidemic.
Something happening somewhere
Wherever or however people end up working, the experience of living in a pandemic is not conducive to creative thought. How many people entered lockdown with a determination to immerse themselves in Proust or George Eliot, only to find themselves slumped in front of “Tiger King”? When mental capacity is taken up by worries about whether or not to touch that door handle or whether or not to believe the results of the latest study on the virus, focusing is difficult. Women are more likely to take care of home-schooling and entertainment of bored children (see article), meaning their careers suffer more than men’s. Already, research by Tatyana Deryugina, Olga Shurchkov and Jenna Stearns, three economists, finds that the productivity of female economists, as measured by production of research papers, has fallen relative to male ones since the pandemic began.

The growing gender divide in productivity points to the final big problem with the 90% economy: that it is unfair. Liberally regulated economies operating at full capacity tend to have unemployment rates of 4-5%, in part because there will always be people temporarily unemployed as they move from one job to another. The new normal will have higher joblessness. This is not just because GDP will be lower; the decline in output will be particularly concentrated in labour-intensive industries such as leisure and hospitality, reducing employment disproportionately. America’s current unemployment rate, real-time data suggest, is between 15-20%.
The lost jobs tended to pay badly, and were more likely to be performed by the young, women and immigrants. Research by Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University and colleagues finds that an American who normally earns less than $20,000 a year is twice as likely to have lost their job due to the pandemic as one earning $80,000-plus. Many of those unlucky people do not have the skills, nor the technology, that would enable them to work from home or to retrain for other jobs. 
The longer the 90% economy endures, the more such inequalities will deepen. People who already enjoy strong professional networks—largely, those of middle age and higher—may actually quite enjoy the experience of working from home. Notwithstanding the problems of bad internet and irritating children, it may be quite pleasant to chair fewer meetings or performance reviews. Junior folk, even if they make it into an office, will miss out on the expertise and guidance of their seniors. Others with poor professional networks, such as the young or recently arrived immigrants, may find it difficult or impossible to strengthen them, hindering upward mobility, points out Tyler Cowen of George Mason University.
The world economy that went into retreat in March as covid-19 threatened lives was one that looked sound and strong. And the biomedical community is currently working overtime to produce a vaccine that will allow the world to be restored to its full capacity. But estimates suggest that this will take at least another 12 months—and, as with the prospects of the global economy, that figure is highly uncertain. If the adage that it takes two months to form a habit holds, the economy that re-emerges will be fundamentally different. ■

1668,"A large fire broke out in a building on an iconic street in Central Paris this morning near the Place de L'Opera square.  
The building on 17 Boulevard des Capucines erupted into flames and sent clouds of smoke rising into the air. 
It started in an office at 10.30am, on the third floor of the seven-floor building.
The building is situated between the 2nd and 9th arrondissement of Paris and above a Bennetton store, Rossignol and a Five Guys.
The iconic opera house Palais Garnier is some 984 feet away from the building and  100 firefighters desperately worked to stop the inferno spreading. 
Crews brought the fire under control at midday and there were no reported deaths or injuries following the blaze.    
Place de L'Opera was closed along with the nearby metro station.
The cause of the fire has not yet been established.  
Firefighters were also seen dealing with the inferno on the second floor of the building.  
The fire hit the 3rd floor of the building and a little of the 4th floor and there is housing on the last two floors of the block.
Earlier, a drone was also deployed to survey the extent of the damage to the building from the air. 
According to Le Figaro , an investigation will happen to determine the cause of the fire.
Social media users took to Twitter to share videos of the ferocious blaze as it first took hold.
Pictures and videos were also circulated as firefighters began to bring the blaze under control and worked to stop it spreading.
Some shared their sadness over the fire, with one person tweeting: 'Triste triste' (sad, sad).
Others shared videos of the beginning of the fire, saying it was a 'strange morning.' 
Boulevard des Capucines is one of the 'Grands Boulevards' in Paris. 
The name comes from the convent of Capuchin nuns and the road houses some of the most iconic buildings in Paris. 
The fire comes two days after Thursday's fire at Palais Vivienne in Paris which started in the kitchens of an Asian restaurant on the ground floor.
No injuries were reported and the fire was dealt with.
The owner, Pierre--Jean Chalençon was evacuated safely from the building.",-2
1669,"Oct 21 (Reuters) - When Sebastian Kanovich co-founded Latin American digital payments startup dLocal in Montevideo in 2016, he struggled to get global retailers to take him seriously.
""It took us a lot of No's before getting the first Yes,"" he told Reuters. ""We were not only from Latin America, but from Uruguay, not known for technology.""
Five years on, it's a different story.
dLocal (DLO.O) listed on the Nasdaq exchange in New York in June and is now worth $16 billion, thanks to partnerships with the likes of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Uber (UBER.N) in 30 countries, and other Latino tech firms are riding the wave.
In the first nine months of 2021, Latino startups from Brazil's online lender Nubank to Colombian delivery firm Rappi raised $14.8 billion in new money, a jump of 174% since last year, data provided to Reuters by CBInsights showed.
The Latino boom has caught the eye of some of the biggest names in private equity and venture capital such as SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. Now Wall Street's banks are looking to tap into the gold rush by taking more Latino ""unicorns"" public in the United States.
At least 10 Latin American tech startups including Brazil's apartment rental service QuintoAndar as well as Mexico's used-car dealer Kavak and fintechs Clip and Creditas are preparing initial public offerings (IPOs) for next year, six people with knowledge of the deals told Reuters.
All the sources requested anonymity as the discussions about the planned listings are confidential.
Kavak, QuintoAndar and Clip declined to comment. Creditas said it could not share any information about an IPO at this time.
Nubank, which counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) as an investor, is aiming for a valuation above $55 billion in a U.S. IPO next year to become the region's most valuable financial institution, Reuters reported in August.
GLOBAL ASPIRATIONS
The rise of Latin American unicorns - private firms worth at least $1 billion - is being driven by a once-in-a-generation internet boom that has accelerated under pandemic lockdowns as more shoppers move online, bankers and deals lawyers say.
""Companies in the region have matured in the last five years and now we think there will likely be between two and three IPOs by Latam tech companies per quarter by next year,"" said Rodrigo Maldonado, executive director at Morgan Stanley in Brazil, referring to U.S. listings.
While Latin America still lags Asia, Europe and the United States in terms of volumes of tech startups, the widespread and increasing use of smartphones, wireless networks and payments cards has created a ready demand for new digital services.
Smartphone-savvy consumers in the region have become increasingly comfortable with digital wallets and even starting to make virtual doctor appointments with smartphone apps.
That's why venture capitalists are still minting tech unicorns in Latin America, and some more established startups are pushing ahead with U.S. listing plans despite the recent market sell-off that hit technology stocks.
""If you look at the pipeline from Latam now, it is pretty amazing what could come from the region - not only from Brazil, but also from countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Peru,"" said Alex Ibrahim, head of International Capital Markets at the New York Stock Exchange.
""And a number of those high-growth startups from those countries are betting on big global markets like the United States,"" he said.
Many stock markets in Latin America are dominated by more traditional companies such as banks and commodities players, which is pushing startups to look north for listings. Tech firms account for less than 10% of Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index, for example, whereas they make up nearly a third of the S&P 500.
Gone are the days, though, when Latino startups were seen as a cheaper entry point for investors than U.S. ones. Most financing is now at valuations on a par with Silicon Valley rivals, investment bankers and venture capitalists told Reuters.
""I see multiples for startups in Brazil and Mexico as very similar to those elsewhere, (especially) if the company has global growth aspirations,"" said Martin Escobari, co-president at U.S. growth investor General Atlantic, which has a dozen Latin American startups in its portfolio.
There are still challenges for tech companies to overcome in the region, including a paucity of engineering talent.
General Atlantic estimates Latin America's universities train 40,000 software developers a year, far below the 100,000 it estimates the fast-growing tech sector needs annually.
Other factors such political and economic instability are also making investors more cautious when looking for businesses they believe will be resilient.
The region has a history of going from boom to bust too, such as in 2014-15 when a number of large investors pulled back following an economic downturn that doomed the prospects of several fledgling tech ventures.
But deep-pocketed investors, such as SoftBank and Sequoia, are betting this time is different, and are poised to rake in big returns from some early bets. Eye-popping gains are, in turn, inspiring a new generation of tech founders and investors.
""Tech companies first emerged in the region roughly 20 years ago, but only now all the building blocks are in place: infrastructure, entrepreneurs, venture capital investors and capital markets,"" said General Atlantic's Escobari.
FINTECH FAVORED
Startups focused on financial technology, or fintech, are mopping up much of the funding with a 40% share of the overall pot in 2020, according to LAVCA, the association for private equity in Latin America.
Many of them sell financial services to the ""unbanked"", or those unable to access traditional banking, and Brazil's Nubank, C6Bank, which is backed by JPMorgan (JPM.N), and SoftBank's Creditas have benefited most from the investor interest.
With fintech in vogue, non-financial startups such as Kavak and QuintoAndar have started offering financial services to consumers including car loans and insurance.
Sequoia has only made a half dozen Latin American investments - including Nubank and Rappi - but Sonya Huang, a partner at the venture capital firm, said it planned to back one or two companies a year, in sectors such as finance, e-commerce, health and education.
""The region is very different from the U.S. or Europe, but there are some big theses which have proved right globally - like digital or mobile-first banking - and they can be applied in the region,"" Huang told Reuters.
Japan's SoftBank renewed its bets on Latin America with a $3 billion fund last month, less than three years after launching its first regional fund. Since 2019, it has invested in roughly 50 Latino startups, said Alex Szapiro, SoftBank's head of Brazil and operating partner.
""Now, capital is basically a commodity for the region.""

1670,"Andrew Marr today revealed he was leaving the BBC after 21 years, including 16 years fronting his Sunday morning political programme - and will join LBC and Classic FM.
The 62-year-old said he was 'keen to get my own voice back' and would now focus on presenting political and cultural radio shows and writing for newspapers.
Father-of-three Marr, who is married to fellow political journalist Jackie Ashley, 67, and earns up to £339,999 a year at the BBC, added that leaving to join LBC's owners Global would give him 'a new freedom' to do journalism with 'no filter'. 
MailOnline understands that Global will be paying Marr at least £500,000 a year for his new role, although the Leicester Square-based network refused to confirm this. 
Industry experts said LBC would be a 'great home for Andrew as he won't have to abide by the BBC's strict impartiality rules'. It comes after Marr hinted in May that he may be leaving the BBC because of 'not being able to speak in your own voice'.
The Glasgow-born veteran broadcaster joined the BBC in May 2000 as political editor and later spent 16 years at the helm of his own Sunday morning show. 
Global said Marr will be presenting new shows on LBC and Classic FM, a new weekly podcast on Global Player, and will also write a regular column for LBC's website. 
His exit comes as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg is said to be in discussions about leaving her role to become a presenter on Radio 4's Today programme.
Jon Sopel is the 6/4 favourite to replace her, with previous political editors such as Marr and Nick Robinson having moved on to other presenting jobs at the BBC.
This week Sarah Smith was made the BBC's new North America editor, taking over from Sopel, and Marr's departure suggests the staffing movements could continue. 
Marr tweeted today: 'Personal announcement. After 21 years, I have decided to move on from the BBC. l leave behind many happy memories and wonderful colleagues. 
'But from the New Year I am moving to Global to write and present political and cultural shows, and to write for newspapers.
'I think British politics and public life are going to go through an even more turbulent decade, and as I've said, I am keen to get my own voice back.
Andrew William Stevenson Marr was born in Glasgow in 1959 and was privately educated in Scotland before gaining a first-class English degree at Cambridge University.
His media career began in 1981 when he joined The Scotsman as a trainee reporter, and in 1984 he moved to London where he worked as a parliamentary correspondent for the newspaper, before becoming a political correspondent.
He joined The Independent in 1986 as a member of the new newspaper's launch staff before leaving for The Economist, where he ultimately became its political editor.
Marr returned to The Independent as the newspaper's political editor in 1992, and became its editor in 1996, where he oversaw radical changes in its format in a bid to halt a decline in readership figures.
He left in early 1998, with some reports suggesting he was sacked, and took roles at different papers before arriving at the BBC as political editor in May 2000. It was a position he held until 2005 when he began presenting The Andrew Marr Show which has become the most important political television show of the week.
He also presents Radio 4's Start the Week and has written more than a dozen books, including the History of Modern Britain.
Marr is married to political journalist Jackie Ashley, 67, with whom he has a son and two daughters – and he also has a love of painting.
In 2008 he took out a super-injunction to suppress reports of a relationship with a fellow journalist five years earlier.
At the time, he believed he had fathered a child with the woman. He also made maintenance payments – until he discovered through a DNA test that he was not the girl's father.
The affair, which ended in 2003, was common knowledge at Westminster and within the BBC, but the injunction banned publication of his name in connection with the story.
Marr later admitted he was 'embarrassed' about resorting to legal action, saying: 'I did not come into journalism to go around gagging journalists.'
Then in 2012 he was photographed putting his hand down the trousers of an unnamed female colleague during an intimate late-night clinch in a Soho back alley.
After the pictures emerged, he said: 'I am really embarrassed and so annoyed with myself. It was just a goodbye clinch. It had been a long drunken evening and it was just a silly thing.'
The veteran broadcaster, who lives in Primrose Hill, North London, has suffered a number of health scares over the past decade.
Marr was taken to hospital in January 2013 after suffering the stroke at home but returned to host his show later that year. In 2018, he declared 'it's good to be back' after undergoing an operation to have a cancerous tumour removed from his kidney.
In June he contracted Covid despite being double vaccinated and felt 'seriously ill' but had fully recovered by the end of his quarantine period.
'I have been doing the Andrew Marr show every Sunday morning for 16 years now and that is probably more than enough time for anybody!'
In a statement released by Global, Marr added: 'Coming to Global gives me a new freedom - to do fast-paced, very regular political journalism on LBC with no filter, in entirely my own voice. 
'On Classic FM, I'll be exploring my love of classical music, and culture generally, with some surprising guests. I feel I'm joining a young, hungrily ambitious and exciting company and I can't wait to get stuck in.' 
Marr received an annual salary from the BBC of up to £339,999 in the 2020/2021 year for his work on The Andrew Marr Show, Radio 4's Start the Week, documentaries for BBC One and election night.
This was down from a salary of up to £364,999 in 2019/2020, and up to £394,999 in 2018/2019.
Addressing Andrew Marr's departure from the BBC, its director-general Tim Davie said in a statement: 'Andrew Marr has been a brilliant journalist and presenter during his time at the BBC.
'He leaves an unmatched legacy of outstanding political interviews and landmark programmes. We wish him well for the next chapter.'
Other BBC colleagues including Newsnight policy editor Lewis Goodall were among those congratulating Marr on his lengthy career at the corporation.
Goodall wrote: 'What a huge loss to the BBC Andrew but what an incredible contribution over so long. Best of luck with the new gig.'
And Fran Unsworth, the BBC's outgoing director of news and current affairs, said: 'Throughout his long and distinguished career at the BBC, Andrew has been a firm favourite with our audiences.
'Andrew started at the BBC as a knowledgeable and insightful political editor and went on to become a feature of the UK's Sunday mornings, on Sunday AM, which became the Andrew Marr Show. He is a fantastic presenter and interviewer, whose wisdom and skill will be a loss to our screens.
'We thank him greatly for his years of service and wish him the best of luck in his new role.'
Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid added: 'Congratulations on the new role but this is a huge blow for the BBC and for those of us who rely on The Andrew Marr Show to set us up for the week ahead. Wishing the very best, to the best.' 
Sky News political editor Beth Rigby said: 'Sunday mornings won’t be the same without you on my telly. But very best of luck in your next chapter.' 
And his new LBC colleague Eddie Mair joked: 'It turns out that three years ago Global wanted to hire Marr but because of a typo they got me by mistake.' 
Global said his new 'opinion-led programme' on LBC will be 'fully visualized' on Global Player and he will 'give his view on the biggest issues of the moment, along with agenda-setting guests'.
The company said he was joining Britain's biggest commercial news talk station which has posted its highest ever listening figures, with more than three million people now tuning in across the UK each week. 
Radio industry consultant Paul Chantler told MailOnline today: 'Andrew Marr is a major signing for Global and will further enhance respect and credibility for LBC in particular. 
'LBC is going from strength to strength and now has a stellar lineup of presenters. It's a great home for Andrew as he won't have to abide by the BBC's strict impartiality rules. 
'At LBC, he will be allowed to express his own opinions and undertake interviews with attitude as impartiality is achieved across the output as a whole not just within a single programme. LBC will certainly allow him to find his own voice again.' 
Marr will also present a new programme on Classic FM, playing music and interviewing guests from the world of politics and arts. 
Andrew Marr's Sunday morning programme on BBC One has been appointment television for those in the Westminster bubble, as well as its keen observers. His departure from the corporation leaves a vacancy in one of the most high profile jobs in political journalism. Here are some of the contenders to replace him:
Laura Kuenssberg
The BBC's political editor is likely to be among the frontrunners for the job.
It was previously reported Kuenssberg is negotiating stepping away from her role of the past six years to join the Today programme as part of a major reshuffle of the BBC's on-air staff.
Zeinab Badawi
The presenter of BBC Global Questions and HardTalk has hosted Marr's show before so would be a familiar face to his regular viewers. She is bookmaker Coral's favourite to take over, with odds of 2-1.
Emily Maitlis
The presenter of Newsnight has won acclaim for her high profile interviews with the Duke of York, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton and would be a sparring partner to be reckoned with when sitting down with political leaders.
Andrew Neil
It has been mooted that the former long-time BBC presenter could return to the fold after he stepped down from his roles as the chairman and host of a prime-time show on GB News.
Neil has since said it was a 'huge mistake' for him to become the face of the fledgling channel and hinted he is keen for another job in TV, saying: 'I don't want GB News to be the full stop in my broadcasting career.
Nick Robinson
The former BBC political editor, who has filled in for Marr before, is currently a presenter of both BBC Radio 4's flagship Today programme and Political Thinking.
Clive Myrie
A regular presenter of BBC News At Six and Ten since 2010, the broadcaster has previously worked as the broadcaster's correspondent in Asia, Africa, Washington, Paris and Brussels.
Earlier this year he replaced John Humphrys as the host of Mastermind, when the veteran journalist stepped down after 18 years in the role.
Victoria Derbyshire
The award-winning broadcaster has presented some of the BBC's biggest programmes, including Newsnight and Panorama, and fronted her own current affairs show.
When plans to axe her self-titled BBC Two programme were leaked, the host said she was 'absolutely devastated'.
She was introduced to a whole new audience when she competed on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! last year.
Amol Rajan
The BBC's media editor is a presenter of the prestigious Today programme on Radio 4, as well as Start The Week.
He is also a restaurant critic and makes regular appearances on television as a guest on the judging panel of MasterChef.
Sophie Raworth
The BBC newsreader, who has also covered for Marr in the past, is one of the main presenters of the BBC News At Six and Ten. She has also presented election night coverage, as well as Watchdog, Crimewatch and coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show.
In May, Marr was interviewed at Aye Write, Glasgow's book festival, and was asked whether he ever felt 'a desperate urge to come out of the closet' over his political views, replying: 'Yes, absolutely.'
The Times reported at the time that Marr refused to say anything else about his personal political views, saying: 'I cannot tell you now because I will lose my job.' 
Marr added: 'There are many privileges of working at the BBC, including the size of the audience and all of that, but the biggest single frustration by far is losing your own voice, not being able to speak in your own voice.
'What I could say safely is that I think we are going to go through a period of politics — the next ten or 20 years — much more turbulent and much more interesting and testing and challenging then anything we have seen in the last ten years, which have been big enough. 
'I think it will be very, very hard for people like me to carry on being completely neutral and completely sotto voce all the way through that. At some point, I want to get out and use my own voice again.'
Ashley Tabor-King, founder and executive president of Global, said: 'Andrew is one of the finest and most respected broadcasters and journalists of our time and we are honored to welcome him to the Global family, especially at a moment when we are celebrating record audience figures.
'LBC now takes its next step. Andrew Marr will be an unmissable moment in the schedule and we are excited that he will be part of LBC and Classic FM's incredible presenter line-up.'  
Marr will join a host of other presenters at LBC including Nick Ferrari, James O'Brien, Eddie Mair, Shelagh Fogarty, Iain Dale, David Lammy, Camilla Tominey and Matt Frei.
He will also join the likes Alexander Armstrong, Moira Stuart, John Suchet, Myleene Klass, Margherita Taylor, Bill Turnbull, Alan Titchmarsh, John Humphrys and Charlotte Hawkins at Classic FM. 
James Rea, director of broadcasting and content at Global, said: 'It is fantastic to welcome a broadcaster of Andrew's calibre to Global. 
'We are looking forward to him bringing his sharp, political insight to LBC at such an exciting time for the station and his passion for classical music and the arts to Classic FM. I know that our audience will enjoy listening and interacting with him from next year.'
Marr has hosted the BBC's flagship political programme, The Andrew Marr Show, for the past 16 years and regularly presents on BBC Radio 4.
He is also a documentary-maker and author, having written more than a dozen books.
It comes just nine days after veteran broadcaster Adam Boulton, who is the same age at 62, said he would leave Sky News following more than 30 years after saying that there is a 'move against the Baby Boomers' in the TV world.
Having joined the channel as political editor for its launch in 1989, the 62-year-old public school-educated Oxford graduate has served as editor-at-large since 2014.
Mr Boulton's departure was said to have been a mutual decision, although he said in an exit interview that television was now 'very sensitive to the idea of diversity'.
Speaking about his fellow veteran Sky broadcasters Dermot Murnaghan, 63, and Kay Burley, 60, Mr Boulton told The Times: 'We've had our day.' 
The announcement of his departure came after John Ryley, the head of Sky News, said TV was moving away from the era of the 'all-powerful anchor'.
And it was announced just seven months after his fellow veteran broadcaster Jon Snow said he would leave Channel 4 News at the end of this year.
The 73-year-old, who has spent 32 years as the show's anchor, said he felt it was 'time to move on'. However, he will continue to front future 'longer-form projects' for Channel 4.
Earlier this week Sarah Smith was appointed as the BBC's new North America editor.
The 52-year-old, who became the broadcaster's first ever Scotland editor in 2014, takes over from Jon Sopel who left the post last month after seven years.
Prior to this, she was based in the US working for Channel 4 and helped cover big American news stories such as the 2008 presidential election and the global financial crash.
Smith is also a regular host on BBC programmes including the Today programme and Newsnight. She began her journalistic career as a trainee at BBC Scotland.
Her father was former Labour leader John Smith, who served as party leader from July 1992 until his death from a heart attack in May 1994. 
The Archbishop of York cut up his dog collar during The Andrew Marr Show in December 2007 in protest over Robert Mugabe's rule of Zimbabwe.
Dr John Sentamu said he would refuse to wear the Anglican symbol of office until Mugabe was no longer in power.
His demonstration followed Mugabe's controversial presence at the EU summit with African leaders in Lisbon
The archbishop criticised African leaders who rallied round Mugabe and defended him as a freedom fighter who liberated his country from white rule.
Speaking on Marr's programme, Dr Sentamu took off his dog collar, saying: 'As an Anglican this is what I wear to identify myself, that I'm a clergyman.'
He then took out a pair of scissors before snipping away at the dog collar, adding: 'Do you know what Mugabe has done? 
'He has taken people's identity and literally, if you don't mind, cut it to pieces.
'So, as far as I am concerned, from now on I am not going to wear a dog collar until Mugabe is gone.'
In November 2017, he put the dog collar back on, again on The Andrew Marr Show, after Mr Mugabe left office following 37 years of authoritarian rule.
David Cameron was told to 'shut up' by broadcaster Andrew Marr while appearing on his BBC programme in April 2014.
As the show drew to a close, the then-prime minister tried to speak about the schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria by the Boko Haram Islamist group.
But footage published online shows Marr appearing to say: 'I, I…Prime Minister shut up I'm afraid. I'm really, really sorry, we have run out of time.'
However, Mr Cameron did not appear to be angered by the interruption and quickly replied to Marr: 'I've gone on, sorry.'
Andrew Marr faced criticism for his interview with Boris Johnson in October last year, which led to the BBC having to defend him as 'duly impartial'.
The interview, which was said to have left 10 Downing Street furious, saw him interrupt the Prime Minister and claimed he was not telling the truth about wage growth in Britain.
Mr Johnson argued during the programme: 'After more than 10 years of flatlining, what you're seeing is people with low incomes being paid more.'
But Mr Marr retorted: 'You've said something that isn't true, I'm afraid. The Office of National Statistics (ONS), your own body, says that wages are not keeping pace with inflation. So, in real terms, over the last three months, wages have gone down, not up.'
LBC radio presenter Iain Dale later praised Marr as an impartial interrogator, but Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she would 'argue otherwise'.
In a response to viewer complaints, the BBC said: 'There were many issues covered in the interview with the prime minister, such as violence against women, the HGV driver shortage and the national insurance tax rise, and so it was imperative for Mr Marr to keep the conversation on track in order to have time for them all. Sometimes Mr Marr repeated his question to press the prime minister into giving a clear answer for the audience.
'Mr Johnson is no stranger to robust and challenging interviews and we consider it is appropriate to hold the leader of the nation to account on different issues. However, we're satisfied that Mr Marr questioned Mr Johnson in a fair, duly impartial and professional manner.'",-2
1671,"WITH FRIENDS like these, who needs enemies? Another family row has broken out between Germany’s sister conservative parties—the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and its bigger sibling, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The pair choose a joint candidate for chancellor, and in April Armin Laschet, the CDU’s leader (pictured, right), got the nod over the more popular Markus Söder, head of the CSU (on the left). The parties were supposed to unite behind Mr Laschet, but after months of barely disguised sulking, the CSU is now making it clear that they find him as impressive as a soggy Weisswurst. On September 8th, asked by a journalist if Mr Laschet was Germany’s next chancellor, Mr Söder grimaced and responded with a sarky “Klar!” (“Sure”). A day later Markus Blume, the CSU’s secretary-general, told Der Spiegel that the CDU/CSU would “of course” be doing better had they opted for his boss. (File that under “true, but unhelpful.”) Expect grimaces all round when Mr Laschet appears at the CSU’s pre-election congress in Nuremberg on September 11th.
__________
Meanwhile the CDU’s miseries have only deepened. Its panicked campaign to spook voters into believing that Olaf Scholz, the popular Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor-candidate, will invite the hard leftists of Die Linke into government has utterly failed to shift the polling needle. Yet it is doubling down. Even Angela Merkel, who had been doing her best to remain aloof from the campaign fray, was sucked in this week. At what was probably her last appearance before parliament she warned that a vote for Mr Scholz—who has served as her vice-chancellor since 2018—risked undermining Germany’s much-prized “moderation”. “I’m only telling the truth!” the chancellor exclaimed, as Die Linke MPs booed. (Commentators dismayed by Mrs Merkel’s rare foray into partisanship seemed surprised to learn that Germany’s monarchical chancellor remains a party politician.) There is still a fortnight to go, and the polls may be wrong. But for now, the CDU’s campaign is looking like a case study in some future political strategists’ textbook on how to lose elections.
__________
Not that it has been plain sailing for the SPD. In Hamburg, Mr Scholz’s home town, an SPD member of the city-state’s government earned himself lasting ignominy (and his own derisive #PimmelGate hashtag) by ordering six police to search the house of “ZooStPauli”, a hapless Twitter user who had called him a “dick”. The following day saw a raid of a rather more serious nature, when prosecutors swooped on Mr Scholz’s finance ministry, as well as the justice ministry, as part of an anti-money laundering probe. The Financial Intelligence Unit, part of the finance ministry, stands accused of failing to act on banks’ warnings about questionable transactions. Mr Scholz criticised the decision to raid his ministry, saying officials should have put questions in writing.

Size is starting to matter in the Bundestag. Although Germany’s mixed electoral system preserves proportionality, it throws up perverse outcomes when the vote fragments. The last election produced 709 MPs, well over the legal minimum of 598, putting pressure on office space and lifting the parliament’s annual running costs to over €1bn ($1.2bn). This time, reckons the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Bundestag could swell to over 900 members. Only China’s rubber-stamp congress is bigger. Attempts to tweak Germany’s electoral law have so far foundered on this or that party’s objections. Those who want to throw the scoundrels out may be dismayed to see how many of them are coming in.

Although the Delta variant has lifted Germany’s covid-19 incidence rate to its highest level since May, the pandemic has largely taken a back seat in the campaign. That is not to everyone’s taste. Lothar Wieler, head of the federal disease-control agency, warned this week that hospitals could become overburdened if the vaccination rate did not pick up. Almost all the new hospitalisations are among the unvaccinated, but Germany has a lot of them: only 62% of adults are double-jabbed, and the vaccination rate has tailed off at a lower level than in comparable countries (see below). France solved this problem by making life extremely difficult for the unjabbed. A country in the middle of a tricky election campaign is unlikely to follow suit.",2
1672,"Until last night, the most nauseous I've felt in my life was after eating a vegan sausage roll live on air, a reckless decision that prompted me to instantly hurl into a large bucket.
But that sickening ordeal paled into vomit-inducing insignificance compared to the comically cringe-worthy collision between the world's two most narcissistic, fake and irritating female celebrities, Meghan Markle and Ellen DeGeneres.
Watching them giggle and preen away during their lengthy cheese-fest, stroking each other's egos and dishing out cash to charity, you'd think they are the kindest, sweetest human beings to ever bestride the globe.
But it's worth reminding ourselves that they both stand accused of being nasty little bullies who, when the cameras aren't around, terrorize their staff.
Unsurprisingly, bullying in the workplace didn't come up as a topic of discussion last night.
Nor did Princess Pinocchio's trashing of the Royal Family and Monarchy, the institutions she professes to detest but milks like a greedy dairy farmer.
Or her treatment of her own family, almost all of whom she's disowned for threatening her relentless climb up the social and financial ladder.
Instead, viewers were treated to a repulsive exchange of faux-humble shmaltz designed to flog copies of Ms. Markle's critically derided, poor-selling children's book The Bench.
To help do so, she released new photographs of her son Archie feeding chickens at her $14.7 million mansion in Santa Barbara and talked about her daughter Lilibet's teething problems.
All of which may come as a surprise to those who'd been conned into thinking Meghan quit Britain, dragging her husband with her, because she craved privacy for her family from the beastly British press.
It turned out she didn't want privacy at all, she just wanted to get away from anyone that might take a negative view of her constant whining and rank hypocrisy.
And of course, she wanted to get away from having to perform the often arduous and unexciting royal duties that go with having a title like the Duchess of Sussex.
Now Meghan has the best of all worlds: she gets to exploit her fancy royal name to make hundreds of millions of dollars, doesn't have to do any work for the institution that bestowed it upon her, is free (in her head) to publicly abuse the royals as a bunch of heartless racists, and can live the life of a fabulously rich celebrity who pops up on TV chat show sofas to promote her brand.
But at what cost does all this come for the Royal Family that she renounced at the same venomous speed she renounced her own father when he didn't toe the line?
The worst thing about her Ellen appearance wasn't even the fact she was going on the show at all given her friend and neighbor's show has been cancelled in the wake of the awful bullying allegations against the host and some of her executives.
That was bad, but then Ellen's no more a real 'friend' of Meghan's than Oprah Winfrey. She's just another famous person with the tools, currently, to inflate the Sussex celebrity brand.
No, the worst thing came when Ellen made Meghan literally dance for her book-plugging supper by taking part in one of the most embarrassing stunts I've ever seen a royal do on television.
The 'Duchess of Sussex', as she so proudly calls herself at every opportunity, pulled a prank on a trio of street vendors, carrying out a series of orders from Ellen via a secret microphone in her ear.
Meghan touched her elbow, and her nose, performed a squat, held a large crystal to her head as she moaned and groaned, and bounced up and down with excitement at seeing a hot sauce for sale as she exclaimed: 'Let mommy have a taste! My boo loves hot sauce!'
She then chomped a sauce-coated chip 'like a chipmunk' because Ellen instructed her to, before telling the salesman: 'That's not spicy! Let me try something real hot, mommy wants some heat! Let's get the spiciest, let's get the hottest!'
Ordered by smirking Ellen to shove another chip whole into her mouth, Meghan did so, and began furiously fanning her face while exclaiming: 'Lordy, lordy, lordy!'
Then she burst into singing 'I'm feeling hot, hot, hot!' as she danced around.
Just when I thought things couldn't possibly get any more toe-curling, she shouted: 'Mommy needs some milk!' before pulling out a baby bottle from her purse and guzzling down the milk.
The humiliating farce ended with Meghan asking another female vendor if she would like to hear a joke.
'Why did the elephant put his trunk in the cookie jar?' she said, then stayed silent and refused to reveal the punchline before bursting out laughing and saying to the bemused vendor: 'It's funny, isn't it?'
Well, no, it wasn't.
None of this was remotely funny.
It was all just incredibly, soul-suckingly excruciating.
In the final scene, Meghan put on a pair of kitten ears and burst into song again, prancing around in her ears as she wailed: 'I'm a kitten, mew mew mew.'
By this point I needed my sick bucket to go ew, ew, ew.
Honestly, it all made me genuinely want to puke.
This is a senior member of the British Royal Family whose husband Prince Harry is sixth in line to the throne, behaving like a gormless desperate reality TV starlet.
Royals don't do this kind of thing for a very good reason.
The public expects them to behave in a regal manner, that is the mystique that preserves the Monarchy.
It may seem anachronistic to many Americans, but it works. The Royals bring in billions of pounds in tourism money to the UK and the Queen remains the world's most revered head of state.
Take away the mystique and the very future of the Monarchy itself may be imperiled, especially given that Her Majesty, now 95, has been in recent worryingly poor health.
That's why what Meghan Markle and Harry get up to carries significance and cannot be dismissed as inconsequential.
So long as they're still the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, their behavior directly impacts on the reputation of the Royal Family.
And just as Prince Andrew's - far more serious - behavior in refusing to be interviewed by the FBI about his relationship with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein is causing huge damage to that reputation, so Meghan and Harry's constant self-publicizing, royal-bashing antics are, in a very different way, doing consistent damage too.
Last night's Ellen debacle exposed Meghan Markle's desire to be a jobbing C-list reality TV celebrity, not a jobbing A-list royal.
But even a Kardashian would have deemed that street vendor stunt beneath them and brand-damaging.
That's how puerile and embarrassing it was.
For a British royal to demean herself in such a way is completely unacceptable.
Not just because it made Meghan Markle look ridiculous, but because it made the British Monarchy look ridiculous.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the Queen must strip the Duke and Duchess of Sussex of their royal titles before their brazen, craven, money-grabbing campaign to fleece their duty-free royal status destroys everything she has worked so hard to maintain.",-2
1673,"APAPER PUBLISHED by three economists in early 2015 came to a hard-nosed conclusion. It looked at what had caused a surge in employment in America over the previous year. The jobs boom coincided with a cold-hearted Republican reform to make unemployment benefits less generous. The authors demonstrated, convincingly, that the one had caused the other, with the benefit cut leading to the creation of 1.8m extra jobs in 2014—about two-thirds of the total.
The notion that lavish welfare benefits discourage work, so that cutting them makes people look harder for a job, is widely accepted not just by economists but by most politicians and voters. Nobody nowadays wins election by promising to lavish the unemployed with public funds. So it is surprising to find that the country with the world’s most generous offer to the out-of-work also has one of its best-functioning labour markets. 

Danish benefits are worth more than 80% of previous earnings after six months out of work, compared with 60% across the rich world and less than 50% in Britain (America is even stingier). For Danish parents who lose their jobs, replacement rates can approach 100%.

The generosity of Denmark’s unemployment system is the flipside of its liberal regulation of employment contracts—a combination called “flexicurity”. Danish employers can hire and fire workers pretty much as they please. Jobs therefore come and go, but people’s incomes are stable. Yet the state’s munificence has not produced a class of feckless drifters. Denmark’s unemployment rate is lower than the rich-world average and its working-age employment rate is higher. Long-term unemployment is low. When Danish people lose a job, they find a new one faster than almost anyone else in the world, according to the OECD. 
That is because Denmark makes it hard for people to live off welfare. Recipients must submit a CV to a coach within two weeks of becoming unemployed. They can be struck off for not trying hard enough to search for work or to keep up with adult-education programmes. As a share of GDP Denmark spends four times as much as the average OECD country, and more than any single one, on “active labour-market policies” to make people more employable. 
This offers a tough lesson for those arguing for more generous welfare states. Simply boosting benefits may dissuade employment, as it did in America before 2014. To stop this happening requires massive investment in training, monitoring and enforcement of the rules for those out of work—spending money to avoid wasting it, in other words. The world’s best welfare system does not come cheap.

1674,"WHEN INDIA set off a nuclear bomb in the desert of Rajasthan in 1974, describing it implausibly as a “peaceful nuclear explosion”, a young Pakistani metallurgist in the Netherlands was ready to volunteer his services to his own country. A few months later, Abdul Qadeer Khan was sitting down with the prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and explaining the possibilities of spinning uranium in centrifuges to make it usable in bombs. The “man makes sense”, noted Bhutto. Within a decade, Pakistan had the ability to build and test a nuclear bomb; in 1998 it did so, following a series of Indian tests.
In later years Mr Khan and his acolytes would cast this moment as if it were Albert Einstein writing to Roosevelt, revealing the secrets of the atom. “A country which could not make sewing needles, good bicycles or even ordinary durable metalled roads was embarking on one of the latest and most difficult technologies,” Mr Khan recalled. In fact Pakistan, humiliated and dismembered by India in the war over Bangladesh in 1971, had begun pursuing nuclear weapons long before.

But Mr Khan’s knack for self-promotion was such that it was he—and not Munir Ahmad Khan, a rival nuclear physicist—who got much of the glory. After AQ Khan’s death on October 10th, at the age of 85, Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister (the three were unrelated, though all of Pushtun origin), declared him a “national icon”. He was buried with full honours.
For Western spies, though, Mr Khan’s sin was not so much vainglory as entrepreneurship. He had been under surveillance for years when he left the Netherlands in 1975 with stolen blueprints for centrifuges and details of the companies that supplied their components. In the years that followed, Mr Khan sold this information first to Iran and later to North Korea—which provided missile technology in return—and Libya. He sold a Chinese bomb design to Libya for tens of millions of dollars and offered it to Iraq, too. Where this money went remains unclear, though an investigation by Pakistan’s National Accountability Bureau found that Mr Khan owned several houses and had $8m in bank accounts in Pakistan, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
This black market was the biggest and most advanced network of nuclear proliferation ever built. Its full extent remains unclear to this day. Mr Khan had travelled to at least 18 countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria. The CIA believed that Osama bin Laden himself had sent envoys to Mr Khan, although these approaches were thought to have been rebuffed.
It was Mr Khan’s dealings with Libya’s dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, that were his undoing. The CIA, increasingly worried about the prospect of jihadists getting their hands on a nuke, had penetrated a Malaysian factory in Mr Khan’s network. When it sent centrifuge parts to Libya in late 2003, spies tracked the shipment and had it diverted to Italy, where the incriminating equipment was impounded. Libya came clean and its nascent nuclear programme was dismantled. In February 2004 Mr Khan appeared on Pakistani television and admitted to “unauthorised proliferation activities”. It was, he said, an “error of judgment”.
Pakistani officials professed themselves shocked that their prize scientist—the only double recipient of the Nishan-e-Imtiaz, the country’s highest civilian award—had been up to such mischief. Mr Khan, who spent years under de facto house arrest, said he took “full responsibility”. Yet the idea that he had run an international nuclear cartel for over a decade and meanwhile acquired a lavish lifestyle, all without the country’s powerful armed forces noticing, strained credulity.
In an interview in 2008, Mr Khan, in disgrace internationally but still a national hero, whose name was affixed to schools and hospitals, came close to recanting his admission of sole responsibility and hinted that he had covered for others. “I saved the country for the first time when I made Pakistan a nuclear nation,” he boasted, “and saved it again when I confessed and took the whole blame on myself.”",2
1675,"LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L) last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (BBVA.MC) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe.
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (KEY.N), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N). Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.
Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.",3
1676,"YAAMIR BADHE is looking forward to his final year as an Oxford classics student. He finds Latin and Greek texts a source of “wisdom, joy and consolation” and is dismayed by the idea that his degree course, taken by generations of grandees, might slacken its language requirements. He was among the students who objected last year when some faculty members floated the idea of dropping the compulsory study, in the original, of Homer and Virgil. The proposal was part of a discussion on how to make classics more accessible to students who did not attend high-powered schools.
Mr Badhe is no traditionalist, nor insensitive to the charge that classics come with colonial baggage. Rather, he brings a fresh perspective. As a Briton of Indian origin, his special interest is in the melding of Greek, Indian and Buddhist culture 2,300 years ago after Alexander the Great swept through what is now Afghanistan. To the sculptors and poets who engaged in that Indo-Greek fusion, the modern idea of classics being a colonial imposition would seem, Mr Badhe says, “highly bizarre”.

All this is part of a controversy that first surfaced in America. Dan-El Padilla Peralta, a black professor at Princeton University, is the best-known advocate of the view that classics as a discipline is incorrigibly tainted by racism and elitism. On British campuses, radically minded students have challenged professors to rethink the curriculum to make it more accessible, as well as free of racist and colonial overtones.
An elitist strain to the classics tradition is not hard to find. British Victorians loved the passages in Thucydides, the father of Greek history, that celebrate the role of Athens as a benign imperial power, spreading civilisation. But that is not the whole story. On British campuses in the 20th century, the most influential classicists included Eric Dodds, an Irish socialist, and Moses Finley, an American who fled his homeland as a suspected communist.
And elitism need not be the discipline’s future. From October the Institute of Classical Studies, a professional body, will be led by Katherine Harloe, a black woman with a chair at Reading University and a declared interest in exposing the distortion of classics for ideological purposes. Her expertise is in the romantic, patronising way ancient Greece was seen in 18th-century Germany. In a recent broadcast, she said that the attitudes of the British public, not just those of professors, need to change. When an educational animation portrayed a Roman family in Britain as dark-skinned, it drew protests on social media from people unaware of the archaeological evidence that Roman settlers were of many races.
In July the Cambridge classics faculty issued an elaborate plan to counter racism and elitism. It pledged to increase the share of ethnic-minority undergraduates, which was 14% in 2017-19 compared with 23% for the whole university. Selectors will be helped to “understand the impact of their decisions” on diversity. There was even a vow to modify a display of plaster-cast statues to make plain that the ancient figures depicted were not all white.
Still, the statistics suggest that if British classics have a diversity problem, it is at least as much to do with social and educational class as ethnicity. Latin, Greek and ancient history are concentrated in fee-paying and academically selective state schools. Elsewhere, they barely feature. In 2019, 1,121 English pupils took Latin at A-level, the exam which opens university doors. Only 12% of those went to non-selective schools; a scandalously low share, according to Classics For All, a voluntary group that promotes the subject for non-privileged youngsters, and has helped over 1,000 schools.
Spreading the classics to all classes and races is noble work, says Sahil Thapa, a sparky 19-year-old who co-edits a student law journal at Oxford University. His parents, who moved from Kathmandu to Essex, were puzzled when he opted for Latin A-level; he explained that ancient orators like Cicero would help his studies, which include Roman law, and stimulate his own rhetorical skills. Classics in Britain shows no sign of dying out, but the people who study it, and the reasons for their choice, would amaze Victorian imperialists. ■",2
1677,"THE STREETS of Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city, have a dystopian feel these days. Marks of the protests which have convulsed the country for the past three weeks are visible everywhere. Several bus stations are now burnt-out shells; many petrol stations have been abandoned. The stench of rubbish and faeces fills the air. Towards the east of the city, protesters have occupied Puerto Rellena, a big crossroads, and renamed it “Puerto Resistencia” (Port of Resistance). Surrounded by bonfires and stolen cars, and with rap music blaring, they dance and light candles in honour of those hurt in confrontations with the police. “We’re here because we are tired of corruption, we are tired of struggling, we are tired of being poor,” says Blanca Cortés, a mother of two.
Cali has been hardest hit by the protests that began on April 28th in response to President Iván Duque’s proposed tax-reform bill. Despite the withdrawal of the bill on May 2nd and the resignation next day of Alberto Carrasquilla, the finance minister, people are still out on the streets.

Most protests are peaceful, but several have descended into violence, probably with the involvement of criminal groups. At least 16 people have died, according to Human Rights Watch, a pressure group, and 740 have been injured, according to government figures. Some 850 police officers have also been hurt. Roadblocks erected by the protesters across the country have led to shortages of food, medicine and vaccines at a time when Colombia is experiencing a third wave of covid-19.

The primary reason for the protests is economic. Despite decent growth since the early 2000s, inequality remains high. At the current rate of improvement, it would take 11 generations for descendants of a poor Colombian to attain the average income, estimates the OECD. The protests follow on from demonstrations in 2019, when thousands took to the streets to demand better wages and more money for higher education. The pandemic, and one of the longest lockdowns, has exacerbated these problems. Last year the economy shrank by 6% and the government’s budget deficit tripled to nearly 8% of GDP. Some 2.8m people fell into extreme poverty (earning less than 145,000 pesos a month, or $38).
Discontent with Mr Duque, who had approval ratings of 33% before the riots, has also brought people out onto the streets. The president has failed to keep his campaign promise to make Colombia safer. Voters plumped for him rather than the leftist Gustavo Petro in 2018 partly because his party, the Democratic Centre, was known as the “party of security”. But at the beginning of his term Mr Duque spent most of his time attacking the peace deal his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed in 2016 with the FARC, a Marxist guerrilla group, rather than dealing with the causes of crime.
Since then, smaller illegal armed groups—descendants from the FARC or right-wing paramilitary groups—have grown stronger. Working with Mexican gangs, they supply around 70% of the world’s cocaine. Colombia is producing more of the drug than at the height of Pablo Escobar’s reign, says Alejandro Eder, a politician who helped negotiate the peace deal. Indeed it is highly likely that the extreme violence in Cali, where around 180 gangs are based, was exacerbated by criminals who see an opportunity to create chaos.
More broadly Mr Duque has failed to see that Colombians, and especially the young, have a new set of “political values’‘, argues Andrés Mejia, a political analyst. With the FARC officially gone, they are more comfortable with left-wing politics. They also have more precarious living standards. Even before the pandemic hit, fully 28% of those between the ages of 20-24 were neither employed nor studying in a school or university. It is no surprise that most demonstrators are young, nor indeed that support for Mr Petro, Mr Duque’s left-wing former rival, is surging. He now polls at around 38% and is the frontrunner in next year’s presidential election.
The tax-reform bill would have dealt with some of these underlying economic issues, by increasing taxes on the rich so that the government could spend more on transfers to the poor. But it was seen by many as unfair. Now the protesters have a list of more than 100 grievances. Among other things, they want Mr Duque’s government to stop forcibly eradicating coca bushes, both manually and by aerial spraying. They are also demanding the introduction of a basic-income programme for 20m people that would cost the government 6% of GDP. In Cali people are furious at Jorge Iván Ospina, the city’s mayor, because he splurged public funds in a virtual version of a yearly salsa fair. Some 40% of the money was misspent or wasted, according to the body that examines public expenditure.
Mr Duque has tried to meet with the peaceful protesters, as he did in November 2019. “The most important thing is that we have to turn this into an opportunity,” he said in an interview with The Economist, adding later that “my obsession today is that we can address the needs of the youngsters”. On May 11th he announced that the poorest 50% of students, who account for 97% of those at public universities and technical schools, would get free education from the second half of the year. The government will soon start a job-subsidy scheme, in which it covers 25% of the salary of around 500,000 18-to-28-year-olds for at least a year, in order to boost employment among the young.
But so far the meetings between Mr Duque and civil-society groups, including the National Strike Committee, an alliance of trade unions and other pressure groups that convened the protests, have not persuaded people to leave the streets.
Another problem is that Mr Duque has no way to pay for these handouts, both of which were in his tax bill. On May 20th Standard  Poor’s, a big credit-rating agency, downgraded Colombia’s foreign-currency debt, ending a decade in which it had enjoyed investment-grade status. This will sharply increase the costs of borrowing for the government, making it even harder to raise the money the protesters would like the government to spend.
Mr Duque’s political weakness does not help, either. His term ends in August 2022 and his party does not have a majority in the national Congress. Videos of police beating protesters have damaged Colombia’s reputation abroad. On May 13th Claudia Blum, the foreign minister, resigned amid criticism from the UN, the United States and other foreign governments over the government’s handling of the protests.
In Chile, huge protests in 2019 were appeased partly with the promise of a vote on a new constitution. By contrast, no single measure can “deactivate” Colombia’s protests, says Francisco Miranda, a political analyst. The demands are too diverse.
Meanwhile Mr Petro is trying to strike a balance between supporting the protests, as most Colombians do, and opposing things like the roadblocks, which most people object to. If he can pull that off, he may become Colombia’s first left-wing president. Even if he doesn’t, however, the past few weeks have shown how much the country has changed.■",2
1678,"AFTER MONTHS of delay, what is one night more? On November 18th Democrats in America’s House of Representatives were preparing to pass the Build Back Better Act—an enormous climate and social-policy spending package that will define Joe Biden’s legacy—more than six months after it was proposed. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, decided to forestall the inevitable by staging a one-man, eight-and-a-half-hour stemwinder (a privilege only afforded to the two party leaders). A few hours after Mr McCarthy’s discursions on, among other things, the cost of a Tesla car, George Washington’s crossing of the Delaware River and the production method for baby carrots concluded, around 5am, Democrats dutifully passed the legislation on a party-line vote.
It is a step forward for Mr Biden, whose agenda appeared to be foundering as Democrats violently disagreed among themselves about what to do with their thin congressional majorities. The president’s approval rating has steadily declined as inflation has climbed (a problem that the White House now admits is real), amid a pandemic that the country has not quite managed to shake off. Defeat in the closely watched gubernatorial race in Virginia on November 2nd—where the president had won handily only the year before—seemed to augur a coming electoral wipeout.
But the president’s luck has turned—for now. On November 5th the House passed a bipartisan infrastructure deal that the Senate had already approved but was stuck in limbo because progressive Democrats wanted it to move in tandem with the social-spending bill. That measure will spend more than $400bn over the next decade on, among other things, roads, bridges, airports and removing lead from water pipes. Now, the House has also advanced the other piece of Mr Biden’s agenda. Its last and steepest challenge will come in the Senate, where Democrats remain divided and have no votes to spare in the face of united Republican opposition. Despite the procedural success, the actual contents of the president’s signature bill have been hastily cobbled together, with some portions drafted rather poorly. Few Americans actually understand what is in it, a messaging failure that suggests that even eventual passage would do little to sway public opinion about the president.
The House version incorporates some of the edits that Democratic senators, particularly Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema—moderates on whose votes the bill’s fate hinges—have been demanding. The recently released score by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the pending legislation would spend $1.7trn over the coming decade—a fraction of the sum the White House had originally pitched. The CBO also estimated that $367bn of that amount would be deficit-financed, which may prove a problem with moderates, though Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, argued that a provision that increases funding for the Internal Revenue Service would yield enough to balance the bill through stricter enforcement of tax laws. That will probably not be enough, though. The bill that eventually passes the Senate, if it does, will almost certainly be less ambitious than the House version.
The House version of Build Back Better spends most of its funds on various family benefits, though these are parcelled out among many initiatives. Around $273bn will go on subsidising demand for child care in a manner that seems likely to accelerate inflation. The bill would also establish a universal pre-kindergarten programme. Because of budgetary constraints, just four weeks of paid family and medical leave made it in—less than the 12 originally proposed. Even this is unlikely to pass, thanks to Mr Manchin’s concerted objections. The expanded child-tax credits that have successfully reduced child poverty in America (amazingly, a fact seldom trumpeted by the White House) would be maintained at their present levels for just one more year. Mr Manchin’s queries on this initiative may result in its being jettisoned entirely.
Although pared back, the climate-change mitigation provisions of the legislation, which would cost almost $500bn, would still be the most ambitious in American history. The heart of the president’s climate initiative, a programme to limit emissions from electricity generation, had already been cut out on the objections of Mr Manchin, from the coal-loving state of West Virginia. Instead, the majority of the spending will go to various tax credits for renewable energy. One of the few remaining punitive measures—a fee on emissions of methane, a very potent greenhouse gas—is also looking shaky because of Mr Manchin’s opposition. If enacted, these would probably significantly reduce the country’s overall emissions of greenhouse gases, though by less than Mr Biden promised when he was campaigning.
For the better part of a year now, Mr Biden has been stuck shaking and remaking a legislative cocktail. Its main ingredients—climate and family policies—look to be set, but its odd dashes of various accompaniments (such as the smattering of immigration reform) are unlikely to all remain in place. Time has not really improved the president’s recipe—if anything the results are becoming murkier with every new attempt. Many more revisions will be needed over the next few weeks. But at least the worst outcome, that of a shaker explosion, looks a good bit less likely.",2
1679,"The Prime Minister has ordered a Whitehall review into the cross-Channel migrant crisis, it emerged last night.
Boris Johnson is said to be 'exasperated' by his Government's failure to reduce the number of migrants on small boats making the journey and wants ministers to 'redouble' efforts to 'fix' the crisis.
Former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been put in charge of the review, according to The Times.
It will seek to find solutions to the crisis and make sure all departments – not only the Home Office – are contributing.
The review follows a week of record migrant Channel crossings, with 1,000 reaching the British shores on Tuesday alone and around 24,000 making the journey this year. The figure is almost triple the number that arrived in 2020.
Mr Johnson's frustration comes after a series of promises made by Home Secretary Priti Patel to tackle the crisis.
They culminated this week with the suggestion that asylum seekers could be sent abroad for processing. Countries including Albania are being considered as possible destinations. 
Last night it emerged that Ms Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants which will see new restrictions imposed on asylum seekers, as well the construction of new purpose-built reception centres, according to The Daily Telegraph.
In Greece, migrants face regular checks on their movements which include curfews to stop them going off the radar.
Speaking of Mr Johnson's frustration that the migrant crisis has not yet been solved, a senior government source said the PM saw it as one of his biggest priorities and he was concerned that 'after two years there are still no viable solutions'.
Germany is becoming a hub for migrants attempting to reach Britain, it emerged last night.
Asylum seekers are massing in the country as a new staging post for Channel crossings masterminded by people-smuggling gangs.
Organised crime groups are also using German sites to store dinghies and other small boats used to attempt crossings, sources said.
Six out of ten migrants arrive in France only on the day they attempt their crossing, travelling there through Belgium and the Netherlands.
A UK government source described Germany as 'the established hub for criminal trafficking gangs' in Europe. 
It is also a key location in the criminals' supply chains, where boats, life jackets and other equipment is sourced for Channel crossings, they added.
'Boris is exasperated. He's told ministers to redouble efforts to fix this, no matter how difficult it is,' they said.
'If it looks bad now, it's going to look much worse in spring when it's warmer.'
In new plans being drawn up by the Home Office, migrants will have asylum claims thrown out if they abscond or misbehave.
The changes – which will require legislation – will be crucial in the operation of the new processing centres, which will house asylum seekers while their cases are scrutinised.
Migrants could also be issued with 'asylum apps' to track the progress of their applications on smartphones or computers in the centres.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has been impressed by the way Greece has digitised its asylum application process to track cases, sped up decisions and cut down on unnecessary paperwork.
Speaking to The Telegraph, Miss Patel said Greece had decided 'not to sit behind the EU block of competency'.
Ministers are also keen to avoid a repeat of riots at asylum centres.
'If they breach the rules, it will affect their asylum claim,' a source said.
'They would be told they have to be back in by a certain time, and so on. Terms would include preventing absconding.'
Some previously reported plans to tackle crossings have included the use of giant wave machines, nets to snare boat propellers and floating walls in the sea.
However, Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, told the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier this week that they were never considered'.
He added that the wave machine idea is 'bizarre'.
But the move to bring in Mr Barclay could be seen as an admission that the Home Secretary has not managed to tackle the issue.
It comes after Sir Keir Starmer accused Ms Patel of failing to deliver on promises to stem the flow of illegal migrants crossing the Channel.
The Labour leader said Ms Patel has not secured strong enough agreements with the French government to prevent migrants making the dangerous sea journey.
He said the Home Secretary repeatedly used 'strong language' to say how she would tackle the problem, but delivered 'absolutely nothing'.
October 15, 2019
Priti Patel vows to halve migrant crossings – then a tenth of the current level – by the end of the month and make them an 'infrequent phenomenon' by the spring of 2020.
'I am absolutely committed to doing everything in my power to stop these dangerous Channel crossings which are putting vulnerable lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Migrant numbers hit a record 1,185 in a day last week.
August 7, 2020
The Home Secretary backs sending Royal Navy patrols into the Channel.
'The number of illegal small boat crossings is appalling and unacceptably high.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Within hours, Ministry of Defence sources suggested the proposals were unworkable.
July 6, 2021
Miss Patel unveils powers for UK Border Force to turn back migrant boats and reduce asylum rights for people who arrive in Britain illegally.
'Access to the UK's asylum system should be based on need, not the ability to pay people smugglers.'
WHAT HAPPENED? The tactics have yet to be used amid opposition from France and even the UK Border Force over legal concerns.
July 20
She agrees to give France another £54million to tackle the crisis.
'The public are rightly angry that small boats are arriving on our shores, facilitated by appalling criminal gangs who profit from human misery and put lives at risk.'
WHAT HAPPENED? In October France accused the UK of withholding the money amid a row over whether Paris was doing enough to stop the boats. The first instalment of UK cash was later paid – but numbers coming over the Channel continue to rocket.
November 15
Miss Patel and French counterpart, Gerald Darmanin, vow they will deliver on their pledge to prevent '100 per cent' of illegal crossings.
JOINT STATEMENT: 'More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings... and make this deadly route unviable.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Days later the French embassy in London said 100 per cent 'should not be presented as an agreed figure'.
November 18
The Home Secretary launches an attack on the EU's open borders policy, blaming Brussels for the crisis.
'The real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – open borders. On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. They simply can't.'
WHAT HAPPENED? Free movement for people between member states in the so-called Schengen area is a fundamental EU principle and there is no prospect of it being changed. 
His attack came as Ms Patel blamed the EU's open borders – established by the Schengen Agreement – for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc.
Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was 'constantly pressing' the French on the issue, but that they were 'overwhelmed'.
'Let's not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever – Schengen open borders,' she was quoted as saying.
It is thought at least 10 migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing.
It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British 'oscillate between partnership and provocation' when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: 'We need to further strengthen collaboration.'
Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensified recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where canisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants.
Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work 'extremely closely' with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe.
'We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings,' a No 10 spokesman said.
'This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours – France, Belgium and the Netherlands – as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions.'
Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britain's 'busted' asylum system.
Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a 'dysfunctional' system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in 2015.
Sir Keir said: 'My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted.
'This Government has been in power for 11 years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch.
'Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at.
'So if the asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.'
Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador to Britain flatly denied reports his country has been in discussions with the Government about hosting a processing centre for migrants who arrive in the UK.
Qirjako Qirko told LBC radio that there had been 'zero talks' between the two countries on the issue.
'It's absolutely fake news because as my prime minister stated yesterday – the foreign minister also tweeted yesterday – that doesn't exist, any negotiations between Albania and the UK regarding these processing centres,' he said.
'It will not be changed because my prime minister was crystal clear yesterday when he said that Albania… will never be a processing centre for illegal immigrants.'
Speaking on a trip this week, Ms Patel said offshore processing centres remained 'on the table' but refused to discuss specific negotiations. 
There have been suggestions that migrants could be sent and held abroad - such as in Albania - while their cases are looked at. 
'We keep everything on the table… and this is why the new Nationality and Borders Bill is just so important,' she said.
'I'm the only Home Secretary over a 20-year period that has taken on the challenge of reforming what is fundamentally a broken system of asylum and illegal migration.' She admitted for the first time that Britain was facing a 'mass migration crisis'.
And, after months of friction with the French government, Ms Patel appeared to change her tone when she said the flow of small boats needs to be treated as a 'Europe-wide problem'. 
She said France was 'overwhelmed' by asylum seekers heading for the UK.
And she blamed Brussels – which governs EU border policy – for failing to act. 'Let's not forget the real problem on illegal migration flows is [that] the EU has no border protections whatsoever,' she said.
'On stopping crossings, France can't do it on their own. Other countries have to do much more in terms of border protection.'
Seven out of ten migrants who attempt to cross the Channel have entered France through Belgium according to French officials, Miss Patel said.
She added: 'The EU's Schengen zone is free movement and open borders. They do not have border controls and border checks. 
'There is no united position across EU member states in terms of how to tackle this issue. It's an EU competency issue.'
Deploying highly-charged language, the Home Secretary went on: 'There is a mass migration crisis. I've said this from day one – from the minute I walked into the Home Office. For everyone who complains about this – and no-one is more angry and frustrated about this than myself, alongside the British taxpayers – there isn't a silver bullet.
'There's no point saying, 'Well, you could just push boats back'. It will not stop it. There are all sorts of issues with criminal gangs, smugglers, etc.' Ms Patel said of the French: 'I think it's fair to say they are overwhelmed. That is a fact.
'We are constantly pressing France on this and we're asking them to be honest with us about where the gaps are because they can't be everywhere. We have a very, very professional working relationship, but no one country can fix this on their own.'",-2
1680,"As a physical education teacher in Loudoun County, Virginia, I serve a very diverse community in Leesburg. I love and respect all my students and treat them with dignity despite our differences.
My recent court win is an important step toward protecting freedom of expression for everyone. My hope is that it will encourage educators across the nation to freely advocate for their students without fear of consequence. Some Americans have lost sight of the importance of open debate. 
The Loudoun County School Board recently passed a policy that forces teachers to call students by pronouns that are contrary to biology and violate my faith as a Christian.
The policy forces me and my colleagues to subject the very children that we are charged to love and protect to a dangerous ideology that could lead to puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and even sterilization.
While the policy was still under review, I took the time, in my personal capacity, to speak at a school board meeting that was open to the public. I told board members that, as a teacher, I cannot lie to these kids—no good teacher would. However, the policy would force me to do just that, and I urged them to rethink it.
Two days later, I got a call to come into Human Resources, where I was informed that I was being suspended for ‘disruptive behavior.’
I didn’t understand what was disruptive about expressing my concern for my students at a public school-board meeting in the county where I live and pay taxes. I later came to learn that the disruption they were referring to was five parents’ e-mails sent to my school complaining about my speech at the school board meeting. 
As a result of the e-mails, the school board determined that it was enough to jeopardize my family’s livelihood and my future as a teacher. Think about the implications of a school board giving into such demands so quickly—simply as a result of a teacher’s views. 
Freedom of expression is a core liberty and a human right, and the school board was trying to take that away from me. I decided to stand up for what I believe in, and to protect my students. I was fortunate to have the assistance of Alliance Defending Freedom to challenge the violation I was facing and defend my rights in court.
First, the court temporarily ordered the school board to reinstate my job. The Virginia Supreme Court later upheld that order. Now the school district has agreed to settle my case.
As part of that settlement, the trial court permanently prohibited the Loudoun County School Board from punishing me for expressing my views. Teachers are just like everyone else; we have legitimate ideas and views we should be free to peacefully express. No government should be able to force its citizens to say things they disagree with.  
This is especially true in schools, where the marketplace of ideas should be fiercely protected, both for the sake of freedom and the sake of truth. The court has vindicated those rights for me and for all teachers. I can now confidently continue teaching at Leesburg Elementary School without fear of punishment for expressing my views.
It’s been a long, emotional journey up to this point, but I know it’s worth pursuing. As exhausting as it is, I know there’s still more work to be done to truly protect freedom in Loudoun County.
The school board adopted the policy I objected to, Policy 8040, and two of my colleagues, Monica Gill and Kimberly Wright, have joined me to take a bold stand to see that the same rights that we have outside the school are protected inside the school. Our constitutionally protected freedoms don’t vanish when we walk through the school doors.
Monica, Kimberly, and I know that not every parent sees things the way that we do, and we respect that. But some would rather see certain voices silenced or, even worse, compelled to speak in ways that violate our deeply held faith, instead of being allowed to engage in the debate.
Call it cancel culture, call it censorship, call it what you want—all of our freedoms are threatened when the culturally accepted narrative is the only option for discussion.
America is large and diverse, and some of us don’t agree with the ideas that are touted as truth by cable news networks, Hollywood executives, or political leaders. We shouldn’t be singled out for censorship. 
Parents should be allowed to have a say in what goes on in their kids’ schools. We recently witnessed a regime change in the Virginia governor’s office, in part because parents in our commonwealth are waking up to what’s going on.
As a result of what was happening here in Loudoun County, many parents saw that it was time for a change to protect their children from these harmful and radical ideologies. If we’re allowed to debate ideas, kids will learn how to value people while engaging with different opinions in a respectful way. 
Silencing opposing voices only teaches kids that you can get your way by bullying others. Teachers and parents have unique viewpoints when it comes to topics like efforts to control COVID-19 outbreaks, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity ideology. 
In my case, the Loudoun County Court took us a big step closer toward allowing those viewpoints to be voiced without punishment. I love all my students, and I enjoy teaching them health and physical education. In my classroom, every student will continue to be treated with dignity, respect, and care. 
This is much more than a job for me; it is who I am. I don’t see myself as a rebel or revolutionary. I’m just a P.E. teacher who cares deeply about the health and future of my students. Monica, Kimberly, and I are taking a stand for what we believe is right and good for all Americans, not just us.",-2
1681,"BELLA LIU’S family was aghast when she returned to her home inland after a year on Hainan, an island province in the south. She had several scars and a deep tan. “My mother thought I had become a drug dealer working across the border with Vietnam,” says Ms Liu. In fact, the former dietician had taken up full-time surfing. But that was almost as shocking. “I nurtured you for 20 years, and you just want to float out to sea?” she recalls her mother saying.
Ms Liu is now a surf instructor in Houhai Bay, on the island’s southern coast. Small tattoos, including one of a seashell, adorn her muscular arms (body art is another taboo in the eyes of hometown folk). Yet surfing has changed her “inside and out”, she says. She is not alone in seeking out its benefits. Most of her clients are women, many of whom are prepared to go against the tide—by plunging into it.

Hainan’s palm-lined beaches and balmy winters have long been a draw for domestic tourists. But even a decade ago it had few surfing enthusiasts. When an American expatriate organised a surfing contest there in 2008, just two of the 30-odd participants were Chinese. Today Riyue Bay, north of Houhai, is home to the national surfing team’s academy, set up after the International Olympic Committee accepted surfing as an Olympic sport in 2016. (The team did not qualify for the games in Tokyo, which begin on July 23rd and where surfing will make its Olympic debut.) The local government is now eager to turn Hainan into a global surf destination. Its waves are said to be the most dependable ones in China for good surfing.
There was a time when cars loaded with boards would be pulled over by police, and surfers lectured about the dangers of their pastime. Now official approval is prompting more people to try the sport. So is the pandemic. It has forced many Chinese who would normally have holidayed overseas to stay put. Between January and May, Hainan received 11% more visitors than in the same period in 2019. Surfing also gained a lift last year when “Summer Surf Shop”, a variety show filmed in Riyue Bay, began airing on iQiyi, a Netflix-like site.
On a recent weekday in Houhai Bay, dozens of bikini-clad novices, their faces streaked with colourful sunscreen, wobbled on boards in knee-deep water. Many come for just one session, hiring coaches who double as photographers for social-media-worthy snaps. But dedicated surfers are swelling in number, too. All “love nature and the spirit of freedom,” says Ms Liu, the ex-dietician. Darci Liu (no relation), China’s first professional female surfer, runs retreats for women who want to enjoy the sport. “Surfing showed me a bigger world,” she says, one in which “I don’t need to have pale skin, or kids by a certain age.” In March she launched Hainan’s first surfing tournament for women. Expect ever more of them to catch the wave. ■",2
1682,"FOR OLIVER MAYERS, a native of Montreal, living in a bilingual city is special. “It’s ‘bonjour-hi’,” he says, referring to the local hybrid greeting. Around two-thirds of people in Montreal regularly use English at work. “You can do both.”
Others say you should not. On May 13th Coalition Avenir Québec, the conservative party in charge of the Quebec national assembly, put forward a bill to bolster French as the province’s sole official language. It is likely to come into force later this year.

The bill mandates that businesses must have their signs mostly in French. Companies with 25 or more employees, moreover, will have to form “francisation committees” to monitor the use of written and spoken French. Staff who misuse the subjunctive will not be referred to human resources. At least, not yet.
New immigrants will have six months to learn the language; after that, all the government’s letters to them will be in French. The bill also seeks to add clauses to the parts of the Canadian constitution that refer to Quebec, declaring it a “nation” within a unified Canada.
It is not the only attempt to boost French. On June 15th the federal government proposed a bill to safeguard the language nationwide. On June 20th Nathalie Roy, Quebec’s minister of culture, announced that most music heard when calling a government agency, or when in a government building, should henceforth be made in Quebec and be in French. (When unveiling the policy, according to the Montreal Gazette, Ms Roy spoke of a terrible injustice: “I was on hold with the culture ministry’s phone line and I was taken aback to hear an American singing a little song in English to me.”)
Few Quebeckers are pushing for independence. After two referendums, most Canadians consider the matter closed. But if the Supreme Court rejects the attempt to declare Quebec a nation, it could rekindle a desire for autonomy, thinks John McGarry of Queen’s University in Ontario. Like Quebec, the Spanish region of Catalonia tried to define itself as a “nation” in regional statutes, but the constitutional court argued that the term had no legal force.
Meanwhile the bill has been criticised by indigenous peoples and Anglophones. Marie-Claire Lafrenière, an English-speaking mother in Terrebonne, complains that recently at a drive-thru she was told to speak French. “I feel as though I’m living under a dictatorship,” she says, showing the sense of proportion for which Quebec is increasingly renowned. ■",2
1683,"GOD, SAYS the Koran, chose Arabic for his revelation because it is easy to understand. But many of the world’s 470m Arabic-speakers beg to differ. According to a report by the World Bank, almost 60% of ten-year-olds in Arabic-speaking countries (and Iran) struggle to read and understand a basic text. Despite decades of investment in education, the Middle East and north Africa still suffer from what the report calls “learning poverty”. “School systems don’t see the importance of engaging kids in reading—or don’t know how,” says Hanada Taha-Thomure, one of the authors. “It creates a gap between children and their language. Many can’t read or write an essay.”
The root of the problem is bad teaching. Arabic lessons are dull and focus on fiddly grammar. Classrooms often have no printed material. Few schools have libraries. Teachers tend to lack “sufficient mastery of the language itself”, says the report. In universities across the region, Arabic departments, along with religious studies ones, attract students with the lowest grades.

In Morocco almost 60% of teachers of ten-year-olds have no higher education. Only Bahrain has a teacher-training college that specialises in teaching Arabic. Teachers tend to be traditionalists, sometimes resorting to beating. Children “don’t love the Arabic language because not even 1% of teachers are reading stories to their students for pleasure,” said Ms Taha-Thomure, a professor at Zayed University in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Some blame the language itself. Pupils are taught Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the formal tongue of officialdom, yet they grow up speaking a native dialect. The dialect closest to MSA is spoken by Palestinians, yet only about 60% of the local lingo overlaps with MSA. The Moroccan dialect diverges far more.
Adults often stumble over the written word, too, so bedtime reading to children is rare. Only about a quarter of Arabic-speaking parents read to their children often, compared with more than 70% in much of the West. Reading for pleasure is widely regarded as critical for a child’s future success. But studies show that Arabic-speaking children do much less of that than children in the West.
Arab education ministries are waking up to the problem. Egypt has developed a trove of online material to bypass the traditionalists. The UAE has begun fitting classrooms with “reading corners”. Across the Arab world girls far outperform boys, in part because female teachers tend to be better, so Saudi Arabia has defied crusty clerics and let women teach boys (though separately from girls). Its education ministry is puncturing the mystique of the sacred texts by distributing Japanese-style comics to every Saudi child over ten, with superheroes speaking Arabic slang. “We are facing generations that do not speak the Arabic language,” says Essam Bukhary, the CEO of Manga Arabia, which produces the comics. “We want to promote reading as a hobby for younger generations.”
Traditionalists quake at such irreverent handling of the sacred language. And Arab regimes are nervous of the free expression a more liberal approach may inspire. Their censors are banning books as keenly as ever and ensure that newspapers all say the same thing. Many officials prefer to keep children disciplined by making them memorise what they’re told, says Andrew Hammond, a lecturer in Arabic culture at Oxford University. Otherwise, he says, they might start thinking for themselves. ■",2
1684,"CELEBRITY BOSSES used to have nicknames that made a virtue of short fuses and brutality. “Chainsaw Al” and “Neutron Jack” sounded more like wrestlers than men in suits. That kind of moniker would jar today. Inclusivity and empathy are what matter: think “Listening Tim” and “Simpatico Satya”. But just because chief executives seem more normal does not mean that they actually are. The demands of the job require an ever-stranger set of characteristics.
In some ways the path to the top of the corporate pyramid is unchanged. It requires people to compete with each other over an extended period. It demands evidence of financial and operational success. It uses the prospect of money—lots of it—as a lever to incentivise ambitious people. And it selects for familiar traits: hard work, impatience, self-confidence and extroversion. If you would rather stay in and watch “The Great British Bake Off” than wine and dine clients, the role is not for you.

A recent study by Steve Kaplan of the University of Chicago and Morten Sorensen of the Tuck School of Business looks at assessments conducted by ghSMART, a consulting firm, of more than 2,600 candidates for different leadership positions. Candidates for CEO jobs emerge as a recognisable type. Across a range of characteristics they have more extreme ratings on average: they shine in what the academics term “general ability”.
They also differ from other executives in the particulars. Where aspiring chief financial officers are more analytical and focus on the detail, would-be CEOs score higher on charisma, on getting things done and on strategic thinking. These traits also seem to be predictive. By tracking the subsequent careers of candidates, the academics find that people who were applying for a different position but had “CEO-like” characteristics were more likely eventually to wind up in the top job.
Yet firms today are after more than a type-A personality. Mr Kaplan and Mr Sorensen note that CEO candidates with better interpersonal skills are more likely to be hired. Another new piece of research, from academics at Imperial College London, Cornell University and Harvard University, analyses the lengthy job descriptions that companies draw up when they work with headhunters to recruit a new leader. Cognitive skills, operational nous and financial knowledge are prerequisites for success. But over the past two decades these descriptions have placed more and more emphasis on social skills—the ability of bosses to co-ordinate and communicate with multiple people.
Why are these softer skills prized? The answer, according to Stephen Hansen of Imperial College, lies partly in the rise of knowledge workers. Firms increasingly depend on developers, data scientists and IT managers who are used to operating independently. Chief executives are not going to tell these kinds of workers what to do; their job is to make sure that people understand the firm’s goals and toil together effectively. Sure enough, the paper shows that demand for these skills goes up in larger and more information-intensive firms. Social skills matter more when bosses need to persuade as much as instruct.
The wider environment also rewards softer skills. Polling by Edelman, a public-relations firm, suggests that majorities of customers and employees make choices on what to buy and where to work based on their beliefs. Chief executives must mollify politicians, respond to activists and dampen social-media firestorms. It helps if the boss comes across as a relatable member of society, not a volcano-dwelling villain.
It is not yet time to call time on old-fashioned narcissism. Another study, by a quartet of researchers at Stanford Graduate School of Business, surveyed 182 directors about the personalities of their chief executives. The answers suggest as many as 18% of bosses are considered narcissists by their own board members, a prevalence rate perhaps three times that of the general American population. The researchers also find that firms with narcissistic CEOs tend to have higher scores for their environmental, social and governance policies. What better way for an egomaniac to come across as empathetic than to save the planet?
The demands on chief executives make for an increasingly strange mixture. Be more talented than others in the firm, but don't tell them what to do. Crush the competition while exuding empathy. Listen charismatically. Be likeably aggressive. CEOs have always been abnormal. The trick now is not to show it.

1685,"“THE TRUTH is, this government is picking on a whole set of British people playing to the worst common denominator, which is disgusting.” Boris Johnson “is not a decent prime minister”, but a “bully”. Having wrapped up the Liberal Democrats’ conference on September 20th, Sir Ed Davey, their leader, is not pulling his punches. His criticisms of Mr Johnson are part of an effort to peel off Tories in marginal seats who, he hopes, are repelled by the government’s stance on culture-war issues and angry at its incompetence.
In 2020 Sir Ed became the Lib Dems’ fourth leader in five years. Since their electoral collapse in 2015, the party has been in turmoil. An attempt to regroup by consolidating anti-Brexit voters behind it in 2019 failed. Nine of its 12 MPs have served less than five years. Sir Ed hangs his hopes on two voter groups: liberal Tories turned off by Mr Johnson’s populism and centre-left liberals. These voters are likely to be young graduates, and to say they value diversity and donate to human-rights charities.

Taken together, the two groups could conceivably enable the Liberal Democrats to chip away at the “blue wall”: seats in the south and south-east metropolitan fringe. Their voters are keener on moderate, centrist Toryism, and growing numbers of graduates have moved to such places in the past decade. Lib Dem leaders make much of their party’s surprise by-election victory in June in the formerly safe Tory seat of Chesham and Amersham, two market towns connected to the capital by the last two stops on the Metropolitan tube line.
According to a paper by UK in a Changing Europe, a think-tank, another 33 seats could be within reach. They would require heroic levels of tactical voting, with pretty much all Labour and Green voters consolidating behind the Lib Dems in seats where it is the Tories’ main challenger. Some would also require a swing from the Tories to the Lib Dems of the order of 5%. But the Chesham and Amersham victory gives the party leadership hope.
Sir Ed’s criticisms of Mr Johnson are thus aimed at the ears of “soft Tories” whom he hopes to persuade to defect—as are several of the party’s recent policy decisions. On some subjects, they make Lib Dems sound remarkably like Tory backbenchers. These include housebuilding and vaccine passports (against and against). Sir Ed does his best to describe both stances as consistent with Liberal Democrat traditions of devolved decision-making and opposition to government overreach (they have long opposed identity cards). But the fact that homeowners in leafy shires rarely welcome housing development, and that small businesses oppose vaccine passports, is no coincidence.
Such political cross-dressing brings with it a big risk, however: alienating everyone else who might vote for the party. Most Britons support vaccine passports, and most young people regard building lots more houses as essential if they are ever to be able to afford to own a home. Even trickier may be navigating the culture wars. The party’s new president, Mark Pack, wants to appeal to young liberals by signalling that the party shares their progressive values.
On topics such as Black Lives Matter, where much of the country ended up supporting the English football team’s decision to kneel during the national anthem before matches—and some Conservative culture warriors did not—this is probably good positioning. Trans and gender-identity issues are less clear-cut. Tory voters are on average pretty sceptical. Young Lib Dem activists may have applauded Sir Ed’s insistence during interviews in the run-up to conference that no public spaces should be allowed to remain female-only, not even rape-crisis centres or sporting competitions. But it is unlikely to have done much to persuade potential Tory switchers.
Sir Ed brushes off further questions on the matter. “It seems to be the media that is obsessed with this issue,” he says. Still, says an activist hoping to be selected as a Lib Dem candidate in the next election, it is unlikely to make it into the party’s election materials alongside pledges to improve social care or to reform planning. ■",2
1686,"Chile’s president, Sebastián Piñera, declared a state of emergency for 15 days in two southern regions. The army will be deployed to help local police, who have struggled to contain violent attacks by indigenous groups seeking to reclaim ancestral lands. A demonstrator died during a protest led by indigenous groups in Santiago. Chile is in the process of drafting a new constitution, which may decentralise power and expand indigenous rights. A far-right presidential candidate campaigning on a law-and-order platform is polling well in a tight race ahead of the election on November 21st, in which Mr Piñera cannot stand.
In Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, at least five American families connected to the United States embassy appear to have been afflicted with the Havana syndrome. The mystery illness, which causes ringing in the ears, fatigue and dizziness, first surfaced in Cuba in 2016.

Vaccination, then vacation
The American government said it would open up land and ferry crossings at its borders with Canada and Mexico in November, but only to travellers who are vaccinated against covid-19. From January this will also apply to truckers and students from Canada and Mexico, who had been exempted from the ban on crossings.
Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, banned employers, including private ones, from requiring their workers to be vaccinated against covid-19. That sets up a clash with the federal government, which is ordering large employers to do the opposite.
Poland set itself on a collision course with the rest of the European Union, after the country’s constitutional court ruled that some of the EU’s most important rules, including Article 1 of its main treaty, are incompatible with Poland’s constitution. The EU seems sure to retaliate, perhaps by freezing the covid-19 recovery funds it was due to send to Poland.
Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, resigned. It had become clear that his coalition partners, the Greens, would bring down his government if he stayed on, because of a scandal swirling around him involving payments for favourable press coverage. Mr Kurz denies wrongdoing.
An election in the Czech Republic appeared to spell the downfall of Andrej Babis, the country's billionaire prime minister. An opposition alliance secured more seats. Mr Babis, who is also mired in scandal, remains prime minister for now.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, launched a plan called “France 2030"", which calls for €30bn ($35bn) to be spent on cutting carbon emissions and boosting industry. It includes a renewed commitment to nuclear power.
Police in Norway said that a Danish man who killed five people with a bow and arrow was a convert to Islam. The attack, in the town of Kongsberg, was the country’s worst since 2011, when a far-right extremist murdered 77 people.
The EU proposed reducing or scrapping most of the border checks for goods crossing between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland that were imposed after Brexit and are causing headaches for business. More talks will be held.
“Many thousands of deaths” could have been avoided in Britain in the early stages of the covid-19 outbreak, according to a parliamentary report. It criticised the government’s initial approach as “fatalism …seeking to manage, but not suppress, infection”. Britain subsequently suffered an egregiously high death rate.
Several Asian countries announced plans to loosen pandemic-related border controls. Thailand and Singapore will start allowing fully vaccinated visitors from low-risk countries to enter without quarantine, Malaysia said it would allow its citizens to travel abroad again, and India will restart issuing tourist visas for all passengers. Sydney ended 107 days of lockdown.
The G20 held a meeting to discuss the economic situation in Afghanistan. The EU promised €700m ($810m) in emergency aid, in addition to the €300m it has already pledged. The leaders agreed to co-ordinate efforts with the Taliban, but stopped short of recognising the government. American officials met representatives from the Taliban in Qatar for their first talks since the jihadists seized power.
At least 50 people were killed in a bombing at a Shia mosque in Kunduz, the deadliest attack in Afghanistan since American forces withdrew at the end of August. Islamic State claimed responsibility.
The party of Muqtada al-Sadr, a cleric-cum-militia-boss, won the largest tally of parliamentary seats in Iraq’s election, with over 70 out of 329. But other Shia parties claimed the vote was unfair. Since some have large private armies, haggling over who forms the next government could turn violent. Some of Mr Sadr’s rivals are backed by Iran.
President Joe Biden considered imposing sanctions on parties to Ethiopia’s civil war, which he was ready to discuss with Uhuru Kenyatta, his Kenyan counterpart. The fighting has plunged 400,000 people in Ethiopia’s northern region of Tigray into famine. The Ethiopian army has started an offensive against rebel forces from Tigray on several fronts.

The International Court of Justice ruled mostly in favour of Somalia in its dispute with Kenya over which country owns a patch of ocean that is thought to be rich in oil and natural gas. Kenya rejected the ruling.
China’s president, Xi Jinping, said that reunification with Taiwan “must be fulfilled” and should be achieved peacefully. But he said no one should underestimate China's “strong ability” to defend its territorial integrity, a hint that it may use force. His Taiwanese counterpart, Tsai Ing-wen, said the island would not bow to pressure from China.
Tanks for the memory
The University of Hong Kong ordered the removal of a sculpture, called the Pillar of Shame, commemorating the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. It was erected 24 years ago.",2
1687,"LOCALS HAVE a saying: “When the Buddha’s feet are washed, Leshan cannot sleep.” The city in the south-western province of Sichuan has reason to be fearful. Leshan lies at the confluence of three tributaries of the Yangzi river. Centuries ago its residents carved a stone statue of the Buddha into a cliff face. It towers 70 metres high, overlooking the swift currents. In August 2020 its giant toes were bathed in river water for the first time since the Communist Party seized power in 1949. Thousands of residents suffered in the flood.
But it is not only the ancient threat of rivers in spate that unnerves Leshan. It is also the way the city itself has grown. By the time of last year’s disaster, its built-up area, including satellite towns, was more than half as big again as it was in 2000. City planners had failed to make due provision for floodwater runoff.

After four decades of frantic expansion, many other cities are in similar difficulty. They are poorly prepared for extreme downpours, which are likely to become more common as a result of global warming. One such storm in July over Zhengzhou, the capital of the central province of Henan, drenched the city in a year’s worth of rain in three days (see picture). Cars were swept away or trapped in flooded tunnels, where six motorists died. Another 14 people drowned in the subway system. In all, nearly 300 were killed. According to Chinese researchers, average annual losses from floods in China doubled from around 100bn yuan ($15.6bn) in the decade after 2000 to over 200bn yuan in the early 2010s.
About one in ten Chinese people lived in cities in 1950. Now six in ten do. About 70% of those cities are in floodplains. “We overbuilt, and we built it wrong,” says Yu Kongjian, a landscape architect at Peking University. Mr Yu was among the first to urge that urban areas become “sponge cities”, meaning they must be capable of absorbing rain without creating floods. He drew inspiration from old Chinese irrigation systems, such as “mulberry fish ponds” that act as natural reservoirs. He estimates that urbanisation has resulted in a third of farmers’ ponds and half of all wetlands disappearing.
The government has embraced the idea, and has adopted the term sponge city. In 2015 it released a series of guidelines for building them. The aim is for 80% of cities to collect and recycle 70% of rainwater by 2030. Local authorities have set their own targets. In 2018 Zhengzhou announced a plan to ensure that nearly nine-tenths of its core urban area would be “spongified” by 2030. This year Leshan said 40% of its urban area would meet the government’s sponge-city standards by 2025.
Cities have long tried to prevent flooding with hard engineering involving the “grey infrastructure” of dams, dykes and barriers. But urban surfaces of tarmac and concrete cause floodwater to rush into often inadequate drains. Producing a sponge effect requires measures such as creating artificial wetlands, planting roadside shrubs and using permeable materials to build pavements and plazas.
The flooding in Zhengzhou shocked the country. It left many Chinese wondering whether sponge cities were all they were cracked up to be. After all, a lot of money has been flowing into spongification. Experts reckon that implementing the government’s sponge-city guidelines will cost at least $1trn nationwide. Generous subsidies have been dolloped out to localities. Netizens were up in arms when they discovered that Zhengzhou had planned to invest close to 55bn yuan in sponge-related projects in the two years preceding the floods. How much was actually spent has not been made public. But the work had clearly failed to avert disaster (and had not reversed the extensive building-over of Zhengzhou’s wetlands that had occurred in recent decades). Officials insisted that the downpour was a “once in a millennium” event that even the best-built sponge city could not have coped with perfectly.
Experts agree that Zhengzhou has not disproved the effectiveness of the sponge-city programme. They point out that the government had required sponge projects to cover only 20% of the city’s urban area by 2020. So it may be difficult to evaluate Zhengzhou’s efforts at least until 2030. Kong Feng of the China Agricultural University in Beijing says that more subterranean spaces need to be used to collect floodwater. For example, he suggests, the lowest levels of underground car parks could be adapted to serve as emergency reservoirs. Such a backup “may not be needed for ten years. But use it just once and it will be life-saving for the city,” says Mr Kong. He has been involved in China’s first nationwide survey of risk from natural disasters, which was launched last year.
It is the case that local governments sometimes misspend the money they are given for sponge-city building. They are often reluctant to use expensive land to create natural drainage systems such as parks and ponds. For a sponge city to work, many government units must collaborate, from water-conservation and weather bureaus to education and emergency departments. For two days before the worst of the flooding, Zhengzhou’s meteorological office issued its highest level of alert for a rainstorm. But few officials appeared to pay much attention.
There is evidence from other places that spongifying can make a difference. Like Zhengzhou, the flood-prone city of Wuhan, on the banks of the Yangzi, was chosen as a pilot sponge-city in 2015. From July 5th to 6th last year, a cloudburst caused record rainfall over the city. Yet flood waters began to recede within hours. The following day centres for taking the gaokao, China’s university-entrance exam, stayed open despite heavy rain.
Many critics overlook the fact that in Zhengzhou, too, water levels fell more swiftly than they would otherwise have done, says Mr Kong (it may have helped that Zhengzhou’s flood-prevention efforts had also included the building or refurbishing of over 5,000 kilometres of drains). City officials recently called on Mr Yu and his team to help them make Zhengzhou more absorbent.
Tourists are flocking once again to Leshan’s Buddha, some to seek peace and protection at its feet. The statue conceals other strengths. Inside its body a drainage system, carved into the rock when it was built, helps to flush out rainwater and reduce erosion. Some say that the rocks gouged out of the cliff were dropped into the river, helping to calm it—and that the statue’s divine presence, where the rivers meet, also helps slow the water’s flow. For sponge-city enthusiasts it is nature, not the supernatural, that offers salvation. ■",2
1688,"THE SCREENS of the digital billboards illuminating the streets of Tashkent flip between the faces of politicians who are running in a presidential election on October 24th. Shop windows display posters of the five candidates lined up side by side. Newspapers plastered in press kiosks grant equal space to all contenders. Uzbekistan is engaged in a scrupulous attempt to show one-person, one-vote democracy at work in a competitive election. But in truth there is only one man, and that is the president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is guaranteed to win with a thumping landslide. He may well improve on the 89% of the vote he won five years ago.
Mr Mirziyoyev took office in 2016 after the death of Islam Karimov, whose brutal 27-year rule made his regime a particularly nasty one even by the standards of the five Central Asian post-Soviet republics. Under Karimov—with Mr Mirziyoyev as prime minister—Uzbekistan forced adults and children to pick cotton, slaughtered demonstrators and tortured prisoners. The elevation of Mr Mirziyoyev promised more of the same. Yet over the past half-decade he has surprised both the 35m-odd Uzbeks and the world by embracing change. Forced labour has dramatically declined, the country’s most notorious prison camp has been closed, Soviet-era planning in the vast cotton sector has ended and strict rules mandating where citizens could live and travel have been abolished.

Economic reforms have accompanied political ones as international institutions have been invited in to offer advice. Entrepreneurs say the lifting of currency-conversion restrictions and streamlined customs procedures have transformed the climate for business. Day-to-day life has become much easier, says Dildora Atadjanova, who runs two small firms. In the Karimov era she gave up running a café because of the need to comply with “ridiculous requests”, such as feeding local apparatchiks for nothing. These days officials are keen to meet the needs of business owners instead. “The ideological change has been tremendous,” says Zafar Khashimov, the boss of Korzinka, a supermarket chain. The government even managed to sustain growth last year, when the pandemic caused most economies to contract.

Yet the reforms so far have been the “pleasant”, or less painful ones, says Jamshid Kuchkarov, a deputy prime minister. The difficult business of structural change lies ahead. The state squats heavily over the economy, controlling 55% of assets and 85% of the banking sector. A privatisation drive aimed at reducing the number of state-owned enterprises by three-quarters has begun, but the behemoths need overhauling to lure investors. Land reform is going slowly. Corruption and cronyism remain endemic.
Political reform might help Mr Mirziyoyev and his overworked ministers tackle these challenges. Sodiq Safoev, the deputy chairman of the Senate, said as much recently, remarking that society could not develop without opposition and “alternative ideas”. The president has declared himself open to opposition. But in practice his government has proved resistant to registering parties critical of the status quo. Citing a technicality, the government rejected a bid by one little-known maverick to set up an opposition party as a springboard for an election bid.
The law bars independent candidates from running, and Mr Mirziyoyev faces little threat from the four candidates representing pro-government parties—the only type that exists. “I’ll toss a coin,” jokes Shavkat Mamedov, who rents out bicycles in Tashkent, explaining how he will decide which box to tick on the ballot paper.
One reason for the slow pace of change is the intelligence service, which remains resistant to the emergence of a genuine civil society, says Agzam Turgunov, a former political detainee who spent a decade in Jaslyk, a prison camp shut down by Mr Mirziyoyev. He is one of 50 political prisoners released under the president’s rule. But 2,200 inmates—10% of the prison population—are still in jail on religiously and politically motivated charges, according to an American government commission.
One of Mr Mirziyoyev’s early moves after coming to power was to rein in the security service by firing its longtime boss and curbing its powers. But the legacy of a police state lurks, and the spooks like to flex their muscles. They are behind several secret trials on spurious treason and espionage charges that have alarmed rights campaigners. These include the case of Kadyr Yusupov, an ex-diplomat who remains behind bars on treason charges despite UN calls to free him.
Emboldened Uzbek media report unflattering news, and these days take on topics that were formerly taboo, such as corruption. But red lines remain for reporters, and some websites and social-media networks are blocked. The jailing of an outspoken blogger on dubious corruption charges and the arrest of a social-media firebrand on charges of insulting the president this year made journalists shiver.
There are mutterings in Tashkent that the government is losing reform momentum as vested interests push back. But Mr Mirziyoyev’s supporters are bullish nonetheless. U-turns are out of the question, insists Mr Safoev, deputy chairman of the Senate. “The way back is suicide.”■",2
1689,"“GOT A FEELING ‘21 is going to be a good year,” the stepfather in “Tommy”, a rock opera by The Who, tells his family. The British government is trying to give a similar impression of optimism. After its year of post-Brexit transition, and with a last-minute trade deal that staves off some of the worst effects of leaving the European Union, the new year offers the country a number of opportunities to cut a dash on the world stage. It will take the presidency of the G7 club of big rich democracies, allowing it not just to set the agenda for the group’s annual summit, but also to invite Australia, India and South Korea to come along—an invitation that might be the groundwork for a “D10” of democracies. In November the most important diplomatic event of the year, the COP26 climate conference, will open in Glasgow.
Within weeks Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, will be visiting India, where on January 26th he will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s guest of honour for Republic Day. His visit will be part of a much-touted “tilt to the Indo-Pacific”. Britain has opened discussions on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade area of 11 countries. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is pushing for it also to become a “dialogue partner” of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The Royal Navy’s flagship, the spanking new aircraft-carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, will soon be Asia bound.

Freed from an endless round of EU gatherings, British diplomats expect to have more time for globe trotting. Alexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister, has pointed out that there was a period of 17 years when no British foreign secretary visited Australia; such slights are unlikely to be repeated. Over the year since Brexit various nimble moves—from offering people in Hong Kong a path to British citizenship after China’s crackdown there, to sanctions on Belarus while the rest of Europe dithered, to rapid approval for a covid vaccine—have shown that Britain can stand out. “It’s exciting to see the British government making creative choices in its national security,” says Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, an American think-tank. “That’s a really important way to signal that Britain outside of the EU sees itself as a leader in national security and is willing to take the risks and the consequences of leading with its values.”
For all these tokens of real potential, though, there are serious impediments to the creation, or recreation, of a “Global Britain”—a project with which many of those who brought about Brexit are enamoured. Through leaving the EU the country weakened its economic prospects; since then covid has hit it hard. The economy has longer-term problems, too. Since 2005 British firms’ share of world market capitalisation has fallen from over 7% to 3%, a much greater slippage than any other large European economy. Over the same period the share of the stock of global cross-border investment attributable to British-headquartered multinationals has fallen from 10% to 6%, also a bigger drop than for any other major economy.
At the same time the world is returning to an era of great-power competition: deepening rivalry between America and China, Russia’s brazen opportunism, the EU’s stubborn assertiveness, at least in economic policy. “The next chapter of world affairs will be about the political, economic, regulatory, technological and military interplay between the US, China and Europe,” says Sir Simon Fraser, one of Britain’s former top diplomats. “The task for the UK is finding our place in this.”
To do so will require a clear strategic vision and coherent implementation. Yet these are just the things which, according to a recent report by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, British foreign policy currently lacks. Unless Britain applies itself to acquiring those necessities, good years will prove hard to find.
No reason to be over-optimistic
It is easy to dismiss Britain’s strengths, and many of its inhabitants delight in doing so. But though Britain is no longer the leading power it was in the first half of the 20th century (see chart) it is still a manifestly significant one. It has the world’s fifth-largest economy, according to the IMF, and is one of the five nuclear-armed states with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. It is a muscular member of NATO and its signals-intelligence service, GCHQ, makes it a potent part of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing elite, together with America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Its imperial past has left it one of the few countries to have a number of overseas territories, which extend its presence while also adding to its obligations. Its head of state is the head of state of 15 other countries, too, as well as leader of the 54-nation Commonwealth. The Anglican Communion is the world’s third-largest Christian church. Britain is rare among rich countries in spending a hefty chunk of its national income on foreign aid and doing so well. It is the biggest voluntary contributor to the World Health Organisation and to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance.
Britain has a high profile in sport, thanks in large part to the Premier League’s global following among football fans, and is one of the most popular destinations for international tourists. It has the world’s most respected public broadcaster, the BBC, and some of its best universities. Though the British government, like many others, botched its response to covid-19, its scientists have excelled themselves, as they do in many fields. They have helped to develop what may prove to be the most widely used vaccine (the one from Oxford-AstraZeneca) and to identify the most effective treatment for those who get ill (the steroid dexamethasone).
But none of these advantages is new. Britain enjoyed them all when it was a member of the EU—while also benefiting from being part of the world’s largest trading bloc and its most important grouping of democracies. To have any chance of getting more out of its native strengths now than it did then, it will need a foreign policy which understands both how to build on them and what that requires. Rory Stewart, who resigned from his ministerial post running the Department for International Development (DfID) when Mr Johnson became prime minister in 2019, says that the self-examination needed has so far been lacking. “We do these things, but we have no very settled, confident idea about why we’re doing these things.”
The delayed but now imminent report of the government’s “Integrated Review” of foreign policy, security, defence and international development should provide some of the foundations required; it has been billed by Mr Johnson as the biggest rethink of Britain’s international stance since the end of the cold war. But several key decisions on the direction of policy have already been taken. In June 2020 Mr Johnson (himself a former foreign secretary, if not a terribly good one) announced that DfID would henceforth be subsumed into the Foreign Office.
In theory, that will make British policy more co-ordinated, combining the diplomats’ lobbying power with DfID’s technical expertise. It may also go some way to reversing the decline of Britain’s diplomatic representation around the world. In the 1990s, says Mr Stewart, Britain had perhaps 25 diplomats in Zambia. Over the decades that dwindled to an ambassador, one other diplomat and local employees. Bringing in DfID may make representation more beefy. But many fear that any such benefits will come at the expense of lasting damage to the capabilities that made Britain an “aid superpower”. “It’s not a merger, it’s the demolition of DfID,” Andrew Mitchell, another former head of the department, has lamented. In November new legislation reduced foreign-aid spending from 0.7% of GDP—an established benchmark—to 0.5%.
Military spending has fared better. It is set to rise by £6.5bn more than previously planned over the next four years, reversing a decade of cuts and confirming Britain’s status as the leading military spender among European members of NATO, with an annual budget of some £47bn. The pattern of spending leans heavily towards the maritime; there is also spending on technology, with the creation of an agency for artificial intelligence and a new emphasis on mounting attacks in cyberspace.
Freedom tastes of reality
Defence spending up, aid outlays down, the Foreign Office and development departments merged: the resources and institutions with which Britain’s new strategy will be implemented seem set. The strategy which informs these choices, though, has yet to be clearly enunciated.
The government will want to remain as close as possible to America. Marta Dassù, a foreign-policy expert at the Aspen Institute Italia in Rome, sees the increased investment in security as “a sort of down-payment to the US, to show the incoming American administration that the UK is still very relevant”. The government will take heart from the idea that the administration led by Joe Biden, the president-elect, will emphasise allies rather than “America First”. Yet the degree to which Donald Trump’s dramatic turn away from global leadership was accepted by the American people will not be forgotten. Nor is Mr Biden likely to favour aggressive interventions like those which Britain has been willing to back in the past.

What of the world’s other major powers? There was a time when Britain’s Conservatives saw Chinese investment as playing a big part in Britain’s economic future and went out of their way to court it. The authoritarianism of President Xi Jinping, the clampdown on Hong Kong and a toughened American stance—one that Mr Biden will not reverse—have forced a rethink. British policy towards Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, diverged from America’s for some time; but in 2020 the company was barred from involvement in Britain’s 5G plans. There are still some in Mr Johnson’s party who want to see a deeper relationship with China. But the Sinosceptics seem to have the upper hand.
And then there is Europe. Britain is keen on its continuing “E3” security discussions with France and Germany (despite covid-19, the troika met five times in 2020 at foreign-minister level to discuss Iran and other matters). But it insisted that foreign policy, external security and defence co-operation be excluded from the negotiations which led to the deal reached on December 24th. Britain “can’t actually tackle Europe in an entirely rational way at the moment,” says François Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a French think-tank. “Although it’s an integrated review, it’s integrating everything except Europe.”
Mr Johnson’s government has avoided almost any mention of the EU in its foreign-policy discussions; but relations with the rest of Europe will play a crucial role in the success of any such policy, both directly and indirectly. Directly because Britain is still, physically and militarily, part of Europe. The adventurism of Russia under Vladimir Putin means that global Britain’s military commitments will remain concentrated in its own European region, handled through NATO and in concert with its former EU partners.
What is more, many of Britain’s global goals will be shared by the EU, and best pursued in partnership. Sometimes, though, the two parties’ goals will clash. Ms Dassù warns that Britain will find itself competing with the EU in its relationship with the Biden administration, which “will look to Germans first and the UK second.”
The deepest influence may well be the effect that leaving the EU will have on Britons themselves. If the divorce with the EU leads to ever greater internal tensions, Britain will remain hopelessly distracted and potentially diminished. A particular worry in strategic circles is that, were such divisions to extend as far as independence for Scotland, the future of the British nuclear-armed submarine force, which is based there, would be in doubt. Though independence will not easily be won under a British government which will not grant the people of Scotland the necessary referendum, it is not the unthinkable outcome it once was. Even without such a rupture, according to Sophia Gaston of the British Foreign Policy Group, a think-tank, Brexit has produced, or revealed, “an enormous amount of volatility” in public attitudes to foreign policy.
All alone, cousin
The prime minister, whose hero is Winston Churchill, frequently claims Britain to be “world-beating”. A nostalgic devotion to such ideas is likely to be evident in the Integrated Review. Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser, expects it to exhibit a tension “between the sort of exceptionalism that seems to be very much the leitmotif of the whole Brexit saga, and the reality that Britain will only make a difference in the world in partnership with other friends and allies.” Karin von Hippel of RUSI, a British think-tank that specialises in military affairs, warns that the review risks resembling “a Christmas tree” with “a bit of everything” hanging off it. Britain could find itself overstretching and underachieving in a number of areas.
Take the tilt to the Indo-Pacific. Sceptics question how central this is to British policy, and what the country can hope to achieve. They view the idea of Britain as anything other than a secondary player in Asian security as “fanciful”. There also appears to be little public enthusiasm for it. “The British people don’t fundamentally buy into the argument of us having a specific role in the Indo-Pacific region at the moment,” says Ms Gaston. And spending on a military presence well beyond Europe and the Atlantic may prove hard to justify. “I’m a great fan of the British military, but much of it is symbolic,” says Mr Stewart. “They’re going to end up with maybe 25 fighting vessels, at incredible expense. Are we actually going to go to war with China to stop them from taking Taiwan?”
In general, Britain has not looked like a very effective power over the past few years. Observers overseas have not just puzzled over its willingness to inflict harm on itself by leaving the EU. They have also marvelled at its lack of a plan for doing so and the years of political chaos that ensued. Britain’s credibility as a champion of the rules-based international order plummeted when its government showed itself to be willing to break part of the withdrawal agreement it had just signed with the EU. And Mr Johnson’s handling of the pandemic has hardly inspired faith in British pragmatism and competence.
That recent experience leads to doubts about whether the government is deploying sufficient resources on the projects that it most needs to succeed. Lord Ricketts, who was ambassador to France in the run-up to COP21, which produced the Paris agreement on climate change, worries that COP26 may be an example. He recalls that France’s foreign minister at the time, Laurent Fabius, “spent a year travelling the world and putting it together, and we’ve got a part-time Alok Sharma [the business secretary] as our special envoy for climate change.” He suggests Britain is “underweight” in preparing for it.
The common thread in all these doubts is whether Britain is fundamentally serious in what its leaders talk of achieving. Can it prioritise a few areas and devote sufficient attention and resources to make a real difference? And can it find a way to develop a proper policy towards Europe? Until it does so, the suspicion will remain that there is too much symbolism and too little substance in its thinking on foreign policy. Britain’s accumulated assets in the game of nations will not make up for a failure to take that game seriously. ■",2
1690,"GABON, A SMALL, family-run petrostate in west Africa, may seem a rather odd campaigner against global warming. Once Africa’s fifth-largest oil exporter, it profited from the world pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Now, however, it hopes to benefit by helping the world to avoid overheating—and by encouraging rich countries to pay African ones to keep their forests standing. Its advocacy got a boost on November 2nd when the leaders of more than 100 countries pledged at the COP26 summit to end deforestation by 2030. To help that happen, rich countries promised to stump up billions of dollars.
At least 85% of Gabon, which lies on the equator at the edge of the Gulf of Guinea, is covered in steaming jungle. It is one of six countries that form the massive forest of the Congo basin—the world’s second-biggest tropical rainforest, after the Amazon—which sucks in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and turns it into leaves and branches. (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the two Congos and Equatorial Guinea are the other five.) Gabon is not the largest of this group of carbon sinks, but its president, Ali Bongo, is the most eager to offer to protect his country’s forests in exchange for cash from rich countries.

Gabon’s argument is simple. Large rainforests such as those in the Congo basin provide a service to the world by sucking millions of tonnes of carbon from the air. Since performing this service provides no income, there has been little incentive for poor countries to protect their forests when they could instead profit by chopping them down for timber or clearing them for farming.

The potential benefits are large. “The stock of carbon in the Congo basin adds up to six years of total global emissions,” says Lee White, Gabon’s environment minister, adding that Gabon alone absorbs the equivalent of one-third of France’s carbon emissions each year. Although Gabon emits only around 25m tonnes of carbon a year, it sequesters about 140m tonnes, he reckons. Yet the six countries in the Congo basin used to suck far more carbon from the air than they do now. The Democratic Republic of Congo, which has the largest expanse of jungle of the six, is losing 500,000 hectares of it a year through deforestation. It will need some incentive to stop the chop. And countries such as Gabon, which have been protecting their forests, should be rewarded for having done so, argues Mr White.
The consequences of not doing so go beyond emissions. Mr White says the forests cause rain to fall across the Ethiopian highlands, the Nile valley and the southern rim of the Sahel. If these places dry up, waves of hungry people may spread across Africa, making the continent more prone to turmoil. Many will also head to Europe.
The deal struck at COP included a pledge by 12 countries to provide $12bn in public funding to protect and restore forests. The countries, which include America, Germany, Japan and Britain, hope that will also open the taps to private funding. Quite how this money will be spent is not yet clear. But several ideas are gaining ground.
Eats, shoots and LEAFs
One is to pay countries that can show they have reduced emissions by preserving forests. The LEAF Coalition, a partnership of governments and big firms that stands for Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance, has raised $1bn for this purpose. Another is that countries or companies may sell “green bonds” to finance climate-related projects. Investors keen to look green may pay a premium for these, allowing issuers to borrow at concessionary rates. “If you stop deforestation, you should be compensated for forgoing other forms of economic development,” says Andrew Mitchell, a climate scientist who founded the Natural Capital Finance Alliance. “Forests should be worth more alive than dead.”
It is not just governments that could raise money using green bonds, but also private firms such as the African Conservation Development Group, a Mauritius-registered company led by a South African, Alan Bernstein, that wants to mix virtue with profit, and help finance its efforts by selling $300m worth of green bonds to companies wishing to offset their own carbon emissions. It has bought a huge concession at Grande Mayumba, on Gabon’s south-west coast, investing $200m in sugar, rubber, fishing, forestry, cattle-ranching, and—for the very rich—eco-tourism.
Mr Mitchell is confident that African green bonds will eventually take off. But for the moment markets are still wary of buying any sort of African bond, let alone newfangled green ones. One worry is politics, as Gabon’s example illustrates. If investors are to pay more for green bonds financing forests, they would have to be certain that the carbon absorbed within the trees would be contained there for many years. Many may wonder what might happen if, for example, Mr Bongo’s regime in Gabon were to fall?
The question is far from academic. The Bongo family has run Gabon as a patronage-ridden fief for 54 years; no one pretends it is a democracy. At its most recent election, in 2016, it was obvious that the main challenger, Jean Ping, had actually won. Moreover, Mr Bongo suffered a serious stroke three years ago and may not be well enough to run again. Should he die, it is unclear if his Eton-educated, half-French son Noureddin, not yet 30, would seek to replace him, presumably using the regime’s usual tricks.
Without the backing of Mr Bongo, it may not be certain that Mr White would be able to continue to protect the forest. As it is, his position is somewhat improbable. A 56-year-old white Briton, he is an expert on biodiversity, gorillas and forest elephants. For nearly ten years he ran Gabon’s national parks, until two years ago, when an illegal-logging scandal was exposed over the illicit export of kevazingo, a reddish hardwood. In the fallout the president fired his vice-president and environment minister, and replaced the latter with Mr White.
He has won widespread admiration for promoting tree-hugging and animal-coddling in Gabon, thereby bolstering Mr Bongo’s claim to be Africa’s green champion. But his policy is far from popular with the many villagers whose crops are routinely trampled by unruly elephants. A standard cry among Gabonese tired of the ruling family runs, “Ali Bongo prefers elephants and trees to people.” It is a sentiment the leaders at the COP will need to get to grips with, if their plans to protect Africa’s forests are to come to fruition. ■

1691,"LAST AUGUST a judge sentenced Brenton Tarrant, who murdered 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, to life in prison with no possibility of parole. It was the first time a court in New Zealand had meted out such a sentence. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister and a liberal icon, took grim satisfaction in the punishment. “Today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist,” she said.
Lifelong imprisonment seems to be spreading as a punishment for the worst crimes. In 2019 Serbia passed “Tijana’s law” in response to the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl. It allows judges to sentence some murderers and rapists of children to life in prison without parole. In June last year, after the gang rape of a 13-year-old girl by soldiers, Colombia overturned its constitutional ban on life sentences. Britain’s government recently proposed legislation to reduce the age at which judges can impose “whole-life” sentences from 21 to 18.

The most heinous crimes are rare, but the world’s population of lifers is large and probably growing. According to the World Prison List, the population of all inmates rose by 20%, to 10.4m, from 2000 to 2015. Meanwhile, between 2000 and 2014 the numbers serving life sentences worldwide rose by 84%, to 479,000, according to “Life Imprisonment”, a recent book. American jails held 40% of them (see chart), and more than 80% of those with no prospect of parole. The Sentencing Project, a think-tank in Washington, DC, reckons that the number of Americans serving life sentences without parole rose by two-thirds, to 56,000, between 2003 and 2020. Turkey, India and Britain impose a lot of life sentences. South African jails hold nearly 17,000 lifers, up from 500 in 1995. In 2014 some sort of formal life sentence was on the books of 183 countries and territories.

Many penal reformers think that is excessively harsh. Lifelong confinement is a declaration by the state that a person is beyond reform. It punishes long after most violent offenders have lost the will or capacity to repeat their offences. And in some countries, such sentences are imposed not only for murder and rape but also for lesser crimes.
Catherine Appleton, one of the authors of “Life Imprisonment”, contrasts the punishment of Mr Tarrant with Norway’s treatment of Anders Breivik, another fanatic, who in 2011 murdered 77 people, most at a summer camp for the Labour Party’s youth wing. He drew Norway’s maximum prison sentence of 21 years. After that, a court will decide if he is still dangerous. If so, which seems likely, he will remain locked up. But if not, he will be freed.
Opponents of life without parole hope to repeat the success of campaigners against capital punishment. Since 1976 more than 70 countries have abolished the death penalty. The number of executions worldwide in 2020 fell for the fifth year running to its lowest in a decade, says Amnesty International, a human-rights group. In America just 17 people were executed last year. If campaigners have their way, life sentences will be the next sort to be branded cruel and rendered unusual.
Making this case is not simple. For one thing, life-sentencing regimes vary enormously. Some are relatively lenient, as in Finland, where few “lifers” spend more than 15 years in prison. Others are staggeringly harsh. Some American states still lock up juvenile offenders for life. China imposes the sentence on corrupt officials. Australia and Britain do so for drug offences. Life with a chance of parole may not be much better than without it if parole is granted rarely. Life sentences can be disguised as indeterminate or very long fixed-term sentences. El Salvador, which does not impose life sentences, can lock people up for 60 years.
A bigger problem for reformers is that many have argued that life without parole is a merciful alternative to the death penalty. Michael Radelet of the University of Colorado Boulder, who is a prominent opponent of capital punishment, says that he is “no fan of life without parole, but the alternative to killing people is not killing them, so it’s a step in the right direction.” Many jurisdictions have swapped death for life. Colorado replaced the death penalty last year with mandatory life sentences without parole. In 2018 Benin commuted the sentences of its last death-row prisoners to life. After the fall of communism many eastern European countries replaced capital punishment with life sentences.
Life after death
In places that retain the death penalty, the possibility of life in prison can reduce its use. In Texas death sentences “declined precipitously” after 2005, when judges first had the option of imposing life without parole instead, notes Ashley Nellis of the Sentencing Project. Thousands of death-row inmates in countries that have stopped executing people, such as Kenya and Sri Lanka, are in effect serving life sentences. “Life Imprisonment” does not count them as lifers.
Another complication is that efforts to reduce incarceration can hurt the anti-life-sentence cause. In America, where such efforts have bipartisan support, reforms to shorten sentences for non-violent crimes have the unintended consequence of making long sentences for violent ones seem more reasonable, says the Sentencing Project. Also, a recent rise in violent crime could makevoters less keen on leniency.
Opponents of life sentences take issue not only with retribution-minded conservatives but also with liberals who cheer when rapists and racist killers are locked away for ever. In South Africa pressure from women’s groups led to a sharp increase from 1995 to 2006 in the use of life sentences for rapists. Those who would free the likes of Mr Tarrant after a couple of decades are, in effect, urging their fellow citizens to show as much empathy to the criminal as to the victim. That is a big ask.
But not, perhaps a hopeless one. In Louisiana, among the most punitive states in the most punitive rich democracy, attitudes are changing. In 2020 the state’s jails held nearly 6,000 prisoners serving sentences of 50 years or longer, a fifth of the total prison population. Nearly 4,400 were serving life without parole, which is mandatory for five offences, including “aggravated” rape and second-degree murder, which might mean driving a getaway car. Louisiana’s version of the “three strikes” laws introduced during a nationwide crackdown on crime during the 1990s lets prosecutors seek life in prison for repeat offenders, just one of whose four crimes needs to have been violent. One man was put away for life for attempting to steal a pair of hedge clippers.
Nearly half of Louisiana’s lifers are first offenders, according to Kerry Myers of Parole Project, an NGO in Baton Rouge, the state’s capital, that helps ex-cons adjust to freedom. Three-quarters are black. In 2016 around 300 were in prison for crimes they committed when they were children.
Until May 12th Chuck Clemons was one. Jailed for what he describes as a “senseless” murder he committed when he was 17, he served 44 years in Angola, a maximum-security lock-up larger than Manhattan that houses 6,300 inmates, nearly three-quarters of them lifers. Tall and soft-spoken, with a scholarly mien accentuated by gold-rimmed spectacles, he was not crushed by his ordeal. “What kept me going”, he says, was baking. He rose at 11:30pm on workdays to confect bread rolls and such treats as banana pudding and pecan pie for 800-900 prisoners at a time.
But there were sorrows. He watched from afar as his sister married and bore children. He could not bear his nephew to visit him. “Just watching [members of my family] leave and knowing that I got to go back there, I wasn’t strong enough to take that,” he says. His mother, with whom he is now reunited, has Alzheimer’s. His father died of covid-19.
Mr Clemons’s release is a sign that things in Louisiana, and America, may be changing. In a string of decisions since 2010, America’s Supreme Court has ruled that mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional, forcing states to reconsider whether people locked up for crimes they committed as children needed to remain so. Louisiana has released 78 juvenile lifers, starting in 2016 with Andrew Hundley, now Parole Project’s director, who was jailed for killing a girl when he was 15.
Louisiana has other reasons to free prisoners who appear to pose no threat. Its incarceration rate of 980 per 100,000 people in 2018 was the highest in the country. Spending on the penal system, some $700m a year, is one of the biggest items in the budget. In 2017, with bipartisan support, the state enacted a package of laws to reduce its prison population. The number of prisoners has dropped by about a quarter since 2017.
Despite such advances, life without parole is still entrenched in Louisiana’s law, says Mr Myers. Prosecutors like draconian penalties. The threat of them makes it easier to secure convictions via plea bargains; suspects often admit to a lesser crime rather than face trial for a more serious one and the possibility of being locked up for ever. Mr Myers claims that politicians do what the prosecutors want.
Prosecutors merely execute the laws, retorts Loren Lampert of Louisiana’s District Attorneys Association. Still, he thinks mandatory life sentences for murder and aggravated rape protect potential victims. Even a few children deserve such a punishment. Some cases “are so heinous, so atrocious, so aggravated that they merit that distinction of the worst of the worst,” he says. Parole hearings can force victims to “relive the most horrible event of their entire lives every two years”.
Changing tack
Some Louisianans are trying a new approach. Two businessmen and a lawyer recently founded the Second Look Alliance, which aims to cut the prison population, starting with a campaign to end mandatory life sentences without parole for second-degree murder. Legislative lobbying has gone as far as it can, says its executive director, Preston Robinson. The next phase requires “changing the hearts and minds of the public”, especially moderate and conservative voters.
He thinks three messages will resonate with them: that Louisiana’s large population of lifers makes it an “outlier” even in the south; that money spent locking people up for decades is wasted; and that redemption is possible. In the group’s first video Billy Ebarb, a white man, recalls that in 1985 his brother was killed trying to break up a fight. The killer was Charles Manuel, a black man who had committed no other crimes. With Mr Ebarb’s support he was freed after 35 years. Mr Manuel appears on screen and places his hand on his victim’s brother’s shoulder.
Some campaigners focus on the extraordinary number of elderly prisoners in America. In 2019 federal and state prisons housed 180,000 people aged 55 and older: 13% of the total, up from 3% in 1999. Keeping old people locked up is expensive. Tina Maschi of Fordham University in New York calculates that they cost $68,000 a year, three times as much as young inmates.
And they would pose little risk if freed. Of 199 prisoners aged 51 to 85 released from jails in Maryland since 2012 just five had returned by 2020 for committing a crime or violating parole conditions. Among the general population of freed prisoners, 40% were back in the pen within three years.
Politicians and courts across America are chipping away at life sentences. Legislators in 25 states have introduced “second-look” bills to reconsider long sentences. Washington’s legislature, inspired by the George Floyd protests, passed a law in April to resentence more than 100 people jailed under the state’s three-strikes law. Nearly 40% of those sentenced under the law are black, ten times their share of the state’s population. That same month Maryland banned life sentences for juveniles. Since 2012 the number of lifers in America jailed for crimes they committed as children has dropped by 45%, to around 1,500.
John Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant-governor, has made reducing incarceration a centrepiece of his campaign to win a seat in the United States Senate. He wants an end to mandatory life sentences without parole for second-degree murder, one reason why Pennsylvania has America’s second-largest population of lifers. He is taking a risk. “With every person I try to get released, I’m writing my next attack ad,” he says.
World war free
Some campaigners use the courts to curb life sentences. A clutch of treaties prohibit governments from inflicting degrading treatment on anyone, including prisoners. In 2013 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that offenders have at the outset of their sentences a right to hope for eventual release. The International Criminal Court says after 25 years sentences must be reviewed. “Twenty-five years is increasingly established in international law as the maximum minimum,” says Dirk van Zyl Smit, Ms Appleton’s co-author.
Scepticism about life sentences is spreading. In 2016 Zimbabwe’s constitutional court ruled that life sentences without parole are cruel, citing the ECHR’s decision. Belize’s court of appeal ruled unconstitutional such sentences for murder in the same year. Canada’s Supreme Court is due to decide whether a court in Quebec was right to reduce the amount of time that Alexandre Bissonnette, sentenced to life for killing six people at an Islamic cultural centre in 2017, will have to wait for parole from 40 years to 25.
Malawi may become a model for countries seeking to avoid simply replacing capital punishment with life sentences. After its High Court struck down the death penalty as mandatory for murder in 2007, the top appeal court ordered that more than 150 condemned prisoners be resentenced. (In practice, all were serving life, since Malawi has executed no one since 1992.) It directed judges to consider the circumstances of each to determine whether the death penalty should be upheld, converted to life or to a shorter sentence.
That kick-started the Kafantayeni Project, named for the case that overturned the punishment. Starting in February 2015, the High Court held hearings in Zomba, near the country’s only maximum-security jail. In cases where documents had gone missing or been eaten by termites, paralegals, law students and volunteers interviewed witnesses in search of mitigation.
Of the prisoners who have been resentenced, one was handed a life sentence but more than 140 have been released after completing shorter prison terms. To prepare the way, workers on the project fanned out to villages to explain what the ex-cons had endured and to find out whether they would be welcomed back.

One freed prisoner was Francisco James, who in 1995 was condemned to death for killing a man who was brawling with Mr James’s brother. Immured for 20 years in Zomba prison, built to hold 800 inmates but stuffed with 2,000, he wondered whether disease would carry out the sentence that the hangman would not. He had “given up on ever getting out of prison alive,” he says. The judges decided that the murder charge was inappropriate, in part because the victim was in poor health, and freed Mr James in October 2015.
He returned to Mkwinya village in central Malawi to find that his father and brother had died, his wife had remarried and his daughter was a mother. The village chief gave Mr James a plot of land, where he grows maize, soyabeans and groundnuts. By Malawian standards he is prosperous, with a motorcycle, an oxcart and two houses roofed with iron sheeting. He has fathered three more children. In April this year Malawi’s top court ruled the death penalty itself unconstitutional.
Its model is being watched in Kenya, where far more prisoners—some 4,800—may be entitled to resentencing under a Supreme Court finding in 2017 that the mandatory death penalty is unconstitutional. (In practice Kenya stopped carrying out executions in 1987.) Most of the condemned prisoners were in for “robbery with violence”. In 2019 a government-appointed task-force recommended investigations like those undertaken in Malawi. To speed things up, it proposed negotiations on new sentences between prosecutors and lawyers akin to plea bargains.
It is unclear how many have so far been resentenced. On July 6th this year the process hit a snag. The Supreme Court said that the mandatory-death-penalty ruling applied only to murderers, not to the majority convicted of lesser crimes. It is now uncertain if and when condemned Kenyan robbers will follow Malawians’ path to freedom, says Virginia Nelder, a member of the task-force.
When liberated lifers are reformed muggers or small-time drug-dealers, few will object. “History is moving towards less incarceration,” concedes Mr Lampert. Setting free those who have committed the worst crimes is harder to justify. Kenya’s reforming task-force recommended keeping life sentences without parole for them.
After his daughter Tijana was murdered Igor Juric attended trials of other abusers and came to the conclusion that, “We, as a society, have to do something to remove killers from our social circles, and keep them far away from children.” “Protection of our children” matters more than “conventions and laws of countries that I don't even live in,” he continues.
That view is understandable. But anyone who meets Mr Clemons will find it hard to fear all ageing lifers or fail to consider their humanity. He reckons he can succeed as a baker “in the free world”. At 62, he says, “I’m gonna work my way up.” ■
Correction (July 16th 2021): The original article misstated the proportion of the world's population of lifers with no prospect of parole who are in jail in America.

1692,"THE DIABLO CANYON nuclear power plant lies about 200 miles north of Los Angeles on California's central coast. Its twin reactors sit between the Pacific Ocean on one side and emerald hills on the other. The Golden State’s only remaining nuclear plant provides nearly 9% of its electricity generation, and accounts for 15% of its clean-electricity production. Yet despite California’s aggressive climate goals and a national push to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Diablo Canyon is set to close down by 2025. A new report from researchers at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) reveals just how detrimental that would be.
Diablo Canyon came online in 1985 and has operated without incident. But the plant is controversial. Diablo sits near several major fault lines, and locals have long feared that an earthquake could trigger a nuclear disaster. America’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) ordered utilities to evaluate their plants for flooding and seismic risk after the meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant in Japan in 2011. Diablo Canyon was found to be safe.

Even so, in 2018 the California Public Utilities Commission approved a proposal put forward by Pacific Gas  Electric, the state’s largest utility and the operator of Diablo Canyon, and environmental and labour groups to close the plant. PG argued that there was reduced demand for nuclear power because of the promise of renewables, such as wind and solar, and the growth of “community choice aggregators”, which allow local municipalities to decide where they get their power from.
Three things have changed since then. First, California passed SB100 in 2018, which requires the state to achieve 100% clean-power generation by 2045. Second, the south-west is suffering from what paleoclimatologists think is its second-worst megadrought in 1,200 years. Reservoirs across the region are drying up, limiting the supply of hydroelectric power. Just 11% of California’s in-state power generation came from hydro in 2020, a 44% drop from 2019 (see chart 1). Electricity from clean-energy sources (including nuclear) made up 51% of California’s power generation last year, down from 57% in 2019.

Third, a heatwave in August of 2020 led to rolling blackouts across the state as demand for electricity (to power air-conditioners) outpaced supply. California’s public utilities commission is scrambling to meet increased demand. The regulator recently ordered utility companies to buy up renewable energy and battery storage to try to offset the impending loss of Diablo.
These three trends led researchers to ponder how keeping the plant running might change California’s energy outlook. They found that to keep it going to 2035, ten years past its current operating licence issued by the NRC, would cut emissions, bolster the grid’s reliability and save the state $2.6bn. The analysis shows that Diablo’s continued operation would reduce the carbon emissions from power generation by 11% each year from 2017 levels. And unlike wind and solar power, nuclear energy provides a stable source of electricity unaffected by changes in weather.
The researchers also suggest that Diablo could potentially help California make its power sector greener and tackle water shortages by producing hydrogen or powering a salt-water desalination plant in addition to generating electricity. “You cannot afford to take technology solutions off the table” when pursuing net-zero goals, says Jacopo Buongiorno, one of the authors and a nuclear scientist at MIT. “All of the above is really the best strategy.”
It is one thing to prove Diablo’s value, and quite another to reverse its retirement. A law aimed at protecting marine ecosystems would force the plant to replace its water-intake system, which cools its reactors, with a new system that reduces the intake flow rate by 93%. It would also require PG to reopen its 2018 settlement and relicense the plant, which can be an onerous process; or sell Diablo to another utility.
Fission impossible?
The debate over Diablo Canyon reflects the recent rebranding of nuclear. Steve Nesbit, president of the American Nuclear Society, says three things happened in the 2000s to put a damper on nuclear power in America: fracking took off, the financial crisis of 2007-08 lessened demand for electricity and the Fukushima accident spooked politicians. The plants that were commissioned were delayed and over-budget. Yet evidence shows that when nuclear reactors shut down, polluting fossil fuels make up the difference.
Even while plants are being shut down, nuclear power is gaining in appeal. Environmental groups have long been sceptical of nuclear because of the toxic waste it produces, or because they were against nuclear weapons. Jessica Lovering, the founder of Good Energy Collective, which aims to build the “progressive case for nuclear energy”, says today’s climate activists are more pragmatic, and focused on nuclear’s lack of carbon emissions. She cites the Sunrise Movement as a group that is not necessarily pro-nuclear, but is against closing down existing plants.

Nuclear is responsible for nearly 20% of America’s power generation and about half of its clean energy. A survey from ecoAmerica found that 56% of Democrats supported nuclear power in 2020, up from 37% in 2018 (see chart 2). “Young people these days maybe don't bring with them the baggage of their parents and grandparents, who were raised during the cold war, in their view of nuclear power,” says Mr Nesbit.

Policy is slowly catching up. Pro-nuclear groups point to the use of “clean electricity” or “zero-carbon” language in state and federal climate targets as a way to leave the door open for nuclear, rather than requiring renewables. Jennifer Granholm, President Joe Biden’s energy secretary, told a crowd at COP26, the global climate conference in Glasgow, that nuclear energy is an “essential tool” in decarbonising the grid. Republicans and Democrats alike are excited about the potential for converting coal plants into nuclear power stations. When TerraPower, a company founded by Bill Gates, announced that it would build a nuclear reactor at the site of a closing coal plant in Wyoming, Ms Granholm, the state’s Republican governor and its senior senator were in attendance. The federal government is also subsidising the project to the tune of $80m.
But nuclear power still faces several obstacles. Experts say the biggest is the prohibitive cost of building a new plant. New designs, such as TerraPower’s, may help with this. Many states, including California, also have de facto bans on building new reactors until radioactive waste can be permanently disposed of. The federal government tried for decades to build a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada, but met stiff resistance from local politicians who didn’t want the stuff buried in their backyard.
The first of Diablo’s reactors will lose its licence in 2024. The report’s authors hope the Golden State will come to its senses before then. “The circumstances have changed,” says Ejeong Baik of Stanford. “Diablo Canyon presents an opportunity,” she adds. Will California take it? ■

1693,"Disappointed, prosecutor Thomas Binger, who has been heavily criticized for his actions during the case, sat back in his chair, looked at the ceiling, and issued a sigh as the first verdict in the Kenosha murder trial came in.
Defense lawyer Mark Richards did not hold back, blasting the Kyle Rittenhouse prosecutor within minutes of the end of the trial in Wisconsin.
‘Prosecutors are supposed to seek the truth — it’s not about winning,’ he said.
‘This case became about winning and that’s probably why it got so personal.’
Richards was speaking after Rittenhouse, 18, was sensationally cleared of all charges resulting from the night he took his AR-15 rifle from his home in Antioch, Illinois to the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where demonstrators were protesting the shooting of black man Joseph Blake.
He shot Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber dead and injured a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz. But the jury of seven women and five men on Friday found him not guilty of all charges.
‘I’ve known Tom Binger for a long time,’ Richards said. ‘I knew him when he was a civil lawyer. I’m disappointed with some of the things he did.’
Richards was just the latest to criticize Binger’s performance in the two-week trial, in which he frequently butted heads with Judge Bruce Schroeder.
But Binger wasn't alone in the legal line of fire.
Many court watchers believe Binger was thrown into the case because District Attorney Graveley — who would normally prosecute such a high-profile case himself — knew the case against Rittenhouse was weak.
'Binger was set up for failure,' one Kenosha legal insider told DailyMail.com during the trial. 'Graveley is the superstar and he knew this one was sure to tarnish it.'
The conservative Milwaukee Right Now said Graveley 'pawned the case off to his unfortunate assistant district attorney, Thomas Binger, who was left to spin gold out of a pile of self-defense straw.’
Problems started before the trial with the charges that the District Attorney’s office had brought against Rittenhouse.
Then-presidential candidate Joe Biden had called Rittenhouse a white supremacist in a tweet, asking why Donald Trump didn’t disavow such people.
That put huge pressure on Kenosha County District Attorney Graveley to come down hard on Rittenhouse, who was then 17.
He was charged as an adult with first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree attempted intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.
Despite being charged as an adult, he also was charged with possessing a weapon while under the age of 18.
Many court watchers felt the prosecution would have had more success if they had brought lesser charges against him.
Daniel Adams, a former Milwaukee County assistant district attorney who isn’t involved in the trial, described Binger’s case as ‘incredibly underwhelming.’
‘He’s got nothing,’ Adams said. ‘I just don’t understand it. What are we doing here? We’re all kind of scratching our heads.’
Problems grew right from Binger’s opening statement when he claimed that Rittenhouse had ‘chased Joseph Rosenbaum down’ and shot him.
But video footage showed that Rosenbaum — a convicted child molester who had been released from a mental health facility earlier in the day — had chased Rittenhouse and ambushed him.
He threw a plastic bag at the teen, cornering’ him between parked cars before Rittenhouse turned and shot as Rosenbaum, who was carrying a chain, lunged for the muzzle of his gun.
Binger was also embarrassed when he was questioning journalist Richard McGinnis who witnessed Rittenhouse shoot Rosenbaum.
‘You have no idea what Mr. Rosenbaum was thinking at any point of his life. You have never been inside his head. You never met him before,’ he said to McGinnis, adding ‘it’s complete guesswork, isn’t it?’
McGinnis shrugged and replied: ‘Well, he said, “F**k you” and reached for [Rittenhouse’s] weapon.’
There were also problems with the testimony of brothers Sahil and Anmol Khindri, who owned the car dealership that Rittenhouse said he was called to protect.
Sahil said he had not asked Rittenhouse to guard the lot while Anmol said he had not met him. But a photo appeared of the two brothers with Rittenhouse and others taken before the riots began.
‘When they put on the Khindri brothers knowing that they were lying, that is a problem,’ said Richards.
Binger was also widely ridiculed for pointing Rittenhouse’s weapon during the trial and for his many clashes with Judge Schroeder.
The most notable was when he tried to introduce testimony about Rittenhouse’s silence in the months between the shootings and the trial that the judge had explicitly ruled inadmissible in a pre-trial hearing.
‘Why would you think that that made it okay for you without any advance notice to bring this matter before the jury?” Schroeder shouted at Binger.
‘I was astonished when you began your examination by commenting on the defendant’s post-arrest silence. That’s basic law. It’s been basic law in this country for 40 years, 50 years. I have no idea why you would do something like that.’
Schroeder also berated him for talking about Rosenbaum setting a fire.
'All we're talking about is arson. We're talking about being loud and disorderly,' Binger said.
Schroeder immediately cut him off. 'I can't believe some of what you're saying,' he said in a raised voice. 'All we're talking about is arson? Come on!'
Binger, 51, made it clear earlier this week that whatever the outcome of the case he would make no public comment.
Instead it was left to Graveley to issue a statement saying: ‘We respect the jury verdict based on three and a half days of careful deliberations. Certainly, issues regarding the privilege of self-defense remain highly contentious in our current times.
‘We ask that all members of the public accept the verdicts peacefully and not resort to violence.’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
After six years prosecuting, he went into private practice as director of litigation for a business law firm before joining the Kenosha County DA's office.
He ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the post of District Attorney in neighboring Racine County in 2016, saying: 'In the last two years as a prosecutor, I have won 13 jury trials. I have convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, drunk drivers, home-invading burglars and men who abuse women.'
One of the most notable cases he has previously prosecuted was of a former New Jersey fire captain who was jailed for five years in 2017 for possessing child pornography and exploiting a child for sexual purposes.
Binger insisted the sentence was not enough, telling Essex News Daily, 'The state recommended 16 years.'
He was also forced to withdraw a case against Guy Smith, a trucker who was found with a gun in his cab. Smith's defense attorney pointed out the law specifically allowed handguns in vehicles without a concealed carry permit, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
The Smith case was also heard by Judge Schroeder.
But those cases had nothing like the media spotlight that has shone on the Rittenhouse case.
Binger's role has been controversial since the start. He took the unusual step of objecting to the attempt by California attorney John Pierce to represent Rittenhouse, saying in a six-page motion to the court that Pierce's presence could 'materially prejudice' the case.
He said Pierce's 'personal financial difficulties raise significant ethical concerns,' adding: 'Given his own substantial personal debts, his involvement with an unregulated and opaque 'slush fund' provides ample opportunity for self-dealing and fraud
'Money that should be held in trust for the defendant may instead be used to repay Attorney Pierce's numerous creditors.'
Pierce, who claimed the case against Rittenhouse was a 'political prosecution' eventually withdrew, leaving the defense in the hands of lawyer Mark Richards.
Binger clashed with Schroeder in pre-trial hearings. Last month the judge ruled against him saying that the men shot by Rittenhouse could not be called 'victims' during the trial but allowed a defense motion which allows them to be called rioters, looters or arsonists.
Thomas Binger is a seven-year veteran at the law office run by Kenosha County's top prosecutor, Michael Graveley. 
Graveley did not personally handling the high-profile Rittenhouse case because he was tasked with the investigation into the police shooting of Jacob Blake at the time Rittenhouse was charged. It was Blake's shooting on August 23 that sparked the Kenosha riots. 
Binger and Judge Bruce Schroeder, who sits on Kenosha County Circuit Court, clashed frequently in the run-up to the trial, and the proceedings were as explosive as expected. 
Schroeder, who at 75 is the longest-serving active circuit judge in Wisconsin, has the reputation of being a stern judge who often hands down tough sentences. 
The website Wisconsin Right Now described his approach as 'bizarre', saying that he frequently made moves that seemed to help the defense in their argument that the teenager acted in self-defense - such as discussing the chaos engulfing Rittenhouse as he opened fire, showing videos of violent protest, and leading Rittenhouse to say that he wanted to help people. 
Binger graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1996 and became a criminal prosecutor at the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office in 1999, where he eventually rose to the rank of assistant district attorney. 
He went on to work for the DeMark, Kolbe & Brodek law firm as director of litigation in 2005 before joining the Kenosha County District Attorney's Office in 2014. 
In 2016, Binger ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the district attorney's seat in Racine County, telling the Journal Times: 'In the last two years as a prosecutor, I have won 13 jury trials. I have convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, drunk drivers, home-invading burglars and men who abuse women.'
He is married to Nicole Gustafson-Binger, a mental health counselor for Oakwood Clinical Associates. They have three children.  
In the lead up to the Rittenhouse murder trial, Binger lost the chance to link Rittenhouse to the Proud Boys extremist group. 
He was later strongly criticized by Judge Schroeder, in pre-trial hearings, after arguing that defense lawyers should not be able to tell jurors about Joseph Rosenbaum's destructive actions during the riot, including setting a dumpster on fire. 
'All we're talking about is arson. We're talking about being loud and disorderly,' Binger said.
Schroeder cut him off and raised his voice.
'I can't believe some of what you're saying,' he said. 'All we're talking about is arson? Come on!'
Schroeder during the trial reprimanded Binger for bringing up information that had previously been barred from the court about Rittenhouse's history with an AR-15 rifle. An incident was caught on video two weeks prior to the shootings in which Rittenhouse talked about shooting men he believed were shoplifting at a pharmacy.
Schroeder had already ruled video inadmissible. 
'You're an experienced trial attorney and you're telling me when the judge says, 'I'm excluding this' you decide to bring it in because you think you've found a way around it,' Schroeder asked. 'Come on!'
Binger replied: 'You can yell at me if you want. I was acting in good faith.' 
Judge Schroeder responded: 'I don't believe you. When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you. There better not be another incident.'
Rittenhouse's defense accused Binger of knowingly attempting to throw the proceeding because they were going badly for the state.
The defense on November 10 demanded a mistrial with prejudice, which would mean that Rittenhouse walks free and a retrial is not possible - a disaster for the prosecution. ",-2
1694,"“I ALWAYS HAD the American dream,” says Bernardo Mattos, sitting outside his shooting club in Rio de Janeiro. “Thank God, I fulfilled that dream.” Since he launched his club in 2018 membership has risen steadily—particularly so during the past year of pandemic. Now around 350 people come through his doors to rattle off rounds. Mr Mattos, who says he was trained by the United States armed forces, broadcasts his views to even more. He has nearly 90,000 followers on social media. He encourages whole families to shoot together; 14-year-olds are allowed to do so if accompanied by an instructor. “I succeeded in bringing the gun ideology I saw in the United States to Brazil,” he beams.
Brazil’s relationship with guns goes back a long way. In the 1970s gun ownership was commonplace in the countryside, where most people lived, recalls Ivan Marques, a lawyer and the chairman of Control Arms, an NGO. By the 1980s guns were ubiquitous and rules for buying them were lax. Even supermarkets sold them. But a rise in shootings triggered stricter laws. In 2003 Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a left-wing president, signed one that prevented ordinary citizens from buying guns—only those in the armed forces, police and prison guards could do so. It also raised the minimum age and required a background check. Although this helped temper the rise in gun deaths for a while, Brazil remained a violent place, with many illegal firearms. With 22 killings per 100,000 people each year, it has one of the world’s highest rates of gun deaths.

In contrast to his predecessors Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain elected as president in 2018, wants more people to own firearms. In his election campaign he frequently posed with weapons; when he couldn’t, he made shooting gestures with his hands. Three of his sons, who are also in politics, have posed at shooting ranges. “Allegedly they have shrines to the NRA in their homes,” quips Ilona Szabó de Carvalho of the Igarapé Institute, a think-tank.
As president, Mr Bolsonaro has tried to approve 31 legal changes that would make guns easier to get hold of. On April 12th the Supreme Court suspended two such changes—including decrees that would have increased the number of guns the armed forces, police and members of the judiciary could legally own for self-defence from four to six, and expanded even further the number of guns that could be owned by specialist hunters and collectors (who already can amass sizeable arsenals).
Despite this setback, however, Mr Bolsonaro’s gun-loving base has been emboldened. The number of registered firearms in circulation has surged by 66% since 2017, to just over a million, or one for every 200 Brazilians. This is far short of the standard set by the United States, which has more guns than people. But still, between 2017 and 2019 the number held by Brazilian hunters, sporting shooters and collectors increased by a whopping 120% (this group registered 271,000 new firearms in 2020). And unlike the United States, Brazil is a country where few animals can be shot legally, points out Mr Marques. At the moment only wild boars are fair game, as they are not an indigenous species. Brazilians can also now own different kinds of guns, and the amount of ammunition they can own has gone up (though the Supreme Court is querying these changes, too).
Shooting clubs have also multiplied. Last year more than 1,300 welcomed firearm fans, compared with just over 150 in 2019. More everyday folk are giving it a try. And that includes women, many of whom can be found at the Clube de Tiro Ponta Negra, a new place in Manaus. With 34 shooting stalls, it is the country’s largest club. “It’s incredible, the number of women who have been looking to train, join clubs, and buy guns,” gushes Monique Benetton, a 39-year-old manager who hones her aim there. Gunmakers are eager to woo female custom, some more subtly than others. On March 8th—International Womens’ Day—Taurus, Brazil’s largest gun manufacturer, launched “Strong Women”, a pink limited-edition revolver decorated with white flowers. It sold out in just three days.
Mr Bolsonaro’s pro-gun stance is mostly political. Loosening gun laws is cheap and simple. Perhaps that is why, unlike the promises he made during his campaign to improve schools and health care, Mr Bolsonaro has been able to keep his word on guns. Also, talking about pistols touches on the “identity of his core supporters”, says Rodrigo Soares, an academic. Many may have started to question Mr Bolsonaro’s handling of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 350,000 Brazilians and caused the economy to contract by 4%. His approval ratings have fallen to below 30%.
Others fear darker motives. When the heads of the army, navy and air force resigned on March 30th in protest at a cabinet reshuffle, it seemed to be a signal that they would not go along with some of Mr Bolsonaro’s anti-democratic urges. The president has spoken of “my army” and threatened to use it to prevent state governments from enforcing lockdowns. But if the armed forces can be relied on to respect the constitution, that is less clear of the police force, which is badly paid and full of bolsonaristas. Some pundits speculate that Mr Bolsonaro, who cheered on the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6th, is arming his base in preparation for 2022, when he will probably face Lula at the ballot box.
The next year or so will show whether this is hyperbole. Police officers benefit from job stability and handouts for themselves and their families, says José Vincente da Silva Filho, a retired colonel of the São Paulo state police. “They wouldn’t jeopardise these benefits to join a political adventure in distant Brasília,” he thinks.
For Mr da Silva Filho, the most worrying effect of Mr Bolsonaro’s rush to arm Brazil will be on crime. Already the statistics are bleak. Although homicide rates vary widely from one part of the country to another, they are rising overall. Last year saw 43,892 gun deaths nationwide, up from 41,730 the previous year. According to Daniel Cerqueira, an expert on guns at the Institute of Applied Economic Research, the inevitable outcome from a rise in gun culture will be “a tragedy” for Brazil—a country that, at the moment, is not short of them. ■",2
1695,"EGYPTIANS SOMETIMES call their country umm ad-dunya, the “mother of the world”. Egypt has never lacked a distinct identity: the sons of the Nile are heirs to one of the world’s oldest civilisations. Theirs is the most populous Arab state, a bridge between the heartlands to the east and the Maghreb to the west.
It was only natural that Egypt would be central to the post-war Arab order. Gamal Abdel Nasser, its second post-revolutionary president, was the charismatic voice of Arab nationalism. The Muslim Brotherhood was born in Egypt, the Arab League based there and the fight against Israel led from there. It began to end there, when Nasser’s successor, Anwar Sadat, signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, a betrayal that played a part in his murder. But that decision, along with his efforts at economic liberalisation and pivot towards America, signalled an ideological shift away from the statist policies and Soviet leanings of the Nasser years.

Egypt ceded its central position during Hosni Mubarak’s dictatorship. He ruled for 30 years yet aspired to little beyond self-preservation. If he accomplished anything it was to unmake his predecessors’ order. The army state became a police state: though a former officer, Mr Mubarak relied on civilian agencies to secure his rule. The socialism of Nasser and the economic opening under Sadat gave way to unchecked crony capitalism. Corruption and an effort to create an inherited presidency led to his downfall.
Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi invites comparisons to his charismatic predecessor, another military man who led a coup and smashed the Brotherhood. But unlike Nasser, he is no ideologue. He has core beliefs—an abiding faith in the army and a mistrust of civilians. Yet he shows no interest in regional leadership. Instead he has a narrow sense of Egypt’s interests and his own priorities.
With 102m people Egypt can seem ungovernable. It has one of the fastest-growing populations in the world: the number of Egyptians has doubled since 1987, and despite efforts to lower the fertility rate (now 3.3 children per woman, down from over 5 in the 1980s) the UN expects the population to reach 160m by 2050. These people will be crammed into a country that, though quite large, is mostly uninhabitable. Some 95% of Egyptians live on 5% of its land. Efforts to build new cities in the desert have mostly failed.

The government trumpets strong GDP growth of 5.3% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2019. Even last year, when covid-19 ravaged the world, Egypt’s economy grew by 3.6%. Yet those rosy figures do not tell the full story. A burgeoning oil and gas sector contributes almost 24% of Egypt’s GDP, says Tarek al-Molla, the petroleum minister. This is good for the treasury, but does little to provide jobs for the unemployed who number 10% of the population and 26% of young people. The purchasing managers’ index, a measure of private-sector activity, has spent most of the past five years contracting. As many as 30% of Egyptians fell below the official poverty line of 857 pounds ($55) a month at the end of 2020.
Military in the market
Even more problematic is the army’s stranglehold on the economy. It is difficult to put a dollar figure on its empire, since its accounts are not subject to scrutiny. But to take one example, it has cornered the cement industry, flooding the market with so much extra supply that private producers have gone out of business. It operates the country’s biggest fertiliser plant and the region’s largest fish farm, both projects that Mr Sisi personally inaugurated.
He cuts the image of a man on the move, a leader scrambling to develop his country. One of his advisers suggests, rather patronisingly, that Egyptians since the time of the pharaohs have admired leaders who build big things. The biggest among those is the new capital rising in the deserts east of Cairo.
Egyptians often call Cairo Masr, the Arabic name for Egypt itself: country and capital are inseparable. One in four live in greater Cairo, an agglomeration that stretches more than 40km (25 miles) from its historic centre. A city that once felt timeless is changing at a dizzying pace. The emptying of Tahrir Square is but one example. On the drive from the airport one passes through Heliopolis, an affluent area that was one of the few leafy redoubts amid the concrete. No longer: workers have denuded more than 400,000 square metres of green space to make room for new roads.
Approaching the Nile on the 6th of October flyover, a notoriously congested road, a visitor sees a huge construction site. The so-called “Maspero triangle”, a wedge of land behind the foreign ministry, is being razed, its poor inhabitants dispersed to slums on the outskirts of Cairo to make room for a fancy mixed-use development in a sort of caricature of gentrification. Some of this frenzied building is helpful. New roads have eased the capital’s hellish traffic, even if Google maps cannot keep up. Yet some Egyptians see an ulterior motive: the urban landscape of Cairo is being reshaped to meet authoritarian goals. Shaded boulevards make a nice gathering spot for protesters, as do pedestrian-friendly squares. Most striking, of course, is the new capital, an effort to separate the government from its people.
Like many post-war Arab republics, Egypt’s military regimes enforce domestic security by throwing in more people. The state-security agency is thought to have had more than 100,000 employees, three times the size of America’s FBI, with a network of informants numbering millions. If you lived in Cairo during the Mubarak years, it was a safe bet that your doorman was on their payroll. Even with such a wide net, the regime could not be in all places at all times. The Sisi government is building a more modern autocracy. A law in 2018 required ride-sharing apps to share data with the government. A year later the government signed a contract with Honeywell of America to install 6,000 cameras across the new capital, linked to a “command centre” run by the army.
Egyptian officials express admiration for China’s ability to deliver growth and development while keeping the party in power. Mr Sisi has launched a programme called Itnayn Kifaya (Two is Enough), an echo of China’s recently abandoned policy. The picture is of a government aspiring to be like China’s, with a flurry of state-directed development and a tight hold on its population.
In his first years as president Mr Sisi seemed more interested in Africa, neglected under Mr Mubarak, than in the Arab world. Aides spoke of the economic opportunity south of the Sahara; in the Middle East they saw only headaches, most of which Egypt had no need for. Lately, though, Mr Sisi has become a fixture in Arab diplomacy. Saad Hariri, the ex-prime minister nominated as prime minister-designate in Lebanon last October, was a surprisingly frequent visitor to Cairo this year. Lebanon has been a regional battleground for decades: Syria, Iran, Israel and the Gulf states all vie for influence. Not Egypt, though, which largely sat out the Saudi-Iranian proxy struggle and has few interests in the Levant.
Egypt brokered the ceasefire that ended a brief war between Israel and Hamas in May. It has played a big part in the civil war in neighbouring Libya. In July Mr Sisi’s spy chiefs even held talks in Cairo with their Iranian counterparts, an unusual step for a country that has historically steered clear of Arab-Iranian disputes.
But Mr Sisi’s wider role is largely meant to safeguard a narrow set of Egyptian priorities. His interests in Libya and Gaza are obvious: they border Egypt and have long been a source of insecurity. Elsewhere he has an eye on the Gulf states. Egypt wants their support in its dispute with Ethiopia, which last year began to fill a massive new dam on the Nile. Seen from Cairo, this is a serious threat: a water-poor country with a fast-growing population cannot tolerate any reduction in its water supply. Acting as an interlocutor with Lebanon and Iran may give Mr Sisi some credit with the Gulf states that he can spend on more pressing issues.
Mr Sisi has been happy to break with his closest partners in the region. He largely refused to send troops to the Saudi-led war in Yemen in 2015—an understandable decision for a country that has already fought one ruinous war there, but a disappointment to the Gulf states that spent billions backing him after the coup. He also diverged early from the Arab consensus on Syria, allowing Mr Assad to reopen his embassy in Cairo in 2013 and later backing the Russian intervention that saved the embattled Syrian dictator.
Nasser was a gifted orator whose speeches still make the rounds on social media. He is remembered for strident remarks about colonialism and Israel; in one famous speech, he berates the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood for seeking to impose headscarves on Egyptian women. Today’s president browbeats his subjects to exercise more and work harder. Yet it is hard to imagine Egyptians a generation hence feeling nostalgic for Mr Sisi’s monotonous lectures. In a way, though, this makes him a fitting avatar for modern-day Arabism: a leader who aspires not to reshape the region, but merely to hold his own country together.■

1696,"NORTH KOREA is not the only supposed success story in Asia’s fight against covid-19. In the middle of the continent, on the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan too has seemingly managed to go the past two years without a single recorded infection. Under President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov (pictured) its lucky citizens have been living in an “Era of Might and Happiness”. What is more, their president entertains them too, roaring around in racing cars, scoring bullseyes on the rifle range and catching whoppers on fishing expeditions. The economy is said to have grown some 6% last year. The country’s 6m people are prospering.
That, at any rate, is the official picture. The reality is quite different. Wage arrears are rife. The black-market value of the manat, the country’s currency, is a seventh of the official rate. Even the usually upbeat president has fretted about Turkmenistan’s swelling debt, though its precise scale is kept secret. The Asian Development Bank reckons GDP grew a modest 1.6% in 2020 as energy prices slumped and Chinese demand for natural gas fell. Gas accounts for 90% of Turkmenistan’s exports; China for 80% of its trade.

Exports have bounced back with the recent surge in demand for natural gas, but an inflexible contract with China has prevented Turkmenistan from reaping the full rewards of skyrocketing prices. The Taliban’s takeover of neighbouring Afghanistan has made even more unlikely already stalled plans to build a pipeline to carry gas to new markets in South Asia. The militants say they want the pipeline to go ahead, but few foreign backers are keen.
Though the government’s propagandists try their best to present the country as a land of plenty, Turkmenistanis are all too aware of the real state of the economy. State television shows shops with overflowing shelves, but “in reality people go at 4-5am to queue at state food shops,” says Farid Tukhbatullin, who heads the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR), an advocacy group based in Vienna. Most citizens dare not complain “because they fear the person next to them could be an informer”, he says.
People who do question the official line are harassed by security men. Soltan Achilova, a 72-year-old journalist in Ashgabat, the capital, who earlier this year publicly criticised the government for shortages of flour and cooking oil, which are subsidised, has faced threats, attacks and arrest as a result of her reports to Chronicles of Turkmenistan, TIHR’s news website.
Last year a young man named Nurgeldi Halykov was jailed after sharing with Turkmen.news, an independent news outlet based in the Netherlands, a photo on Instagram that drew attention to a visiting delegation from the UN’s World Health Organisation. Officials continued to deny covid was present even after the British ambassador caught it last year. “Turkmenistan never fails,” the editor of Turkmen.news, Ruslan Myatiev, notes wryly. Social-media networks and news websites are blocked. Police surveil mobile phones for software that can circumvent such censorship. Turkmenistanis cannot even access Zoom.
Such heavy-handed repression has kept Mr Berdymukhamedov, who styles himself Arkadag (“The Protector”), in power since 2007, nearly half of Turkmenistan’s existence as an independent state. Yet the absence of credible information also causes wild rumours to circulate, such as when the president, whose health is said to be failing, disappeared from public view in 2019. Many Turkmenistanis believed he was dead.
Earlier this year Mr Berdymukhamedov appointed his 40-year-old son, Serdar, as deputy prime minister answerable only to the president. Two months later the younger Berdymukhamedov was made head of the country’s horse association. The local Akhal-Teke horses and Alabai dogs play an important role in the president’s personality cult. Photographs aired this summer showing Serdar astride a thoroughbred, a gift from his father, again fuelled speculation among Turkmenistanis about a coming succession. A dynasty appears to be in the offing.■",2
1697,"ON MAY 9TH China’s foreign ministry was asked to comment on an atrocity in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Terrorists had detonated a car bomb outside a girls’ school, then two more bombs to kill pupils running for safety. At least 68 people had died, most of them children. The attack was aimed at girls from a Shia minority that is often targeted by Sunni Islamist groups, which have brought much misery to Afghanistan. Today such groups are jostling for blood-soaked advantage ahead of a full withdrawal of American forces, at the latest by September 11th this year, as ordered by President Joe Biden. China’s diplomats could have responded to the latest violence in several plausible ways.
It would have been reasonable for the foreign ministry to tell the largest militant group, the Taliban, to rein in the mayhem, for China enjoys growing leverage over the Taliban’s leaders. That may seem counterintuitive. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has expressed hope that future Afghan governments will embrace moderate Islam: an apparent rebuke of Taliban-style zealotry. Across the border, in China’s north-western region of Xinjiang, officials have demolished mosques and banned young people from public prayers. In all perhaps a million Muslims, most of them from the Uyghur minority, have passed through re-education camps in Xinjiang, set up to cure them of excessively religious or “backwards” thinking, and to turn them into biddable workers, loyal to the Chinese motherland.

But the Taliban can be both fanatical and pragmatic, it turns out. Their leaders hope to rule Afghanistan soon, a quarter of a century after they first subjected the country to a reign of pious terror. Especially over the past three years, say scholars and diplomats in Beijing and other capitals, links between the Afghan Taliban and China have grown remarkably. Anxious for political recognition and economic backing from their giant neighbour, Taliban delegations have approved of Chinese plans to build motorways between Afghan cities. They claim to support a Chinese-funded project near Kabul to create one of the world’s largest copper mines, which has been stalled for years by concerns about ancient Buddhist ruins on the site and by fears of militant attacks.
Privately, it is said, the Taliban have signalled that they do not care about Xinjiang. That relates to China’s main interest in Afghanistan: to prevent that unhappy country from sliding into chaos and becoming a haven or transit corridor for Uyghur militants who, China is sure, lurk in the region. Those fighters, China believes, include some with combat experience in Syria, some trained by Iran, and others who hope to enter Xinjiang through lawless tribal regions of Pakistan.
It would have been reasonable, too, for China to have asked Pakistan to help stem the bloodshed. Pakistan is the Taliban’s patron, and has prodded the Afghan militants to establish ties with China. Pakistan likes to be useful to China, its most important sponsor. But the ministry chose a different response. After deploring the murder of the schoolgirls in Kabul, its spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, singled out America for blame. She charged that the “abrupt” announcement of America’s exit from Afghanistan had “led to a series of explosive attacks throughout the country”. She called on foreign troops “to pull out in a responsible manner and avoid inflicting more turmoil and suffering on the Afghan people”.
This is a new criticism. Chinese scholars and state media have spent years accusing American forces of straying beyond their original mission to eradicate al-Qaeda and of spreading turmoil with their naive dreams of Western-style nation-building. More recently, they have asserted that America will surely leave behind covert operatives after its troops leave, in part to make trouble for China. In short, China believes that America has stayed too long in Afghanistan, is departing too hastily and is not really leaving at all.
That line of argument is tangled enough. Making it more so, Chinese officials now call Afghanistan an area of possible co-operation with America, along with climate change and efforts to curb nuclear proliferation. When pressed for detail, including at a recent meeting with American counterparts in Anchorage, Chinese envoys are vague. A few years ago China and America did jointly train Afghan diplomats and police. These days China stresses the importance of its Belt and Road Initiative: how the infrastructure-building scheme can promote Afghan development and thus stability, such as by connecting the country to the sea via Pakistan.
Afghanistan once saw remarkable co-operation. Early in the war on terror, President George W. Bush’s administration designated a Uyghur group, the East Turkistan Independence Movement ( ETIM), as terrorists. Chinese agents were allowed to interrogate Uyghurs detained in Guantánamo Bay. They told one Uyghur he was lucky to be in American hands, since “as soon as they got him back to China, he was dead”, his lawyer later told Congress. Such joint action is unthinkable now: the two sides are so far apart on Xinjiang. In 2020 the Trump administration delisted ETIM as a terror group, expressing doubts that it still existed. China says it is a grave menace.
To China, nothing matters more than stability
China sees its positions as coherent. Singling out America as a troublemaker is logical. It also distrusts the Taliban, Pakistan and Iran, but those actors have reasons to bow to China’s will, so do not need public scolding. In contrast, America is a dangerous rival that has made bad mistakes, so is an ideal target for criticism. China may support regional or UN peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, if its neighbour seems on the brink of civil war. But it will not send its own troops to keep order, at least under a Chinese flag, because its neighbour is a “graveyard of empires”. Afghanistan’s case is revealing. China is emerging as a great power that—to an exceptional degree—trusts in cold, hard economic and security interests alone. To China, self-interest is wisdom. ■",2
1698,"New York (CNN Business)A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general have launched an investigation into Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on children and teens.  The announcement follows extensive reporting on a trove of internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Some of those documents show that the company's own researchers have found that Instagram can damage young users' mental health and body image, and can exacerbate dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders.  The attorneys general say they will look into whether, by continuing to provide and promote Instagram despite knowing of the potential harms, Meta violated consumer protection laws and ""put the public at risk."" The states involved include California, Florida, Kentucky and Vermont. ""Facebook, now Meta, has failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health -- exploiting children in the interest of profit,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigation, said in a statement. She added that the coalition hopes to ""get to the bottom of this company's engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good."" Meta (FB) spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement that the allegations made by the attorneys general are false and said they ""demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts."" He also noted that the company plans to launch features to help teens regulate their use of Instagram, such as a ""Take a Break"" reminder, which was announced in October amid intense scrutiny.  ""While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,"" the statement reads. ""We continue to develop parental supervision controls and are exploring ways to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for teens by default."" The investigation is the latest escalation of regulatory pressure on Meta related to findings from the leaked internal documents, which have come to be known as the Facebook Papers. Earlier this week, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that it misled the public about its algorithm and the harms its apps can cause to users, causing losses for shareholders when those things were revealed. (Meta says the suit is without merit.) Senator Richard Blumenthal has also asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about the effects of Instagram on children. The Wall Street Journal first reported in September on what the company's own documents and research show about the potential harms to young people from its apps, and said Facebook knew Instagram was ""toxic"" for teen girls. In one internal report from 2019 on the mental health effects of Instagram cited by the Journal and reviewed by CNN Business, company researchers said ""we make body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls."" Meta has also pushed back on the Journal's reporting, and said its apps do more good than harm.  Following the Journal's report, a Senate subcommittee called a hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone Davis, where lawmakers grilled her on Instagram's effects on kids. Davis said the company was ""looking for ways to release more research"" that she suggested might paint a different picture about the platform. Haugen has also testified to lawmakers that she believes Meta's platforms ""harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.""  The company announced it was pausing plans to develop a version of Instagram designed for kids in late September, amid the fallout from the Journal report.  ""While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we've decided to pause this project,"" Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote in a blog post at the time. ""This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.""

1699,"TWENTY YEARS ago America set out to reshape the world order after the attacks of September 11th. Today it is easy to conclude that its foreign policy has been abandoned on a runway at Kabul airport. President Joe Biden says the exit from Afghanistan was about “ending an era” of distant wars, but it has left America’s allies distraught and its enemies gleeful. Most Americans are tired of it all: roughly two-thirds say the war wasn’t worth it. Yet the national mood of fatigue and apathy is a poor guide to America’s future role in the world. Its capabilities remain formidable and its strategy can be retooled for the 21st century, provided the right lessons are drawn from the post-9/11 era.
The murder of 3,000 people on American soil provoked a reaction that highlighted America’s “unipolar moment”. For a while, it appeared to have uncontested power. President George W. Bush declared that the world was either with America or against it. NATO said the assault on the twin towers was an attack on all its members. Vladimir Putin pledged Russian military co-operation; Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, called this the real end of the cold war. The ease with which American-led forces routed the Taliban seemed to augur a new kind of light-touch warfare: 63 days after September 11th, Kabul fell. There have been enduring achievements since then. Counter-terrorism efforts have improved: Osama bin Laden is dead and no remotely comparable attack on America has succeeded. Lower Manhattan has been rebuilt in style.

But for the most part the legacy of the response to September 11th has been a bitter one. The mission to crush al-Qaeda morphed into a desire for regime change and nation-building that delivered unconvincing results in Afghanistan and Iraq, at a huge human and fiscal cost. Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction were a mirage. America broke its taboo on torture and lost the moral high ground. The initial, illusory, sense of clarity about when it should intervene militarily faded into indecision, for example over Syria’s use of chemical weapons in 2013. At home the spirit of unity quickly evaporated and America’s toxic divisions mocked its claim to have a superior form of government. The mire in the Middle East has been a distraction from the real story of the early 21st century, the rise of China.

Mr Biden’s debacle in Kabul makes a grim epilogue. Some will see in it proof not only of American incompetence, but also of decline. That is going too far. The fall of Saigon did not lead to the West losing the cold war. And for all America’s flaws—its divisions, debts and decrepit infrastructure—many facets of its power are intact. Its share of global GDP, at 25%, is roughly what it was in the 1990s. It is still technologically and militarily pre-eminent. Although public opinion has turned inwards, America’s interests are far more global than during its isolationist phase in the 1930s. With 9m citizens abroad, 39m jobs supported by trade and $33trn of foreign assets, it has a strong interest in an open world.
Its foreign policy shifted under Barack Obama, who tried a “pivot” to Asia and to scale back the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Donald Trump’s detour into bombast and transactional dealmaking was a disaster, though he helped end America’s illusions about China. Mr Biden is well qualified to pick up the pieces, with long experience in foreign affairs and advisers who are crafting a Biden doctrine. Its goals are to end the forever wars, complete the pivot to Asia, tackle new spheres such as cyber-security and rebuild global alliances.
The Economist supports much of this agenda, not least the emphasis on 21st-century priorities such as climate change. The administration’s attitude to women’s rights is better than its predecessor’s, and that could affect geopolitics more than most people realise. But important elements of the Biden doctrine are worryingly fuzzy. The abandoning of Afghanistan has angered allies, who were barely consulted. A confrontational approach to China may blur the focus on climate change.
Overarching the doctrine is an insistence that foreign policy must serve America’s middle class. “Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind,” he has said. Trade, climate and China are simultaneously domestic and foreign concerns. In one sense this is obvious: all countries act in their long-run self-interest, and strength at home is a prerequisite of strength abroad. However, the impulse to make decisions about the world to please a domestic audience is already causing problems.

In Afghanistan an artificial deadline for withdrawal (by September 11th) was fixed to please voters at home, and a decision to remove all troops ignored the reality that a modest American garrison could have stopped the Taliban from taking over. On covid-19, America has missed the chance to lead a global vaccination campaign that would have won it gratitude and goodwill and demonstrated American prowess.
The risk is that Mr Biden’s domestic bias could make his foreign policy less effective. America needs to find a new way to co-exist with China, with rivalry and co-operation in different areas. Yet Mr Biden’s China policy is remarkably like Mr Trump’s, with an ad-hoc array of tariffs in place and rhetoric about a zero-sum contest. He knows that hostility to China is one of the few things that unites Congress and the public: 45% of Americans view China as America’s greatest enemy, up from 14% in 2001.
America still needs to be prepared to use military power to protect human rights abroad. Mr Biden has come close to ruling this out. The world’s despots may have noticed. Mr Biden rightly aims to revive America’s alliances, which multiply its influence. Yet his protectionism hurts allies, from America-first public contracts to $50bn of semiconductor subsidies. His administration shows little interest in a comprehensive Asian trade deal that would counter China.
Foreign policy is guided by events as much as by strategy: Mr Bush ran on a platform of compassionate conservatism, not a war on terror. Mr Biden must improvise in response to an unruly age. But he should not imagine that a foreign policy subordinate to fraught domestic politics will revitalise America’s claim to lead the world.■",2
1700,"LAST-MINUTE APPEALS are common in the weeks preceding the COP, the UN’s annual climate summit. Green groups urge world leaders to promise bold action. Poor countries ask rich ones for money. Ahead of this year’s event, which starts in Glasgow on October 31st, a group representing indigenous people is asking for donations of jackets, wellies and waterproofs. It notes that Amazonian indigenous folk who plan to attend “have not experienced a climate like a Scottish winter”.
This year’s summit is COP26—the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It marks the most important climate talks since 2015, when the Paris agreement was signed. That is largely because of what countries promised they would do by this point. All countries are supposed to have announced tough new targets for reducing emissions. Rich countries are supposed to be helping poor ones finance green schemes. On both fronts, the world is coming up short. The proceedings in Glasgow may be chilly indeed.

The Paris agreement was adopted by the vast majority of countries. They promised to try to keep the increase in the Earth’s mean surface temperature to “well below” 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels, and ideally to no more than 1.5°C. In terms of the detrimental impact of global warming, the gap between those two targets is large. But temperatures have already risen by 1.1-1.3°C since the invention of the steam engine. So limiting heating to 1.5°C is a colossal task. To have a good chance of achieving it, the world must make net emissions of carbon dioxide 45% lower in 2030 than they were in 2010, and reduce them to zero by the middle of this century.
The Paris agreement did not demand such cuts—nor could it have done so. Instead countries pledged themselves to emission-reduction strategies known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The NDCs brought to the table in Paris did not match the agreement’s lofty aims. They put the world on track to be around 3°C hotter than the pre-industrial baseline by 2100. But the treaty required that every five years all parties should up their game with new, more ambitious NDCs. The Glasgow conference (which is taking place a year later than planned, because of covid-19) is the due date for the first round of beefed-up pledges.
Governments began announcing new pledges last year. Rich countries have been more ambitious than poor ones. The European Union (EU) promises that by the end of the decade it will have cut emissions by 55% compared with 1990 levels. It had previously promised only a 40% decline. America says that by 2030 it will have cut emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels. It had previously proposed only a 26-28% cut by 2025. These two parties account for 23% of the world’s carbon-dioxide emissions.
A lot of hot air
Australia is an outlier among rich countries. Its original NDC was not particularly ambitious. Nor is its new one. Meanwhile many emerging economies have set lax targets. Russia and Indonesia are promising no new effort. By employing some creative carbon accounting, Mexico and Brazil have produced new strategies that are less ambitious than their original plans.
India, which is responsible for 7% of carbon-dioxide emissions, has not yet published a fresh climate strategy. Nor has China, which accounts for 28%. Last year it said that it planned to make its emissions peak “before” 2030, having previously said only that it would reach this milestone “around” that time. Many would like it to bring this date forward, but Li Shuo of Greenpeace thinks that is unlikely to happen soon. He says there is more chance China might strengthen its pledge by declaring an absolute figure above which its annual emissions will not rise.

Taken together, the new targets underwhelm. Promises made by the middle of this year give a 50% chance of keeping warming below 2.1°C but only a 5% chance of keeping it under 1.5°C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), a forecaster (see chart). And this assumes that all the pledges are honoured, which is far from guaranteed.
On the tail of these lacklustre announcements is a failure relating to funding for developing countries. In 2009 rich countries vowed that by 2020 they would be providing poor ones with $100bn in climate finance each year. Roughly equal amounts were to go towards adaptation and to reducing emissions. The figure is a fraction of the $2trn annual investment that the IEA believes developing countries need. But the promise is supposed to signal the willingness of richer countries to make sacrifices for the good of the planet.

In 2019 only $80bn was provided, according to the OECD, a club of rich countries. This year a last-minute whip-round could perhaps see the total rise above $100bn before the conference. But poor countries are miffed. The original deadline was 2020—when, because of the pandemic, the total was probably lower even than in 2019. And only about 25% of the cash is financing ways of adapting to climate change, instead of the 50% promised.
All these disappointments will cause hand-wringing at the summit. Rich countries may re-emphasise their willingness to lend. They may offer an aggregate figure over several years, such as $500bn between 2020 and 2025. But no country is likely to swiftly adjust its new NDC. Designing them takes months of work and co-ordination across government departments.
Instead, progress in Glasgow will probably have to come from agreements struck in narrower debates, the outcomes of which will help countries implement their existing climate strategies, and make them more likely to increase their ambitions in the future. One job is to agree on rules for international carbon markets, such as what double-counting means when it comes to carbon credits.
A second debate is about “loss and damage”, meaning how far countries that will suffer most from climate change should receive compensation. The topic is taboo among rich countries. In Paris they eventually allowed the concept to be mentioned in the agreement, but resisted language that might actually lead to something being done. Poor countries hope to move it up the agenda and to lay the groundwork for more concrete discussions in the future.
Third comes the effort to get governments to sign up to sector-level pledges, such as to stop burning coal, ban the sale of internal-combustion engines and halt deforestation. The Global Methane Pledge, a promising new pact, calls for cutting global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Its backers include America and the EU. Measured over 20 years, a tonne of methane causes 86 times more warming than a tonne of carbon dioxide but the gas is naturally removed from the atmosphere much faster than CO2. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition, made up of governments and lobby groups, says cutting human-made methane emissions in half by 2050 could lower temperatures by about 0.2°C.
The fourth topic is what Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute, a think-tank, calls “keeping 1.5°C alive”. Green groups and some governments want countries to acknowledge that the world is failing to slow global warming, and to state explicitly that they wish to keep the increase under 1.5°C. China and India refused to back a similar statement at the G20 summit in July. They feel that if the temperature targets are revised the same should happen to the climate-finance goals.

A global energy shortage provides an unfortunate backdrop to the discussions. In Asia coal shortages are forcing factories to curb output. European gas and power prices have gone berserk. Governments are watching Joe Biden try to get legislation containing support for clean-energy firms through Congress. The wrangling is a reminder of the difficulties democratic countries face when they seek to enact big climate reforms.
Covid-19 has increased the costs and risks of getting negotiators to the summit. Poor countries, in particular, may send fewer than usual. Even in normal times they are at a disadvantage to rich places, which can send hordes of technocrats. The fact that many rich countries appear to be past the worst of the pandemic, while poor ones are still struggling through it, will only make such inequalities rankle more.
Block parties
All this could deepen the usual factionalism. Delegations attending the COP typically form three blocks. Poor countries ask rich ones for more ambition and more money. Rich countries try to convince emerging ones, which account for the lion’s share of the growth in emissions, to pollute less. And emerging economies try to tell rich countries that they are in fact part of the poor and vulnerable group, while also reminding rich countries that they got where they are today by polluting.
Yet there are some signs that these old alliances are loosening. Emerging economies have less excuse for inaction than they did when Donald Trump was in the White House, says Laurence Tubiana of the European Climate Foundation, a lobby group (Mr Trump pulled America out of the Paris agreement; it rejoined in February). Some, such as South Africa, are becoming more ambitious. In September China said it would no longer finance new coal-fired power stations outside its borders. Natural disasters in rich countries, such as floods in Germany that killed almost 200 people, may bring a new sense of urgency.
Any progress made at COP26 will probably be incremental, not a “big leap” of the sort John Kerry, America’s climate envoy, has promised. That will enrage grassroots activists. And it hardly matches the scale of the challenge. Two years from now a “Global Stocktake” scheduled under the Paris agreement will examine how well governments are implementing their climate plans. If their most recent climate promises are any indication, the stocktake could reveal a rather bare cupboard.■

1702,"ARLINGTON, HOME of Robert E. Lee and a cemetery dug vengefully on his front lawn, is barely in Virginia these days. The city’s tony apartments and IT firms have long made it feel like an extension of Washington. That, in turn, made it relatively safe for Joe Biden, one cold and blowy evening this week, to flit across the Potomac and dip his toes into Virginia’s gubernatorial race.
It would have been awkward had he not, given how many Democratic big-hitters have flooded the state as the contest between Terry McAuliffe and Glenn Youngkin has tightened. But no one expected the increasingly troubled president to move many votes. Even the irrepressible Mr McAuliffe, a force field of positivity and Mr Biden’s friend for 40 years, admits that he is unpopular in the commonwealth. This was implicit in the arrangements made for the presidential visit. Only a tiny corner of a large Arlington park had been fenced off and floodlit for it—to create the safest possible space in the most reliably Democratic city of a state that Mr Biden won last year by ten points.

Only a modest Democratic crowd duly showed up. And its members seemed ambivalent about the president. Asked for their opinion of him, some said they were “indifferent”, others claimed to have “no view”. Several of those quizzed by Lexington said they knew nobody who was enthusiastic about him. “That’s not really what he’s about,” said one woman, jiggling a “Terry for Virginia” sign. Just one person, an India-born woman huddled in the gloom, richly praised the administration. She worked for a hospital lobby and loved its increased health-care spending.
As Mr Biden’s approval ratings have dived in recent months, solid arguments have been offered in his defence. Most presidents lose support in their first year, as the thermostatic nature of public opinion asserts itself. And indeed his descent from 56% approval after his inauguration to the low 40s today is similar to the slides Barack Obama and Donald Trump suffered. Mr Biden has also faced daunting headwinds, in the resurgence of covid-19, the economic havoc it has wreaked and the fact that half of Americans have not heard a good word said about him, so polarised have the media become. History is against him in Virginia, too. As one of the first states to vote after a general election, it often bloodies the nose of whichever party occupies the White House. Yet such rationalisations cannot lessen the gravity of his predicament.
Mr Obama fell from such a high level after his first election that he remained in positive territory. Mr Trump was never popular outside his base—yet the more unpopular he got, the more its members loved him. Taking the fight to the liberal mainstream was his shtick. Neither ameliorating factor applies to Mr Biden. He won by a much narrower margin than Mr Obama’s, which in itself called the Biden shtick (his promise to unite the country against Trumpism) into question. And that tension has increased as his numbers have worsened.
In Arlington Mr Biden again focused, in his shouty way, on his predecessor. “Remember this: I ran against Donald Trump and Terry is running against an acolyte of Donald Trump!” The limits of that message were exposed in the general election, not only by Mr Trump’s robust losing performance, but also by how little damage other Republican candidates suffered by association. And the former president is even less of a bogie today. Most voters—especially independents, among whom Mr Biden’s slide has been steepest—appear to have put him from their minds. Moreover, it becomes increasingly hard to present yourself as a uniter, not a divider, when more than half the country thinks you’re doing badly.
If Mr Biden cannot reverse that impression, the outcome for his party will be grim. Mid-terms are a referendum on the president, not his predecessor. His dire ratings are therefore setting Democrats up for a hiding. History suggests they are consistent with their losing control of both chambers. It also shows how hard it will be for Mr Biden to claw his way back.
Among his recent predecessors, only Bill Clinton has staged a major public-opinion comeback in peacetime, and he had the advantages of an excellent economy and quicksilver political skills. Mr Biden has neither. He is above all tied to covid-19, the sort of fundamental that is far more determinative of political success or failure than most coverage suggests. Political performance tends to be less of a factor; but there too Mr Biden is in trouble.
By recent standards, his administration has performed creditably. It is led by serious people, unlike its predecessor. And he appears on track, despite Democrats’ slim congressional majority, to sign more major legislation in his first year than Mr Obama. The debacle in Afghanistan, which hit Mr Biden’s ratings hard, was a blot, yet one that received blanket coverage in part because of how uncharacteristic of the administration it was. Such incompetence, which was expected of the Trump administration, is atypical of Mr Biden’s—save in one respect, its ability to sell its aims and accomplishments, at which he and his party are abject.
Hardly any non-lobbyist in the Arlington crowd could name a significant thing the administration had done. Most knew congressional Democrats were haggling over the cost of a spending package, but struggled to recall almost any of the climate and social policies it contained. And this was in arguably the most educated, switched-on, centre-left place in the country. The chances of independent voters in Milwaukee or El Paso having half a clue as to what Mr Biden is attempting would appear to be close to zero.
In his labyrinth
Mr Trump was always selling his record, even when it didn’t exist. By contrast Mr Biden and his party are not making a case for what they are actually doing. Mr Clinton’s guru, James Carville, suggests they dislike salesmanship. Or perhaps Mr Biden is no good at it. Either way, he is falling short. If elections are about the future, as Mr Clinton liked to say, they cannot only be about Mr Trump. ■

Despite a pandemic and savage slump in 2020, the net income of large American firms for the third quarter of this year is expected to exceed $400bn. Yet as the earnings season gets into full swing three worries are circulating: supply-chain tangles, inflation and wages, and concerns that competition is intensifying in some industries.",2
1704,"THE FIRST signs may go unnoticed. An individual might sicken here; another might die there. As few need reminding in 2021, death enters countries quietly. For trees, as for people, a whisper of unease may mark the arrival of a new disease. But as from tiny acorns, mighty oaks, so from small beginnings, devastating diseases.
Nobody is counting the trees Britain has lost to diseases, because it is difficult to keep track of millions of hectares of woodland. But on ash and elm, oak and beech, horse chestnut, alder and larch, diseases are spreading. Some kill. In London the leaves of horse-chestnut trees curl, brown and wither long before autumn arrives. In Devon and in Cumbria, ailing ash trees lift their skeletal silver fingers to the sky. In Dumfries and Galloway, hillsides of larch have been felled.

This is the era of the treedemic, which is not one disease, but many. Some are mild; others reshape the landscape. When Dutch elm disease swept across Britain in the 1960s and 1970s it was described as a national tragedy, but it was not the whole tragedy. It was the messenger speech, a warning of what is to come. Twenty-odd diseases have come to Britain since the 1960s; over 40 others, it is feared, might yet come. Attempts are being made to slow them. Forestry Commission helicopters hover over Britain, searching for signs of disease and issuing felling orders.
On an autumn day at the edge of Lake Windermere in the Lake District, Great Knott Wood sits in sunshine. This is archetypal English woodland, not particularly dark or deep but with cultural roots that spread far into the national story. Wordsworth wandered here, exulting at “Nature’s fairest forms”. Now some of those forms are threatened. Sudden larch death, which arrived in Britain in 2002, has just been found here. Within six months, says Heather Swift, the Cumbria site manager for the Woodland Trust, a charity, every larch tree in this area will have been felled.
The reason for all this devastation is simple: trees are not meant to move. Seeds might travel a few metres, or a few miles if eaten by a bird or animal. But outside Middle Earth and “Macbeth”, the plant itself should stay put. Instead vast numbers are travelling, more and farther every year. Over the past three decades, the global horticulture industry has grown so rapidly that it puts weeds in the shade. Forests are on the move and, as when Birnam Wood came to Dunsinane, this bodes ill.
Buy a potted plant and you may assume that you have bought a single species. You have not. In a recent paper in the Journal of Fungi, Alexandra Puertolas and three co-authors analysed the soil in 99 woody plants bought in Britain and the Netherlands: 90% contained organisms capable of causing diseases, some serious. It is perhaps better to think of bought trees less as plants in pots than as Petri dishes of potential pathogens which also contain a tree.
Worse still, they often do not contain the diseases of one area alone. Many enjoy an arboreal “grand tour” of Europe before being planted in British soil. Trees are not obliged to carry the country of origin, or of where they are grown, on their labels. Dieback led to regulations for ash trees being tightened in 2012, explains Richard Buggs, a senior researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, but other trees travel far. A single sapling might start life in the Netherlands and then be sent to Italy (trees grow faster where it’s sunnier) before returning, via Germany, to Britain. Like many a European grand tourist, such a tree can become riddled with disease.
The globalisation of tree cultivation means that many countries are experiencing similar problems. But they are unusually severe in Britain, which has few tree nurseries and is one of the least wooded countries in Europe, a fact it is trying to change. The value of tree imports has increased from £6m in 1992 (£12.5m in 2019 prices; $16m), to £93m today, an increase of nearly 650%. The Forestry Commission counted 4.25m new trees planted in Britain in the 12 months ending in April; the Woodland Trust, a charity, has pledged to plant 50m trees by 2025.
The potential impact of tree disease, however, dwarfs such numbers. Britain is home to 150m ash trees, and many more saplings, all of which might be infected by ash dieback. Of the trees infected, it is estimated that 90-99% will die. Dead trees must be removed (especially if they overhang roads and railways) and their environmental benefits are lost. Researchers at Oxford University have estimated that the cost of tree death on such a scale will be £15bn (0.7% of GDP).
Root cause
Humans have been exploiting forests for millennia. Ancient Roman bathers were warmed by fires kindled with North African trees. Captain Cook returned from Botany Bay with a ship filled with botanical samples. But Roman merchants and Enlightenment explorers transported dead trees and live seeds. Now, live trees are being moved. The analogy is less with dead timber than with live animals, in particular humans. “When Europeans colonised America they took with them diseases like flu and chickenpox that for them caused fairly mild symptoms,” says Mr Buggs. When they met populations unused to such diseases, the result was catastrophic.
Moving trees less would reduce the spread of disease. So would building more nurseries and cutting imports. Brexit means Britain is better able to impose phytosanitary restrictions at its borders. That would come at a cost, but it would probably be lower than the potentially catastrophic losses caused by new diseases. The Oxford researchers point out that imports and exports of all live plants, not just trees, were worth £300m in 2017—a mere 2% of the potential costs of ash dieback. It is time to see the wood for the trees. ■",2

The S 500 notched up its seventh consecutive month of gains in August. The American stockmarket index has risen by a fifth since the start of the year and more than doubled since the outbreak of covid-19 in March 2020, as investors shrug off concerns about inflation, labour shortages and supply-chain issues. In Europe the STOXX 600 also recorded its seventh straight month of gains, its best run since 2013.
The euro zone’s annual rate of inflation jumped to 3% in August, from 2.2% in July. In Germany inflation hit 3.9%, according to the country’s statistics office, the highest since December 1993.

1706,"YOU KNOW it’s election time in Germany when every lamppost sprouts the grinning face of a politician. The placards appear suddenly. Local authorities decide on a date and time, and activists race to get their ladders out: popular lampposts on busy roads are hot property.
The images on the placards and the posters have barely changed since 1949, when modern Germany’s first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, stared ferociously into the middle distance above the words “Peace, Freedom and Unity”. Today’s would-be chancellors use the same technique: a face, a party name and a slogan. But strategists now analyse how to transmit the party’s core message in the two seconds voters on average spend looking at a poster. What look like bland photos are carefully, and expensively, choreographed.

The posters of the current poll favourite, the centre-left SPD’s Olaf Scholz, are the most successful, says Frank Brettschneider, a political scientist at Hohenheim University. Mr Scholz, who is selling himself as the Angela Merkel continuity candidate, sits statesmanlike, as if he’s already chancellor. His capable-looking hands are in the foreground, crossed in a manner reminiscent of a characteristic Merkel pose. “The SPD has done well focusing on the candidate, who is more popular than the party,” he says.
Mrs Merkel’s own party, the conservative Christian Democrats, for their part have realised that their candidate, Armin Laschet, is more of a liability than an asset. So their slogans feature more prominently. Unfortunately, a ring around Mr Laschet’s photo gives him the appearance of being stuck in a washing-machine.
The usually immaculate Christian Lindner, leader of the market-friendly FDP, has opted to look knackered in shirtsleeves at his night-time desk—a hardworking, last-one-in-the-office pose that he hopes will appeal to his pro-business supporters.
The Greens, also realising that their candidate, Annalena Baerbock, divides opinion, often feature their co-leader, Robert Habeck, alongside her. They have chosen to drench their photos in a murky, pond-like pale green. “They look like Martians,” says Professor Brettschneider.
To foreign observers from more image-conscience climes, the posters can seem old-fashioned and the photos unattractive. Few people, after all, are in politics because of their looks. But in Germany posters are effective political tools. Some 56% of voters said they were informed about parties and candidates from posters, compared to only 48% for TV ads and 25% for social media, according to a study by Hohenheim University and Forsa, a polling company.
The posters are omnipresent, so they are seen by voters that are hard to reach. “Whether we want to or not, we can’t escape political posters,” says Stephanie Geise, a professor in communications at Bremen University. When it comes to broadening voter turnout, maybe cardboard is cutting-edge after all.",2
1707,"ON FEBRUARY 1ST researchers around the world saw the tweet for which they had been waiting: “We say with caution, the magic has started”. Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute, had been posting regular updates on the course of Israel’s covid-19 epidemic since its mass vaccination campaign had begun six weeks earlier. By February 1st he was seeing the number of hospitalisations dropping significantly among the over-60s—a cohort in which the number vaccinated had reached 70%, seen as a crucial level, three weeks before. After an expected but still somewhat nail-biting lag, the vaccine was doing its thing.
By February 6th about 85% of the over-60s in Israel—and 40% of the general population—had received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine (or in a few cases the Moderna mRNA vaccine) and 75% of the over-60s had received their second dose, too. In that age group hospital admissions for covid-19 were about two-thirds what they had been at their peak in January and still falling (see chart 1). At the same time, the country as a whole was seeing its caseload rise.

The vaccine was not the only thing which arrived in Israel late last year. So did B.1.1.7, a highly contagious variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for covid-19, which was first identified in Britain in September. It set about filling up hospital wards in Israel just as it has done in Britain, Ireland and Portugal. Despite an extended lockdown it is still doing so.

It is no surprise that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved new biological tricks over a year spent infecting more than 100m people. But the near simultaneous arrival of not just B.1.1.7 but also B.1.351, which is now the dominant strain in South Africa, and P.1, a variant first seen in Brazil, is making the roll-out of mass vaccination more complicated and more confusing than might have been hoped when the first evidence of safe, effective vaccines became available last November. How fast the various new variants can spread, how well today’s vaccines work against them and how soon new vaccines better attuned to them—and to the other variants which will turn up over time—become available will determine the course of the pandemic.
Testing the bounds
As of February 10th at least nine vaccines had been authorised for use in one or more countries. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, first out of the gate, has now been authorised for use in 61, as well as for emergency use by the WHO. The number of doses administered, 148m, now exceeds the number of confirmed covid-19 cases recorded over the entire course of the pandemic. All of the vaccines appear very good at preventing severe cases of covid-19 of the sort that lead to hospitalisation and/or death; in trials which compared the vaccinated with control groups the efficacy with which the various vaccines prevented these outcomes was 85-100%.
Their efficacy against all symptomatic cases of the disease found in trials has been lower, ranging between 66% and 95%. Some of that range is down to intrinsic differences between the vaccines. Some is down to trials being done according to different protocols and in different populations, sometimes against different variants of the virus. It is hard to disentangle such effects. The general message, though, is fairly clear. The vaccines make serious cases of all sorts very rare, and mild-to-moderate cases caused by the original strain of the virus a lot rarer than they would be otherwise.
That is undoubtedly good news; it lessens the death toll, the suffering and the strain on hospitals. But the situation is not perfect. For one thing mild and moderate cases can be worse than they sound. Many cases of “long covid”, a debilitating form of the disease in which some effects last for months, follow original infections that were not severe enough to require hospital admission. It is not yet clear whether long covid is less likely in people who have been vaccinated.

What is more, this pattern of effects does not reveal what the vaccines are doing about transmission. As Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, points out, there are two ways one can imagine a vaccine bringing about the pattern of protection the covid-19 vaccines have been seen to provide (see chart 2). In one of them the same number of infections occurs as would occur otherwise, but the consequences of these infections are systematically downgraded. Thus almost all of the infections which would lead to severe cases lead to moderate or mild cases, and many of the infections that would have led to moderate or mild cases produce no symptoms at all.
The alternative is that the total number of infections is being reduced, but the ratio of severe to mild to asymptomatic cases stays roughly the same. The already low number of deaths and hospitalisations shrinks to something hardly there. The number of mild cases is similarly deflated (although, since bigger, remains palpable). And so is the number of asymptomatic cases. Indeed, the main difference between the two scenarios is that in one the asymptomatic cases rise, and in the other they fall.
The passing game
In the real world there is almost certainly a bit of both going on: lower infections overall and a lessening of the symptoms that follow, with different vaccines offering different profiles. But considering the two extremes is still instructive. Vaccines which do little more than downgrade the symptoms will be doing relatively little to stop the spread of the virus. Honey-I-shrank-the-infections vaccines, on the other hand, will be making a big dent in the epidemic’s now infamous R number—the number of new infections to which each infection gives rise. If you imagine reducing what are known as “non pharmaceutical interventions”—masks, social distancing, shelter at home orders and the like—that difference would begin to matter a lot.
Some people will not be vaccinated, either because of pre-existing conditions which make it dangerous for them, because there isn’t enough vaccine for everyone, or because they choose not to (see article). If the vaccines are basically downgrading symptoms, then these unvaccinated people will be at risk. If they are making the virus less transmissible that risk will be lessened.
A covid-19 vaccine that is highly effective in preventing transmission will, therefore, be particularly useful. According to a model by Imperial College London, all other things being equal, a vaccine that blocks 40% of infections and thus prevents 40% of disease would have a similar impact on the number of covid-19 deaths as a vaccine that got rid of 80% of disease but left infection untouched.

Epidemiologists are waiting with bated breath for results that will tell them how good existing vaccines are at reducing asymptomatic infections and infectiousness. Data from Israel suggest that the viral load in swabs from infected individuals is lower if they have been vaccinated. Clinical trials of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine suggest that the jab may halve infections as detected by PCR tests. Such results suggest that covid-19 vaccines are likely to reduce overall transmission of the virus. But understanding quite how much transmission is blocked—and the degree to which some vaccines are better at blocking transmission than others—will take months.
And then there is the further complication of the new variants. Vaccines seem to have no particular problem with B.1.1.7. It just complicates things by running through the unimmunised parts of the population that bit faster. B.1.351, which has now been found in more than 30 countries, is of greater concern. At least three vaccines—those from Oxford/AstraZeneca, J and Novavax—have been found to be less effective at stopping it from causing disease than they are against variants elsewhere. There is increasing evidence that P.1, now also reported in a number of countries beyond Brazil, also appears to be better at avoiding immunity created by prior infection and by some vaccines.
Countries that have already vaccinated a lot of people could be brought back to square one by the spread of such variants. Britain, where 13m people had been vaccinated as of February 10th, and millions more have been infected and thus have some immunity (British studies have found reinfection very rare for at least five months), is trying hard to keep B.1.351 from making inroads in the population. Health authorities are mass-testing neighbourhoods where cases of B.1.351 have been spotted and are doing particularly meticulous contact tracing when a case is found. Border controls have been tightened.
Eking out an advantage
Not all such new variants can be spotted and stopped at borders. Mutations can arise anywhere—sometimes the phone call is coming from inside the house. But there may be a limited range of mutations about which people need to worry. The new variants all differ from the original virus and from each other in various ways. But P.1 and B.1.351 both share a particular mutational quirk—technically called E484K but mercifully nicknamed Eric or Eek—which makes a specific change to the spike protein on the outside of the virus. Eek has now been found in some isolates of B.1.1.7. too. Researchers are beginning to think that the change Eek represents is what allows those variants to infect people even if they have been vaccinated or previously infected.
It would be great if there were no vaccine-resistant strains. But given that there are, the possibility that they are all using the same trick offers a bit of comfort. It suggests that Eek may be the best way for new variants to avoid immune responses capable of dealing with the original strain, or at least the way evolution can most easily find. If the variants have all converged on the same trick, tweaking vaccines to protect against one may protect against all—and against any later variants to which natural selection teaches the same ruse. If the virus had found a whole panoply of ways by which to avoid existing immune responses things would look a lot worse.
Whether or not Eek turns out to be crucial, new ways of broadening immunity are on their way. Some vaccine-makers are developing booster shots designed to help people vaccinated with earlier versions of their jabs deal with new variants. Others are developing vaccines intended to work for multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants straight away. On February 3rd GlaxoSmithKline and CureVac, a German biotech company with an mRNA vaccine in late-stage clinical trials, added their names to those developing such “multivalent” vaccines.
Tweaked covid-19 vaccines will not be required to go through large scale clinical trials to prove their efficacy, any more than updated seasonal flu shots do; small trials that look for markers of immunity in the blood may suffice. Britain’s National Health Service, which should be able to vaccinate all adults who choose to be jabbed by the end of the summer, is already starting to make plans for a round of covid-19 booster shots aimed at new variants in the autumn. Increased surveillance may yet provide advance warning of which variants need to be dealt with by subsequent tweaks. It will take luck, diligence and hard work, but the magic that started at the beginning of this year may be made to last for many years to come.■

1708,"“THE TALIBAN is not the North Vietnamese army,” declared President Joe Biden on July 8th, days after America abandoned Bagram air base, the hub of its war in Afghanistan for 20 years, without telling its Afghan commander. “They’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of the embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.” By August 15th Chinooks were rattling windows in Kabul, shuttling American diplomats from their hulking embassy. At the city’s airport, desperate Afghans swarmed the runway; some clung to the undercarriage of a C-17 transporter, falling to their deaths.

The chaos on the runway contrasted with the Taliban’s nearly bloodless capture of Kabul a day earlier. The Taliban now control more of Afghanistan than they did in 2001, when America swept them from power in response to the September 11th attacks (see map). At the presidential palace in Kabul, Taliban fighters in dusty sandals seemed surprised at their victory as they posed around the desk abandoned by Ashraf Ghani, the country’s president. “We have reached a victory that wasn’t expected,” admitted Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s deputy leader.
In the tense drama around the airport, the foes have treated each other warily. The Taliban have so far allowed America to run evacuation flights, but have forced back crowds trying to get onto them. With thousands of Americans left in Kabul the situation could grow more dangerous. The Taliban may grow impatient with thousands of American and British troops on Afghan soil, and angry at America’s decision to block access to foreign reserves.
America’s flight from Kabul, like its departure from Saigon in 1975, is a defining geopolitical moment: the world’s mightiest country has again been defeated by a weaker enemy. In both cases—then as a senator, now as president—Joe Biden advocated a rapid exit. And then as now, fierce critics of America predicted that such a chaotic abandonment would alarm allies and embolden adversaries. Neighbouring states and rich countries farther away can expect an unsettling new influx of refugees. Global jihadists, thousands of whom are thought to be sheltered by the Taliban, will see a divine hand in the way holy warriors have defeated two superpowers in Afghanistan—first the Soviet Union in 1989 and now America.


The consequences will be felt, above all, in Afghanistan itself. It is too early to say whether the Taliban’s triumph marks the final, or merely the latest, chapter in the country’s 42-year-old war—with more than 117,000 Afghans killed since 2001 (see chart 1). Afghanistan remains one of the world’s poorest countries. If Western aid is cut off, it stands to lose even the modest economic and social gains—such as the education of girls—of the past two decades (see chart 2). Much will depend on how the Taliban govern.

When they last ruled in Kabul, from 1996 to 2001, they plunged a country long ravaged by war into a theocratic tyranny. They halted female education and employment, banned most art and music, and massacred minorities. And they harboured militants of all stripes, notably al-Qaeda, which sought to export jihad around the world. The “emirate” was so repulsive that it was recognised only by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, a long-time sponsor of the Taliban.
This time around, the Taliban want to show a gentler face. On August 17th one of their officials appeared on Afghanistan's main television network to be interviewed by a female presenter—an unimaginable scene during the first Taliban era. The group has also applied a light touch in the capital. “We were expecting a lot more brutality,” says Obaidullah Baheer, a lecturer at the American University in Kabul. Instead, he was “pleasantly surprised at their discipline and respectfulness”. Mr Baheer notes that the Taliban’s vehicles do not honk at civilian cars, forcing them off the road, as Afghan military ones used to.
Keeping the lights on
The Taliban’s priority is to keep the existing state going. Lacking technocrats or managers, they have declared a general amnesty for all government officials, urging them to return to work. The health minister and the mayor of Kabul remain in their posts. Antonio Giustozzi of King’s College London notes that the Taliban have cut deals with Salahuddin Rabbani, a former foreign minister, and Hamid Karzai, the first president installed by America. They have recruited army specialists to operate captured equipment and are trying to woo military pilots.
The Taliban's strategy in rural provinces that they have held for some time may hold other clues. They often piggybacked on government services, allowing teachers and doctors to continue working as long as they abided by Taliban rules. “They are going to assume control of what already exists, at least in the short term, and I think they will try to go for stability, rather than a revolution of any sort,” says Ashley Jackson of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a think-tank in London.
As they take over the country, says Martine van Bijlert of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, a research group, the Taliban are debating how to strike the balance between what many of their fighters see as ideological purity, on the one hand, and the demand for education that exists even among many of the more conservative Afghans. Mustapha Ben Messaoud, the chief of field operations in Afghanistan for Unicef, says he is “cautiously optimistic”.

How long this pragmatism lasts is anyone’s guess. The news out of some newly captured areas is worrying. In Herat, where 60% of the students at the university were women, female students have been ordered back to their homes. Women at work have been told to give up their jobs to male relatives. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s spokesman, says that media outlets can remain open—as long as they do not “contradict Islamic values” or “broadcast anything that goes against our national interests”. That is hardly reassuring.
Nor will many Afghans be persuaded by the Taliban’s promise that there will be “no revenge on all those who are working with the Kabul administration or with the foreign forces”. After the Taliban took Spin Boldak, a town on the Pakistani border, dozens of government supporters were reportedly massacred. In Kandahar the Taliban kidnapped and murdered Nazar Mohammad, a popular comedian. Kabul is rife with reports that the Taliban are hunting former US army interpreters and Afghan commanders. One female judge in the city says she, and hundreds of her former colleagues, are terrified of reprisals. In Jalalabad on August 18th the Taliban reportedly killed several protesters waving the Afghan flag rather than the Taliban’s standard.
The hollow Afghan army
Even so, Taliban promises of “mercy” and safe passage for government soldiers who put down their arms goes some way to explaining how they swept away the Afghan army so easily. When the Soviet Union left Afghanistan in 1989, its client regime survived for three years before collapsing (in part because by then the Soviet Union itself had disappeared). The state built this time did not hold out long enough for America even to complete its departure. “We spent over a trillion dollars,” lamented Mr Biden on August 16th (see chart 3). “We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong…a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies.” Why did it all dissolve in days?

In 20 years of America’s presence, the Taliban had seized only one city, Kunduz, holding it for brief periods. Yet starting with Zaranj in the south-west on August 6th, they took one provincial capital after another, culminating in the seizure of Kabul on August 15th. They control virtually all the territory once held by the former Northern Alliance, an anti-Taliban amalgam that America relied on in 2001. Amrullah Saleh, Mr Ghani’s vice-president, has fled to the Panjshir valley, declared himself the caretaker president and called for “resistance”. But his cause looks forlorn.
The Taliban’s success owes much to Pakistan’s support, America’s distraction in Iraq, drug money and the corruption of Afghan elites. But the militants also had agility. In the last stage of the war, they often embodied Sun Tzu’s dictum that the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. “What just happened is probably one of the best conceived and planned guerrilla campaigns ever,” says Mike Martin, a former British army officer in Helmand province, now at King’s College London. “The Taliban went into every district and flipped all the local militias by doing deals along tribal lines.” In Herat, for instance, the head of the provincial council cut a deal with the local Taliban commander (both were members of the Alizai tribe). “Once those local forces had flipped,” says Mr Martin, “there wasn't enough weight on the government side, so the army had to surrender.”
That the Taliban could strike such deals reflected a deeper problem. America and its allies acted as the midwives of a highly centralised state, whose constitution in 2004 echoed the monarchy of the 1960s. Mr Ghani, a former official in the World Bank and co-author of a book called “Fixing Failed States”, wanted to build national institutions that would disenfranchise local power-brokers. That went down badly with important tribes and clans. “These tensions between Kabul and regional actors opened up vacuums the Taliban were able to exploit,” observes Ibraheem Bahiss of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. “They went from really limited appeal to virtually a national movement.”
The Afghan army that America built was large, well armed and equipped with air power. It was also utterly unsuited to the war at hand. The formal chain of command clashed with family and tribal loyalties, says Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank. The result was endemic corruption. “Equipment was going into the military, into big warehouses and then getting siphoned off all over the place,” he says.
Though the army was 352,000-strong on paper, the available force amounted to around 96,000 soldiers, according to CNA, a think-tank—not much larger than the Taliban’s 60,000 or so. American-supplied equipment was too complex to maintain, resulting in frequent breakdowns. That in turn confined much of the army to besieged bases. Many soldiers went unpaid and hungry, and casualties were high. A small cadre of Afghan special forces was left to do much of the fighting, but they were stretched thin.
America’s decision to leave was the coup de grâce. As a study of Vietnam by the RAND Corporation, published in 1978, noted, “the physical side of it—the withdrawal of troops, the loss of US airpower, declining aid—was no more disastrous than the concomitant psychological effects of no longer being regarded by the United States as worth saving.”

Gaining friends and seeking influence
Western countries are in a bind. Having failed calamitously, they now hope to exercise a “moderating influence” on the Taliban, as Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, put it, by using two levers: aid and diplomatic recognition of the new regime. Neither is likely to be effective. Iran and Russia, once hostile to the Taliban, are now friendlier to them; both relish America’s humiliation in Afghanistan. Zamir Kabulov, Russia’s presidential envoy to Afghanistan, all but applauded their victory: the Taliban, he said, are “much more able to reach agreements than the puppet government in Kabul.” Pakistan, whose spooks nurtured the Taliban from birth, was even keener. “In Afghanistan they have broken the chains of slavery,” gushed Imran Khan, the prime minister.
The biggest diplomatic prize for the Taliban, however, is China, which shares a border with Afghanistan through the slender Wakhan corridor. On July 28th, with the American withdrawal nearly complete, China made a show of hosting a delegation of Taliban leaders in Tianjin and called the group a “decisive military and political force”. Shortly after it proved so, Chinese diplomats welcomed the prospect of “friendly and co-operative relations”.
How the relations with neighbours actually turn out depends, in part, on the Taliban’s links with international jihadist groups. China, for instance, worries about the presence of militant Uyghurs, whom it sees as a threat to stability in Xinjiang, where Uyghurs form a majority and are the subject of intense repression.
Islamist extremism has long been a concern to Western countries, too, even if the threat has abated since 2001. “We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission, and that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11,” said Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, on August 15th. “And we have succeeded in that mission.” Al-Qaeda, the group which was responsible, is a shadow of its former self. But its ideology has spread far and wide; it has spawned the likes of Islamic State, an even more brutal group born in Iraq and Syria, as well as offshoots and lone-wolf terrorists.
Mr Mujahid has tried to assuage concerns that Afghanistan will again become a base for global terrorism, as it was on 9/11: “We want to reassure everyone, especially the United States, that Afghanistan won’t be used to attack anybody.” But last month a UN team which monitors jihadist groups reported that al-Qaeda remained present in no fewer than 15 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, primarily along the country’s eastern fringes. A local branch of Islamic State is also present in several places, with anywhere from several hundred to 10,000 members. Western intelligence agencies reckon that Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda’s leader since America’s killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, is in Afghanistan, though ailing. The Taliban’s release of thousands of prisoners, many of them hardened jihadists, from Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul compounds the problem.
American officials believe that they can keep the terrorists in check through a combination of watchful intelligence and targeted strikes. Mr Biden says that America has a robust “counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability”. Yet this capacity has been greatly weakened. America will soon lack a military or diplomatic presence on the ground. Afghanistan’s own spy agency, the National Directorate of Security, is unlikely to survive; if it does it is unlikely to co-operate with the West. American spooks will become more reliant on agents recruited mostly outside Afghanistan, and on signals intelligence.
Without an air base to operate from in Afghanistan, the country’s landlocked geography is another forbidding constraint. CIA drones once took off from next-door Pakistan but its relations with America are at rock-bottom. Missiles or warplanes could fly from bases in the Persian Gulf or an aircraft-carrier in the Arabian Sea, but they could not avoid passing over either Iran, an unlikely prospect, or Pakistan, with or without its permission.
Much as Mr Biden and his team reject comparisons to Vietnam, they are unavoidable. In both cases, civilian and military leaders misled Americans about a conflict with uncertain aims and unreliable partners, and on cultural terrain where they never found their footing. But there are many differences. The 2,452 American military deaths in Afghanistan are painful, but the war in Vietnam was far bloodier—with 25 times as many Americans killed—and more divisive. In other ways, the failure in Afghanistan is worse. The North Vietnamese army was a skilled and armoured force, notes Caitlin Talmadge of Georgetown University, perhaps twice the size of the Taliban and backed by a superpower. Yet the Taliban have taken a territory four times as large as South Vietnam.

A shock that rings around the world
Many historians have concluded that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and expanded support for proxies in Central America and Africa in part out of the belief that America had been weakened by Vietnam. China has already seized on the debacle in Afghanistan to celebrate America’s retreat, if not decline. The Global Times, a jingoistic tabloid run by China’s Communist Party, crowed on August 16th that the withdrawal was an “omen of Taiwan's future”. If America was unwilling to absorb several thousand casualties in Afghanistan, it suggested, a war over Taiwan “would mean unthinkable costs”. Andrew Yang, a former Taiwanese defence minister, agrees that the withdrawal from Afghanistan matters to Taiwan: “That is a lesson to learn…Taiwan should depend on its own self-defences instead of US support.”
In India, many officials are troubled by a victory for Pakistan’s proxy, and the prospect of energised jihadism. And having aligned the country more closely with America against China, they are taken aback by America’s apparent unreliability. “The US withdrawal…showed utter disregard of what it would unleash in its wake,” argues Nirupama Rao, formerly India’s most senior diplomat. “It has devalued the worth and credibility of American power in the region,” she says.
Europeans fume that America’s withdrawal was presented to them as a fait accompli. For one diplomat, it “confirms a long-term trend of US disengagement”. Europeans, he said, must “draw conclusions” about America’s reliability when it comes to crises in places like the Middle East and the Sahel. British officials are apoplectic, too. Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP and chairman of Parliament’s foreign-affairs committee, who served in Afghanistan as a soldier, said Britain should “set out a vision…for reinvigorating our European NATO partners to make sure we're not dependent on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader”.
Yet complaints about American reliability are an old pastime. Europeans grumbled about Barack Obama’s reluctance to intervene in Libya in 2011 and his cancellation of air strikes on Syria in 2013. Gulf states fretted over Mr Trump’s failure to punish Iran for its attack on Saudi oil facilities in 2019. Taiwan already has experience of betrayal by America, when it switched formal diplomatic recognition to communist China in 1979, yet lives with it.
If the manner of Mr Biden’s withdrawal demonstrates American capriciousness, it also shows its indispensability. Few allies have anywhere else to turn as Russia and China assert themselves. “This is a hard blow for America,” acknowledges Michael Fullilove, director of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, “but it doesn’t change the calculus for Australia.” Asked whether Japan is worried, one senior official in Tokyo replies: “No, because Afghanistan is Afghanistan…Japan is different.”

And just as European allies welcomed America’s withdrawal from Vietnam, anxious that it was diverting resources and attention from the Soviet threat to Europe, many allies (and China hawks in Washington) spy an opportunity to refocus America on their concerns. As Mr Biden noted: “Our true strategic competitors—China and Russia—would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilising Afghanistan indefinitely.”
The long view
The enduring lesson from Vietnam may be the importance of perspective. In the short term America’s confidence was shaken and its adversaries cheered. Yet within 15 years of defeat in a war that was waged to hold back the communist tide, America had won the cold war and emerged as a power without peer. Its armed forces, shattered by the conflict, rebuilt themselves into an unrivalled, technologically advanced force. And four decades on, Vietnam is a close partner of the superpower it vanquished. That may be a consolation to America. It is of little solace to Afghans who trusted it to defend them, and must now face life under the Taliban.

1709,"ELECTIONS ARE supposed to be a smooth way to change power. In Iraq they seem to heighten hostilities. The vote on October 10th split the Shia majority between two snarling blocs. Muqtada al-Sadr, a gruff cleric-cum-militiaman popular with working-class Shias, emerged as the front-runner, with more than 70 of parliament’s 329 seats, a third more than his tally in the previous election, in 2018. His nearest Shia rival, Nuri al-Maliki, won about half as many. But within hours Mr Maliki, a besuited former prime minister, had assembled a coalition of Shia factions and militias friendly with Iran, topping Mr Sadr’s tally. Both men are claiming to have a mandate to form the next government.
Much will depend on which side Iraq’s Kurds and Sunni Arabs take. Preliminary results suggest that Masoud Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party has 32 of the 63 seats won by Kurdish parties, so he will probably style himself as a kingmaker. Sunni voters, previously more divided, rallied behind Muhammad al-Halbousi, parliament’s speaker, giving his party, Taqaddum, 38 seats.

Elections in Iraq are usually followed by months of wrangling between the main parties over who gets the big jobs with control of big budgets. But this time, before they could begin horse-trading, the two Shia blocs were threatening war against each other. In his victory speech on state television, Mr Sadr (pictured) vowed to disarm the pro-Iranian factions. “Arms must be controlled by the state only,” he said, without a hint of irony, even though he heads one of Iraq’s largest private armies.
The pro-Iranian militias bristled. Their main political arm, Fatah Alliance, had a bad election. According to preliminary results, its clutch of seats dropped from 48 to 14. Kataib Hizbullah, the most pro-Iranian militia, fielded 31 candidates, but won only a single seat. Few Iraqis, it seems, want it to brandish its swords. But rather than heed the message, the group’s spokesmen denounced the result as “the biggest fraud…in recent history” and called on the militia to assemble. For some, this deployment was simply theatrical sabre-rattling. For others it was preparation for a re-enactment of the bloodshed of 2008, when Mr Maliki, then the prime minister, sent troops to crush Mr Sadr’s forces in Basra, Iraq’s second city.
Western tensions with Iran are making matters worse. Mr Sadr once fought against American forces but now considers Iran the bigger threat to Iraq’s independence. In his victory speech he said embassies from every foreign country were welcome, tacitly including America. Although he still refuses to meet American officials, he uses the incumbent prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, as a go-between.
Iran, meanwhile, is egging on its local allies to oppose Mr Sadr. Esmail Ghaani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force, the foreign wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, arrived in Iraq on election day. “They’re not going to hand Iraq to Mr Sadr on a golden plate,” says an Iraqi official.
Iraq’s election commission further muddled the mayhem. Its claim of a turnout of 9m voters, or 41%, in the face of a boycott, induced a few guffaws. Some monitors guessed it was possibly half that. The EU, observing an Iraqi election for the first time, listed numerous violations in its mission report. The comma in its phrase, the “officially announced turnout was low, 41%”, sounded a bit like a cough. Millions of people were left off the register of voters. Days after the vote the election commission was still changing results on its website, citing problems with manually counting the vote. Some losing candidates and their followers have alleged vote tampering and blocked main roads with protests. Others called on armed supporters to descend on the commission’s offices unless the results were changed.
The gloom, however, is not entirely without glimmers. Mr Kadhimi, who is also a former intelligence chief, is wisely staying outside the fray. He withdrew from the election months ago, but hopes he may again be picked as the compromise candidate on whom all factions might agree. Young Iraqis, who call themselves the Tishreenis (after the Arabic word for the month in 2019 when they first started their protests to demand sweeping change), also celebrated. Despite their calls for a boycott of the ballot, their main party, Imtidad, together with independents, won some 20 seats. New Generation, their Kurdish counterpart, won another nine. “Next election we’ll sweep the board,” enthused a protester in the southern city of Najaf. Had he and his friends voted, they might not have needed to wait. ■",2
1710,"GLASGOW, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine, Fiji, Colombia, Kenya and Mali will be the first countries to participate in an investment program announced on Thursday that will help developing countries transform their power grids to carry growing levels of renewable energy.
The Climate Investment Funds (CIF), created by the world's biggest economies in 2008 to help developing countries accelerate their shift to a low-carbon economy, said its new initiative would help those countries bridge a huge gap in investments needed to integrate renewable energy sources.
Experts estimate that global infrastructure investments will have to ramp up to $820 billion annually by 2030 to facilitate the decarbonization of power systems and help refit or replace existing infrastructure so it can integrate alternative energy.
""Power systems in many, many developing countries are not equipped today to take on that much renewable energy capacity,"" CIF chief Mafalda Duarte told Reuters at the COP26 climatesummit.
""Our grids won't be ready for a clean energy future unless we can unlock significantly more investment in fit-for-purpose energy systems,"" Duarte added.
Duarte said investors viewed this issue as a major barrier to investments in renewables. ""If you can't integrate them into the power systems, there's no point in generating all that power,"" she said.
Duarte said Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia and Turkey were priority countries for subsequent phases of the Renewable Energy Integration (REI) program.
The REI program will work through multilateral development banks to offer participating countries a toolbox of financial instruments and technical assistance.
Plans for REI were endorsed earlier this year by the Group of Seven advanced economies, and are supported by financial pledges from the Netherlands, Britain and Switzerland.
The new program will support grid flexibility measures on both the supply and demand sides by scaling up renewable-energy enabling technologies and enhancing the readiness of energy infrastructure for renewables.
It will also support innovative business models and improve power system and market design.",3
1711,"THE END of the summer feels too early to be thinking about Christmas, but retailers have little choice. The typical British household spends around a third more than usual in December, and stocking up for the most important trading weeks of the year usually begins around now. This year, however, rather than preparing for the coming rush, retailers are struggling to keep shelves full.

According to survey data from the Confederation of British Industry, a lobby group, retailers’ and manufacturers’ inventories have plunged in recent months (see chart). It has been asking members about stock levels for decades and has never recorded answers so low. In spring and early summer, shortages of construction materials and computer chips hampered builders and carmakers. In recent weeks the impact has become more visible on high streets. McDonald’s, a burger chain, stopped serving milkshakes. Wetherspoons, a chain of pubs, is short of some brands of beer. Nando’s, a chicken restaurant, temporarily closed around 50 branches because it cannot get the birds.
The main reason is straightforward. With pandemic restrictions almost entirely lifted and the economy reopened, demand has recovered faster than supply, leading to shortages and higher prices. Consumer-price inflation, which was running at under 1% annually at the start of the year, hit 2.1% in July. The Bank of England expects annual inflation to rise to around 4% over the coming months.
But that is not the whole story. Some of the squeeze is caused by problems outside Britain’s borders, for example the computer-chip shortage. And the pandemic is far from over: government estimates suggest that new infections are running at over 200,000 a week. Employers are having to do without both the infected and many of those who came near them. According to the most recent data available, in the week ending August 18th over 300,000 close contacts of people who tested positive were told to stay home.

The main additional factor, however, is Brexit. Britain’s transitional membership of the European Single Market and Customs Union ended on December 31st 2020. The end of the frictionless border with Britain’s main trading partner means further problems for supply-chain managers. Although the government has chosen to suspend most border checks until October, new rules on collecting value-added tax have convinced many smaller European businesses to sell less to Britain. Sanitary and phytosanitary rules, due to be imposed on imports this autumn, will make food supply chains more fragile. Employers in sectors such as food processing and hospitality, which relied heavily on European workers, say that many left the country last year. Some may not return.
Disentangling the effects of Brexit and the pandemic is tricky. Take, for example, the shortage of heavy-goods vehicle (HGV) drivers. It has become severe enough that the government has extended the maximum time allowed behind the wheel. Drivers may stretch the daily maximum of nine hours to 11 hours twice a week between now and October. Around 40% of Britain’s shortfall of drivers, estimated at around 100,000, can be blamed on the suspension of driving tests at the height of the pandemic, and HGV drivers are in short supply across the continent. But Britain is suffering particularly acutely.
As well as suppressing demand and disrupting supply, the pandemic has also twisted Britain’s economy into a new shape. Over the past 18 months, consumer habits have undergone a dramatic shift. Between the end of 2019 and March 2021, their spending on services fell by around a fifth, while spending on goods mostly held up. The typical Briton went to the pub hardly at all and used Amazon a lot more. Such shifts have reshaped high streets. The Centre for Retail Research, a think-tank, calculates that almost 18,000 shops have closed since the end of 2019, and over 215,000 retail jobs have been lost. According to the Office for National Statistics, the share of retail sales made online has jumped from under 20% before the pandemic to approaching 30%, even as shops have reopened. Retailers think that shopping habits formed during the pandemic may well outlive it.
Many workers have responded to changing consumption patterns by following the money. Bosses in the hospitality sector have found themselves short of staff, probably because some former waiters and the like are now driving delivery vans or stacking supermarket shelves. Data from Indeed, an online recruitment firm, show a marked drop in interest from potential applicants in working in certain sectors. Clicks per online job advert for vacancies in food preparation and service roles have fallen by over 50% since February. In an effort to lure workers back to such jobs, employers are starting to raise pay. The median wage rate for hospitality jobs posted on Indeed rose by 3.7% between February and July, compared with an increase of 0.8% across all roles.
Some of these bottlenecks should ease over the coming 12 months. Global supply chains will be adjusted and strengthened, and the labour market will adapt to new spending patterns. The rules on when to isolate after coming in contact with a case of covid-19 were eased in mid-August. And higher wages will eventually draw workers back into hospitality, and encourage them to train as HGV drivers. But all this will take time, and as Brexit bites, trade with the EU will continue to become more difficult. The recovery from the pandemic will be far from smooth. ■

1712,"Energy prices have replaced Covid as the main worry for almost half of British families, an exclusive new poll reveals today.
Some 49 per cent of voters polled say that the recent surge in gas and electricity bills is more of a concern that the pandemic, as the cold of winter approaches.
A third (33 per cent) surveyed by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for MailOnline admitted that they were keeping the heating turned off in cold weather in an attempt to lower their bills. 
Four-in-10 said they were turning the heating down, with the same amount saying they were wearing more clothes indoors instead.
And also a third (30 per cent) said they were cutting down on other spending as they keep an eye on their outgoings. 
It comes the day after it was claimed the average British family is more than £1,000-a-year worse off due to soaring inflation.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rose sharply from 3.1 per cent in September to 4.2 per cent last month, which is the highest level since December 2011.  
The bigger-than-expected rise in the cost of living comes amid surging gas and electricity prices, with regulator Ofgem last month increasing the energy price cap by 12 per cent. But the figures also show sharp fuel costs rises and inflation building across food, household goods and hospitality as supply chain disruption takes its toll. 
With households spending an average of £508.50 a week on all areas in the financial year ending 2020 according to the ONS, Labour said this new CPI rate has seen the outlay go up by £21 a week, £93 a month or £1,111 a year.
The Party added that the Office for Budget Responsibility said last month that it expected CPI inflation to average 4 per cent next year, a figure which would leave the average household spending £1,058 more a year.
Experts said today when inflation is combined with the effects of recent tax changes such as the new social care levy and personal allowance freeze, such big price increases will have a major impact on living standards.
Interest rates look set to rise before Christmas after last month's bigger-than-expected leap in the cost of living.
This has fuelled expectations that policymakers will act next month to cool rampant inflation.
Most economists are forecasting that rates will rise to 0.25 per cent in December from their all-time low of 0.1 per cent as pressure mounts on the Bank of England to rein in inflation.
A mounting cost of living crisis in the UK has seen prices rise across the board - for energy, fuel, food, cars, furniture and eating out.
Inflation has reached levels not seen for nearly a decade in the UK as the global economy reopens and amid mounting supply chain disruption.
The Bank warned earlier this month it may have to increase rates in the ""coming months"" as it forecast inflation peaking at 5 per cent next April. 
It held off from an increase at the November meeting to assess how the jobs market was holding up after the end of furlough.
Robust jobs data on Tuesday showed another 160,000 workers were added to UK payrolls in October and no large uptick in redundancies, despite furlough coming to a close on September 30.
This, coupled with inflation coming in at a higher than forecast 4.2 per cent for October, is widely expected to see the Bank raise rates at its next meeting on December 16.",-2
1713,"“BABA KOBE ashbe?” (“When will Daddy come?”), asks the youngest daughter of Sajedul Islam Sumon. No one has an answer, but she keeps asking anyway. Her family’s life—and hers—revolves around his absence. Now eight, she was just one when security forces came to their suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, and bundled her father, a local leader for an opposition party, into the back of a van. That was the last time he was seen or heard from.
Mr Sumon’s tale, in a new report on enforced disappearances in Bangladesh, is a chilling example of what can happen to those who oppose or criticise the government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed. Under her 12-year tenure at least 600 Bangladeshis are reckoned to have been “disappeared”.

Many have eventually re-emerged. Some have been implausibly “found” and produced in court—like Shafiqul Islam Kajol, a photojournalist who, 53 days after he went missing in March last year, turned up blindfolded, his legs and arms bound, in a no-man’s land between Bangladesh and India. Police took him into custody, slapping a trespassing charge on to his original crime of posting on Facebook about a sex scandal involving a politician in the ruling party. Others, like Aminul Islam, have returned in body bags. He was a labour activist whose tortured remains were found dumped on the edge of Dhaka, days after his abduction in 2012. Eighty-six victims, including Mr Sumon, are still missing.
While these numbers may seem small in a country of 170m, fear of being goom (disappeared) muzzles millions of voices. Disappearances, along with an array of other human-rights abuses, are not new in Bangladesh. Under previous governments, including those led by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the ruling Awami League, dissidents vanished and were killed. But since 2009, the year Sheikh Hasina took office for a second time, state-sponsored abductions have become a systematic tool of oppression, says Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the advocacy group behind the report.
Bangladesh’s is not the only South Asian state that covertly kidnaps its citizens. Yet, says Ms Ganguly, such actions elsewhere are usually linked to civil strife or insurgencies. Bangladesh is alone in “so blatantly” targeting political opponents and critics for secret detentions. Disappearances have shot up most in the run-up to elections, with over 130 before the 2014 vote and 98 in the year leading up to the ballot in 2018.
Despite such brazenness, ruling-party politicians deny or play down the abductions. In 2017 Sheikh Hasina claimed that Bangladesh’s enforced disappearances paled in comparison with Britain’s, bogusly citing data for missing persons. Her son, Sajeeb Wazed, recently penned an article for the Diplomat, an online news site, calling the “disappearances” comical. Many of the vanished were fugitives who, he joked, had gone into hiding to escape arrest.
Such mocking attitudes percolate down through the state apparatus. When Marufa Islam Ruma sought answers about her missing husband, Mofizul Islam Rashed, security-force officers jeered that he had probably run off with another woman. Years after Mr Sumon’s disappearance, a senior officer came to his family’s home and theatrically walked around the house shouting “Where is Sumon? Let him out, I need to speak to him!”, recalls his niece.
The families interviewed for the report named the Rapid Action Battalion, an elite police squad, as being behind the abductions. But other security units are guilty too, say various rights groups. And they all operate with impunity.
Some families give up or do not try in the first place, says Afroja Islam Akhi, Mr Sumon’s sister, who runs Mayer Dak, an organisation for the families of vanished Bangladeshis. They know their questions may bring punitive repercussions rather than helpful answers. She reckons the number of disappeared is far higher than the 600 known about. “Only God knows the accurate tally.”■",2
1714,"LAST MONTH the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Spandau, a borough in Berlin, stuck a campaign placard for local candidates over one of Armin Laschet, the main standard-bearer of the CDU and the Christian Social Union (CSU), its Bavarian sister party, in the federal election on September 26th. It was a mistake, says a local politician, but stories abound about CDU chapters across Germany declining to put up Laschet placards. On a two-hour walk through Charlottenburg and Mitte, two other boroughs in Berlin, your correspondent did not spot a single one (though there were several with the grinning face of Olaf Scholz, the Social Democratic Party’s candidate).
Some in the CDU are still defiant in public, but the mood is defeatist. The conservative party is used to success: it has occupied the chancellor’s office for 52 of the 72 years of the republic’s existence. It has never polled lower than the 31% it won in the first post-war vote. But it is now facing the real prospect of being booted out of power. A new poll by Forsa put the SPD at 25%, the CDU/CSU at just 19% and the Greens at 17%. In 2013 the CDU/CSU got 41.5% and at the most recent election, in 2017, they got 32.9%.

What happened? Many believe that the CDU/CSU committed a cardinal error when it picked Mr Laschet, the wishy-washy state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, as its candidate for chancellor, instead of Markus Söder, the forceful boss of Bavaria. “The party had the choice between winning with Söder and losing with Laschet,” says Manfred Güllner, head of Forsa. He blames CDU apparatchiks, who feared a takeover of their party by Bavarians.

Another view, propagated by members of the Berliner Kreis, a network of conservative CDU and CSU politicians, is that the CDU is leaking voters because it lost its conservative identity under Mrs Merkel. “That’s absolute nonsense,” says Manuel Hagel, a CDU politician in Baden-Württemberg, who argues that Mrs Merkel’s success in four successive elections speaks for itself.
Julius van de Laar, a political strategist, thinks the troubles stem from a poorly planned campaign that started only in April; an emphasis on change when many voters want continuity; and Mr Laschet’s inept handling of the floods in July that devastated his state. All this played into the hands of Mr Scholz, who presents himself as a clone of the competent Mrs Merkel, copying even her hand gestures.
In a speech on September 7th Mrs Merkel strongly endorsed Mr Laschet and lambasted Mr Scholz for not ruling out a coalition with the polarising Left party. There is still a chance that the CDU will catch up with the SPD: the polls have been extremely volatile in recent months. But it is small. Forsa’s Mr Güllner thinks the party will stick to its choice and probably lose. Even a (highly unlikely) last-minute switch to Mr Söder may not help the CDU very much. Postal voting has already begun.

1715," (CNN)What's that we hear? Is it the sound of prominent conservatives and Trump allies openly rebuking former President Donald Trump? Are these the early murmurs of a conservative backlash against Trump? And is it possible a political lane is opening for another Republican presidential candidate in 2024?It's too soon to know, of course, and there's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.The statements from Rupert Murdoch -- who controls a media empire that includes, among other properties, the shamelessly pro-Trump Fox News -- and from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- an adviser who worked with the former president and helped him prepare for the presidential debates during the 2020 election -- may serve as a test for Republicans who understand just how harmful Trump's dominance of the GOP is, and how it could ultimately sink the party.It was startling when Murdoch, addressing his company at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said that the United States faces a number of major political decisions that conservatives will fail to shape unless Trump moves on. ""The current American political debate is profound,"" he said, citing education, welfare and economic opportunity. ""It is crucial that conservatives play an active, forceful role in that debate,"" he added, ""but that will not happen if President Trump stays focused on the past.""Murdoch is not alone in arguing that Trump is a threat to conservatives. Christie, who has just published a new book that looks very much like his unofficial entry into the 2024 presidential race, is making the same case, only more forcefully.Consider the title of Christie's book -- which effectively labels Trump a threat to the GOP: ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Notice that Trump fits two of the three reasons the party needs saving (by Christie, presumably).Murdoch and Christie are not the first Republicans who have stood up to the former president --  but their rebukes of Trump are markedly different. Trump's early critics, like Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and others, melted into passionate defenders once their criticisms proved perilous to their own standing. Their reversals bring to mind a quote often attributed to Groucho Marx: ""Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others."" Christie says many in the GOP are frightened of Trump, whose ""conduct is meant to instill fear."" Conservative Republicans who refuse to fall in line, such as Rep. Liz Cheney, are being hounded out of a party that is increasingly remade into the former president's raging, iconoclastic and intolerant brand.Sure, it's possible Murdoch and Christie's words may also fail to change the course of the GOP, but their criticism is different. They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party -- and the rest of the country -- that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.Coincidentally or not, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, finally acknowledged Biden's win on Thursday, more than a year after the 2020 vote. ""Painfully,"" she said, ""Joe Biden won the election and it's very painful to watch. He's the President. We know that."" Murdoch and Christie undoubtedly have their own personal motives for speaking out against Trump in this moment, and there's plenty of evidence to warrant accusations of hypocrisy. Murdoch, whose Fox News -- home of Tucker Carlson, a purveyor of harmful lies and propaganda about everything from the Covid vaccine to American democracy -- is still serving Trump's goals. But Fox News now faces billion-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by two voting technology companies that allege the network spread false claims of election fraud. Murdoch might be driven by a fear of liability and the potential damage additional lawsuits could inflict on his bottom line if Fox News continues to follow Trump down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and baseless claims. There is, also the possibility that he cares about the future of conservative politics, and genuinely fears the GOP might get trampled if Trump doesn't let up.Christie, for his part, is trying to promote his book and his prospects of occupying the White House.Still, it is remarkable that they have done the calculus and decided they can benefit from speaking out against the former president, even after other Republicans have been badly hurt by doing the same thing. I think their calculation makes sense. With President Joe Biden's ratings sinking, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are doomed. But it is Republicans who may be doomed if they continue to stick with the former president.There's no doubt the Biden administration is terrible at messaging. The economy is booming and yet consumers are feeling pessimistic. Meanwhile, Biden is making important legislative progress, and the inflationary pressures that are creating the false impression that the economy is failing could be resolved in time to boost Democrats' fortunes.Even if Democrats are still in the doldrums in 2024, it's hard to imagine that voters will be yearning for another four years of Trumpian chaos. Biden may look uninspiring now, but the former president, who had the most consistently poor approval ratings of any president in the modern era, remains highly unpopular and controversial. Do Republicans want a candidate embroiled in endless -- and serious -- legal troubles? According to the New York Times, prosecutors are likely to impanel a grand jury in Georgia in the criminal investigation of the former president's attempt to overturn the 2020 election (In September, he suggested he was being unfairly targeted, saying, ""Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me."") Meanwhile, prosecutors in New York have convened a second grand jury to hear evidence about Trump Organization's business practices, according to the Washington Post. (The first grand jury, which convened this spring, charged two Trump companies and an executive with tax evasion. Trump, who was not charged, blasted the indictment and called the investigation a ""political witch hunt."")A Pew poll conducted in September found that two-thirds of Republicans want Trump to remain a major force in the party, but only 44% want him to run again. One-third of Republicans and 92% of Democrats don't want him to be a major national political figure going forward. That's not the arithmetic of victory. There's the potential for a post-Trump Republican Party to gain ground. It still seems like a long shot at this point, but if his critics are successful in persuading the GOP to move in a different direction, there's a chance American democracy can return some semblance of normality, where political leaders debate what policies are best for the country, without fear of upsetting the tender, explosive feelings of a very bad loser.",0
1716,"CALL IT AN October surprise. Almost every day over the past two weeks countries across Asia have revealed plans to loosen pandemic-induced restrictions on inbound tourism. India went first, announcing on October 7th that it would at last resume issuing tourist visas for visitors from all countries on November 15th. Two days later Singapore expanded its quarantine-free travel lanes beyond just Germany and Brunei. Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thailand’s prime minister, said on October 11th that fully vaccinated tourists would be able to visit many parts of the country without quarantine from November 1st.
Several Indonesian islands, including Bali, opened up on October 14th. Malaysia’s prime minister hinted at a reopening in December. Fiji’s government said it wants people to spend Christmas there. Even parts of Australia, which has had among the harshest travel policies in the world, will welcome travellers again from next month. “For double-vaccinated people around the world, Sydney, New South Wales, is open for business,” said Dominic Perrottet, the state’s premier.

Yet India is an exception in throwing open its borders to all tourists. Most Asian countries welcoming travellers are doing so only for those from a carefully chosen list of countries, with acres of small print. Thailand initially planned to open its doors only to ten, mostly European countries. Bali is welcoming travellers from 19, half from Europe and none from its own region of South-East Asia. Singapore’s list has expanded from two to 11, with most in Europe, and even then only on designated flights. Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, threw cold water over Mr Perrottet’s reopening a few days later when he said that it will at first apply only to Australian citizens, residents and their families.
Indeed, the more reliant a country is on tourism, the greater seems to be its caution. In 2019 tourism made up about half of Fiji’s exports, a fifth of Thailand’s, and nearly a tenth of Malaysia’s. India, by contrast, relied on tourists for just 6% of exports. The share for Singapore is smaller still, but the city-state’s economic model depends on being open to the world. The announcements are less an indication of enthusiasm for welcoming visitors back than of the sense that it would be especially damaging to delay longer: now is when people book their winter holidays.
That is one reason why the reopening is so limited. Many Asian economies desperately need a decent season of inbound tourism but do not feel fully prepared to welcome lots of visitors. Even in Thailand, where tourism accounts for a fifth of jobs, 60% of people said in a recent survey that November 1st was too soon for the country to open up. Yet that must be balanced against people’s livelihoods. On October 21st Mr Prayuth announced that Thailand would in fact open to 46 countries, more than half of them European. “If we wait until everything is fully ready, we’ll be too late. Besides, tourists may choose to go elsewhere,” he wrote on Facebook.
A phased approach allows locals to get used to the idea of tourists again. It will also help businesses, which must refill their swimming pools and rehire workers after nearly two years of closures. Taking things slowly is useful for governments, too, which are watching covid-19 case numbers and worry that they may need to throttle back.
“The first markets to open up will be vulnerable to overtourism,” says Liz Ortiguera of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, an industry body. The choice of European countries may in part reflect that concern. The vast majority of tourists in Asia come from other Asian countries, who tend to make shorter trips and therefore spend less per visit. Europeans and Americans, having travelled all the way, often stay longer and spend more freely, says David Vanzetti of the University of Western Australia. As countries re-open, they are trying to maximise profits while keeping visitor numbers manageable.
The near-total halt in travel and tourism caused by the pandemic is unique in being caused by a lack of supply rather than demand, says Xiang “Robert” Li of US-Asia Center for Tourism  Hospitality Research at Temple University in Philadelphia. People still want to travel, and will get back on the road as soon as they are allowed. After past crises, such as the SARS outbreak in 2002-04, travel recovered domestically at first, then regionally and eventually across long distances. The same will be true this time, perhaps even more so after nearly two years of public-health messages that painted the outside world as a mortal threat. “We used to take travel for granted,” says Mr Li. But after 18 months of being grounded, “we realise that tourism is not just superficial fun. It actually is part of the contemporary lifestyle and has a lot to do with our well-being, who we are, and how to be happy.”

Editor’s note (October 21st): This piece has been updated to include Thailand’s announcement that residents of several dozen more countries would be allowed to enter from November 1st. It has also been corrected to note that they can travel only to certain parts of the country.

1717,"THE 13TH hole at Augusta National, named Azalea after the riotous pink blooms behind the green, is one of golf’s most celebrated par-fives. Its fairway turns sharply left after 275 yards, still 235 short of the flag. Most recreational players need three strokes to reach that azalea-fringed green—which is protected by a creek at the front and four bunkers at the back. Yet several competitors at this year’s Masters tournament, which starts at Augusta on April 8th, will expect to be on it in two.
Among them will be Bryson DeChambeau. Thanks to data analysis, more powerful clubs, more muscle and better technique, golf’s biggest hitters are driving the ball farther than ever, and the Californian farther than anyone. Last year Mr DeChambeau put on 40lb and a few yards. In September he won the US Open. And in November, at the Masters, bookmakers predicted he would triumph again, thanks to his ability to bomb the ball 350 yards or more and reach the greens on par-fives with just a drive and a short, lofted iron. On the final day, he holed out in a mere three shots on the 13th. (Alas, he hit some wild shots into the bushes, too, so he did not come close to winning the tournament. Another mighty hitter, Dustin Johnson, did.)

The defanging of golf’s most fearsome courses encapsulates a problem facing authorities in several sports. How should they respond when better technology, allied with improved physique and technique, lets players take a leap forward? Do they weigh them down again, or let them soar?
Thirty years ago, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) was facing a similar conundrum. Players were getting stronger and wielding more powerful rackets. Games were dominated by big serves and shorter, less entertaining rallies: “Just boom, boom, boom; bang, bang, bang,” shrugged Jimmy Connors, winner of eight Grand Slam tournaments in the 1970s and 1980s. According to Jeff Sackmann, a tennis analyst, the average length of a point in men’s singles finals at Wimbledon fell from just under three shots (ie, serve, return, winner) in 1981-85 to just above 1.5 (serve, returned half the time) by the end of the 1990s. On his way to the title in 2001 Goran Ivanisevic blasted 213 aces.
The ITF, with the organisers of the four Grand Slams, took action. Balls were made bigger and fluffier, so they travelled through the air more slowly. Courts were relaid with different materials to encourage bounce; at Wimbledon, different grass was sown. It worked: Mr Sackmann calculates that in 2011-15 the average point length at Wimbledon was up to more than four shots. Points got longer at the Australian and US Opens, too.
All the while, players have adapted, both to power and to changing conditions. Mark Kovacs, a tennis coach, says that having grown up facing big serves, the generation of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal not only served well themselves but became better than their predecessors at returning the ball. And Mr Kovacs expects “a big increase in the next five years in the power and speed of tennis players’ shots” as the game makes fuller use of sports science. This could in turn prompt the authorities to act again if power becomes too dominant once more.
In athletics and swimming, technology poses governing bodies a different problem. Runners and swimmers battle not only their opponents and the elements, but also the clock. Great rivalries and fierce championship races are thrilling—but doubly so when records are broken.
Several studies have suggested that humans are approaching the physical limits of how fast they can run and swim. On the track and in the pool, the progression of world records has slowed dramatically. In the 1960s seven men lowered the record for the 400 metres by a combined 1.3 seconds. In the next 50 years it was broken only thrice more, by a total of 0.8 seconds. Several marks in women’s sprinting have stood for more than 30 years. In 2008 Mark Denny, a Stanford biologist, estimated the fastest possible times for a range of races. So far, all but one of his predictions have held up. Even the mighty Usain Bolt failed to break the Denny barrier, despite setting records for the men’s 100 and 200 metres (9.58 and 19.19 seconds, both at the world championships in Berlin in 2009).
But lately, technology—in the shape of the newest running shoes—has helped athletes start smashing world records again, at least at longer distances. At the same meeting in October 2020, runners wearing Nike shoes cropped four seconds from the best time for the women’s 5,000 metres, which had stood for 12 years, and six from for the men’s 10,000 metres record, after 15.
Unlike the tennis authorities in the boom-boom years, World Athletics has taken a broadly permissive view. It has updated its guidelines, but the new rules would still allow almost all of the record-breaking shoes to be worn at the Olympics due to take place in Tokyo this summer. “It is a very difficult line to tread,” says Gareth Balch of Two Circles, a sports marketing agency. “You want to balance being modern and relevant with being contextual and traditional. The shoes are right on the line.”
A blanket ban on next-generation shoes would open World Athletics to accusations of obstructing innovation. But if it does nothing, record times could become so quick that modern, tech-powered athletics becomes shorn from glorious achievements in the past. Swimming offers a cautionary tale. Its governing body, FINA, permitted drag-reducing all-in-one polyurethane suits before the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Twenty-five world records were set, 23 of them by swimmers wearing all-in-ones. The suits became almost a requirement for winning a gold medal. FINA banned them the following year, but has been left with a group of records that subsequent swimmers have struggled to break. Instead, competition pools have been deepened and drainage improved to encourage faster times.
At Augusta golf’s rulemakers (the USGA in America and Mexico; the R elsewhere) will watch the tee shots with more than just the usual appreciative eye. In recent years they have become more concerned by the lengths that elite golfers are driving. One could make golf courses longer to accommodate big hitters, but that is expensive, since it typically requires more land. So this year the R and USGA published a report making the case for new regulations on clubs and balls. Outlawing new equipment would annoy its manufacturers—who spend a lot of money on sponsorships and advertising. And many players chafe at putative restrictions on their driving power.
Any changes would need to be phased in slowly, so whoever dons the winner’s green jacket at this year’s Masters will probably be a big hitter. But afterwards golf’s authorities are likely to look to the example of tennis, and tilt the balance of the sport back in favour of its most demanding holes and away from its power-hitting players.",2
1718,"Seoul (CNN Business)Tim Sweeney is on a mission. The Epic Games CEO has been mounting a relentless attack on Apple, after the tech giant kicked his company's hugely popular video game Fortnite off the App Store. Apple said at the time that Epic flouted rules on digital payments by establishing its own system.Epic sued Apple in response, kicking off a highly public trial. Apple has argued that its rigid payments system exists to protect the security and privacy of its developers and customers, and that it's only a small part of the video game market — and therefore has no monopoly. Sweeney sees things differently. Companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL), he argues, wield enormous power over the app market. Their control prevents consumers and companies from choosing how they do business.The case is still working its way through US courts, but in September a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside its App Store. Still, the judge stopped short of calling Apple a monopoly, and the company has barred Fortnite from its devices until the legal battle finishes, which could delay the game's return to iPhones by several years.CNN Business caught up with Sweeney in Seoul, where he was attending the Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness — an event hosted by South Korean lawmaker Jo Seounglae. The country recently enacted a law that allows app developers to use alternative payment systems. We asked Sweeney questions about that law, as well as his ongoing fight with Apple, Fortnite's failed foray into China and his thoughts on the ""metaverse,"" the virtual world Facebook (FB) sees as its future. Our Q&A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.South Korea recently passed a bill banning mandatory in-app purchases and ordering tech companies to allow alternative payments. What did you think?I was very happy to see that Korea was taking the leadership role, initially. Korea is one of the leading technology powerhouses in the world, with Samsung (SSNLF) and all the great game developers around Korea. It's great to see Korea really defending developers, including all the Korean developers against these bad practices [by] Apple and Google. How much business and revenue has Epic Games lost as a result of getting kicked off Apple's ecosystem?Fortnite had made hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Fortnite being off of iOS, it's losing that much now. But fortunately, Fortnite is also successful on personal computers and game consoles. So the business continues to be strong, despite being off of iOS. But it just shows how much power Apple wields and is able to completely eliminate a game's existence on iOS. No platform company should have that power, right? Consumers should be free to install software. And developers should be free to create software, and the platform company should never stand in between them.Do you have any regrets about how the legal battles with Apple and Google have played out?We always knew it would be a slow and complex case. Both Apple and Epic realized from the beginning that whatever happened within the District Court ... the decision would be appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court in the United States, and, if possible, to the United States Supreme Court, to ultimately make the decision. And so, it was inevitable that this would take many years.Do you have anything to say to the people who have influence over this issue in the United States? Ultimately, this is a battle for consumer rights. Though the disputes are mostly between companies and governments, it's about the right of a smartphone owner to be able to install software from sources of their choosing, and to do business directly with developers without the platform company adding taxes and fees to every transaction. ... It's about the basic freedom of everybody to do business together directly if they choose. I think it's the most important fight for digital rights in the industry right now. Because more and more of our lives are moving online and becoming digital — all of our digital interactions are increasingly controlled by Google and Apple. If we allow the world's two most powerful corporations to control our online lives, it'll become a force that's more powerful than the government itself.Epic spent a long time working on Fortnite's launch in China, but it didn't happen. Was that time and effort worth it?I'm glad we tried. There's always been a lot of uncertainty about the future of US-China relations, and unfortunately, they've been strained for the past few years. And we just didn't see a realistic likelihood of being able to receive approval to launch in China. So we gave up trying, but I think it was a good effort.The team did a wonderful job, and I wish there had been a way, but I think there's just going to be a long period in which there's a separation between consumer services inside China and globally.What is the ""metaverse"" to you?It is real time 3D entertainment experiences that are social. It's you and your friends together in a 3D world, having fun in lots of different ways. You can be playing games like Fortnite Battle Royale, you can be going to concerts, you can be dancing, or you can just be standing around and chatting. It's all the sorts of social interactions we can have in real time 3D together with our group of friends.What kind of future do you envision in the metaverse? Is it really going to be a game changer, like the internet was when it was introduced?I think it will take a decade or more to really get to the end point, but I think that is happening. And it will be a better online experience than we're having today. It will succeed because it's better. The metaverse doesn't require fancy new hardware. It doesn't require all that reality hardware or [virtual reality] or things that haven't been invented yet. You can get online and start experiencing this right now.The next step of this metaverse evolution is to open up broader experiences to bring in the next billion users.What are some of the biggest hurdles to making it happen?The metaverse isn't going to be created by one company. It will be created by millions of developers each building out their part of it.Another challenge is building the economy. In order to have millions of developers building for the metaverse, you need to have a business where they can make as much or more money from that effort, developing software to support their businesses.We need to win the fight against platform monopolies, because Apple and Google currently have rules in place to prevent the metaverse from existing on the Google Play Store and on iOS. They have rules that prevent web browsers from existing — you're only allowed to use their web browser.They don't allow commerce to be done directly with users. They don't allow code to be run on your local device if it hasn't been reviewed by Apple and Google. The metaverse needs to support all of these things, so we really need to win this battle to open up platforms before the metaverse can truly exist.-- Rishi Iyengar and Jill Disis contributed to this report.",0
1719,"TO GET RICH is glorious, Deng Xiaoping supposedly said. “To get as rich as Jack Ma is clearly not so glorious,” quipped an investor last November when the initial public offering of Mr Ma’s Ant Group was cancelled on the say-so of China’s financial regulators. A lot of foreign investors interpreted it as a slap-down to China’s best-known billionaire and thus a warning to the country’s other plutocrats not to get too big for their boots.
But in the months since then the scope of the regulatory crackdown has grown ever wider. China’s two internet giants, Alibaba and Tencent, are being worked over by the antitrust authorities. Earlier this month Didi Global, a ride-hailing service, was caught in the net just days after it listed in New York. And in the past week the education-technology industry has become a target. New regulations bar any company that teaches subjects on the school curriculum from listing abroad, having foreign investors or making profits. When it comes to teaching schoolchildren, no one should get rich.

The market response to the latest bureaucratic diktat was a sharp sell-off. The share prices of a trio of Chinese online-tutoring firms listed in New York fell by two-thirds. The panic spread to other Chinese firms listed in America. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks the biggest stocks of this kind, fell by almost 20% over three days. The contagion took in China’s onshore market, with share prices down across the board.

China’s preferences now seem clear. It wishes to see capital raised on its own exchanges, within its purview and on the terms that it dictates. The effects of this on financial markets are likely to linger. China itself may be the biggest loser.
Start with the effect on the market value of tech firms outside China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index also sold off in response to the rout of Chinese tech stocks, because the latest episode signalled that investing in technology carries regulatory risk. In America Joe Biden’s administration has also sought to strengthen oversight of big tech, by beefing up antitrust. But trustbusting in America takes place in a legal context. There is a body of jurisprudence that limits how far the authorities can go in clipping the wings of tech giants, even those making profits many find obscene: Alphabet, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft all reported a record second-quarter haul this week. If Chinese rivals are mired in red tape, that is all to the good of big tech in America.
And the clampdown will indeed harm Chinese tech. Investors who piled in during recent years have this week been pummelled in public markets. Private American capital is also tied up in Chinese startups. The value in those ventures is now, in effect, frozen. The route to an IPO for a young Chinese firm—the reliable way for venture capitalists to get their money back—now borders on perilous. A lot of Chinese firms have raised money abroad in vehicles known as variable-interest entities, which are essentially synthetic shares. This route may now be blocked for ever. And venture capitalists will surely be charier about backing Chinese tech startups, however promising.
Still more worrying is that any investment, even in an onshore non-tech firm, is now at risk from arbitrary rule changes. That will raise the cost of capital for Chinese firms. China’s securities regulator hastily convened a meeting with international bankers this week to reassure them that only education-based firms were being targeted. It suggests that China’s policy brass, having startled markets, have realised that they may have miscalculated.
It certainly looks that way. The capital markets are not a tap that regulators can turn on and off when it suits them. True, investors’ memories can be short. But China is gaining a reputation for regulatory high-handedness that it can shed only by starting to follow transparent rules—and that is precisely the sort of subordination the Communist Party abhors. ■",2
1720,"CHINA’S VAST and opaque financial system has long posed a threat to its economy and the world. The agonies of Evergrande, a property firm with towering debts, are a reminder of how hard it is to manage the risks. The government is attempting to impose an orderly default on some of its creditors but faces the risk of contagion. The episode also highlights a bigger question of whether President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on business will make it even harder to create a reformed financial system that is safer, more open and more efficient.
Part of what makes China’s financial industry daunting is its size. Banking assets have ballooned to about $50trn and they sit alongside a large, Byzantine system of shadow finance. Total credit extended to firms and households has soared from 178% of GDP a decade ago to 287% today. The industry suffers from opacity, a lack of market signals and the erratic application of rules. Property is part of the problem. Families funnel their savings into apartments rather than casino stockmarkets or state-run banks. Real-estate developers raise debts in the shadow-banking system in order to finance epic construction booms.

As well as being big, the system is inefficient at allocating capital, dragging down growth. Nor is this a problem the world can ignore. Chinese firms have issued roughly $1trn of dollar bonds, many of them snapped up by foreign investors. A liquidity crunch in China’s economy would hurt global activity, from commodity markets to the sales of luxury goods.
With an illiquid portfolio of property projects financed by $300bn of liabilities, 80% of them short-term, Evergrande has a huge liquidity mismatch. It has struggled to cope with new government rules designed to curb excessive borrowing in the real-estate industry but which may now have backfired.

Bailing out financial firms can be distasteful but necessary—just ask the officials who rescued AIG and Citigroup. China’s government is worried that a default could cause contagion in the bond market and shadow-banking industry and lead to job losses and stalled projects in the property sector, which underpins a fifth or so of GDP. As we went to press, it was unclear whether the government would blink and rescue the firm.
While the dilemma of “too-big-to-fail” is common, many elements of the Evergrande saga highlight China’s shortcomings. Evergrande’s statements about whether it has missed interest payments have been confusing, leaving investors in the dark. It is unclear if the formal hierarchy of creditors matters or whether the Communist Party’s view of who counts will override it. The sense of opacity and political machination is part of a pattern. Huarong, a state-owned financial firm suffering from fraud, hid a $16bn loss for months. It was eventually bailed out in August.
Evergrande shows the importance of deeper financial reforms. But what might they look like? Liberal reformers have longed for a clean-up of bad debts, a loosening of controls over prices (including the exchange rate), transparency and independent courts that can enforce property rights. Such a system would allocate capital better and be less prey to moral hazard.
Mr Xi’s authoritarian regime helps financial stability in some ways: he sees excessive borrowing as a security risk and may terrify debt-hungry tycoons into being more cautious. The centralisation of power may make it easier to control crises at sprawling organisations such as Evergrande.
But his broad agenda to reassert control over the economy, information flows, courts and regulators cuts against the thrust of financial reform. Why would he want a more open capital account, which would raise the risk of capital flight following political purges, or private creditors to have stronger rights, or to delegate the role of picking tomorrow’s industries to investors? Even if Evergrande escapes calamity, the consequences of Mr Xi’s policies for the long-term health of the financial system are only just starting to sink in. ■

1721,"BARBARA GOMES has almost completed her doctorate in biomedicine at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), one of the best in Brazil. Jobs are scarce and the best she has been able to find is a substitute teaching position at the university that pays around 4,000 reais ($760) a month. For her experiments on a protein associated with mad-cow disease, however, she needs reagents that that university cannot always afford and that cost more than her salary. As a result she, like many of her cohort, wants to leave Brazil. Her plan to move to France was scuppered by the pandemic, but when she finishes her doctorate, she will go: “If I want to work in science, I must leave the country.”
Brazilian emigration to OECD countries has been rising for years, but took off especially in 2017, growing by 24% from the previous year. Nearly 30% of all Brazilians living in OECD countries have a university education. In the past two years, applications by Brazilian skilled workers for permanent visas in the United States, the main destination for those leaving Brazil, rose by 30% to the highest level in at least ten years.

The exodus is mainly the result of economic instability left over from the recession of 2014-16. But it has been worsened by the populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, who sees academics as enemies. His guru, Olavo de Carvalho, has said that Brazil’s universities are hives of drugs, orgies and communist propaganda. The federal science-funding agency’s budget has dropped by nearly half since 2000, while the government is pouring money into sending members of the armed forces, often supporters of Mr Bolsonaro, to study abroad.
The UFRJ has enough money to keep its doors open only until September; after that it may have to close labs and restrict some classes to online. At least six professors who criticised the president’s actions during the pandemic, which has so far killed more than 540,000 Brazilians, were investigated by the government.
“Being in a country that has daily attacks on science is very discouraging,” says Ana Carneiro, a professor who studies the Brazilian diaspora at UNICAMP, a university in the state of São Paulo. But it is not new. During the dictatorship of 1964-85, for which Mr Bolsonaro is nostalgic, academics were among the thousands exiled. The military government had a slogan: “Brazil: love it or leave it.”
After starting to trim the bloated public-pension system in 2019, Mr Bolsonaro has abandoned attempts at the economic reforms required for a return to growth. The country was still struggling from the recession when the pandemic hit. With only 17% of Brazilians fully vaccinated, economic normality still seems distant. Despite a generous public financial-aid programme last year, poverty tripled. GDP in the first quarter exceeded expectations, but Brazil must still tackle unemployment at 14.7%, a record high. Half of all young people say they would leave if they could.
It is not long ago that Brazil offered young researchers fairer prospects. Between 2003 and 2016 successive governments led by the Workers’ Party, under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, set up 18 new universities (some from satellite campuses of existing institutions). In 2015 Brazil outpaced countries like Russia and Mexico in its spending on science, technology and innovation.
Yet even when Brazil was investing in education, there were snags. The Ciência Sem Fronteiras (“Science without Borders”) programme inaugurated in 2011 by Ms Rousseff, then president, sent almost 100,000 Brazilians to study in more than 30 countries over six years. But when they returned, there was no policy for what to do with them, says Ms Carneiro. When the programme was still running, a quarter of scholarship recipients said they intended to pursue a career outside Brazil.
By exporting scientists and their innovations, Brazil is losing the chance to build technological heft at home. More than a quarter of GDP still comes from agriculture. Cuts in scholarships that began under Ms Rousseff’s successor, Michel Temer, have deepened under Mr Bolsonaro. After Ms Rousseff’s disastrous stewardship of the economy led to recession, the newer government-funded universities saw their budgets slashed. The Federal University of Cariri in the state of Ceará, in the poor north-east, was founded in 2013, but has lost more than 80% of its government research grants in the past four years.
The foreign ministry recently set up a programme called Innovation Diplomacy to try to link Brazilians abroad with the mother country, in order to boost trade and investment back home. But its goals are ill-defined. And many of those planning to leave are likely to stay away until the situation in Brazil improves. “I wish I didn’t have to go,” says Ms Gomes. “But there’s nothing here for me.” ■",2
1722,"Britain’s annual rate of  inflation dipped slightly to 3.1% in September, pulled down by a fall in restaurant prices. As in other countries, inflation is expected to remain high because of the dual crunch in energy markets and supply chains. Speaking before the release of the data, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said that action might be needed to tame inflationary pressures. Some saw this as a sign that the central bank will raise interest rates before Christmas, though Mr Bailey suggested he is more concerned about taming prices over the medium term.
Jens Weidmann announced that he would step down as president of Germany’s Bundesbank, a position he has held since 2011. As a leading hawk on the European Central Bank’s council, Mr Weidmann was a vocal critic of quantitative easing, saying in 2019 that the ECB had overreacted to the euro zone’s slowdown. In remarks this week he warned central bankers “not to lose sight of prospective inflationary dangers”.

European gas prices surged again, after a closely watched auction of pipeline capacity suggested that Russia will not increase its supply in the coming weeks. Russia provided 43% of the European Union’s gas imports last year. The Kremlin denies it is withholding supplies as a way of pressing Germany to certify Russia’s recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In Germany a senior Green politician accused Russia of blackmail and said the pipeline should not get a permit.

1723,"MOST ARTISTIC impressions of dinosaurs picture them in lush forests or on vast temperate savannahs. That is fair enough. Such landscapes were common during the beasts’ heydays, the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. These pictures do, though, ignore the fact that dinosaur fossils have, for decades, been dug up in places which were at that time polar. Whether these are the remains of migrants which came for the summer, or of permanent residents, is debated. But a discovery of bone fragments and teeth from dinosaur hatchlings (see picture), just published in Current Biology by Patrick Druckenmiller of University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and his colleagues, suggests some dinosaurs did indeed make their full-time homes in the Arctic.
Modern animals that migrate to polar climes, notably birds, do often breed there. But their eggs hatch quickly and their young develop fast enough to fledge and fly to warmer places before winter arrives. Growth lines in fossilised dinosaur embryos found elsewhere suggest they needed as much as six or seven months of incubation before they were ready to hatch. Palaeontologists therefore reckon any discovery of fossilised eggs or hatchlings near the palaeo-poles would mean the species concerned must have been year-round residents rather than migrants.

Until now, no such hatchlings had been found, and the only known polar dinosaur eggs were from the Kakanaut formation of north-eastern Russia, which was only just within the Arctic Circle when its rocks were laid down. Dr Druckenmiller’s discoveries are from the Prince Creek Formation of northern Alaska, which may have been as close as 5° of latitude from the North Pole when its rocks formed 70m years ago.
The fossils themselves come from a range of dinosaur groups, including ceratopsians (related to the likes of Triceratops), duck-billed hadrosaurs, large carnivores related to Tyrannosaurus and smaller velociraptor-like predators. This suggests a diverse and flourishing ecosystem, despite the fact that Prince Creek was continuously dark for 120 days a year and had an average annual temperature of 6°C—meaning snow would have been common in winter.
How all these creatures survived those conditions was, Dr Druckenmiller suggests, a consequence of dinosaurs’ warmbloodedness and the downy feathers many of them are now known to have sported. No direct evidence of feathers has yet been found among the Alaskan fossils, but their ubiquity elsewhere makes it likely they had them.",2
1724,"SUGA YOSHIHIDE, Japan’s prime minister, had been plotting for his re-election as late as September 2nd. The next day, he emerged from a meeting with the other leaders of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) looking crestfallen. With his approval ratings wallowing and his support inside the party hollowing, he declared that he would not run in the party’s leadership race after all. Mr Suga’s about-face has left the LDP—and Japan’s political future—in flux. The party will vote for a new president on September 29th. The winner will become prime minister and lead the LDP into lower-house elections that must be held by late November.
Four contenders stand out so far: Kishida Fumio, a former foreign minister, has good relationships within the party, but limited popular support. Kono Taro, a former foreign and defence minister and the current vaccine tsar, is social-media savvy, and, at 58, on the younger side by Japanese standards. Though popular with the public, his reputation as a maverick puts off many in the party. Takaichi Sanae, a former internal-affairs minister, has scant name recognition, but is a budding darling of the LDP’s right wing. Ishiba Shigeru, a former defence minister, may enter the fray as well. He too has sizeable public support but little among colleagues.

None of the four represents radical change in policy terms. All are staunch supporters of the alliance with America, and favour shoring up Japan’s own defences in the face of Chinese expansionism. None will move to reverse the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy or to impose fiscal austerity. There are subtle differences emerging over how exactly to handle relations with China, how loose to be with different forms of stimulus, how to shape Japan’s energy policy and how to manage the covid-19 pandemic. But the main faultlines are instead generational and presentational: between a predictable, old-style party man in Mr Kishida; the independent-minded, more charismatic Mr Kono; and a nationalist firebrand in Ms Takaichi.
In public opinion polls Mr Kono comes out on top. Yet the public does not decide LDP elections. The initial ballot combines the party’s 383 members of the Diet and another 383 votes that reflect the choices of the party’s 1.1m members. If no candidate wins a majority, as is often the case, the top two move to a run-off in which Diet members’ votes have far more weight. They tend to vote in blocs along factional lines, but this time around, younger MPs are chafing at the older faction bosses’ control.
The outcome of the race will depend on backroom wheeling and dealing and inter-factional horse-trading, but also on how worried the party’s leadership is about the looming Diet elections and on how much influence younger backbenchers, who prefer Mr Kono, can exert. For the party’s old guard, Mr Kishida may seem a safer bet. Ms Takaichi, a regular visitor to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, is attractive to those on the right. Mr Ishiba could upend the race further by entering himself or explicitly backing one of the others.
Before the eight-year premiership of Abe Shinzo, Mr Suga’s predecessor, Japan ran through six prime ministers in six years. There is a risk that Mr Suga’s resignation will precipitate a similar spell of turmoil. But it may also open the door to a new era. As Mr Suga’s abrupt resignation suggests, at this stage, uncertainty is the only certainty. ■",2
1725,"WHEN MILLIONS of migrant workers were forced by India’s sudden covid lockdown to return to their villages from the cities where they worked, many feared destitution. But Aadhaar, the country’s pioneering biometric ID system, came to the rescue. Under an income scheme for farmers launched in 2014 that would have been impossible without Aadhaar, $1.5bn was transferred digitally and at speed into the bank accounts of 30m people, with little waste or fraud and almost no distribution cost.
Because 1bn accounts are linked to people’s Aadhaar identity numbers, India has been able to channel help to where it has been most needed with remarkable efficiency. Contrast that with America, where 90m paper cheques were laboriously sent through the mail, accompanied by a signed letter from President Donald Trump.

Covid has had a way both of exposing the weakest links in societies and of acting as a spur to innovation. Rich countries without national digital-ID systems can scrape through, thanks to myriad other ways people have of proving who they are—driving licences, credit cards, social-security numbers and so on. But for poor countries, the problem of getting covid-related help to their most vulnerable citizens is made infinitely more difficult when you do not know who they are or what services, such as health care and income support, they are entitled to.
Around the world, 1bn people have no formal proof of identity. More than 80% of them live in sub-Saharan Africa and the less well-off parts of Asia. Less than half of African children under five have their births registered. The poorest, women and those living in rural areas are least likely to have officially recognised IDs.
Something as seemingly straightforward but critically important as a vaccination registry to record who has had a jab and who has not, is easy to set up if you have a foundational digital-ID system to build it on, but much harder if you do not. Nandan Nilekani, the co-founder of Infosys, one of India’s largest IT-consulting and systems-integration firms, and the driving force behind Aadhaar, believes that the system will be crucial to authenticating digital certificates as a proof of vaccination.
Many governments in Africa and Asia have been inspired by the success of Aadhaar, which since its inception in 2009 has enrolled 1.3bn people. It has streamlined the delivery of services and payments, cut corruption, boosted financial inclusion and hugely raised participation in India’s digital economy. Before covid struck, encouraged by the launch of World Bank’s ID4D (“Identification for Development”) programme, which started in 2014, countries such as Morocco, the Philippines and Myanmar went to Delhi in search of help. But there is now a new sense of urgency.
However, Aadhaar is a complex system with its own set of application program interfaces, known as the India Stack, that could not easily be replicated. Having learned lessons from Aadhaar, Mr Nilekani proposed a different approach: building an open-source foundational ID platform that could be taken up by any country free of charge. The result is MOSIP, which stands for Modular Open Source Identity Platform.
With financial support from the World Bank, two countries—Morocco and the Philippines—are implementing national ID schemes based on MOSIP, which will be rolled out early next year. Three more—Ethiopia, Guinea and Sri Lanka—are working on pilots. Several others, including Ivory Coast, Togo and Tunisia, are keen on using MOSIP. There are plans for countries across west Africa to have a shared interoperable ID platform, allowing cross-border authentication. The aim is that by 2023, at least ten countries will be operating MOSIP-based digital-ID platforms and it will have become an international standard, each country having learned from the others’ deployments. And the covid emergency is lengthening the queue of countries at MOSIP’s door.
The MOSIP project, which got going in March 2018, is nested in Bangalore’s International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-B) and endowed with funding of $16m from the Omidyar Network, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Tata Trusts. What it set out to do was to give countries with far less IT capacity than India’s a basis for establishing a cost-effective foundational identity system that was, in effect, “Aadhaar in a box”. Bangalore, according to C.V. Madhukar, Omidyar’s lead on digital identity, was the obvious place to base MOSIP. It could draw on technical know-how from Mr Nilekani’s original Aadhaar team, who were mostly still there, and on the resources of the iSPIRT Foundation, an organisation of volunteer engineers who donate their time to build software as a public good.
From the outset the MOSIP group, which is led by S. Rajagopalan, the entrepreneurial head of IIIT-B’s Innovation Centre, was clear on two points. The first was that MOSIP should be a standard-bearer for “good” digital ID. It had to be designed with a “citizen-centred” approach that ensured safety (protecting individual privacy and ensuring inclusion) and accountability (policies to limit use cases to those which are of general benefit and which cannot be perverted for purposes such as political suppression).
Countries applying to use MOSIP must assure its governing executive committee that as well as having sufficient digital infrastructure (or adequate funding to put it in place), their intentions for the system are benign and the underlying policy framework is robust. It is not a guarantee against misuse, but it is a worthy statement of principle. 
The second was that MOSIP should be open-source, allowing all its protocols to be seen, developed and strengthened by collective effort. As Professor Rajagopalan says: “A lot of eyes are better than a few.” His vision is for MOSIP to become a thriving open-source project in which a community of developers and system integrators contribute to the long-term support and growth of the platform.
It was critical that implementing countries, though still needing to hire a professional systems integrator, would own the underlying identification platform including the software that supports it. Mr Madhukar notes that because national digital-ID systems are inherent monopolies, a key requirement for most countries is to avoid the perils of being locked into a single proprietary technology. MOSIP allows them to work with multiple application vendors, and remain in overall control of the system.
Because of its modular design (which separates the functions of each program into independent and interchangeable components) and configurability (which allows flexible solutions to real-world problems and simplifies deployment and maintenance), MOSIP can be adapted to different country contexts, laws and varying levels of digital infrastructure. Ease of customisation gives countries the option to pick the features they want to buy “off-the-shelf” and those they want to develop bespoke. For example, they can choose different modes of authentication, from biometrics to mobile one-time passwords. Another big decision that MOSIP leaves to its clients is whether to go for hosting the platform on national premises or the quicker, more scalable solution of the cloud. Either way, governments, rather than a third-party outfit, will own all their own data.
Over the next year or so, says Mr Madhukar, the MOSIP team will concentrate on “handholding” implementing countries and learning from them what works (and what does not) and further developing the architecture to integrate with a wide range of commercial software producers, while still avoiding the perils of vendor lock-in.
A big challenge for the future, as the number of countries wanting to use MOSIP grows, will be the capacity of local IT talent to build on the platform and create the data application layers to ensure interoperability with national registries and services. That will require the resources to train local providers and systems integrators, while also building a small community of developers that can be parachuted in to deal with specific problems. Without additional funding from philanthropic donors and the World Bank, or more help in kind from tech giants such as Google and Amazon, those efforts will stall.
That would be a pity. Chris Yiu, who leads the technology and policy team at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, is optimistic both about what digital ID in lower-income countries can achieve and how MOSIP can help. The institute is working with Oracle, a business computing firm, to establish vaccination registries across Africa. Mr Yiu says that “covid has played a forcing function” in making countries determined to run their health-care and welfare systems more efficiently and see digital-ID systems as the vital platform for doing so.
Other good things can come from that. Well-designed digital-ID systems, he argues, play a vital role in building trust in both government-to-citizen and citizen-to-citizen transactions, each of which are crucial drivers of social capital (those networks and relationships which are the bedrock of thriving societies) and economic development.",2
1726,"A man is fighting for his life in hospital with a head injury which police believe he may have sustained in an attack after a Queens Park Rangers football match.
The 52-year-old was found after the match last night against Luton Town.
He was found at around 9.50pm on Friday, near the Uxbridge Road junction with Davenport Road in west London. 
Police said they think he may have been caught up in disorder or assaulted after the Championship match and have appealed for witnesses.
Witnesses on social media suggested the post-match fracas happened as fans left the stadium.  
The man, from Luton, was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service (LAS) paramedics and is in a life-threatening condition.

Metropolitan Police Detective Constable Arrash Faghihi said the incident happened in an 'extremely busy' area and urged any witnesses or anyone with mobile phone footage which may be relevant to contact the force.
He said: 'This man sustained a serious head injury, and it is vital that we make contact with witnesses quickly.
'The area was extremely busy after the match and there will undoubtedly be many people with information that will assist police.
'I need them to get in touch as detectives work to build a complete picture of what happened on Friday night.'

1727,"AT FIRST GLANCE, a murder in Istanbul, an abduction in Dubai and a deportation from Austria may seem to be unrelated. But they are all part of a disturbing pattern of behaviour by authoritarian regimes, which are using violence, intimidation and technology to silence dissent abroad. A report published on February 4th by Freedom House, a think-tank, argues that “transnational repression” has become more common. It found that 31 states had physically attacked their citizens living in other countries since 2014, with China, Russia and Rwanda among the worst offenders. China alone is responsible for 214 of the 608 direct attacks recorded. Millions more have been intimidated by harassment, digital surveillance and smear campaigns.
Regimes differ in the way they choose their targets. China goes after a wide variety of victims: religious and ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs, political dissidents, human-rights activists, journalists and former princelings. Russia targets outspoken politicians and former insiders who might spill President Vladimir Putin’s secrets. The Kremlin does not usually harass ordinary Russians abroad. However, the regime in Chechnya, a violent Russian republic, does. Chechens who have fled to western Europe are routinely spied on, threatened and occasionally killed. Iran and Saudi Arabia target outspoken exiles. Turkey hunts for Gulenists, members of an Islamic group whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for an attempted coup in 2016.

Physical attacks, such as murders, assaults, detentions and illegal deportations, are the most direct method of crushing enemies abroad. Freedom House believes there have been many more cases than it has managed to count. Blatant assassinations, such as the dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and a columnist for the Washington Post, in his country’s consulate in Istanbul, are quite rare. Illegal deportations and forced renditions, favourite tactics of Iran and Turkey, are more discreet. Dissenters can be hauled back home, tortured and sometimes executed away from the gaze of disapproving foreigners.
Grabbing people on foreign soil can be hard to do alone, so many countries turn for help to friendly foreign powers or even to formal international agreements. The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a security pact involving China, India, Russia and five Asian “stans”, has a shared “blacklist” of dissidents. Saudi Arabia uses the Gulf Co-operation Council to keep tabs on unreliable exiles.
Democracies can be unwitting accomplices. In March 2020 Austria complied with a request to deport Hizbullo Shovalizoda, an activist, back to Tajikistan. Austria’s Supreme Court later invalidated his extradition, but he is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for extremism. Rogue regimes have long manipulated the “red notices” of Interpol, an international policing organisation, to snare their opponents abroad (Russia has issued more than 40% of all such requests for arrest pending extradition now in circulation). And America’s “war on terror” provided regimes with both a model for rendition and a criminal label for those they want to abuse: 58% of the victims identified by Freedom House had been accused of terrorism.
Governments can also make exiles’ lives difficult in more subtle ways. Common tactics include withholding travel documents, denying consular services and threatening relatives back home. For example, in its attempt to shut down the website of a group of Ahmadis, a religious minority, in America, Pakistan has reminded the exiles that Ahmadis back home can be charged with blasphemy for referring to themselves as Muslims. Since many have relatives in Pakistan, where blasphemy is punishable by death, this is a potent threat.
Technology is making it easier for states to oppress at a distance. The internet and social-media networks which at first connected and empowered dissidents can now trap them, explains Marcus Michaelsen, a researcher who studies authoritarian politics. The Arab Spring a decade ago was a turning point. From thousands of kilometres away, states are now able to track the movements of anyone with a smartphone or a laptop, deploying surveillance software and malware to monitor and harass them. Some even have “backdoor access” to social-media platforms. Saudi Arabia bribed a Saudi programmer at Twitter to provide the whereabouts of troublesome tweeters. China is believed to exercise control over WeChat, a lifeline for Chinese abroad. Such technologies make it easier not only to find out where people are, but then to threaten them, or worse.
Technology also makes repressive regimes more aware of far-flung dissidents’ grumbling. Once they had no idea what the diaspora said about the tyrant back home. Now they can monitor social media and hear every unencrypted and possibly seditious word. This makes the exiles seem more of a threat, so repressive regimes feel more impelled to go after them.
The technology and tactics of extraterritorial repression are, for their perpetrators, helpfully inexpensive. “More and more states are realising that this is easy to do and fairly cheap,” says Gerasimos Tsourapas, of the University of Birmingham. Rwanda, a small, fairly poor African country, is a striking example. Determined to silence those who challenge its self-image as an African “development darling”—and to crack down on those who question its version of the country’s bloody history—the government extends its repressive reach far beyond its borders. Last year Paul Rusesabagina, a former hotelier whose heroism saving Tutsis during the genocide was portrayed in the film “Hotel Rwanda”, was kidnapped in Dubai and brought home. He has since been charged with terrorism; many suspect his real crime is to be an outspoken opponent of Rwanda’s autocratic president, Paul Kagame. Like China, Rwanda seeks to control its people abroad through spyware, an army of social-media trolls, and a coercive network of embassies and expatriate organisations. Senior regime insiders who defect have the most to fear. A former intelligence chief, for example, was strangled in a hotel room in South Africa. But Freedom House says that “all Rwandans are at risk of transnational repression.”
One reason why rogue states get away with harassing exiles is that democracies often look the other way. Sometimes, argues Mr Tsourapas, by acceding to extradition requests and Interpol red notices, and by broadening the definition of terrorism, they have even been complicit.
Extraterritorial repression is not new—Leon Trotsky was in Mexico City, more than 10,000km from Moscow, when Stalin had him murdered with an ice pick. What is new is the ease with which dissidents can be snooped on from afar. This, coupled with the global rise of authoritarian regimes and the disinclination of the previous American administration to advocate human rights, has allowed ever more despots to spread fear globally. As Freedom House argues, stopping them will require the re-assertion of international norms and the punishment of the worst offenders.",2
1728,"Editor’s note: This story has been updated since it was originally published.
“TO THOSE WHO carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this,” said President Joe Biden, speaking after a suicide-bombing at Kabul airport killed 13 Americans and over 170 Afghans on August 26th. “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.” The strike, delivered by a drone, came at dawn on August 28th, in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, killing two “planners” for Islamic State, the Department of Defence claimed. The next day, after Mr Biden had warned a second attack at the airport was “highly likely”, came another, on a car in Kabul. American officials said the vehicle was rigged with explosives, was carrying “multiple suicide-bombers” and was on its way to the airport. But with American forces on their way out, hunting down terrorists is going to get a lot harder.
Around 10,000 foreign jihadists are thought to be in Afghanistan, according to recent UN reports. Many belong to al-Qaeda, which has close ties to the country’s new Taliban rulers; a larger number are affiliated with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), a more extreme group that was behind the Kabul attack. The Pentagon referred to its strikes as “over-the-horizon” counter-terrorism, a capability that Mr Biden had said in July that America was developing, in order to spot threats and “act quickly and decisively if needed”. Such a capability would require at least two things: the ability to spot terrorists and the ability to attack them. Despite the swift strikes, the withdrawal from Afghanistan complicates both.

Start with the first. Much of the intelligence about groups like al-Qaeda and ISKP—such as their leadership, their safe houses and their plotting—would once have come from American troops on the ground, along with their allies in the Afghan army and the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the country’s once-formidable spy agency. Now American troops are gone and the Afghan army and NDS no longer exist. That leaves an intelligence vacuum. “It becomes increasingly difficult to see and understand what is happening on the ground, not least because the supporting infrastructure no longer exists,” says Suzanne Raine, who was director of counter-terrorism in Britain’s foreign office from 2017 to 2019.
One option is to find new Afghan allies. Strangely enough, one candidate is the Taliban. On August 26th General Kenneth McKenzie, head of the Pentagon’s Central Command, which has responsibility for Afghanistan, acknowledged that America had supplied intelligence to the Taliban on ISKP, albeit in sanitised form, and that the Taliban had thwarted some attacks. The problem is that they are unlikely to be so compliant when it comes to the groups with which they are friendlier.
“Contrary to some wishful thinking by a handful of senior [Biden] administration officials, the Taliban are not going to co-operate with us against al-Qaeda and most other terrorist groups,” says Lisa Curtis, who co-ordinated policy on South and Central Asia in the Trump White House. “While the Taliban are opposed to ISKP and will fight them, they will not do the same against the other several South Asian terror groups, like Lashkar-eTaiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad,” she says, referring to a pair of Pakistan-linked groups. Sending actionable intelligence to the Taliban would also require a legal framework, which may not be easy given the group’s questionable record, and might imply recognition of the group as a legitimate government.
A more attractive partner may be Ahmad Masoud, a 32-year-old commander holed up in the Panjshir valley, a northern stronghold, along with Amrullah Saleh, a former NDS chief and vice-president, who has declared himself caretaker president and vowed to resist the Taliban. British and French intelligence agencies once worked closely with Mr Masoud’s father, a renowned anti-Taliban commander, and are thought to remain close to Masoud junior. Yet Panjshiri forces cover only a small sliver of the country. They would have little insight into the machinations of ISKP in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan or the suburbs of Kabul.
America is thus likely to become more reliant on electronic eavesdropping by the National Security Agency (NSA), its signals-intelligence agency. “The difference between now versus 20 years ago is that every Afghan has a cell phone,” says Sameer Lalwani of the Stimson Centre, a think-tank in Washington. Mr Lalwani points to America’s assassination of Qassem Suleimani, a top Iranian general, last year, as an example of how effective such electronic espionage can be against even the hardest targets. It can also be augmented by more traditional spying beyond Afghanistan’s borders. According to Yahoo News, a website, the CIA compromised one of Suleimani’s phones by targeting a courier who visited the Persian Gulf to procure devices. Spies may search for potential recruits among the large and growing Afghan diaspora, some of whom could slip back into the country.
Counter-terrorism is not just about collecting intelligence, but also about acting on it. Some of that action is non-lethal, such as blocking terrorist financing, taking down jihadist propaganda or sowing discord among plotters. Often, though, as with the latest drone strikes, it involves violence. That does not always go well. In August 1998 President Bill Clinton launched dozens of cruise missiles at an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan. He missed Osama bin Laden and killed several Pakistani villagers when a missile went astray.
Missiles are more accurate these days, and drones can fly a great distance, but Afghanistan’s landlocked geography is unchanged. America’s raid into Pakistan against bin Laden in 2011 relied on helicopters flown from Bagram air base, near Kabul, via Jalalabad, a city in eastern Afghanistan close to the Pakistani border. Those bases are no longer available. Iran, to Afghanistan’s west, is unlikely to provide them, given its antipathy to America. America’s relations with Pakistan, which until 2011 hosted CIA drones at the conveniently located Shamsi airfield in Balochistan province, are increasingly rancorous. “There is no way we are going to allow any bases, any sort of action from Pakistani territory into Afghanistan,” said Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, in June. “Absolutely not.”
That leaves Central Asia. “Uzbekistan would seem the most obvious candidate,” suggests Raffaello Pantucci of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. The country previously hosted an American base at Karshi-Khanabad, but it was shut down in 2005 after America criticised Uzbek human-rights abuses. Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Uzbekistan’s president, is keen on improving ties with America and bringing investment, says Ms Curtis. But there may be others who are less keen on the idea of American spooks and soldiers in Central Asia. “The region is under Russian thrall and Putin has signalled loudly: no US bases,” adds Mr Pantucci. “So it really depends on who would have the balls to go against him.”
More likely is that America would have to send warplanes from al-Udeid, its sprawling base in Qatar, or an aircraft-carrier in the Arabian Sea. That would have several disadvantages. Planes would take longer to arrive at their targets, during which time jihadists could move or civilians get in the way, and the fuel demands of a long voyage would mean they could spend less time over their targets. On top of that, such flights could not avoid the diplomatic headache of overflying Iran or Pakistan.
In the end, things are going to get trickier for American spies. “The US government’s ability to collect and act on threats will diminish,” acknowledged Bill Burns, the director of the CIA, in April. “That is simply a fact.” Between 2010 and 2020, American drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen killed somewhere between 9,000 and 17,000 people, including as many as 2,200 civilians, according to figures collected by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a news organisation. Raids by special forces killed many more. Between 2015 and 2018 America and its Afghan allies killed more than 11,000 ISKP members.
Many of the jihadists caught up in this industrial-scale counter-terrorism campaign were not exactly burgeoning bin Ladens. America will inevitably become more selective about whom it targets, largely ignoring those that strike within Afghanistan or the region. Groups like the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the East Turkestan Islamic Movement are more of a problem for local powers than America, says Mr Lalwani. But al-Qaeda, ISKP and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the outfit that killed 169 people in Mumbai in 2008, will remain potential threats.
For the past two decades, intense American pressure forced al-Qaeda’s leaders underground, hindering their communications and complicating plots. As it abates, the group may reconstitute its ability to strike Western targets. “What's happening in Afghanistan is just the next phase in the cycle,” says Ms Raine. “It might be another five years before anything happens. But they've now got the space that they didn’t have, and we should expect them gradually to move back in. The question is whether we will know when it happens.”",2
1729,"NEW DELHI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - India's financial crime fighting agency has ordered Future Group to submit documents related to its 2019 deal with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) as part of an investigation into possible breach of foreign investment laws, according to sources and a notice seen by Reuters.
The demand indicates heightened scrutiny of a deal which is at the heart of legal battles between Amazon and Future after the Indian company decided to sell its retail assets to rival Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) for $3.4 billion in 2020.
That transaction has been put on hold by an arbitrator and Indian courts after Amazon argued Future had violated its contracts with the U.S. company by entering into the sale. Future denies that, and says Amazon is illegally exerting control over the Indian firm's business decisions.
In a confidential notice dated Oct. 28, the Enforcement Directorate agency asked a Future unit to submit all correspondence including emails between Amazon and the Indian group in respect of the investment the U.S. firm made in Future two years ago. Reuters has reviewed a copy of the notice.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the notice was part of an ongoing investigation by the Indian agency to establish whether there were any violations of foreign investment law when Amazon made the $200 million investment in Future's gift voucher unit, Future Coupons.
The notice has not previously been reported and was sent to Future Coupons, which was given 15 days to respond.
The Enforcement Directorate, which typically does not make details of its investigations public, did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon and Future also did not respond.
'RELEVANT FOR INVESTIGATION'
The dispute centres around three commercial agreements signed between Future and Amazon entities in 2019, which a Singapore arbitration panel - also hearing the dispute - has said must be read together while reviewing the transaction, and not separately as Future argues.
But Future contends conflating the commercial agreements would effectively mean its 2019 Amazon deal violated Indian law which prohibits such foreign investments in the retail sector without government approvals.
The Singapore panel has so far backed Amazon's contentions, saying Future breached its agreements with the U.S. company and must not proceed with the Reliance deal while the proceedings are ongoing.
The Indian enforcement agency in its two-page notice also asked Future for copies of various legal filings and supporting documents submitted by Amazon and Future group representatives to Indian courts and the Singapore arbitration panel.
The Enforcement Directorate ""considers that information/documents specified ... would be useful for and relevant to the investigation being conducted,"" the notice added.
Future is India's second largest retailer with more than 1,700 retail outlets, including popular chain Big Bazaar. Before the Reliance deal, Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's assets itself if regulations changed to allow that.",3
1730,"Matt Hancock's job advert for a new member of staff at his House of Commons office has sparked a series of mocking memes about his tryst with his former aide.
The ex-health secretary's post looking for a communications officer was ridiculed on social media in wake of his affair with Gina Coladangelo.
Many made reference to the couple while some asked if they needed to be experienced in CCTV - in reference to him being caught out by his own office security camera in June.
Mr Hancock called for applicants to help run his social media accounts and do public relations for the embattled MP.
The ad said the successful candidate will be 'highly organised' and have 'sound judgement'.
But social media users mercilessly mocked the disgraced minister by clogging up his tweet with references to his affair with Ms Coladangelo.
He lost his job when it emerged they were seeing each other despite her being his £15,000-a-year aide and them breaking social distancing rules at the time.
His Twitter post had read: 'I'm hiring in my brilliant Parliamentary team. Take a look here.'
The job ad said: 'Matt Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, is looking to recruit a Communications Officer who will be primarily focused on communications activity.
'The successful applicant will need to be able to undertake media and press activities, design and create content for social media, as well as assist with wider communications activities and assist the wider parliamentary and constituency team.
'The role will be based in the Westminster office.' It said the salary was in line with IPSA pay scales.
But the advert trigger a torrent of mockery, with most pointing towards his affair with his aide.
One posted the CCTV picture of him kissing Ms Coladangelo with the caption: 'Only former female university friends need apply.'
Another put: 'Do I need a working knowledge of CCTV?' One person wrote online: 'Well, not much public service, based on Matty-boy's previous history. But plenty of grift, for sure.'
Another man wrote: 'Will there be any specific training on how to conduct an extramarital affair?'
And one more added: 'Missing a spine is requested or will [you] develop that during my probation? Not very good at lying though sure you can offer training on that too.'
The bombshell expose of Mr Hancock's affair with his aide, who was married to Oliver Bonas founder Oliver Tress, forced him to resign as health secretary.
Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo are reportedly still seeing each other but are rarely spotted together.
Earlier this year the former minister's crowdfunder page for his London marathon run was also inundated with mocking comments.",-2
1731," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci said it could be the end of 2021 before life gets back to how it was before Covid-19.""If you're talking about getting back to a degree of normality which resembles where we were prior to Covid, it's going to be well into 2021, maybe even towards the end of 2021,"" Fauci said Friday.A vaccine will help, but there are caveats, Fauci said in a series of interviews Friday.   Fauci has said repeatedly that it's possible at least one of the vaccines being tested could get emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year or early next year. But it won't be available to everyone immediately.""By the time you mobilize the distribution of the vaccinations, and you get the majority, or more, of the population vaccinated and protected, that's likely not going to happen to the mid or end of 2021,"" he  told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell. One stumbling block -- keeping the vaccines cold. Most of the experimental coronavirus vaccines must be kept frozen. Speaking during a Friends of the Global Fight webinar earlier on Friday, Fauci said, ""One of the things that's always an issue is the cold storage issue, and the 'cold chain' that is so often required."" Debunking nonsensePlus, people are not always doing what they should do to control the spread of the virus, even now, Fauci said.""When you're dealing with a situation that requires behavioral change, we in the United States have a significant issue that I'm very disappointed in,"" Fauci said during the webinar.""It was stunning to me ... that in some states and cities and counties, you would see television clips of people crowded indoors at bars, which is a superspreading event if you ever saw it.""Young people may think they are not going to get dangerously ill, and get careless, Fauci said.""But what they forget is their societal responsibility to not propagate the outbreak because if they get infected, they're likely going to infect someone else who then might infect someone who really is vulnerable and will have a serious severe consequence."" And people are spreading misinformation, making the virus even harder to fight.""The one thing that bothers me is the amount of things that aren't evidence-based, and we've seen examples of that in the United States like claims that certain drugs have a great positive effect when there's no scientific evidence whatsoever that they have a positive effect,"" Fauci said.""And yet it gets ingrained and I and my colleagues have to spend a lot of time trying to debunk that. And you're in the middle of a pandemic and you're trying hard to address all the appropriate issues, it is truly a waste of time to have to debunk nonsense.""Fauci also cautioned that just because coronaviruses are in the spotlight, people should not forget  the flu.""The one thing I've learned throughout the years is don't put anything past the flu -- don't take anything for granted,"" he said during the MSNBC interview. There ""a hint of potential good news"" when it comes to flu season. In Australia, where the flu season just ended, ""They have had the lightest flu season in memory -- which most people think is because they're doing things to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection with masks, distancing, avoiding crowds, outdoor more than indoor. That what they've done as a secondary offshoot of that is they brought down the level of influenza cases, very, very low,"" he said. He added that if  Americans can do this, he's optimistic the country will have a light flu season too. ",0
1732,"ISTANBUL, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan dismissed three central bank policymakers on Thursday, two of whom were seen to oppose the last interest rate cut, clearing the way for more policy easing and sending the lira to a new all-time low.
Analysts viewed the move - announced at midnight in the Official Gazette - as fresh evidence of political interference by Erdogan, a self-described enemy of interest rates who frequently calls for monetary stimulus.
With no explanation for the decision, Erdogan fired deputy governors Semih Tumen and Ugur Namik Kucuk, along with the longest-serving monetary policy committee (MPC) member, Abdullah Yavas, the gazette said.
He appointed two new members - Taha Cakmak as a deputy and also Yusuf Tuna - who are little known at the central bank or among economists, leaving the MPC with little monetary policy experience after a years-long overhaul by the president.
Two sources familiar with internal deliberations said Kucuk and Yavas were ousted after disagreeing with last month's 100 basis-point rate cut, which at the time surprised investors and sent the currency tumbling.
Soon after the announcement the lira  weakened to a record low against the dollar, before paring its losses during the day. However it hit a fresh all-time low of 9.1950 at 1444 GMT.
The currency has shed some 19% this year, primarily due to the central bank's bruised credibility and worries among investors and savers over premature rate cuts in the face of inflation that has risen to nearly 20%.
""The lira has lost its institutional support in recent years ... and last night's changes strongly indicate that the central bank is no longer capable of managing Turkey's monetary policy,"" said Arda Tunca, economist at Eko Faktoring.
The combination of monetary policy and financial regulations have left the ""Turkish economy extremely fragile,"" he added.
Last month the central bank cut its policy rate (TRINT=ECI) to 18% as Erdogan - sliding in opinion polls and keen to boost credit and exports - had publicly sought. Most analysts called the easing a mistake at a time of accelerating global inflation.  read more 
TURNAROUND
The MPC overhaul came after the presidency said on Wednesday evening that Erdogan had met Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu and it published a photo of the two men together.
That marked a turnaround from last week when Reuters reported, citing three sources, that Erdogan was losing confidence in Kavcioglu and that the two had communicated little in recent weeks.  read more 
Though the MPC has seen a rapid turnover this year, Kavcioglu pushed for changes in recent days, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the matter.
""Kavcioglu sort of cleared the path to be able to cut rates more quickly with the new members,"" the person said. Now, those who were distant towards rate cuts have been removed.""
Erdogan named Kavcioglu governor in March.  read more 
In just over two years, Erdogan has abruptly fired three bank governors over policy differences, a dizzying display of political interference that badly hit the bank's credibility and predictability.  read more 
""Firing central bank officials in the middle of the night without a very good explanation is not how you build central bank credibility or bolster market confidence,"" one foreign investor said on Thursday.
Turkey's headline inflation hit a 2-1/2 year high of 19.58% in September, while a core measure - which Kavcioglu has been stressing over the last month - was 16.98%.
INTERNAL OPPOSITION
Addressing a parliamentary committee this week, Kavcioglu said September's rate cut was not a surprise and had little to do with the subsequent lira sell-off.  read more 
The bank's next policy-setting meeting is on Oct. 21, when another rate cut is seen as likely.
Market reaction to Thursday's changes included a jump in the premium demanded by investors to hold Turkish debt over safe haven U.S. Treasuries, based on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified index. It hit 521 basis points, the highest since April, leaving spreads above those of Ukraine and Kenya.
The second source who spoke to Reuters said both Kucuk and Yavas - who missed September's policy meeting - had opposed some recent bank decisions.
Kucuk also opposed an unorthodox policy in 2019-2020 of using the bank's forex reserves to support the lira via state bank sales, the person said, adding that Kucuk had warned the MPC that failing to keep rates high enough now only leads to even higher rates in the future.
Cakmak, the new deputy governor, was a deputy chairman at Turkey's BDDK banking watchdog from 2019. Previously he held posts at state lender Ziraat Bank, including head of human resources.
Tuna, the other MPC hire, was a professor and also served as management board member at the BDDK from 2003-2009.
""It can be assumed that the newly appointed members of the central bank committee will support Kavcioglu's and Erdogan's monetary policy,"" said Antje Praefcke, analyst at Commerzbank. ""That is not a good omen for the Turkish lira.""",3
1733,"ALL PANDEMICS end eventually. Covid-19 has started down that path, but it will not be eradicated. Instead, it will gradually become endemic. In that state, circulating and mutating from year to year, the coronavirus will remain a threat to the elderly and infirm. But having settled down, it is highly unlikely to kill on the monstrous scale of the past 20 months. Covid will then be a familiar, manageable enemy, like the flu.
Although the destination is fixed, the route to endemicity is not. The difference between a well-planned journey and a chaotic one could be measured in millions of lives. The end of the pandemic is therefore a last chance for governments to show they have learned from the mistakes they made at its start.

As the pandemic fades, weekly recorded cases and deaths have been falling globally, including in America, since the end of August. Britain is one country where cases are high and rising, but it has had a lot of disease and has run a successful vaccination campaign. Because 93% of Britons have antibodies, roughly 250,000 cases a week are leading to hundreds of deaths instead of thousands. That is the path to endemicity.

Nobody knows how many people around the world enjoy such protection, but you can hazard a very rough guess. About 3.8bn people have had at least one dose of the vaccine. The Economist estimates that during the pandemic excess deaths lie between 10m and 19m, with a central estimate of 16.2m. Working backwards, using assumptions about the share of fatal infections, this suggests that 1.4bn-3.6bn people have had the disease, amounting to 6-15 times the official count. There is an overlap, as many have been both vaccinated and infected.
The reservoir of people with immunity makes covid less dangerous. However, in bringing the pandemic to an end, the world is likely to face several tests.
One is the wave of winter infections in the northern hemisphere. Covid thrives when people spend their time indoors. If cases start to overwhelm hospitals, governments will need to intervene. One line of defence is treatments, including promising new antiviral drugs such as molnupiravir, which cuts rates of serious illness by half if administered early, but is still awaiting approval. Another is measures such as mask-wearing, shielding care homes and closing hotspots, including clubs and bars. The question is whether governments have learned to act promptly, but proportionately.
A second test is mutation. The genetic sampling of infections serves as an early warning if the Delta variant is displaced, yet poorer, unvaccinated parts of the world still go unmonitored. A new variant may require vaccines to be redesigned. That is far easier than starting from scratch, but it would require the production and approval of new jabs and perhaps jettisoning the stocks of old ones. It could trigger a replay of the fights over supply that marred the start of 2021.
The greatest test is how to protect the billion or more people without immunity. China’s answer is to try to shut the virus out with harsh and costly quarantines and lockdowns. This allows time for vaccination and stockpiling medicines. The Communist Party has used the country’s tiny number of cases as proof its system is better than democracy, so abandoning its zero-covid strategy is politically awkward. However, as places including New Zealand have accepted, the coronavirus is not going away. One day China will have to relent.
Ultimately, people will gain immunity either through infection or vaccination. Because vaccination is so much safer, governments must get as many needles into arms as possible. According to Airfinity, a data firm, 11.3bn doses should have been produced before the end of the year and 25bn by June 2022. If so, global supply will soon no longer be a constraint—how soon, depends on the demand for boosters. Not all vaccines are equally effective, but all of them are far better than being infected.
This approaching vaccine glut means that exporters should already be shipping doses wholesale. Instead many are holding back supplies for boosters and to vaccinate children, who very rarely die from covid. Doses are promised for next year, but they are needed now.
The last barriers to vaccination will be hesitancy and the capacity of local health care. The World Health Organisation has set a target of 40% of every country to be jabbed by the end of the year. A global vaccine summit set a target of 70% by September 2022. But different countries have different needs for vaccines depending on their demography, their ability to administer jabs, and the threat of covid compared with other diseases like malaria and measles. Blanket targets risk turning sensible priorities into failures.
It is a daunting to-do list. Will governments rise to the challenge? Therein lies the last test. As covid fades into the background, rich countries may start to lose interest in the coronavirus. The disease it causes risks becoming a poor-country killer, like so many of the rest. ■

1734,"ON THE OUTSKIRTS of Vientiane, the capital of Laos, workers for China Railway No. 2 Engineering Group recently welded the last two 500m lengths of “seamless rail” for the China-Laos Railway, a flagship project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Chinese state media celebrate the railroad, set to open in December, as a feat of modern engineering. It is also a marvel of modern book-keeping, amassing $3.6bn in debt off the government’s balance-sheet but for which the Laotian state may still end up on the hook. That financing and other “hidden debt” to China amounts to a third of the country’s GDP, which could become a problem: Laos already has sovereign debts equivalent to about 60% of GDP on its books, half of it owed to China.
Hidden debts bedevil many of China’s development projects abroad, including lots in Asia, which are financed in such complex ways, and arranged among so many different entities, that even Chinese financial authorities have had trouble keeping track. On September 29th AidData, a research unit at William  Mary, a university in America, released a data set that attempted to put a dollar figure on China’s lending to projects overseas, including off-the-books debt that is not reported to the World Bank. AidData tallied 13,427 projects for which China had provided about $800bn in lending over an 18-year period starting in 2000. That includes $385bn in what AidData calls “hidden” debt. It counted 44 countries that owe the equivalent of at least 10% of their GDP to China.

Getting a grip on how much countries owe to China matters because many of these developing countries, struggling in the pandemic, are trying to renegotiate the terms of their sovereign debts not only with China but also with multilateral lenders and other countries. In 2020 the G20, which includes China, agreed to suspend debt-service payments temporarily for as many as 73 countries to give them a chance to restructure their debts. But many of China’s loans are arranged in ways that might not be covered by the agreement. As in the case of the China-Laos Railway, loans can be agreed between state-owned enterprises and joint-venture companies without being formally guaranteed by the government (Laos separately has a sovereign obligation of about $480m connected to the rail project). In some cases, governments may not even know the full extent of loans for which they may one day find themselves responsible.
The pace of China’s BRI lending has slowed considerably in recent years (the AidData research covers loans through to 2017). But there is little indication that China plans to change the way it works with debtor countries. Many of China’s BRI loans are agreed with poor countries at commercial interest rates and often include collateral obligations (such as proceeds from the sale of natural resources), neither of which is true of conventional development financing. China typically deals with unpaid debts by extending the terms of a loan rather than taking a haircut on the principal—“kicking the can down the road”, as Scott Morris of the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington, puts it. Sometimes the Chinese side takes a big equity stake in projects where debtors have fallen behind on payments. A decision in 2017 to assume control of a port in Sri Lanka led to charges of “debt-trap diplomacy”.
In debt-ridden Laos, a Chinese state-owned company has already assumed control of another piece of infrastructure, part of the electric grid. But Matt Mingey of Rhodium Group, a research firm, says the railway is an example of how a Chinese infrastructure loan can be not so much a “hidden” liability as a complicated one. The joint venture that owes China $3.6bn is already majority-owned by three Chinese state-owned firms, making the project akin to a Chinese one that happens to be in a foreign country. If the railway proves to be a financial flop, it may be China on the hook, not Laos. The “hidden debt”, then, would be one that China owes to itself. That should be simple enough to resolve.■

1735,"PANIC HAS set in at the Konrad Adenauer House, the Berlin HQ of Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats (CDU). The long-ailing Social Democrats (SPD), under the steady hand of Olaf Scholz, their candidate for the chancellorship, have opened a clear polling lead, and Armin Laschet, the candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian CSU ally, is plumbing new depths of unpopularity. What to do? Mr Laschet’s answer was to unveil, on September 3rd, a group of obscure advisory “experts” to lend his floundering campaign intellectual heft. They spanned the CDU’s “Christian-social, liberal wings”, beamed Mr Laschet, meaning that they could not agree on a single thing. Observers detected desperation.
A second tactic has been to raise a red scare. Mr Scholz has not ruled out forming a coalition with the Greens and Die Linke, a small hard-left outfit partly derived from East Germany’s Communists. (Nor will he; to do so would reduce his leverage in post-election coalition talks.) The liveliest moment in an otherwise dull televised debate between the chancellor-candidates on August 29th came when Mr Laschet launched a broadside against Mr Scholz for holding the door open to Die Linke. Two days later even Angela Merkel, who has sought desperately to stay out of the campaign, repeated the charge. Mr Scholz, an ultra-moderate who is as likely to invite the Russophiles of Die Linke into government as he is to don a Karneval outfit and down a litre of Kölsch on the streets of Cologne, can probably take the blows. A poll on September 2nd, the first since the debate, gave the SPD a five-point lead over the CDU/CSU—the biggest yet.

To a Hoffest (roughly, a party in a courtyard) in Charlottenburg, a posh neighbourhood in west Berlin, where Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), is geeing up the party faithful at a campaign event. Mr Lindner takes potshots at Robert Habeck, the Greens’ co-leader and a possible rival of Mr Lindner’s for the finance minister’s job in the next coalition. Mr Habeck’s plans for debt-fuelled investment, declares Mr Lindner, run up against a linguistic problem: “debts” (Schulden) sound a lot like “guilt” (Schuld). So instead, howls Mr Lindner, Mr Habeck decides to rebrand it as “credit”! Cue much guffawing. Some years ago Mario Monti, a former Italian prime minister, said that Germans treated economics as a branch of moral philosophy. Perhaps he was right.

Almost 60 years ago Germany signed its first “guest-worker” agreement with Turkey, which kickstarted several waves of migration between the countries. This week Mrs Merkel held a ceremony at the chancellery to pay tribute to Germany’s guest workers and their descendants. “Integration cannot remain a seven-generation task that is never completed because your name is not Klaus or Erika,” she said. It was a laudable sentiment from a chancellor who, in her quiet way, helped usher in Germany's slow acknowledgment of its own diversity (more than one-quarter of the population have what Germans call a “migration background”). The sceptical outsider might wonder why, 60 years on, such a statement remains necessary.

The federal election is not Germany’s only vote on September 26th. Two of the 16 states will also be choosing their assemblies. And if the election in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, a sparsely populated north-eastern state, might struggle to set pulses racing, the Abgeordnetenhauswahl in Berlin, one of the three city-states, should be a livelier affair. A few months ago the Greens thought they were cruising to a victory that would double the tally of states they run. But as nationwide polls go, so, it seems, do metropolitan ones: the SPD has lately opened up a clear lead in the capital. In May Franziska Giffey, the SPD’s charismatic candidate for mayor, had to quit her job as federal families minister amid—what else?—a plagiarism scandal which saw Berlin’s Free University strip her of her doctorate. But Ms Giffey’s campaign is going from strength to strength—even if wags have taken to defacing election posters bearing her name with an artfully placed “Dr”.

In engineering-mad Germany there is a tool for everything—even voting. Thursday saw the launch of the “Wahl-o-Mat”, an online election guide which asks voters three dozen questions on matters like wind-energy subsidies and asylum policy, before telling them which of 40 parties have views that best match their own. Before the 2017 election a staggering 15.7m voters cranked up the Wahl-o-Mat. The number that based their votes on the result is perhaps a little smaller, but either way there is great sport in starting a questionnaire believing yourself to be a Green, social democrat or conservative—only to find that your views align perfectly with Die Urbane, the “hip-hop party”, or V-Party, which aims to advance the interests of vegetarians and vegans.

1736,"THE BIDEN administration was supposed to just “follow the science”, a welcome contrast to the previous regime. But one month after it announced covid-19 boosters would be available for everyone, Americans are still left wondering who will get boosters and when.
On August 12th, amid the Delta surge, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved boosters for some immunocompromised people who had received the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. One week later, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that every American could receive a shot eight months after their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, starting on September 20th. Many vaccinated Americans were eager for the extra protection.

Since then, two leading FDA scientists have announced their intention to leave or retire. Many have speculated on the reason. But shortly after announcing their intentions, they released a paper in The Lancet, a medical journal, written with several other researchers, concluding that booster doses are not needed for the general public. A few days later, on September 17th, an advisory panel to the FDA, consisting of independent experts, recommended boosters only for high-risk individuals, people over 65 and health-care workers who had received the Pfizer vaccine at least six months previously. Although the FDA does not always follow the recommendations of their advisory panels, it usually does.
The recommendation still needs FDA approval and CDC support before this group of people can get their jabs. And depending on how both organisations interpret “high-risk,” as many as 129m non-elderly Americans with pre-existing conditions could qualify, explains Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health in the Obama administration. But the statement by the advisory panel contradicts President Joe Biden’s wider-reaching booster plan.
This back-and-forth between the administration and scientists has consequences. By announcing the need for booster shots before the FDA approved them, the administration signalled, probably unintentionally, that the current regimen is no longer effective for everyone. Boosters are common for vaccines to ensure protection from disease. Sometimes multiple doses are needed to achieve lifetime immunity. Some vaccines require an extra dose after a period of time to keep being effective. Others require additional doses to counter different strains.

Since the covid-19 virus is new, further analysis is needed to determine if additional doses are necessary. A needless booster could be harmful, as well as being a waste given that worldwide only 32% of adults are fully vaccinated. The administration’s original statement said that boosters were contingent on recommendations by the FDA and CDC, but that nuance was lost on many.
Partly as a result of the confusion, many immunised Americans are now questioning their current defence against the Delta variant, despite the HHS announcement stating that, “vaccines...continue to be remarkably effective”. Some patients are getting additional doses without approval. By mid-August, before the announcements, about 1m Americans had helped themselves to a third dose, according to the CDC. That number will probably grow. (2.2m people have received an additional dose since the CDC recommended boosters for the immuno-compromised, but it is unclear how many qualified.)
Some state governors are adding to the confusion. Several are encouraging their residents, particularly the elderly, to get boosters despite the lack of FDA approval. Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, signed an executive order on September 8th authorising boosters for pensioners living in communal settings, like retirement homes. Mr Hogan has repeatedly criticised the administration for its inconsistent messages.
Several other governments have done a better job of keeping their recommendations in line with the research. Britain’s and Italy’s are recommending boosters for older people, front-line health-care workers and the vulnerable.

1737,"WORTH NEARLY $1TRN, Facebook is the world’s sixth-most-valuable company. Its revenues have grown by 56% in the past year, and its share price by more than a quarter. Nearly 3bn people use its products every month. Why would such a glittering success change its name, as the Verge, a news site, reports it plans to within days?
The likely official reason for the rebranding, which Facebook has not confirmed, is that the firm has outgrown the social network that Mark Zuckerberg started 17 years ago in a Harvard dorm. Today it encompasses other social apps (Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger) and video hardware (Oculus, Portal). It has launched a digital wallet (Novi) and may yet offer a currency (Diem). Mr Zuckerberg expects people eventually to associate his firm more with the “metaverse”, a virtual space for work, play and more, than with social media. This week Facebook said it would hire 10,000 people to work on the metaverse.

If the Facebook network is to take a back seat, there may be a case for regrouping under a new name. Facebook wouldn’t be the first tech titan to do so. In 2015 Google set up Alphabet, a holding company for the search engine and its many side projects. Under this model, Facebook would become just another app within a wider family, albeit by far its biggest earner.
There is another, less flattering possible motive for a makeover. For all its pecuniary success, the Facebook brand has become tarnished. The social network is blamed for stoking everything from teenage anorexia to insurrection at the US Capitol. This month Frances Haugen, a former employee, told Congress that Facebook was failing to moderate content on its platform and covering up a drop in young American users (it denies this). Public trust in it is lower than in most tech giants, and falling. Although two years ago the firm started branding its apps as being “from Facebook”, its new “smart glasses”, which can record video and take phone calls, feature only the logo of its partner, Ray-Ban.
Facebook investors seem untroubled. But its social apps’ growing toxicity threaten to poison its other projects. On October 19th Democratic senators signed a letter arguing that Novi and Diem should be scrapped, since “Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient.”
Mr Zuckerberg himself has been a lightning rod for much of the criticism of Facebook, and of bossy tech firms more generally. As the all-powerful founder, he has a higher profile than his opposite numbers at TikTok, YouTube and other social networks. Normally, a brand facing a reputational crisis might dump its unpopular CEO. But Mr Zuckerberg’s position is unassailable, which may explain why he would want to dump the brand instead. ■

1738,"ON APRIL 9TH the Soufrière volcano on St Vincent spewed a cloud of ash 10km (six miles) high. Over the following days there were further explosions. Some 16,000 people have been evacuated from the island’s northern region. No deaths have been reported. But even in the southern safe zone, life is tough. Volcanic dust is everywhere. “My chickens are totally confused, they don’t know if it’s night or day,” says one islander.■",2
1739,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3
1740,"XI JINPING IS waging a campaign to purge China of capitalist excesses. China’s president sees surging debt as the poisonous fruit of financial speculation and billionaires as a mockery of Marxism. Businesses must heed state guidance. The party must permeate every area of national life. Whether Mr Xi can impose his new reality will shape China’s future, as well as the ideological battle between democracy and dictatorship.
His campaign is remarkable for its scope and ambition. It started to rumble in 2020, when officials blocked the initial public offering of Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, a tech giant. It is thundering onward, having so far destroyed perhaps $2trn of wealth. Didi, a ride-hailing outfit, has been punished for listing its shares in America. Evergrande, an indebted property developer, is being driven towards default. Trading on cryptocurrency exchanges has been banned as, more or less, has for-profit tutoring. Gaming is bad for children, so it must be strictly rationed. China needs larger families, so abortion must become rarer. Male role models should be manly and celebrities patriotic. Underpinning it all is Xi Jinping Thought, which is being drummed into the craniums of six-year-olds.

This comes on top of an already brutal authoritarianism. As president, Mr Xi has purged his rivals and locked up over 1m Uyghurs. He polices debate and will not tolerate dissent. The latest campaign will show whether he is an ideologue bent on grabbing power for himself, even if growth slows and people suffer, or whether he is a strongman willing to temper dogma with pragmatism. His vision, in which party control ensures that business is aligned to the state and citizens dutifully serve the nation, will determine the fate of 1.4bn people.
Mr Xi is tackling real problems—indeed, many of them have parallels in the West. One is inequality. The slogan of the moment is “common prosperity”, reflecting how Communist China remains as unequal as some capitalist countries. The top 20% of China’s households take home over 45% of the country’s disposable income; the top 1% own over 30% of household wealth (see Free exchange). Another concern is the clout of tech giants accused of unfair competition, corrupting society and having unfettered access to personal data (only the state has that privilege). A third is strategic vulnerability, particularly the threat that adversaries will obstruct access to commodities and vital technologies.
Yet Mr Xi’s campaign poses a threat to China’s economy. Pain from unravelling the debt of firms like Evergrande could spread unpredictably. Property developers are sitting on $2.8trn of borrowing. Property development and the industries that cater to it underpin about 30% of China’s GDP. Households have parked their savings in real estate partly because other assets offer a poor return. Households’ spending on unfinished property accounts for half of developers’ funding. Local governments, especially outside the big cities, depend on land sales and property development to generate revenue.
The crackdowns are also making business harder and less rewarding. The party had been creating a regulatory and legal framework, but Mr Xi is imposing big top-down changes so fast that regulation has started to seem arbitrary. Consider, for example, “tertiary redistribution”, in which shamed tech companies hand over cash to the state in an attempt to redeem themselves.
Because conspicuous success is dangerous, private companies will be more cautious. State-owned firms and strategic industries—including “hard-tech” such as semiconductors—may benefit, but not the entrepreneurs who have been the true source of China’s dynamism. One measure of anxiety is that foreigners, who are not bottled in by capital controls, pay 31% less than mainland investors for identical Chinese stocks. The gap has grown sharply since early 2020.
All this threatens to puncture China’s economy. It was already facing a squeeze from declining returns to infrastructure investment and the effects of a shrinking workforce and growing numbers of aged dependents. After 40 years of breakneck expansion, most Chinese are completely unfamiliar with the hard choices that a sharp, sustained slowdown will impose.
In politics the danger is that Mr Xi’s campaign degenerates into a cult of personality. To bring about change, he has grabbed more power than any leader since Mao Zedong. As he prepares to break with protocol at the Communist Party’s 20th congress next year by claiming a third five-year presidential term, he is using the campaign to organise a huge turnover in personnel, as the basis for an ideological crackdown and as the reason why he should remain at the helm. Each of these contains dangers.
One is that the bureaucracy fails him. Mr Xi wants it to be responsive to market signals, but with promotions and purges in the air, China’s officials are jumpy. One cause of the power cuts in 20 or so provinces in recent weeks was the panic of bureaucrats who suddenly realised that they were likely to miss their carbon-reduction targets. Equally, however, officials fearful of being accused of corruption or ideological deviance by their rivals tend to sit on their hands. Failure is dangerous for a bureaucrat who takes the initiative; so is success.
Another danger stems from the ideological crackdown. “Moral review councils” and “moral clinics” are enforcing orthodox behaviour using public shaming. Although there is as yet no prospect of anything as awful as the Cultural Revolution, Chinese people are becoming less free to think and talk. As well as promoting his own doctrines, Mr Xi has played up Red nostalgia and cast Maoism as a vital stage in building a New China, broadening his support before the party congress.
Last come the politics of Mr Xi himself. In the long run, if he clings to power the succession could prove highly unstable. In the short run, if his attempt to impose a new reality does not go to plan, he will face a fateful choice to double down or step back. Up to this point, repression looks more likely than compromise.
Western governments are also struggling with tech firms, inequality and national security. In America Congress has risen to the occasion by contemplating a default on the national debt. Some may envy Mr Xi’s scope to get things done fast. But to imagine he has the right answers would be a big mistake. ■",2
1741,"WORRIES ABOUT the use of puberty blockers, which are prescribed to some children to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics (like breasts and facial hair) have been mounting in much of the rich world. Some countries have scaled back their use. Not America. Doctors who work in transgender clinics routinely claim that prescribing such drugs is conservative, because their effects are largely reversible, and compassionate, because they save children with gender dysphoria (the feeling of being in the wrong body) from enormous distress.
That may be beginning to change. Last week Abigail Shrier, a writer, published interviews in “Common Sense With Bari Weiss”, a newsletter, with two transgender health-care professionals who suggested that some doctors were irresponsible in the way they treated children. The women, both trans, are on the board of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which endorses the use of blockers early in puberty in some cases. Though blockers are often described as operating like a pause button, most children prescribed them go on to cross-sex hormones. This combination can have irreversible consequences, including sterility and the inability to orgasm.

This was the chief concern expressed by Marci Bowers, a vaginoplasty surgeon who is due to become the president of WPATH in 2022. Dr Bowers built her career operating on adults, but she has also operated on teens: in 2018 she performed a “penile inversion” on Jazz Jennings, a 17-year-old who had been put on blockers aged 11. But Dr Bowers told Ms Shrier she was “not a fan” of putting children on blockers early in puberty. She worried, she said, “about their reproductive rights later. I worry about their sexual health later and ability to find intimacy.”
In 2018 Lisa Littman, a researcher, was hounded and lost her job as a consultant after coining the term “rapid onset gender dysphoria” (ROGD) to describe the social contagion of trans-identification among teens, mostly girls. Dr Bowers appeared to acknowledge the existence of “this ROGD thing” as she called it. “I think there probably are people who are influenced. There is a little bit of ‘Yeah, that’s so cool. Yeah, I kind of want to do that too.’” In some cases, she said, girls with eating disorders were being diagnosed with gender dysphoria, “then they see you for one visit, and then they recommend testosterone.”
Erica Anderson, a clinical psychologist at the University of California San Francisco’s Child and Adolescent Gender Centre told Ms Shrier that because of “sloppy health-care work”—“rushing people through the medicalisation” and an “abject failure” to properly evaluate patients’ mental health—she expected more young people to regret transitioning. Her clinic had seen twice as many females as males for two years running, she said.
It is exceedingly rare for health-care professionals in America to criticise—or even question—the practices that have become prevalent in the medical treatment of gender-dysphoric youth. Professional bodies, including the American Association of Paediatrics, have endorsed “gender-affirmative” care, a model that accepts patients’ self-diagnosis that they are trans, and the use of blockers. Anyone who publicly dissents tends to be castigated.
Will the airing of these views change the way trans-identifying children are treated? Laura Edwards-Leeper, a psychologist who helped found America’s first transgender clinic for children in Boston in 2007, has claimed (including to this newspaper) that too few teens undergo crucial mental-health assessments before starting treatment. She says Dr Bowers’s comments, especially about the effects of blockers on sexual function, have “shaken up” many in the field. Yet she notes some doctors are responding by talking about how they might control or slow treatment, without mentioning the role mental-health professionals should play in all this. That they are discussing the risks at all nonetheless constitutes progress.■",2
1742,"TITO GBANDEWA sweeps a hand across a beach in Sierra Leone that many call one of the most beautiful in west Africa. The bark of nearby trees can cure a child’s cough, locals say. The nectar of its palms comes “from God to man”. In the distance, a boy fishes for grouper; children play in the surf. If the government has its way, all this will be gone, says Mr Gbandewa, who runs a small resort on the beach. In its place will be a Chinese-funded fishing harbour covering 100 hectares.
The project at Black Johnson beach (pictured) is officially described as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure scheme. Sierra Leone is one of the world’s poorest countries and has long needed a harbour for deep-sea fishing boats. China has agreed to give it $55m to help build the port. But when details leaked out in May they were not well received. Many Sierra Leoneans fret that the project may threaten the surrounding rainforest and the country’s fledgling tourism industry. Some fear the development will include a fishmeal plant, which could make the environmental impact all the worse. The government says this is untrue.

Even some fisherfolk were alarmed. Around the world, including along the west African coast, China is buying fleets and building ports to help satisfy its own demand for fish. “They are creating a closed loop for their own supply chains,” says Whitley Saumweber of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, an American think-tank. The impact is evident in west African waters, which are among the most overfished in the world. Chinese boats account for three-quarters of Sierra Leone’s modern fishing fleet. Reports abound that they catch more fish than they are legally allowed to. Locals who depend on fish for protein cannot compete. A single high-tech trawler can catch five times as much in a day as a small village fleet can in a year. Controlling ports, or having preferential access to them, makes it easier to bypass international restrictions on overfishing.
Belt and Road projects are often murky. For the one in Black Johnson, no environmental assessment has been carried out. Landowners have not been consulted. Tourism is crucial to Sierra Leone’s long-term plan for achieving middle-income status, known as “the Agenda for Prosperity”. But a tourism official says her ministry was not informed of the plan either. The fisheries ministry says bidding for the construction contract will be open and transparent. Chinese media suggest that two Chinese firms have already secured the deal.
It may smell fishy, but “there is no Chinese conspiracy,” says Jinghan Zeng, who follows China-Africa relations at Lancaster University in Britain. Chinese investors are still relatively new to Africa, so they make mistakes, he suggests. China’s state-owned firms often act like Western companies: pursuing profit without much regard for their home country’s diplomatic interests. In asking China for the grant to build the port, Sierra Leone was not necessarily making itself subservient: the country had previously axed plans to build an airport with $318m of Chinese loans.
Many Sierra Leoneans would disagree. They believe that China is hoovering up their country’s rich natural resources (timber, minerals and fish) with no regard for locals—and with the complicity of corrupt officials. In a survey last year, only 41% of respondents said China’s influence on their country was positive. That was down from 55% in 2015, and was a lower share than in all but one of the 18 African countries covered by the study. The mood in Sierra Leone has also soured since June, when a video published on social media showed a Chinese worker attacking a Sierra Leonean miner.
China is also trying other ways of winning public support. Since the pandemic hit, it has doled out 240,000 vaccines to Sierra Leone—more than the 192,000 provided by COVAX, a global vaccine-sharing scheme. In July the two countries celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations; ahead of the anniversary, China’s ambassador said his country was keen to help boost tourism. If that involves attracting big-spending Chinese visitors, Black Johnson’s stunning sands may not be on offer. ■",2
1743,"ON JUNE 2ND Cristiana Chamorro, an opposition hopeful in Nicaragua’s forthcoming presidential election, was placed under house arrest. It came a day after she announced that she would run as a contender for a relatively new party, Citizens for Liberty (CxL), to unite a fractured opposition. On June 5th another opposition politician, Arturo Cruz, was detained for “conspiring against Nicaraguan society”. Three days later two more presidential hopefuls, Félix Maradiaga and Juan Sebastián Chamorro (a cousin of Cristiana), were detained, too.
Nicaragua is heading for the “worst possible elections” on November 7th, says Luis Almagro, secretary-general of the Organisation of American States in Washington. Voters will elect a president and members of the National Assembly. Daniel Ortega, the strongman president who governs with his wife as vice-president, plans to run for a fifth term.

Mr Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla, first came to power in 1979 by force of arms. He stepped down after losing an election in 1990 but was elected president again in 2007. Now he appears determined not to let power slip once more. In 2018 he ordered a crackdown on anti-regime demonstrators that left perhaps 450 people dead and sent over 100,000 into exile. To ease international sanctions, he released some political prisoners in 2019. But more recently he has reverted to his old tricks.
Since late last year a flurry of new laws has tried to smother the opposition. One targets NGOs that receive foreign funding. Another bars “traitors” from running for office and redefines treason along absurdly broad lines (Messrs Cruz, Maradiaga and Chamorro are the first people to be ensnared by this law). A third doles out lengthy prison sentences to anyone found guilty of spreading fake news. But now the regime seems increasingly brazen. On May 4th the National Assembly, controlled by Mr Ortega’s Sandinista National Liberation Front, appointed five Ortega loyalists to the electoral council, banned independent election monitors and gave the police powers to shut down party meetings and campaign events. One of the two main opposition parties has been banned.
Mr Ortega is right to fear Ms Chamorro. She is the daughter of Violeta Chamorro, a former president who unseated Mr Ortega in 1990, and thus a scion of Nicaragua’s most famous political family. A poll released on May 28th ranked her as the most popular politician in the country.
The detention of these candidates “sends a direct message to the United States”, said Mr Chamorro, in a defiant interview with The Economist before his arrest. Ms Chamorro was detained while Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, was visiting Costa Rica to discuss the erosion of democracy with Central American officials. The other candidates were arrested while Kamala Harris, the American vice-president, was in Guatemala and Mexico.
Such autocratic behaviour could backfire. The United States has already announced new sanctions, and is considering more. Members of the European Parliament are calling for the suspension of an agreement governing around $380m in exports each year. And by banning one of the two main parties, Mr Ortega has forced rival politicians to overcome differences and band together in CxL. ■",2
1744,"PAMELA ROCCHI was born a boy, but felt from an early age she was a girl. At 16 she was kicked out of school for responding angrily when a teacher called her by her birth name. She moved to a city far from her home town of Alcorta in central Argentina and worked for two years as a prostitute. Now, aged 35, she is back in Alcorta, where she works in local government and is running to be the town’s president.
Although trans people are often poor and occasionally the victims of hate crimes, life has lately become much easier for them. In 2012 Argentina became the first country in the world to allow individuals to change their gender on legal documents without permission from a doctor or judge—a process known as gender self-identification. Argentina’s law is “still considered the gold standard among activists around the world”, says Maria Sjödin of OutRight Action International, an advocacy group. Gender-reassignment surgery and hormone therapy are paid for by medical insurance.

Now Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, is going further. On June 25th Congress approved an earlier decree that established a quota for trans people in the public sector. One per cent of newly hired bureaucrats must be transgender. They need not have changed their appearance or their names in official documents. The same measure provides tax incentives for private firms that hire trans people and gives them preference in public procurement. On July 21st Mr Fernández announced the issuing of the first ID cards that give holders the option to tick X, meaning they are “non-binary”.
It is not clear how Argentina arrived at the quota of 1%. No one knows how many trans people there are. Rosario, a city in central Argentina, has tried to hire 25 trans people (five a year) since 2016. So far it has recruited 15. Uruguay, which also has a hiring quota, has failed to fill it.
Some feminists fear that Argentina’s rush to expand rights for trans people will undermine hard-won rights for people who were born women. Maria Binetti, an academic, says the accumulation of trans-rights laws aims to “erase women and the category of sex”. Yet it has encountered little of the opposition from feminist groups that has sprung up in other countries, such as Britain. Popular resistance has been mild. Indeed, polls suggest that Argentines are especially keen to let people change their gender, perhaps without realising how easy the government has made it. In a survey in 2016 by BuzzFeed News, Ipsos, a polling firm, and the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School, almost half of Argentine respondents supported self-identification without restrictions, compared with 27% of Brits and 23% of Americans.
Such nonchalance seems surprising in a macho land of gauchos and red meat. One explanation seems to be that Argentina’s brutal military dictatorship, which ruled from 1976 to 1983, led to the rise of an unusually strong human-rights movement. After democratisation it championed the rights of all sorts of disadvantaged groups, including trans people.
Another factor is religion’s weak role in politics. Although much of the countryside remains God-fearing, religion has lost clout in the cities. Argentina does not have strong political parties that cater to socially conservative evangelical churchgoers. So it differs from Brazil and the countries of Central America, where many more people resist the idea of expanding trans people’s rights.
As a result of all this, Argentine politicians think they have something to gain by promoting socially liberal policies of all sorts. In 2010 under then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is now vice-president, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. Mr Fernández, whose son identifies as non-binary, says he wants “to beat Cristina” by being more liberal than she was. His government legalised abortion.
Some trans activists are now urging schools to teach about sexual diversity and the government to pay reparations to trans people who were persecuted by the dictatorship. In trans-friendly Argentina, that may well happen. ■
Correction (August 15th 2021): In the original version of this article we wrote that Argentina was the first country in the Americas to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples in 2010. In fact, it was the first country in Latin America. Canada’s civil marriage act came into force in 2005. Sorry.",2
1745,"A GOOD DUST-UP with one Western ally or another is something that Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, always relishes. On October 23rd he took on ten of them at the same time, announcing that he had ordered the American, French, German, Dutch, Canadian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, and New Zealand ambassadors to be declared personae non gratae, a prelude to having them kicked out of the country. Their offence was to have signed a letter urging Turkey to release Osman Kavala, a philanthropist locked up on farcical terror and coup charges. It took another couple of days, the exhortations of Turkish officials, who warned him of the dire potential consequences to the country’s economy, and a carefully crafted statement by the American embassy, in which the mission said it did not meddle in Turkey’s domestic affairs, before Mr Erdogan backed down. The envoys were allowed to remain in Ankara.
After nearly provoking, then averting, the biggest diplomatic crisis Turkey has seen in decades, Mr Erdogan proclaimed victory. The envoys “took a step back from the slander against our country”, he said. “They will be more careful now.”

The episode, and the gloating that followed, showed how badly Mr Erdogan needs something to celebrate. Turkey’s leader is having one of the worst slumps of his long career. An alliance of the two main opposition parties, the secular Republican People’s Party (CHP) and the nationalist Iyi (“Good”) party is polling ahead of Mr Erdogan’s governing coalition, composed of his own Justice and Development (AK) party and the Nationalist Movement Party. Were parliamentary elections to take place tomorrow (they are not due until 2023, together with the next presidential election), the ruling coalition would lose its majority. Mr Erdogan, meanwhile, trails behind each of the four most likely contenders for the presidency, in some cases by double digits in putative run-offs. The whispers are starting to grow louder: could the Erdogan era be drawing to a close?

The economy, hobbled by high prices and a plummeting currency, is the main reason. The lira has lost over 20% of its dollar value since the start of the year, more than any other major currency. The latest rout came on October 21st, when the central bank slashed the main interest rate by two full percentage points. Days earlier, Mr Erdogan had sacked three members of the bank’s monetary-policy committee. The surprise cut, the second in as many months, brought the rate to nearly four points below the rate of inflation, which reached 19.6% in September. Many governments have used negative real interest rates to revive growth, usually after undershooting their inflation targets. Turkey is overshooting its own target (5%) fourfold. Investors have run out of patience.
From Mr Erdogan’s vast palace in Ankara, things do not look so bad. The economy grew by a record 21.7% in annual terms in the three months to July, thanks to large base effects and booming exports. But inflation and devaluation are ravaging the wages of ordinary Turks. In dollar terms, GDP per person, which grew steadily until 2013, is back to where it was in 2009. During Mr Erdogan’s first decade in power (he first became prime minister in 2003) millions of Turks worked their way into the middle class. Over the past couple of years, according to the World Bank, 3.2m of them sank into poverty.
Mr Erdogan’s opponents smell blood, calling (in vain) for early elections, in the knowledge that they would have a genuine chance to unseat him. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the CHP, recently urged officials to stop following “illegal orders” from Mr Erdogan and warned that those who continued to do so would be held accountable when the opposition took power.
Since 2016, when an abortive coup rocked Turkey, the main opposition has deferred to Mr Erdogan on almost every national-security issue, from the country’s purchase of advanced weapons from Russia to its armed offensives in Syria and Libya. That changed on October 26th, when the CHP said it would oppose renewing the government’s mandate to deploy troops to Syria and Iraq. Businesspeople have also begun to speak up. Turkey’s largest business group, TUSIAD, recently called for a return to central-bank independence and the separation of powers.
Knives out?
There are even signs that officials and ruling-party backbenchers may be preparing for the end of the Erdogan era. Ankara is awash with allegations that a charity linked to one of the president’s sons placed hundreds of sympathisers in government jobs. Leaked documents suggest the charity was allocated a number of properties the government seized from the Gulen community, the group involved in the 2016 coup. Meanwhile, Sedat Peker, a fugitive mobster, continues to regale his 2m Twitter followers with stories implicating officials in crimes ranging from corruption to drug trafficking. Analysts believe at least some of the leaks are coming from disaffected AK types or bureaucrats eager to distance themselves from the government.
But it is far too early to write off Mr Erdogan. Turkey’s leader continues to tower over the country’s politics and to command the loyalty of tens of millions of people, the media and state institutions, including the courts and the police. More troublingly, he and his entourage may be capable of desperate measures to cling on to power. Mr Erdogan’s latest showdown with the West will not be his last. Another military offensive in Syria, and another wave of repression at home, may be around the corner as well. Mr Erdogan will surely not go quietly. ■",2
1746,"Editor’s note: this story has been updated to take in the release of official preliminary results
THE ATRIUM of the Willy Brandt House, the Berlin headquarters of Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD), erupted in cheers on the evening of September 26th, as an exit poll suggested that the centre-left party had a narrow lead in Germany’s national election. Preliminary official results published the next morning made clear that Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s candidate to replace Angela Merkel in the chancellery, had secured an early edge. They gave the SPD 25.7% of the vote, ahead of the conservative Christian Democrats and their Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), on 24.1%. 

The two parties once commanded over 90% of the vote in Germany. That this number has fallen to around 50% explains why, whatever the final result, Germany is now entering a lengthy period of uncertainty. Assuming that a continuation of the current CDU/CSU-SPD “grand coalition” is ruled out, whoever leads the next government will need to persuade both the Green Party and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) to join them in coalition. That will not be an easy task—not least because Mr Scholz and Armin Laschet, the CDU/CSU candidate, each claimed a mandate to form a government. The leaders agreed they should try to get a government in place by the end of the year, but complex negotiations could upset that timetable. (Angela Merkel will remain chancellor until a new government can be formed.)
In the one case, Mr Laschet would lead a “Jamaica” coalition. In the other, Mr Scholz would become chancellor at the head of a “traffic-light” coalition (the arrangements take their name from the parties’ colours, and Jamaica’s flag). Both would enjoy clear majorities. The SPD also won a huge victory in an election in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and a narrower one in the city-state of Berlin.
In contrast to previous elections, the early projections this year were sufficiently ambiguous for none of the party leaders to make extravagant claims. Perhaps the most important news of the night was that the FDP and the Greens have agreed to begin exploratory talks with one another before agreeing to negotiations with either of the bigger parties. The two parties disagree on much, but if they can assemble a joint position, perhaps including an agreement on the distribution of ministerial portfolios including the crucial one of finance, they will in effect be able to act as joint kingmakers.
For now, what is clear is that Mr Laschet has led the CDU/CSU to its worst-ever election result, down perhaps nine percentage points from the previous election in 2017, itself a historic nadir. The CDU/CSU will take some satisfaction that it has not slumped to the lows found in some recent polls, but the result remains a serious disappointment for a party that has long seen itself as a Kanzlerverein, or “chancellor’s club”. Mr Laschet acknowledged that the party could not be satisfied with its result.
The mood among the SPD’s troops, on the other hand, is bullish. A few months ago the party seemed unable to lift itself from a dismal 15% in the polls. After a strong campaign focused squarely on the unflappable Mr Scholz, they are now looking at a strong result some five points ahead of the 2017 score. Exit polls found a strong preference for Mr Scholz to become chancellor over Mr Laschet—and that the party had done particularly well with older voters. The SPD also looks headed for victory in a state election in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Its hopes of holding on to the city-state of Berlin, where another election was held, look uncertain after a late Green surge. 
The Greens, meanwhile, took just under 15% of the national vote, according to preliminary results. Given that the party was briefly leading in polls as recently as April, that will feel like a disappointment. Yet it will still count as by far the best result in its history. Michael Kellner, the party’s general secretary, said he was “having a hard time getting excited”, but chose to congratulate the SPD on a “great result”. That is a strong invitation to Mr Scholz to start work on a traffic-light coalition. The CSU had lately ruled out the possibility that the centre-right bloc might attempt to form a coalition if it came second in the election. That also gives an early advantage to Mr Scholz, who returned the Greens’ compliment. Much hard work lies ahead, and the complexity of the coalition constellation could well lead to surprises. But for now, it is advantage Mr Scholz.",2
1747,"CHINA HAS an anger-management problem, at least when dealing with small and mid-size Western democracies. The fate of Lithuania, a European Union member on the shores of the Baltic Sea, is a case in point.
The country is being punished for agreeing that Taiwan, a democratic island that China claims as its own territory, may open a “Taiwanese Representative Office” in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital. China calls that an affront to its sovereignty. It has summoned its ambassador, Shen Zhifei, home for consultations, and told Lithuania to recall its envoy, Diana Mickeviciene. In a covid-era twist, China informed Ms Mickeviciene of her fate as she returned to Beijing from a summer break. She has to complete three weeks of strict quarantine at her residence and, after emerging on August 31st, catch the next flight home. State media suggest that China may soon suspend direct rail-freight services to Lithuania, then sever other economic links with that country of 2.8m people (Lithuanian farmers should forget long-held dreams of selling milk to China, it is hinted). In a detail noted with dismay by foreign envoys in Beijing, Lithuania’s embassy has received a barrage of threatening calls, many targeting local Chinese staff.

China’s problem is not simply that it has a short fuse. It is not new for leaders in Beijing to downgrade relations with governments that cross their “red lines”. China routinely freezes trade talks and official visits whenever foreign leaders meet Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (Lithuania suffered this fate in 2013). Last year China curbed imports of coal and wine from Australia after that country’s government called for an international probe into covid-19’s origins. Often, China’s demands are arcane as well as aggressive. Lithuania may earn a partial reprieve if it permits only a “Taipei Representative Office” in Vilnius. China tolerates trade offices named after Taiwan’s capital, because those sound like local government outposts. Even the hair-trigger anger of the Chinese public—or at least its noisiest elements—is wearily familiar. Each week, it seems, online nationalists demand a new domestic boycott of a business, or the cancellation of a foreign or local celebrity accused of hurting Chinese pride. Threats directed at Chinese deemed “race traitors” are alarmingly common.
Rather, Chinese irascibility may prove more problematic than before because China’s ambitions are changing. The country no longer inhabits a world of bilateral ties dominated by trade, of the sort that allowed it to play one country off against another. It hopes to create new international networks and groupings that share similar views about what constitutes good governance, in which China plays the central role. That brings new forms of scrutiny when it loses its temper.
About a decade ago, lots of foreign countries saw China as a dazzling, potentially transformative economic partner. Lithuania was no exception. In competition with Estonia and Latvia, its Baltic neighbours, it pitched its largest airport as a hub for Chinese flights, and its main seaport, Klaipeda, as an entry-point for Chinese ships. More recently, it sought to be a European gateway for Chinese financial technologies. In 2012 Lithuania joined 15 other central and eastern European countries, nine of them EU members, in a Chinese-led grouping. This came to be known as the “16 plus one” initiative, holding annual summits with China’s prime minister and spawning countless committees to work on co-operation. At first, many in eastern Europe chafed when the group was called a threat to the EU’s unity by the continent’s rich Westerners. Easterners particularly resented being chided by Germany, given that country’s exceptional access to Chinese leaders and markets.
Disappointment followed. Chinese investments in central and eastern Europe proved paltry, and the lion’s share went to Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Serbia. Trade increased, but mostly because of imports from China. Today, China is still only Lithuania’s 12th-largest trade partner. As dreams of an economic bonanza faded, some members of the 16 plus one (which swelled to 17 after Greece joined in 2019) began comparing notes about the bloc’s political aims and lack of transparency. Like-minded embassies discovered that Chinese officials and party bodies were making direct contacts with regions, cities and institutions in their home countries, bypassing national capitals. In February six members—Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia—sent only ministers to a virtual summit of the 17 plus one, though President Xi Jinping was in the chair.
China’s brand of performative patriotism goes global
Further complicating China’s image, its nationalist fervour is increasingly on display far from home. In August 2019 Lithuania accused China’s embassy in Vilnius of rallying Chinese citizens to disrupt a protest in support of Hong Kong’s democrats (Chinese diplomats were photographed handing out banners). A few months later Chinese-speaking visitors proudly filmed themselves vandalising signs of support for Hong Kong planted on the Hill of Crosses, a shrine to national independence dating to Lithuania’s occupation by Nazi Germany and then by the Soviet Union. The videos went viral, appalling Lithuanians. In April this year expansion of Klaipeda’s outer harbour was put on hold for at least a decade. Senior officials had earlier called China’s attempts to invest in the port a national-security risk. In May Lithuania’s foreign minister announced his country’s withdrawal from the 17 plus one, calling it divisive and less efficient than a unified EU.
State media accuse Lithuania of foolishly provoking China in order to curry favour with America, as if smaller countries lack any will of their own. The mood of gloom and wariness among many European embassies in Beijing is obvious to all. But domestic political imperatives require outsize displays of anger, whenever China feels disrespected. That is a clumsy way to manage foreigners. To China, however, being defied is worse. ■",2
1748,"A five-year-old girl is lucky to be alive after being pulled unconcious from the water at a popular Perth amusement park.
Paramedics were called to the Adventure World amusement park in Bibra Lake at 12.15pm on Saturday.
Members of the public pulled the girl who was found face down and unconscious in the water before life guards performed CPR after she stopped breathing. 
She regained consciousness and was taken to Fiona Stanley Hospital in a critical condition. 
Adventure World chief executive Andrew Sharry thanked the two park guests who played a 'pivotal role' in saving her life, according to The West Australian. 
'Early this afternoon an unsupervised five-year-old girl was retrieved from the main pool by the two closest guests,' he said.
'Our lifeguard checked vitals and commenced CPR immediately. Our First Response Team arrived and provided further support.
'The girl responded within moments and was then stabilised until the ambulance arrived.' 
She was later transported to Perth's Children Hospital and is now in a stable condition. 
A witness has described the incident as 'horrible', according to Perth Now. 
'A young girl, she was helped and fortunately taken to hospital breathing,' Sarah Louise wrote via social media. 
'The life guards and members of the public did a great job.
'Was a horrible scene.' 
Under the amusement park's policy children aged under 12 must be supervised at all times by a guardian.   
'Our thoughts are with the young girl and her family,' Mr Sharry said.
'We have reached out to the parents to offer our support.' 
Hundreds of children and their families were reportedly at the popular amusement park during the time of the incident. 
Adventure World continued to remain open to the public after the incident.",-2
1749,"GABRIEL GARCÍA MÁRQUEZ wrote that it is easier to start a war than to end it, an observation that might also serve as a summary of America’s experience since 9/11. The constitution vests Congress with the awesome power to declare war, so it is a persistent source of vexation on Capitol Hill that presidents so often drop bombs without asking permission. Yet it is possible to understand why presidents might roll their eyes at that prospect considering how much difficulty Congress is having resolving a far less weighty question: when is it the right time to undeclare a war?
At issue are two congressional authorisations to wage war in Iraq, the first issued 30 years ago, the second 19 years ago, both to presidents called George Bush. The first war ended years before the second began, and the second ended almost ten years ago. Yet both laws remain on the books, and presidents remain free to start a war against Iraq. They have not chosen to, presumably because Iraq is now an ally.

Earlier this summer, after years of struggle by a handful of senators, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took a step towards revoking the Iraq authorisations by voting to let the full Senate consider a bill to do so. Its supporters, and even its opponents, see it as a small step towards Congress reasserting its power over warmaking. Some in Congress hope to turn next to revising another legacy of 9/11, the authorisation of force in 2001 that four successive presidents have relied on to wage America’s “war on terror” in 14 countries. Yet even the revocation of the two Iraq war resolutions is not assured.
In explaining his vote against that bill, the leading Republican on the committee, James Risch of Idaho, noted that “virtually all of us have the same agreement” about the need for Congress to assert itself, and he conceded the bill would have “zero effect” on a president’s ability to respond to threats. But by repealing these authorisations, Congress would send a dangerous signal to Iran, he warned. “There are people that are going to look at this and say, ‘Aha, the US is getting weak on the region’.”
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas went a step further—in both directions. He said he opposed the last Iraq war and that it was “a good thing” to repeal the authorisations. “We have allowed executives, both Republican and Democrat, far too much leeway in exercising the awesome might of calling into battle the US armed forces,” he said. Yet he added that he would vote against the bill unless it was amended to give the president even more leeway to use force in the future, because he was also worried about Iran. This is the pickle several hawkish lawmakers find themselves in. They want to undeclare these wars, because they worry that the president, particularly one from another party, feels too free to wage war. But they do not want to undeclare these wars—because they fear the president might not go to war.
The constitution says Congress, not the president, “shall have Power” to declare war. In theory, the president appeals to Congress for authority to fight or even for a declaration of war, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt did after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. But voting for a war can be politically risky, as can voting to end a war, which might be seen as undermining troops in the field.
For their part, presidents do not like to be constrained by Congress, and they have taken to stretching previous congressional authorisations rather than seeking new ones. The classic example is the authorisation in 2001 to use force against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, which Congress passed less than a week after the World Trade Centre fell. That is the authorisation that Barack Obama invoked to strike at Islamic State (IS), which did not even exist in 2001.
Mr Biden relied on the same authority in August to justify air strikes in Somalia against what the military chiefs said were al-Qaeda affiliates. Lawmakers of both parties criticised that rationale as exceeding Congress’s intent. But despite such objections, Congress has given its implicit approval to these acts of presidential creativity by appropriating money as the military mission expanded. The bill pending before the Senate does not touch the authorisation of 2001, and rewriting it will be a much tougher political proposition.
Yet as the last Iraq war shows, Congress does not necessarily get it right when it does provide authority to use force. Claims by the administration that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction proved false, and many members of Congress came to regret their votes. In any case, presidents often insist no authorisation is needed. When Mr Obama intervened in Libya as part of a NATO coalition in 2011, the Justice Department contended the president was acting within his constitutional authority because the use of force was in the national interest and limited in “anticipated nature, scope and duration”. The bombing campaign lasted for months and helped topple the Libyan regime.

Congress spent more time investigating the killing of four American officials and contractors in Benghazi, Libya than it did looking into the 9/11 attacks. But though some representatives grumbled about Mr Obama’s assertion of presidential power, Congress held only a handful of hearings on the intervention in Libya itself. Such scrutiny might have saved Mr Obama from what he later called the worst mistake of his presidency, the failure to plan for the aftermath of the intervention.
Barely a month after Mr Biden became president he dispatched two F-15 fighters to fire missiles at facilities in Syria which the armed forces said were controlled by Iranian militias. The administration said the strike was legal because it was an act of self-defence, in response to attacks on American personnel in Iraq, and also an effort to deter future attacks. Though Republicans were generally supportive, some influential Democrats did not buy the argument. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a leader of congressional efforts to constrain presidential warmaking, declared that “offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances.”
The administration did not retreat from its legal claim. But Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Mr Biden wants to work with Congress to replace “outdated authorisations” for using force with “narrow and specific frameworks”. That might help restore some balance between Congress and the president when it comes to starting wars. But after America stumbled out of Afghanistan, 20 years after invading it, one hard lesson is that, regardless of which branch of government starts a war, America would benefit most from dogged congressional oversight of how that war is conducted. ■",2
1750,"FACED WITH a bully, you have two choices. One is to confront, as Rodrigo Duterte threatened when campaigning in 2016 to become president of the Philippines: he declared he would deal with the country’s dispute with China in the Spratly Islands by riding a jet ski into the contested waters waving the national flag. In office, Mr Duterte has taken the other path, trying to bribe, flatter, cajole and wheedle the bully into more reasonable behaviour. This has turned out to be as silly and futile as a jet ski.
As Mr Duterte prepares to leave office next year at the end of the one term the constitution allows him, relations with China are no better than in 2016, when his term began. Benigno Aquino, his predecessor who died in June, once likened acceptance of China’s creeping maritime expansionism to the appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Mr Duterte, in contrast, soon after becoming president, visited Beijing, where he announced his military and economic “separation” from America, telling his Chinese audience: “I will be dependent on you.” China promised billions of dollars in investment and concessionary loans. The two sides agreed to open negotiations over fishing waters in the South China Sea.

That swatted aside one of Aquino’s achievements: a landmark victory five years ago when a UN tribunal ruled that China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea had no basis in international law. China ignores the judgment, and Mr Duterte often rubbishes it. “That’s just a piece of paper,” he said in May. “I will just throw it into the wastebasket.”
Mr Duterte, however, does not have much to show for letting China trample his country’s rights. Only three of a planned 14 Chinese-financed infrastructure projects have broken ground. Of $15bn-worth of promised investment, only $3.2bn was approved in 2016-20. And although soft loans and grants from China have risen from $1.6m in 2016 to $590m in 2019, America provided almost as much; Japan’s aid totalled $8.5bn. Unusually for a South-East Asian country, the Philippines still does more trade with both Japan and America than it does with China.
Nor has the friendly approach restrained China’s maritime expansionism. In March some 200 of its fishing boats—or, as some called them, maritime militias—staged one of the biggest and longest-lasting incursions into Philippine waters. The Philippine foreign minister likened China to “an ugly oaf forcing [its] attentions on a handsome guy who wants to be a friend”. Mr Duterte, however, still insisted China was “a good friend”.
Yet Mr Duterte has not followed through on his other pledge in Beijing by jettisoning the alliance with the Philippines’ former colonial power, America, despite its infuriating harping on about his human-rights abuses. A 70-year-old mutual-defence treaty remains in place, and Mr Duterte’s threat to abrogate a Visiting Forces Agreement signed in 1998 has so far proved hollow. Facing resistance from the army and others, Mr Duterte has to keep “suspending” termination. Indeed, some of Mr Duterte’s own political allies take issue with his stance on China. And though he remains popular with voters, China does not. Whoever succeeds Mr Duterte is thus likely to revert to a more nuanced foreign policy, seeking to keep America engaged and to stand up more to China.
Nobody said that dealing with China would be easy. It likes to remind its neighbours that it is a big country that they will find hard to resist. South-East Asian countries have a weak hand. All the more reason not to throw away their three strongest cards, as Mr Duterte did so thoughtlessly.
One is regional solidarity. Other countries, too, including Malaysia and Vietnam, are at odds with China in the South China Sea, and their regional association, ASEAN, has long sought to get China to agree to a code of conduct there. The second is friendship with America, with all its military might. And the third is that, in the long run, playing these first two cards is the best way to encourage China to see that its interests lie in a world where countries agree to follow an accepted set of rules—and that, far from being a piece of waste-paper, that ruling five years ago was the law. ■",2
1751,"THE IDEA that there are five senses goes back at least as far as Aristotle. But it is not quite true. Four of the senses are obvious, not least because each is associated with a particular organ: sight with the eyes, hearing with the ears, taste with the tongue and smell with the nose. But the fifth classical sense, touch, is distributed over the whole surface of the body, albeit that it is particularly concentrated in the fingertips. 
Touch, moreover, is only one of such distributed senses. Others, perceived consciously, include pain, heat and cold. And modern science has shown there are yet further, unconsciously perceived senses, known collectively as proprioception. These keep track of the position and movement of the body and its parts. This year, the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, in Stockholm, which awards the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine, chose to honour the discoverers of the molecular mechanisms of two of these distributed senses—temperature and mechanical stimulation.

The winners were David Julius of the University of California, San Francisco and Ardem Patapoutian of Scripps Research, a biomedical institute in San Diego. Dr Julius did the pioneering work on temperature. He and Dr Patapoutian, acting independently, then advanced this work. After that, Dr Patapoutian moved on to look at mechanical stimulation.
Dr Julius’s chosen tool for his investigation, which he began in the late 1990s, was capsaicin. This is the active ingredient of chilli peppers. By a chemical coincidence (as was then assumed and is now known) capsaicin reacts with, and thus stimulates, one of the body’s heat-receptor proteins. Dr Julius set out to discover what this protein was. To do so he made millions of fragments of genetic material for proteins known to be active in heat-receptor cells. He then introduced these fragments into other cells, to encourage them to manufacture the relevant protein fragments. That done, he tested the modified cells for sensitivity to capsaicin. 
The fragments which induced capsaicin sensitivity turned out to be parts of a protein now called TRPV1. This belongs to a class of proteins called ion channels, which do many jobs in the body. As predicted, TRPV1 turned out to be heat sensitive. When the temperature rises above 43°C, the channel through it opens, permitting ions of calcium and sodium to pass. That chemical signal stimulates a nerve impulse which tells the brain about the temperature change.
TRPV1 turned out to be one of several temperature-sensitive ion channels, some of which register heat, and some cold. It was one of the cold-sensitive varieties, TRPM8, which was discovered simultaneously by Dr Julius and Dr Patapoutian.
Dr Patapoutian then went on to look at the sensation of touch. Molecular biology having advanced in the interim, he was able to work with whole proteins—or, rather, the genes for whole proteins. He identified 72 such proteins expressed in a mechanically sensitive cell line that looked like potential touch-sensitive sensitive ion channels. He tested them one at a time, by silencing the genes that encode them and poking the resulting cells. The first 71 silencings had no effect. But the 72nd proved to be of the protein he was looking for. He called that protein PIEZO1.
In nature, PIEZO1 is found not in sensory neurons, but rather in organs like the bladder where local sensitivity to pressure is important. But Dr Patapoutian soon discovered a second, similar channel, PIEZO2, which is, indeed, found in nerve endings. It is this that is responsible for touch and proprioception. 
Fascinating work, then. And important. It is through the senses, and the senses alone, that human beings are able to perceive the world. But to some people the award has come as a surprise. In a year of covid, many had been expecting the honours to go elsewhere—perhaps to the inventors of mRNA-vaccine technology. Like God, however, the various Nobel-prize committees work in mysterious ways their wonders to perform.",2
1752," (CNN)What's that we hear? Is it the sound of prominent conservatives and Trump allies openly rebuking former President Donald Trump? Are these the early murmurs of a conservative backlash against Trump? And is it possible a political lane is opening for another Republican presidential candidate in 2024?It's too soon to know, of course, and there's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.The statements from Rupert Murdoch -- who controls a media empire that includes, among other properties, the shamelessly pro-Trump Fox News -- and from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- an adviser who worked with the former president and helped him prepare for the presidential debates during the 2020 election -- may serve as a test for Republicans who understand just how harmful Trump's dominance of the GOP is, and how it could ultimately sink the party.It was startling when Murdoch, addressing his company at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, said that the United States faces a number of major political decisions that conservatives will fail to shape unless Trump moves on. ""The current American political debate is profound,"" he said, citing education, welfare and economic opportunity. ""It is crucial that conservatives play an active, forceful role in that debate,"" he added, ""but that will not happen if President Trump stays focused on the past.""Murdoch is not alone in arguing that Trump is a threat to conservatives. Christie, who has just published a new book that looks very much like his unofficial entry into the 2024 presidential race, is making the same case, only more forcefully.Consider the title of Christie's book -- which effectively labels Trump a threat to the GOP: ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Notice that Trump fits two of the three reasons the party needs saving (by Christie, presumably).Murdoch and Christie are not the first Republicans who have stood up to the former president --  but their rebukes of Trump are markedly different. Trump's early critics, like Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and others, melted into passionate defenders once their criticisms proved perilous to their own standing. Their reversals bring to mind a quote often attributed to Groucho Marx: ""Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others."" Christie says many in the GOP are frightened of Trump, whose ""conduct is meant to instill fear."" Conservative Republicans who refuse to fall in line, such as Rep. Liz Cheney, are being hounded out of a party that is increasingly remade into the former president's raging, iconoclastic and intolerant brand.Sure, it's possible Murdoch and Christie's words may also fail to change the course of the GOP, but their criticism is different. They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party -- and the rest of the country -- that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.Coincidentally or not, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, finally acknowledged Biden's win on Thursday, more than a year after the 2020 vote. ""Painfully,"" she said, ""Joe Biden won the election and it's very painful to watch. He's the President. We know that."" Murdoch and Christie undoubtedly have their own personal motives for speaking out against Trump in this moment, and there's plenty of evidence to warrant accusations of hypocrisy. Murdoch, whose Fox News -- home of Tucker Carlson, a purveyor of harmful lies and propaganda about everything from the Covid vaccine to American democracy -- is still serving Trump's goals. But Fox News now faces billion-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by two voting technology companies that allege the network spread false claims of election fraud. Murdoch might be driven by a fear of liability and the potential damage additional lawsuits could inflict on his bottom line if Fox News continues to follow Trump down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and baseless claims. There is, also the possibility that he cares about the future of conservative politics, and genuinely fears the GOP might get trampled if Trump doesn't let up.Christie, for his part, is trying to promote his book and his prospects of occupying the White House.Still, it is remarkable that they have done the calculus and decided they can benefit from speaking out against the former president, even after other Republicans have been badly hurt by doing the same thing. I think their calculation makes sense. With President Joe Biden's ratings sinking, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are doomed. But it is Republicans who may be doomed if they continue to stick with the former president.There's no doubt the Biden administration is terrible at messaging. The economy is booming and yet consumers are feeling pessimistic. Meanwhile, Biden is making important legislative progress, and the inflationary pressures that are creating the false impression that the economy is failing could be resolved in time to boost Democrats' fortunes.Even if Democrats are still in the doldrums in 2024, it's hard to imagine that voters will be yearning for another four years of Trumpian chaos. Biden may look uninspiring now, but the former president, who had the most consistently poor approval ratings of any president in the modern era, remains highly unpopular and controversial. Do Republicans want a candidate embroiled in endless -- and serious -- legal troubles? According to the New York Times, prosecutors are likely to impanel a grand jury in Georgia in the criminal investigation of the former president's attempt to overturn the 2020 election (In September, he suggested he was being unfairly targeted, saying, ""Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me."") Meanwhile, prosecutors in New York have convened a second grand jury to hear evidence about Trump Organization's business practices, according to the Washington Post. (The first grand jury, which convened this spring, charged two Trump companies and an executive with tax evasion. Trump, who was not charged, blasted the indictment and called the investigation a ""political witch hunt."")A Pew poll conducted in September found that two-thirds of Republicans want Trump to remain a major force in the party, but only 44% want him to run again. One-third of Republicans and 92% of Democrats don't want him to be a major national political figure going forward. That's not the arithmetic of victory. There's the potential for a post-Trump Republican Party to gain ground. It still seems like a long shot at this point, but if his critics are successful in persuading the GOP to move in a different direction, there's a chance American democracy can return some semblance of normality, where political leaders debate what policies are best for the country, without fear of upsetting the tender, explosive feelings of a very bad loser.",0
1753,"Britons travelling to China have been told by the UK Government to avoid wet markets — because of a rise in bird flu. 
In fresh advice issued today, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned the notorious markets were a 'source of infection'.   
Wet markets became the centre of international criticism last year after being touted as the epicentre of the Covid pandemic.
It is common for dozens of animals, dead and alive, to be kept dangerously close to one another in cramped cages at the markets.
The UKHSA said travellers to China and other Asian countries should also avoid live bird animal markets and poultry farms. 
Returning Britons should alert their GP if they experience flu-like symptoms within 10 days of coming home.
China is recording record numbers of the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza this year, with 22 confirmed so far - compared to just five last year.  
Dr Gavin Dabrera, an infectious diseases expert at UKHSA said: 'Anyone visiting China should avoid exposure to birds or live birds in ‘wet markets’ as a precaution.'
The cases of H5N6 in China this year have resulted in at least six deaths and left many of the remaining patients critically ill. 
Scientists estimate the substrain - which first emerged in the East Asian state Laos in 2013 - has a kill rate of 67 per cent.
The UKHSA said China claimed it had not recorded any cases of human-to-human transmission, and that the risk to the UK was 'very low'. 
Britons travelling to the area are also being advised not to handle undercooked or raw poultry, egg or duck dishes. 
Dr Dabrera added: 'We continue to encourage people to avoid touching dead or dying birds and maintain good hand hygiene while travelling. 
By Luke Andrews, Health Reporter 
Flu will make a comeback this winter after a year of Covid restrictions, a respiratory diseases scientist warned today.
Dr Beverly Taylor, who monitors emerging strains around the globe for the World Health Organization, said that cases have been rising globally and the UK can expect a bad bout this year.
She told a press conference: 'It definitely looks like influenza is on its way back. 
'The World Health Organization sends out a report every two weeks, and it shows a very slow but very steady increase in the number of samples positive for influenza.'  
Measures imposed to keep Covid at bay — including work from home and face masks — also helped to limit the spread of other respiratory diseases.
UK Health Security Agency surveillance shows flu cases are now rising slowly in Britain but remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Some 0.8 per cent of samples tested picked up flu last week (36 cases).
This was up from 0.4 per cent in the previous week (18 cases).
For comparison, in the same week in the year before the pandemic 3.4 per cent of samples tested positive for flu.
Dr Taylor is head of influenza scientific affairs at Britain's major manufacturer for seasonal flu jabs Seqirus.
'Avian influenza remains a risk in China and if travellers experience any flu like symptoms within 10 days of returning from China, they should call their GP or NHS 111 and report their recent travel. 
'UKHSA has arrangements in place to deal with emerging diseases. This includes the detection and investigation of suspected cases, and the management of confirmed cases and their contacts.'
A World Health Organization (WHO) expert said there was nothing to worry about yet because there is no sign the strain can spread between people.
But Dr Beverly Taylor, an influenza and vaccine expert, warned: 'We can't rule it out'. 
She told MailOnline: ' I think the key thing is we are not seeing human to human transmission. 
'Right now the risk is expected to be low but we cant rule it out.'
She suggested wet markets and other agricultural practices in China made it more prone than other countries to outbreaks.
She said: 'China does have — it always has — a higher number of cases than we see in other countries and part of that is the way we see people live there.
'There are live bird markets which we have seen the Chinese Government try to get control over and people living very closely with their domestic birds.' 
The Huanan Seafood Wholesale in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei Province, has been touted as the source of Covid.
A majority of the early cases were reported among people who had been shopping or working there.
Yet, despite testing markets, farms and no fewer than 80,000 animal samples spanning dozens of species across China, no evidence has emerged for a similar chain of early 'zoonotic' infections — transmitted from animals to humans — in SARS-CoV-2. 
Hundreds of samples taken from animal carcasses at the market have all tested negative for any trace of the virus.
And while the Chinese authorities have not revealed the professions of those who were earliest infected, we know that several of them, including the first known cases, had no exposure to the market whatsoever.
More recently, attentions have turned to a high-security biomedical lab in Wuhan, where it is feared the virus may have accidentally leaked from. ",-2
1754,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. Among them is a piece offering a different view on reparations.
DRIVE SOUTH-EAST from Minneapolis for an hour and you come to the Prairie Island Indian reservation, home to one of Minnesota’s 11 federally recognised Native American tribes. The federal government built a dam in the 1930s, flooding the place. In the 1970s it allowed the construction of a nuclear-power plant. Despite these blots, on a rainy Wednesday afternoon Prairie Island is full of visitors. People have come from Minnesota and Wisconsin to play the slot machines and blackjack and poker tables at the Treasure Island casino, operated by the tribe.
The Native American story runs through Minnesota. The largest mass-execution in American history took place at Mankato, south-west of Minneapolis, when 38 Dakota tribesmen were hanged in 1862. Today a small memorial garden in Mankato has a bench inscribed “forgive everyone everything”. Native Americans also receive reparations. In most states they take the form of land, though it is often useless for farming or property development. But federally recognised tribes are not subject to state laws against casino gambling. So Native Americans with reservations near cities have a near monopoly over a lucrative industry. Yet gambling has been only a partial success. Native Americans still have lower life expectancy and educational attainment than any other group.

The federal government has made some attempts similarly to recompense African-Americans, but these efforts were either ineffective or withdrawn after meeting too much opposition. The unpopular attempt to redistribute land in the South after the abolition of slavery was soon suspended. From the 1960s, various schemes were tried to favour minority-owned businesses in government contracting. They have not made much difference. For private businesses, reserving jobs for people of one race is illegal. Affirmative action, which gives African-Americans favourable treatment in university admissions and federal contracting, is being litigated away, mainly because it tends to discriminate against Asian-Americans.
Yet the idea of paying reparations for slavery has moved from the fringe since 1989, when John Conyers, a Michigan congressman, first introduced a reparations bill in Congress. Mr Conyers persisted in every Congress until he retired. It was not until Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote an article in the Atlantic in 2014 that the idea became more mainstream among Democrats. In the party’s 2020 primary the leading contenders all supported reparations. Since he moved into the White House, Joe Biden has announced his support for studying the issue, which looks like a case of a politician signalling support for an idea without actually having to do anything to advance it.

Even if a reparations bill passed the House, which is unlikely, it would have no chance in the Senate. The idea, which is popular among upscale Democrats, has the support of only half of African-Americans. Practical questions, such as who should receive any payment and who should be obliged to contribute, remain formidable. The political backlash against a party that made a determined push for reparations from the federal government would be fierce. This has not stopped some towns and institutions from trying. Asheville in North Carolina, Evanston in Illinois and Georgetown University have all taken steps in this direction by acknowledging a moral responsibility for slavery and segregation.
Initiatives like this may be worthy, but they will not deal with disparities in income, wealth, education and housing. The reparations movement is driven by arguments about justice, but the economic arguments for it are weak. The bulk of the black-white wealth gap is accounted for not because white Americans have inherited far more than black Americans. It is caused by African-Americans having lower incomes which, compounded over time, lead to less wealth. A one-off reparations payment would not fix that.

1755,"WHEN A MODIFIED MD-80 airliner flew at the 1988 Farnborough air show in Britain, it was supposed to represent the future of air travel. One of its rear-mounted jet engines had been replaced with an unusual form of propulsion. This consisted of two rings of short propeller-like blades mounted in the open air, immediately behind the jet housing and spinning in opposite directions. Some called it a propfan, others an unducted fan or open rotor. Whatever the name, many said it marked the return of the propeller for large passenger aircraft.
It was not to be. Although the propfan promised a big reduction in fuel consumption the engine failed to enter commercial service, mostly because oil prices fell, but also because conventional jet engines became more efficient. But the idea never went away completely. Engineers in America and Europe continued to tinker with propfans. In the 1990s Antonov, a Ukrainian firm, launched a military transport plane called the AN-70 with four forward-facing contra-rotating propfans under its wing, although only two prototypes were made. Now, in a more environmentally conscious world where cutting aviation emissions is of increasing importance, propfans may be staging a comeback.

Fan-tastic
The idea behind a propfan is to combine the fuel economy of a propeller with the speed of a jet engine. Because it is more efficient to move a large volume of air slowly than a small amount rapidly, the fans at the front of modern jet engines have been made progressively bigger. Removing the housing allows the fan to be bigger still.
A fan rather than a propeller (as on a turboprop aircraft) is used because aerodynamic effects cause propellers to lose efficiency at high speed. This happens when the moving tips of a large propeller blade reach supersonic speeds, setting off shock waves which disrupt the airflow. The fans on jet engines, however, have more numerous blades and they are specially shaped, a bit like scimitars, to avoid creating shock waves. This should allow an aircraft using propfans to match the speed of a conventional jet airliner.
The propfan fitted to the experimental MD-80 was made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE, an American engineering group, and Safran, a French company then called Snecma. The pair are now developing a new version, which they reckon could reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20% compared with the best jet engines currently in use. And the new propfan will be capable of running on unconventional sources of energy, such as synthetic aviation fuel, hydrogen or a hybrid-electric system. Flight tests are scheduled for 2025.
The new CFM propfan differs from older designs in various ways. Like the engines on the AN-70, it will sit under the wings, with an open fan at the front. Unlike the AN-70’s engines, though, it will use a single rotating open-fan. It does have a second ring of blades immediately behind the front fan, but these do not spin. Instead, they act as vanes that guide the flow of air backwards. The new arrangement is less complicated than the older one, and should be easier to maintain.
The new propfan is also lighter, which itself saves fuel and hence emissions. This is not just because the fan housing has been eliminated. The thrust reverser—which on a conventional jet engine uses a series of deflectors to slow an aircraft once it has touched down on the runway—has also gone. Instead of deflectors, the pitches of both the rotating blades and the static vanes can be adjusted on the new propfan to reverse its thrust.
One problem with propfans, though, is noise. This was particularly high inside the cabin of the modified MD-80. The combination of a single ring of blades, and advances in acoustic design should let the engine meet current and anticipated noise regulations, says CFM.
There has been concern about what would happen if a propfan blade broke off. A conventional jet engine is designed to contain a breakaway blade within the fan housing. With no such housing, there is nothing to stop such a breakaway striking the aircraft’s fuselage or wing, with potentially catastrophic results. That could mean parts of the aircraft near the open blades will need to be reinforced.
The best thing, though, is to stop the blades breaking in the first place. For that, new materials will help. One legacy of the MD-80 propfan was the pioneering use of extremely strong blades made from carbon-fibre composites. This technology has progressed, and the fan blades in jet engines and the propellers of modern turboprops are now routinely made from composites. These blades are proving their durability by safely notching up millions of flight hours, says a spokeswoman for CFM.
Mounting the propfans under the wings of an aircraft is more in keeping with the way modern airliners are built. It also makes maintenance and safety checks easier. However, the consortium says it can producer a “pusher” version if an aircraft-maker wants to design a plane with its engines at the rear, like the old MD-80.
New aircraft designs are in the works, but the two main builders of airliners, Boeing and Airbus, have yet to commit themselves to any big, new projects. CFM hopes the propfan will be a contender for a new generation of short- and medium-haul aircraft, although it could be used on large wide-body aircraft, too. If flight tests go well, in a decade or so travellers might find the aircraft they are boarding is once again powered by propellers.■",2
1756,"SALTA, Argentina, Sept 14 (Reuters) - In Argentina's remote northern Salta province, the silence of the desert landscape is broken only by the hum of machinery pumping salt-water brine to extract lithium, a sign of accelerating efforts to ride the global electric vehicle boom.
Beneath the South American country's highland salt flats, reached by winding mountain roads, is buried the world's third largest reserve of the ultra-light battery metal, which has seen a price spike over the past year on the back of a global push towards greener modes of transport.
Already the fourth top producer of lithium worldwide, Argentina's national and local governments are now looking to speed up development, held back for years by red tape, high tax rates, rampant inflation and currency controls.
Provinces like Salta are building regional mining logistics nodes and access roads, lowering tax rates and rationalizing confusing rules for the sector to attract investment in the 'white gold' metal.
That has seen a flurry of new activity, deals and plans to ramp up production, which could make Argentina a key player in the electric vehicle supply chain in coming years, with demand from carmakers and buyers like China expected to gain pace.
""Argentina could become the world's leading producer from brines in less than a decade if the flow of projects is followed and maintained,"" David Guerrero Alvarado, a consultant advising Canada's Alpha Lithium (ALLI.V), told Reuters in Salta.
Alpha Lithium is in the investigation stage for a project in the nearby Salar Tolillar, one of many early-stage developments that - while offering promise - need an often long and costly process to be turned into a reality.
With countries around the world scrambling to reduce emissions, rising global lithium demand and surging prices have drawn increased interest in the so-called 'lithium triangle' that spans parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.
In Argentina, mining provinces such as Salta, Jujuy and Catamarca have moved to encourage wary investors, signing an agreement in June to create uniform rules and to ""strengthen infrastructure, legal security and fiscal stability.""
Salta's Secretary of Mining and Energy, Flavia Royon, told Reuters the province could produce 200,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent annually by 2025, after flicking though a list of upcoming lithium developments.
That would be a huge ramp-up, equivalent to around one-fifth of forecast global production that year.
""There's interest in Salta and it's the Argentine province with the most lithium projects in the pipeline,"" she said.
The country's CAEM mining chamber predicts a lower 175,000 tonnes nationally by 2025 from an estimated 38,800 tonnes this year. But - with lithium projects often taking years to ramp up - that remains a lofty goal.
FUELS OF THE FUTURE
Argentina's center-left government has been making a conscious and strategic push towards lithium.
Last year it lowered taxes on all mining exports to 8% from 12% and in April eased capital controls on firms taking foreign currency out of the country for projects with investments of over $100 million. It has backed the state energy firm YPF (YPFD.BA) to create a lithium battery plant and is pushing a bill to lower taxes on electric cars.
""We will focus on areas and fuels of the future, that generate zero polluting emissions, which are basically hydrogen and lithium batteries,"" Production Minister Matias Kulfas said in a recent meeting with reporters in Buenos Aires.
A source at the central bank, which is keen to rebuild battered foreign currency reserves, said that the country had seen growing investor interest in mining, including in lithium.
Australia's Orocobre Ltd (ORE.AX) and U.S. miner Livent Corp (LTHM.N), which have supply tie-ups with Toyota Corp (7203.T) and BMW (BMWG.DE) respectively, operate the two producing lithium projects in Argentina out of a total of over 60 proposed projects in various stages of development.
Others in the country include Australia's Argosy Minerals (AGY.AX), Lake Resources (LKE.AX) and Greenwing Resources (GW1.AX), as well as South Korea's Posco (005490.KS) and Neo Lithium Corp (NLC.V), backed by China's CATL (300750.SZ).
China's Ganfeng Lithium Co Ltd (002460.SZ) is in a bidding war to buy Argentina-focused Millennial Lithium Corp (ML.V) after an unnamed battery maker made a rival bid to its $280 million offer. 
Ganfeng and Lithium Americas (LAC.TO) are aiming to produce some 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent from the Cauchari-Olaroz mine, with production set to start in 2022.
'UNSTABLE MACROECONOMY'
Doubts, however, remain about whether Argentina can rev up its lithium output in the way it has promised. Half a decade ago, under a business-friendly government, the country expressed ambitions to overtake larger producer Chile but failed to do so.
""Argentina has the resources, but in order to transform them into reserves and making projects... a series of clear and stable rules is needed,"" said Buenos Aires-based Natacha Izquierdo, an analyst at consultancy Abeceb.
Alejandro Moro, general manager of Rincon Lithium, an Australian firm that owns a concession on the Rincon salt flats in Salta, agreed there remained hurdles to attracting capital.
""This a country with a quite unstable macroeconomy, with a high degree of taxes that are imposed on the capital that comes to invest,"" he said.
The firm is running a pilot plant on the flats, almost 4,000 meters (13,100 ft) above sea level. It pumps brine through pipes 30 meters below the ground, which is then refined to produce lithium carbonate. Rincon hopes to extract 50,000 tonnes a year by 2025.
Despite his reservations, however, Moro said he had become more optimistic about Argentina's support for mining investments after meeting with senior officials a few weeks earlier.
Argentina, an agricultural powerhouse with abundant oilseeds, has for years focused energy subsidies on biofuels, but officials are now signaling a shift in priorities towards electric vehicles - and lithium.
""Definitely, lithium is going to replace biofuels,"" Moro said.",3
1757,"THE MOB that rampaged through the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 6th would acknowledge little in common with the pro-democracy activists who invaded Hong Kong’s Legislative Council (LegCo) in July 2019. They were trying to overturn a free and fair democratic election—which was precisely what the Hong Kong protesters wanted to be granted. But the two sets of malcontents were similar in at least one way, which they shared with most of the protest movements that swept the world in 2019 and early 2020: they relied heavily on digital media for organisation, publicity and communication; and that reliance has made them easier to trace as the authorities seek retribution.
From demonstrations against police brutality in Nigeria to anti-mask activism in America, protests around the world have had different catalysts and ambitions, fallen on different sides of the political spectrum and occurred under wildly differing forms of government. But they have often been leaderless, horizontally structured and heavily reliant on digital media. In many places, though, they share another similarity: they are struggling to sustain momentum as coronavirus restrictions continue to constrain activism and as incumbent governments get better at countering the 21st-century digital tools used by protesters.

The internet and, in particular, social media have opened new vistas for protesters and have transformed street activism. An adage of Bruce Lee, a martial-arts star—“Be formless, shapeless, like water”—defined young Hong Kong protesters’ tactics in 2019. They eschewed the immobile sit-ins of the past for fluid, nimble-footed provocations, communicating on encrypted apps such as Telegram. They confounded authorities with their flash-mob tactics, rapidly mobilising in thousands to shut down the city airport or sing their anthem in shopping malls. Extinction Rebellion, an environmental movement, embraced similar techniques to bring British cities to a halt during their climate protests.
These movements, though typically dominated by the young, have been multi-generational, multi-class and multi-ethnic. Most lacked obvious leaders (or are, as many prefer it, “leaderful”). Rather than following a charismatic figurehead, they have united around icons as diverse and bizarre as milk tea; a rubber duck; and a “pussy” hat (a pink design, with cats’ ears, inspired by notorious recorded remarks by President Donald Trump). This has enabled them to survive despite the arrest of prominent campaigners. Wong Yik-mo, of Hong Kong’s Civil Human Rights Front, currently in exile in Taiwan, says that if China arrests 1,000 “leaders”, “another 1,000 will emerge to take their place”. The Hong Kong authorities, who, also on January 6th, rounded up dozens of pro-democracy activists for their involvement in an unofficial virtual “primary election” last year, seem ready to test the hypothesis.
Digital dexterity also provided protesters with a degree of protection. Warnings can be pinged instantly to thousands. In Hong Kong, HKmap.live tracked the real-time movement of police, vehicles and tear-gas through crowdsourced data (though, under pressure from the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, Apple removed the app). This matters: consequences can be dire. Protesters have been tortured in Belarus and shot in Nigeria, Chile, Iraq, Egypt, and elsewhere.
In 2020 the global wave of protests crashed into two big barriers. One was covid-19. Social-distancing measures helped governments squash the huge street demonstrations of 2019. Some movements persisted and some—in Belarus, for example—were launched. Activists devised novel, creative ways to continue campaigning, such as doing so on the multiplayer Nintendo game “Animal Crossing” or waging “editing wars” on Wikipedia. Yet most activists agree that online campaigns are not enough to bring change.
The second barrier is more enduring and more fundamental: the concerted resistance of many of the targets of protest—often using the activists’ own tools, and deploying them with ever-increasing sophistication. As Piyanut Kotsan, director of Amnesty International Thailand, comments: “Both sides are using social media. Facebook pages, press meetings, even Telegram, can be compromised by the government.” In Hong Kong, as in Thailand, protesters were arrested before actions started—clear evidence, says Mr Wong, that online-messaging groups were infiltrated by “spies”.
During the protests, China allegedly tried to create splits between non-violent and radical elements, pumping out huge amounts of propaganda in an attempt to tar protesters as rioters or stooges of foreign powers. In August 2019 Facebook and Twitter blocked hundreds of accounts they said were connected to China’s state-backed misinformation campaigns. In this, China is not an outlier. In an inventory it compiles annually, the Oxford Internet Institute, a department of Oxford University, found the number of countries with organised misinformation campaigns had risen to 81 in 2020, up from 28 three years ago. Social media can also be used to trace activists. In Egypt, for example, after a flurry of small anti-government protests in September the government blocked social-media platforms and arrested hundreds for their activity online.
Curbing online access is a common tactic. In Belarus mobile signal was cut off for a few days amid the widespread protests after the presidential election in August; in India, Iran and Egypt, internet access was severed during demonstrations in 2019. Like protesters, “authoritarian regimes learn from each other and duplicate each other's tool kits,” says Philip Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute. “In last year’s inventory, we found the first evidence of training sessions…Learning how to rent tens of thousands of fake users from a troll farm, then how to use those trolls to go after a particular target.” Demonstrators have in turn found innovative ways to stay connected despite internet and app shutdowns, turning to offline applications that use Bluetooth like Bridgefy and Firechat, or even organising through Tinder, a dating app, or “Pokemon Go”, a game.
Twenty-first-century protesters may be technologically adept and globally connected, and therefore hard to repress, yet governments, too, are increasingly run by digital natives; and they have resources and manpower the embattled protesters do not. As Hong Kong has just shown, when their opponents use digital media in ways they find threatening, such as holding an election, they can simply criminalise the activity. In many places, neither side looks ready to back down. But the contestants do not seem evenly matched.",2
1758,"IN 1892 A captivating Scottish preacher arrived in Chicago. John Alexander Dowie’s church, known as the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in Zion, proved popular. By 1900 Dowie had enough money to set up a dedicated community, known as Zion City, on the shore of Lake Michigan.
Dowie wanted missionaries to go forth across the world. In most places they failed to find many converts but Zionism did take off in another newly seething metropolis: Johannesburg. In “The People’s Zion”, a book published in 2018, Joel Cabrita of Stanford University offers several explanations, such as its appeal to the poor, its disavowal of racial and ethnic differences, and its use of faith healing at a time of scepticism towards mainstream medicine. It also helped that black mine workers spread the gospel on visits home to rural areas.

Today Zionism is the largest religious movement in southern Africa. There are an estimated 15m followers in the region, versus just a few hundred heirs of the Illinois church in America. On Sundays in Johannesburg parks athleisure-clad suburbanites jog past prophets in white robes leading small groups of Zionists in the siguco, a rhythmic prayer circle, the sound of hymn-singing floating over jacaranda trees.
Its ability to reform, as well as its egalitarianism and cosmopolitanism, is the reason for Zionism’s endurance, notes Ms Cabrita. A lack of hierarchy and doctrine made it easier, for instance, to blend Christian teachings with African traditions like ancestor worship. “We wanted Christianity but we didn’t want it to take away who we are,” explains Siphiso Dlamini, one of the 30-40% of Swazis who are Zionist.
Some American evangelicals are, however, concerned about the happy syncretism of their long-lost religious cousins. Behind a tyre shop in Manzini is Zion Bible College, run by Brett Miller, who moved from Wyoming to the commercial capital of Eswatini in 2014. The missionary-funded college wants to encourage Swazis to embrace Biblical literalism and denounce practices such as witchcraft and convening with dead relatives. “We are unpopular in some quarters,” Mr Miller admits, recalling times when he has been chased out of villages by traditional healers.
But the biggest challenge to Zionism is from Pentecostalism, perhaps the fastest-growing religion in southern Africa. Though it shares many characteristics with Zionism, its extra razzmatazz and its promises of prosperity have huge appeal. In response, some Zionists are changing their ways by playing amplified music and ditching the reference to Zion in their church names, lest the brand appear tired. In a bustling religious marketplace it can be hard to keep up, concedes Dumisani Dlamini, a Zionist radio presenter in Eswatini. “We say that you are not promised prosperity; we teach suffering.”",2
1759,"ONLY OTTO VON BISMARCK and Helmut Kohl served longer as Germany’s chancellor than Angela Merkel has. Bismarck forged an empire, and invented Europe’s first public-pension and health-care systems along the way. Kohl oversaw the reunification of East and West Germany and agreed to the replacement of the beloved Deutschmark with the euro.
Mrs Merkel’s achievements are more modest. In her 16 years in the chancellery she has weathered a string of crises, from economic to pandemic. Her abilities as a consensus-forger have served her country and Europe well. But her government has neglected too much, nationally and internationally. Germany has got away with it, for now; the country is prosperous and stable. Yet trouble is brewing. And as Mrs Merkel prepares to leave office when a new government forms after an election this weekend, admiration for her steady leadership should be mixed with frustration at the complacency she has bred.

The list of neglected issues is long (see our Special report). Germany looks like a purring luxury car; pop the bonnet, though, and the signs of neglect are plain to see. The public sector has failed to invest adequately or wisely, falling behind its peers in building infrastructure, especially the digital sort. This hampers not just whizzy new tech firms, but every other company, too. It also makes government less effective, a problem exacerbated by a failure to hire enough staff. Penny-pinching is hard-wired into the state. In 2009, on Mrs Merkel’s watch, Germany hobbled itself with a constitutional amendment that makes it illegal to run more than a minute deficit. With interest rates so low, sensible governments ought to have been borrowing for investment, not fainting at the first spot of red ink.
Germany’s most severe domestic problem is a failure to reform its pension system. Germans are ageing fast, and the baby-boomers will place an even heavier burden on the budget later this decade as they retire. On climate change, Germany has also been sluggish, and still emits more carbon per head than any other big EU country, not helped by Mrs Merkel’s shutdown of Germany’s nuclear industry after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.

In Europe, where German influence matters most, Mrs Merkel’s reluctance to wield it has been especially disappointing. The EU has not grappled sufficiently with the weakness of its indebted southern members. Only during the pandemic did it create a financial instrument that lets the EU issue jointly guaranteed debt, and dispense some of the cash as grants, rather than yet more loans. But this was designed as a one-off. Worse, the “stability” rules that will force countries back into austerity to shrink their stocks of debt are ready to revive, unless amended. Germany, always the most powerful voice at the EU table, should have argued harder for a more sensible approach.
In EU foreign policy, Germany could and should have been doing more to force a quicker adjustment to a less comfortable new world. China is an increasingly challenging economic and strategic rival, Russia an unpredictable threat and America a distracted and uncertain ally. Yet Germany has dithered. Despite recent increases, it spends too little on defence. It cosies up to Beijing in the hope of better trading terms. It is giving Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, a chokehold over European energy supplies by backing the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline which, as it happens, makes landfall in Mrs Merkel’s own constituency. It has fallen to others, principally France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to make the case for Europe to do more.
Which German candidate, though, could do better than Mrs Merkel? The polls suggest that Germany is set for a messy new parliament, with no single party, or even two, able to form a government. Instead, some sort of ideologically incoherent three-way coalition is on the cards—one that, by combining high-spending greens and pro-business liberals, may struggle to agree on anything ambitious.
This is another symptom of Merkelian complacency. Comfortable, cautious Germans seem uninterested in serious debate about the future. Crisis-management has become a substitute for initiative. Candidates have no incentive to highlight their country’s looming problems. The result has been one of the least substantive campaigns for decades: all about the horse-race and not about the issues.

Of the possible outcomes, two seem most likely. One is a coalition headed by Mrs Merkel’s party, the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister-party (the CDU/CSU), led by Armin Laschet. The other is a coalition led by Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), who is Germany’s finance minister. In either case, the coalition would be joined by the Greens and by the pro-business Free Democrats. Both outcomes will have serious shortcomings, but of the two, The Economist narrowly prefers the second: a “traffic-light” coalition, headed by Mr Scholz.
That is because the CDU/CSU, frankly, has blown it. Sixteen years in power has been enough. The party has run out of ideas and drive, as its decision to choose the gaffe-prone and uninspiring Mr Laschet for chancellor makes clear. An affable lightweight, he has run a dismal campaign, and is predicted to lead his team to its worst result since the second world war. The polls say that Mr Scholz is preferred by twice as many voters.
The tug from the left
Are they right, though? There are reasons to hope so, but also plenty to fear. Mr Scholz has been an effective finance minister. The German people trust him. He is better placed than a CDU chancellor would be to work with the Greens on climate change. The problem is that although he belongs to the business-friendly wing of his party, the SPD is stuffed with left-wingers. They may try to drag him further in their direction than the Free Democrats will wear and enterprise can comfortably bear.
The world should expect the coalition talks to last for months, poleaxing European politics while they drag on. And at the end of it all, Germany may well end up with a government that fails to get much done. That is the mess Mrs Merkel has left behind. ■

1760,"“KEEP YOUR eye on one thing and one thing only: how much government is spending,” Milton Friedman once said. Today his eyes would be popping. Governments have spent $17trn on the pandemic, including loans and guarantees, for a combined total of 16% of global GDP. On current forecasts, government spending will be greater as a share of GDP in 2026 than it was in 2006 in every major advanced economy. America is about to put $1.8trn into expanding its welfare state; Europe is doling out a €750bn ($850bn) investment fund; and Japan is promising a “new capitalism”, with even more government largesse.
In the coming decades the state’s economic footprint will expand yet further. Four-fifths of the world economy is now subject to a net-zero emissions target, a goal that in Britain is projected to raise the government-debt-to-GDP ratio by 21 percentage points by 2050 as the state subsidises decarbonisation and growth slows. And many countries have ageing populations that will demand vastly more spending on health care and pensions.

It would be easy for classical liberals such as this newspaper to despair at government’s relentless march. As the state has grown during the pandemic, its failures have been on full display. Early in the crisis America’s public-health authorities hindered private labs developing their own tests for the virus; this year they took until October to approve rapid tests that could have been available before the summer. For months Europe’s vaccine roll-out was too slow. China once celebrated its response to the virus as a victory for a strong-state model. Now its zero-covid strategy exemplifies the inflexibility of unchecked centralised power. One of the scandals in which British politics is mired is over whether its leaders took advantage of the crisis to award lucrative contracts to their pals.
The long-term threat of a big state is that such bureaucracy, institutional failure and corruption become routine and widespread, making people poorer and limiting individual freedom. But these dangers are mixed with an opportunity. To understand how, consider why government grows.
As our Briefing this week explains, the state almost always expands relative to GDP over time. Three forces are at work. The first is obviously malign. Inertia and mission creep make government hard to pare back. Voters and lobbyists who benefit from a regulation or item of spending have every reason to work hard at preserving it, whereas the many taxpayers who pay for pork barrels have better things to do than petition politicians to get rid of them. The bureaucrats in charge want to defend their turf and careers. When a programme fails, its supporters say it could still succeed if only it were given more money.
The second force is a fact of life. Prices of the services welfare states provide, such as health care and education, grow faster than the economy because of their high labour intensity and low rates of productivity increase. Though government inefficiency can make things worse, this “cost disease” afflicts the private and public sectors alike. It comes with the territory.
The third force is that governments today have more things to get done. As voters became richer over the 20th century they demanded more education and more of the expensive health care that takes advantage of the latest science. Today, as they age, they want to keep up spending on the elderly. And, increasingly, they want governments to do something about climate change.
These three forces are plain to see in the true impact of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the anti-government free-marketeers who loom largest in the public imagination. They are often said to have laid the groundwork for the “neoliberal era”. In fact, they did not leave a sustained legacy of smaller government. In 2019 America’s federal government spent a higher share of its GDP than in any of the ten years preceding Reagan’s presidency. Three decades after Thatcher left office—one of those decades being defined by austerity—Britain’s Conservative government will soon preside over the highest sustained spending as a share of the economy since the pre-Thatcher era.
The lasting victory of Reagan and Thatcher—and other reformers in Sweden, New Zealand and elsewhere—was over the first of the forces for big government. They realised that the state is at its worst when it is swollen by the distorted incentives of insiders to seek ever more control. Governments rightly sold off nationalised firms, cut back regulations, simplified some taxes and promoted competition. A consensus emerged about the limited role of government in liberal societies. Its adherents welcomed markets in most of the economy, but permitted redistribution and spending on public services to make the world fairer.
Today this consensus is under threat just when it is needed most. As ageing and climate change irresistibly increase government’s size, it is vital to recognise what the state can and cannot do well—and to avoid Leviathan wielding its might to the benefit of insiders and cronies. The argument for limited government should today be about the nature of the state’s interventions, not whether limiting global warming or providing for the elderly are necessary.
One task is to maximise the role of markets and individual choice. Climate change should be fought with a price for carbon, research-and-development subsidies and highly scrutinised public investments, not by rationing flights, promoting green national champions or enlisting central banks to distort financial markets. The welfare state should focus on redistributing cash and letting those in need choose what to do with it, not setting up new bureaucracies such as President Joe Biden’s proposed federal child-care system. Taxes should be broad-based and friendly to investment.
The supersized state
The state must also seek to be nimble and efficient. Income support for households should be automated where possible as the financial sector becomes more digitised. Much form-filling can be eliminated, as Estonia’s war on paperwork has shown. If there were fewer, better-paid bureaucrats, the public sector could attract more talented staff. And politicians should be willing to start afresh when tackling new problems, rather than relying on lacklustre incumbent departments. The biggest successes of governments during the pandemic have come from internal startups like Operation Warp Speed, which helped bring about America’s development of vaccines.
The state should strive to be impartial. Narrow interests, whether the unions and anointed victim groups favoured by the left, or the right’s chums in business, will always seek to capture it. To resist, bureaucrats do not need relentless cynical, self-serving attacks on their integrity from politicians, but transparency and support for the ethos of public service. Though rising total spending on the old is justified, a full-scale gerontocracy is not. Retirees with deep pockets do not need public handouts. On the contrary, they should bear a heavier burden as taxes shift from wages, towards property, inheritance and consumption.
The prize is enormous. The difference between good government and bad will be measured not just in the rapid transition to net zero and the provision of a sustainable safety-net for the old, but in societies that are fairer and a lot more prosperous. In the 20th century classical liberals ensured that the growth of government accompanied the progress of humanity. The same might yet be true in the 21st. ■

1761," (CNN)Dr. Umair Shah remembers the last mass vaccination campaign the US waged.  It was in 2009, when the H1N1 ""swine"" flu broke out in April, right at the end of the regular flu season. ""That was very challenging,"" Shah, who heads the Harris County, Texas, health department, told CNN. ""There were a lot of moving pieces. It took several weeks to months to not just organize but to implement and to do safely and effectively. And that was a mild pandemic."" This is not a mild pandemic. And while vaccine manufacturers, public health experts and the federal government are all confident one or more of the coronavirus vaccines being tested now will be shown to work safely by the end of the year, the US and the world will still be a long way from ending the pandemic. ""I feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this calendar year, as we get into early 2021,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, who, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is helping lead the medical battle against the virus, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual,"" Fauci added. ""Having"" a vaccine does not mean having a vaccine approved, distributed and into the arms of more than 300 million Americans.First, any vaccine must either be approved or authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. That's a process that under normal circumstances can take months or years. While the FDA has promised a speedier process for a Covid-19 vaccine, it must still go through a committee known as the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBAC. The FDA will almost certainly allow a shortcut process known as emergency use authorization, or EUA, but the agency has said it will require an ""EUA-plus"" that adds at least some layers of scrutiny. ""It's unlikely that a Covid-19 vaccine will receive full approval and broad distribution right away. Instead, the FDA will probably authorize vaccines for use in targeted groups of people at high risk from Covid and most likely to benefit from the vaccine,"" Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, both former FDA commissioners, wrote in a commentary in the Wall Street Journal Monday. ""All this means that at least initially, Covid vaccines won't provide the sort of herd immunity that can help extinguish an epidemic.""  That will take time -- likely well into next year, even if a vaccine were to be authorized in January, most experts who spoke to CNN predicted. ""People can't be lulled into a false sense of security by knowing the vaccine is coming,"" Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, told CNN. Although manufacturers are already making vaccine doses, it takes time. And the US will likely need more than 600 million doses of vaccine -- enough for everyone to get two doses of the vaccine. A new vaccine, and a plan for getting it out""Let's say ... at the end of the year, there will be millions and tens of millions of doses available,"" Fauci said in the CNN interview Friday.   ""It won't be until we get into 2021 that you'll have hundreds of millions of doses, and just the logistics constraints in vaccinating large numbers of people -- it's going to take months to get enough people vaccinated to have an umbrella of immunity over the community."" The US just is not ready for a mass vaccination campaign like the one needed to bring coronavirus under control, public health experts agreed. ""I don't think it's going to be seamless,"" said Plescia. The biggest mass vaccination program the US undertakes every year is the annual influenza vaccine. Only about half of Americans get a flu vaccine, and manufacturers make and distribute fewer than 150 million doses of it. Yet it takes a full year from start to finish to formulate, make and distribute flu vaccines every influenza season.  ""We start planning for flu vaccines in January or February,"" Michael Einhorn, the president of Dealmed, an independent medical supply distributor covering New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Flu vaccines generally become available in August -- seven to eight months later. And that's with a vaccine made using familiar technology, and dispensed in ways that people are familiar with -- in pediatricians' offices, at pharmacies, in grocery stores and at clinics.  ""You have a playbook for influenza,"" Shah said. ""This is not the same."" Any coronavirus vaccines will involve new technology and a whole new process for distribution, administration and then for payment. And while anyone can walk into, say, a pharmacy, get a flu shot and leave without ever thinking about it again, coronavirus vaccines will involve a whole lot more trouble and paperwork. People will probably need at least two doses about a month apart. Someone will have to track and follow up on that. ""We have to be able to see who has been vaccinated and who has not been,"" Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, told a public hearing about vaccine distribution organized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Paperwork and red tape ""To have two doses means that you provide the initial dose and we will need to bring the person back for a second dose a month later,"" Dr. Jinlene Chan, acting deputy secretary of public health for the state of Maryland, told CNN. And it's very likely that vaccines made by several different companies will be in use by next year. ""We have to make sure that we give the person the same vaccine for their second dose that they got for their first dose,"" Chan said. No vaccination program can start until there are plans in place to manage this. Plus, the coronavirus vaccine or vaccines will still be experimental, so every person who gets one will need to be tracked to make sure there are no adverse reactions. There is no plan yet for any of this. ""We have gotten very little information on how this is going to roll out,"" said Harris County's Shah. ""That makes it even more difficult to plan.""  One big potential stumbling block is what's known as the cold chain. The two vaccines furthest along in development both must be kept frozen. Moderna's vaccine must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius), while Pfizer's must be kept at -94 F (-70 C). While -4 isn't much colder than the optimal home freezer's setting of 0 degrees F, -94 is more of a challenge. ""Throughout -- from every single point the vaccine has to traverse -- we have to maintain it at that temperature. Otherwise, there is a risk of some degradation and the vaccine possibly becoming less effective,"" Chan said. ""We need to make sure that there is some capability to store it appropriately until it is ready to use."" Otherwise, a thawed batch could mean hundreds or even thousands of people get a dud vaccine. This can be a challenge, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a vaccine expert at Emory University. ""We simply don't have freezers that can reach minus 70 degrees in most clinics,"" he told the National Academies meeting. To reach enough people, any mass vaccination effort will have to go beyond clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. ""You are going to have to get out to communities. You are going to have to get out to places of work,"" Del Rio said. That makes keeping the vaccines cold enough more of a challenge. Plescia said Pfizer has a plan to help keep its vaccine cold. ""Pfizer is going to have special boxes they ship the vaccines in, packed with dry ice,"" he said. ""Once you get the box, it'll keep the stuff at negative 80 degrees for 10 days."" But it's not clear, Plescia said, if the boxes could be opened and a few doses of vaccine taken out safely. ""Even if these boxes work very well, it is still going to add a whole level of challenge,"" he said. Taking the mass out of mass vaccinationPast mass vaccination efforts have been just that -- mass. But coronavirus is a respiratory disease, and the last thing anyone should be doing is lining people up or packing them into, say, school gyms to get vaccinated, Chan noted. ""With mass vaccination clinics, it involves bringing large groups of people into a site and vaccinating as many people as possible,"" Chan said. ""How do we do that in a way that reduces the risk of transmitting the very disease that we trying to vaccinate against?""  Illinois' Ezike said some of the experience with test sites may help. ""We had these strike teams,"" she said. ""We have been able to convert a lot of different sites into sites where people can drive up. Can you do a vaccination through the [car] window?"" she asked.  But to accommodate that, cities and states will have to get busy soon. ""We are going to need additional providers,"" she told the NASEM meeting. ""We need mass vaccination clinics and sites. So we really want to recruit lots and lots of essential partners,"" she added -- especially for the communities that are hardest hit by the pandemic, including meat-packing facilities and remote rural areas. That means changes in policies and legislation -- another potentially time-consuming process. Medical practice is legislated by states, not by the federal government. ""We know that we'll need some expanded scope of practice for different professional groups,"" she said. For instance, states may want to enable dentists, dental hygienists and even medical school students and veterinarians to vaccinate people. And that requires some other levels of legislation so that providers can get paid for their time. Changes to health insurance laws may be necessary, including billing codes that provide for a system under which people get vaccinated for no charge. Because rollout will not be immediate, people will be vaccinated in groups. The National Academies is considering this, as is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). They, along with private advocacy groups, have already released their own draft blueprints that in general put health care workers, first responders and the most vulnerable at the front of the line. But that's another layer of management for governments to take on. Many states have old and unwieldy systems for managing all of this, and Ezike said the needed upgrades may take time. Immunity takes time Adding to the timeline is simple biology. The Pfizer and Modern vaccines, at least, will have to be given in two doses, a month apart. After that, it takes about two weeks for immunity to build. That makes for six weeks from the time someone first gets vaccinated to when they can feel safe from infection.  On top of all of this, many Americans are fearful of vaccines -- especially a new one and especially a new vaccine rolled out in a time of intense politicization of the process. ""There's general vaccination mistrust and then there's government mistrust,"" Ezike noted. The current atmosphere over mask use has not helped, added Harris County's Shah. ""We have made it a political fight,"" he said. ""When you make it political in nature, not driven by health and medical considerations, ultimately people will take sides."" Unless a majority of the population gets vaccinated, the virus will continue its spread. Most estimates suggest that 60% to 70% of the population must be immune to provide enough herd immunity to interrupt the spread of the virus. Polls indicate that only about half of Americans feel confident right now about being vaccinated.  And if vaccines are less than fully effective, that may mean even more of the population needs to be vaccinated to have an effect on spread. Then there are the unknowns. ""Testing has not been seamless at all. There are going to be some glitches,"" Plescia said. ""I think there is a good chance there is going to be a vaccine that works and gets us out of this, but it is hard to believe that it is going to go really smoothly, given all the things that could happen."" Shah is ready for unpleasant surprises. ""This is a super slick virus that has broken every rule in the book,"" he said.",0
1762,"IN 1867 AN English missionary, James Hudson Taylor, wrote a letter home defending his policy of encouraging fellow preachers in China to wear Chinese robes and the Manchu-style pigtail. By dressing in Western garb, he argued, they risked giving the impression that becoming a Christian meant becoming a foreigner. Taylor’s concern was justified. Such was the scorn for those who embraced the faith that, long before the Communist Party seized power in 1949, people used to say, “One more Christian, one fewer Chinese.” Officials in China still mutter this phrase today.
In the 1950s the party began cutting Chinese Christianity’s links with foreign churches and requiring believers to worship only in government-authorised venues. Eventually all religious activity was banned and brutally crushed. A few years after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, restrictions were partially relaxed. This led to an explosion of Christian worship, much of it in small “house churches” with no official links. Protestantism grew especially fast, as did its foreign connections. Foreign missionaries, often working as teachers, poured back in. Now, in an effort to reassert control, China is trying once again to “sinify” Christianity. It will prove tougher than in Mao’s day.

All religions in China are being targeted by the sinification campaign, which was launched in 2015 by the country’s leader, Xi Jinping. Among ethnic minorities in the western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, these efforts have formed part of a broader assault on cultural and religious identity. More than 1m of Xinjiang’s Muslims, most of them ethnic Uyghurs, have been sent to camps for “deradicalisation”, which has included warning them of the dangers of foreign influence over Islam. There are 11m Uyghurs and 7m, mostly Buddhist, Tibetans. But there are far more Christians—between 60m and 80m. More than three-quarters of them are Protestants, of whom about half attend house churches. The party is acutely aware of the role that Christians have played in anti-Communist movements in other countries.
In 2018 and 2019 the government published five-year plans for sinifying each of the country’s five officially recognised faiths: Buddhism, Islam, Taoism and Christianity, which China treats as two separate religions: Protestantism and Catholicism. The Protestant plan reads in parts like one that Taylor would have liked. It encourages churches to use Chinese architecture and Chinese tunes for hymns, as well as Chinese-style painting, calligraphy and other “popular cultural forms”.
But the document has a tough message, too. It does not mention house churches specifically, but demands adherence to the country’s newly revised regulations on religion, which took effect in early 2018. These impose tougher fines on the unauthorised use of premises for religious purposes, require official permission for religious training abroad and prohibit any control of churches by “external forces”. Without naming him, the plan condemns the “confusing and poisonous” views of a late missionary, Jonathan Chao, who supported China’s house churches from bases outside the country.
Even for many of those who attend official churches, the five-year plan’s emphasis on the need to integrate Christian theology with socialist ideology is grating. It says quotations should be used by preachers to promote “core socialist values”. These principles should feature more prominently in their training. Interpretations of the Bible should become more sinified—meaning, presumably, that they should help to bolster belief in socialism.
With Catholics, China may feel that it has made progress. In 2018 the party reached an agreement with the Vatican that gave both sides a say in the appointment of bishops. The accord means, in effect, that no party-rejecting Catholic can become a bishop in China—a victory, as the party must see it, for sinification.
The deal with the Vatican took years to reach. The party may find that bringing Protestants under its wing is much trickier. In state-approved churches it has been easy enough to impose an appearance of Chineseness through the display of national flags and portraits of Mr Xi. But many pastors have dragged their feet. One says he avoided having to put a photo of Mr Xi next to the cross in his church by arguing that to do so would invite comparisons between China’s leader and the criminal who was crucified alongside Jesus.
House churches are an even bigger problem for the party. Since 2018 officials have been stepping up pressure on them. In 2019 a court in the south-western city of Chengdu sentenced one of China’s most outspoken house-church pastors, Wang Yi, to nine years in jail. He had tried to set up a “Reformed Presbytery of Western China” by uniting churches from various provinces. From the pulpit, he had called Mr Xi a “sinner” for persecuting the church.
Some of the bigger house churches, however, have split into smaller groups and continue to worship without official approval (mostly online during the pandemic). So far the authorities have not responded with mass arrests as they once did, up until the 1990s. But the government may lose patience, especially if, despite all its hostile signalling towards house-church Christians, their numbers continue to grow rapidly. Christians’ faith “gives them purpose, it gives them ethical standards, it gives migrants a family away from home. What can the party do about that?” asks Easten Law of Princeton Theological Seminary. A house-church pastor says the party risks alienating young, white-collar Christians, turning those “who are not its enemy into its enemy”.
For now, social media remain awash with Christian material. There are numerous Bible-study groups on WeChat, a popular social-media platform. Many churches also use WeChat forums. Unauthorised seminaries and missionary-training schools still operate (the pandemic has prompted them, too, to move online). At many house churches, online congregations are 50% bigger than meetings were when held in person, says a pastor.
The five-year plan states that “the historical lesson from the repeated setbacks to Christianity’s spread in China fundamentally relates to its failure to overcome its foreignness”. The faith’s recent growth, however, suggests that foreignness is not a problem. In many ways, sinification in the cultural sense has already happened. “We are Christian and we are also proudly Chinese,” says the pastor. The party’s attempt to sinify Christians politically as well may squeeze the church but will not crush it, he says. “We will go on giving to Caesar what is Caesar’s. And we will go on giving to God what is God’s.” ■",2
1763,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure and social spending legislation will not add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, economists and analysts in leading rating agencies told Reuters on Tuesday.
Biden has spent the past few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation - the $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better"" plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure plan.  read more 
The two pieces of legislation ""should not have any real material impact on inflation"", William Foster, vice president and senior credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters.
The impact of the spending packages on the fiscal deficit will be rather small because they will be spread over a relatively long time horizon, Foster added.
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, has previously raised inflationary concerns in relation to Biden's social spending plan, with a report earlier this month suggesting he may delay the passage of the Build Back Better legislation.  read more 
""The bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which operates independently from the parent company's ratings business.
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastructure and social spending legislation were sustainable.
""The bills are largely paid for through higher taxes on multinational corporations and well-to-do households, and more than paid for if the benefit of the added growth and the resulting impact on the government's fiscal situation are considered"", he said in an interview.
Charles Seville, senior director and Americas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, said the two pieces of legislation ""will neither boost nor quell inflation much in the short-run.""
Government spending will still add less to demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the longer-run, the social spending legislation could increase labor supply through provisions such as childcare, and productivity, Seville told Reuters.
The House of Representatives passed the $1 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month after the Senate approved it in August. Biden signed the bill into law on Monday.
The Build Back Better package includes provisions on childcare and preschool, eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pricing and immigration.
""The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as pandemic relief spending drops out and the economic recovery boosts tax revenues"", Seville said. ""But the legislation (Build Back Better) does not sustainably fund all the initiatives, particularly if these are extended and don't sunset, meaning that they will be funded by greater borrowing.""
The Congressional Budget Office anticipates publishing a complete cost estimate for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected the Build Back Better legislation to be passed within a week's time.",3
1764,"EACH YEAR the United Nations puts out a carefully crafted state-of-the-world assessment from a humanitarian perspective. It considers how much help is needed to stave off disaster in the most vulnerable countries. According to its latest “Global Humanitarian Overview”, released on December 1st, the state of the world is stark.
A year ago the UN projected that 168m people would need assistance in 2020. For 2021 the number is 40% higher: a record 235m. That is almost as many people as there are in Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most-populous country. The UN says it will need $35bn to support the neediest 160m of these—about four in five of them in Africa and the Middle East—across 56 countries. Extreme poverty has risen for the first time in 22 years. Women and young people are the hardest-hit.

The main cause of the increase is covid-19—not the health effects of the virus itself but its toll on economies, with recession, food-price rises and a decline in remittances from abroad adding to the millions of people who are so poor they will not survive without help. The UN fears a near doubling of the number of people at risk of starvation. “Famine is back,” says Mark Lowcock, the UN’s humanitarian chief. Famines had seemed largely a thing of the past: the only significant one this century was in 2011-12 in Somalia, where about a quarter of  a million people died. Now Yemen, north-east Nigeria, Burkina Faso, South Sudan and half a dozen other countries are vulnerable. “If we get through 2021 without major famines, that will actually be quite a result,” believes Mr Lowcock.
The pandemic is also having a knock-on effect on health beyond the virus’s immediate toll. In vulnerable places it is causing a contraction in life-saving services such as immunisation, malaria prevention and neonatal care. The result, predicts Mr Lowcock, will be a reduction in life-expectancy—not as visible or concentrated as famine, but another unhappy reversal after decades of progress.
Vaccines offer hope in the fight against covid-19, yet rich countries are bound to roll them out fastest, paying too little heed to the amounts and most appropriate types available for the poorest places. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines need to be stored at very low temperatures. “Frankly, we don’t think anywhere where we work is going to be able to very quickly put in place cold-chain requirements,” says Mr Lowcock. He also cautions against a rush to channel efforts into covid at the expense of routine immunisation (against measles, say) with a higher life-saving impact in many poor and crisis-hit places.
The pandemic may be the biggest reason for the rise in humanitarian stress, but two longer-term factors are also pushing it up. One is global warming. Many of the countries most at risk from the effects of climate change already have big humanitarian problems (with extra risks in the coming months from the La Niña weather system). The other is conflict, which is spreading trouble in a growing number of places, including Western Sahara and the Sahel, Ethiopia and northern Mozambique as well as Nagorno-Karabakh. Syria, which looms large in the UN’s humanitarian efforts, has seen no peace: the UN expects an extra 1.9m people will need humanitarian assistance there. Overall, the number of people displaced within countries because of conflict and violence has reached a new high of 51m, and over the past decade the number of refugees crossing borders has doubled to 20m.
Will a cash-strapped world be willing to provide anything like the $35bn the UN says it needs for the coming year? The amount of humanitarian aid co-ordinated through the UN (about 70% of the global total) has been rising. The bad news is that the needs have been rising faster, so the funding gap has been growing, to $22bn (see chart).

America’s spending has been robust, and Germany’s has been increasing. But the Gulf countries have grown less generous, and last week Britain announced that it was slashing £4bn ($5.3bn) of its foreign aid, suspending its commitment to devote 0.7% of GDP to international development (it will now drop to 0.5%, though humanitarian spending within the total may be protected as far as possible). “A small budgetary saving for the UK will have large impacts for the world’s most vulnerable people,” laments Mr Lowcock, himself a former head of Britain’s Department for International Development.
If, as seems likely, the UN ends up far short of its $35bn target, it will have to channel the money it has towards alleviating the worst of the distress. The focus on emergency relief leaves little room for more lasting support. The result is more places on the verge of famine for longer: that is, a rising humanitarian caseload.
A few bits of brightness can be discerned. First, experiments in “anticipatory action”, where the UN acts early when key indicators suggest releasing funds can help prevent a deeper disaster, have shown encouraging results. This approach has been tried this year to pre-empt the impact of floods in Bangladesh and hunger in Somalia. Anticipatory action against cholera might be tried next. Donors seem keen to see more such interventions.
Second, adjustment to the pandemic has speeded up change in the humanitarian sphere, just as it has in other industries. Cash is being deployed more effectively. So is technology: artificial intelligence is being used to map outbreaks of disease, and drones deployed to deliver medical supplies and testing samples. Even the UN’s bureaucracy is pushing less paper, and its staff are travelling less manically. More important, the value of building up local organisations in the field has become even clearer, with the prospect of improved capacity to deliver relief in future. Local capacity-building was recognised as vital at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in 2016, but the pandemic  has given this a renewed sense of urgency, according to Dr Esperanza Martinez, head of health at the International Committee of the Red Cross: “Covid-19 is an accelerator,” she says, for example causing the ICRC to bring forward the building of surgical capacity from 2023 to 2021 in a project spanning Nigeria, South Sudan and the DRC.
Third, the incoming Biden administration could make a difference. It is likely to give greater weight to places President Donald Trump called “shithole countries”. One of Jake Sullivan’s first tweets after he was named as Mr Biden’s choice for national security adviser was about Ethiopia. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the nominee for UN ambassador, served as the top official for Africa under the Obama administration. Mr Biden plans to put America back into the Paris agreement and has signalled the priority he attaches to tackling climate change by naming John Kerry, a former secretary of state, as his climate envoy. 
But all these changes will take time to show results. In the meantime, 235m people are at risk in 2021. The bright spots are mere glimmers in the gloom.",2
1765,"AT ABOUT 54, the average age of retirement in China is among the lowest in the world. This is a problem. Since standards were set, life expectancy has soared while the number of working adults—those whose labour, in effect, supports retirees—has begun to shrink. But persuading people that they should work longer is proving hard. In 2008 the government said it was mulling the idea of raising retirement ages, but backed away amid a public outcry. Now it feels it can wait no longer.
The pressure to act is evident. Current retirement ages were set in the 1950s, when the average person was expected to die before reaching that stage. For most men in China the age is 60, much lower than the average of 64.2 in the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries. For female civil servants the age is 55; for blue-collar women it is 50.

Yet life expectancy in China is now just two years short of the OECD average of 79, so a Chinese retiree on a state pension usually needs several more years of support from government funds than his or her rich-world equivalent. In 2019 the public-pension system covered almost 1bn adults, more than any other such scheme in the world. The country’s main pension fund may run out of money by 2035, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, an official think-tank, has warned.
The government appears not yet to have decided how to reform the system. The current five-year economic plan, a 142-page document that was approved in March, contains merely a sentence on the topic, calling for adjustment in “small steps” and “flexible implementation”. But its inclusion means that changes are all but certain to begin before the plan expires in 2025: the government rarely announces a goal that may not be attainable.
Officials say retirement ages will be lifted in stages, a few months at a time. China’s main state-run news agency, Xinhua, said two possible approaches were being considered. One would raise the retirement age for both men and women to 65, with the age for women being raised faster so that both reach the end point simultaneously. The other method would involve first raising the retirement age for women to 60, and then both sexes advancing to 65 at the same pace.
Since the government revealed that the five-year plan would call for older Chinese to work longer, social media have reverberated with debate about the idea. On Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, posts tagged with “postpone the retirement age” have received 620m views and launched more than 100,000 discussions. Many comments have been critical, with some blaming the country’s draconian one-child-per-couple policy for exacerbating the population’s ageing. (The limit was increased to two children in 2016, and will soon be raised again, to three.) In 2020 a survey of 96,000 people by a newspaper in Wuhan found that more than 80% opposed later retirement. They wondered whether they would have the stamina to keep working into their 60s, and also whether—if not in a secure job already—they would still be employable. Firms often discriminate against older people when recruiting.
Concerns about the possible impact on social stability may explain why the government’s plans have kept slipping. In 2008 it hinted that reforms would begin in 2010. They didn’t. In 2015 a senior official said a detailed plan would be revealed in 2017. Again, no show. The government does not always pay much heed to public opinion when shaping policy: the one-child restriction was never popular. But in this case it may worry about angering a large number of people in urban areas where it is especially keen to prevent unrest (the one-child policy was most resented in the countryside). Most farmers carry on working until they are forced to stop by poor health: a rural pension scheme was introduced in 2009, but it provides far less support than urban residents enjoy.
Lifting the retirement age is a bit more popular among government employees. Of almost 170,000 respondents to a survey conducted in 2016 by China Youth Daily, an official newspaper, more than 80% said delaying retirement was more favourable to government employees (presumably because such people are considered less likely to be fired for becoming older and therefore, as is commonly imagined, less energetic). One civil servant told Xinhua his boss had doctored his own records to make his age appear younger. “This way, he holds onto power longer,” the bureaucrat said.
But young workers grumble about raising the age. They suspect they will have to wait longer for promotions as older workers occupy jobs for longer. Online, they use a common idiom to describe such seniors, accusing them of “squatting on the toilet without taking a shit”. In reality, lifting the retirement age will be harder on older workers who may struggle to retain their jobs when so many of their younger peers are far better educated. And concerns about job insecurity, especially as they get older, are pushing more young people to apply for jobs in the civil service.
Raising retirement ages may create another problem. China’s fertility rate (the average number of children a woman can expect to have in her lifetime) is among the world’s lowest. On May 31st the Communist Party said married couples would be allowed to have three children to help the country “cope” with its ageing. (In 2018 the share of people over 60 was almost one-fifth; by 2050 it will be more than one-third.) But many families rely on grandparents for child care. When parents retire, the probability that their child gives birth increases by between 44% and 61%, says a study by Fudan University. If grandparents have to work longer, the government will have to spend more on kindergartens and introduce rules to force employers to make better provisions for working parents. Grappling with China’s demographic woes will involve many tough reforms. ■

1766,"After years of complaints from investors that its sprawling empire of businesses was hindering profits, General Electric decided to split into three, independently run companies. Its health-care assets will be spun off in 2023; energy and power will be rolled into one and spun off in 2024; and aviation is to remain the sole focus of today’s GE. The conglomerate has been shedding businesses for over a decade. The decision to split heralds the end of arguably the world’s best-known conglomerate, a titan of American business throughout the 20th century.
On the road

Rivian, a maker of electric vehicles backed by Amazon, had a successful stockmarket debut on the Nasdaq. Its stock rose by 30% above the offer price, giving it a market capitalisation of over $100bn, more than either Ford or General Motors. The company raised around $12bn, making it the biggest IPO in America since Alibaba’s listing in 2014.
At the opposite end of the motoring business, Hertz’s share price fell by 10% on its first day on the stockmarket since the company emerged from bankruptcy.
The European Union’s General Court, the lower tribunal of the Court of Justice, dismissed Google’s appeal against the €2.4bn ($2.8bn) fine that the European Commission imposed on the company in 2017 for anti-competitive practices that favoured its own comparison-shopping service. In the one ray of light for Google, which is also appealing against two other blockbuster antitrust fines in Europe, the court said that general search is not included in its ruling.
Rolls-Royce said it had received enough investment from private partners to start building small modular reactors, or small nuclear power stations, in Britain. The government is contributing towards the project as part of its “green industrial revolution”.
Britain’s economic growth rate slowed in the third quarter, to 1.3%. As in other countries, supply-chain problems are hindering the recovery. GDP is still 2.1% smaller than in the final three months of 2019.
Oil prices climbed higher, with Brent crude once again over $85 a barrel. In America the price of petrol at the pump hit an average seven-year high of $3.41 a gallon. California remains the most expensive state in which to fill your car, with petrol averaging $4.64 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.
The price of fuel is a big factor behind America’s surging inflation. The annual rise in the government’s consumer-price index leapt to 6.2% in October, up from 5.4% in September, the largest jump since late 1990. Stubborn inflation is putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to bring forward an interest-rate rise.
Government relief
Meanwhile, the pace of hiring picked up in America, with employers creating 531,000 jobs in October. That is closer to the monthly average for this year and comes after two months of lower-than-expected jobs growth.
The board of Sydney Airport agreed to a A$23.6bn ($17.5bn) buy-out from a consortium of investors. The deal comes amid a sense in the aviation industry that business is really taking off following 20 months of pandemic gloom. America reopened its borders to most travellers this week. Emirates, one of the world’s biggest airlines, reported that passenger numbers were up by 319% from April 1st to September 30th, year on year, though it still made a net loss in the first six months of this year.
After a little over a year as a publicly listed company,  McAfee agreed to a buy-out from a consortium of private-equity firms, in a deal worth $14bn. The computing-security company is to refocus entirely on the consumer market, having sold its enterprise business in July.
Consumers’ voracious appetite for ordering grub from home is feeding a wave of consolidation in the sector. This week DoorDash, America’s largest food-delivery platform, agreed to buy Wolt, based in Helsinki and with operations in 23 countries, for €7bn ($8bn).
Viasat, a satellite company based in California, is to take over Inmarsat, a British rival that counts the American armed forces among its customers, in a $7.3bn transaction. The combined company will compete in the increasingly crowded space for providing satellite broadband.

Markets were once again left scratching their heads about the motives behind Elon Musk’s latest stunt, when he asked his Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla to pay tax, in a dig at a Democratic proposal to tax unrealised capital gains. They said yes. Tesla’s share price swooned. Mr Musk then started selling stock. He had planned to sell at least some of his shares before seeking advice from the Twitterati.",2
1767,"Oct 25 (Reuters) - Members of Sudan's cabinet and a large number of pro-government party leaders were arrested on Monday in an apparent coup after weeks of tension between the military and a civilian government, political sources said.
Here is some background to the events.
WHO IS IN CHARGE IN SUDAN?
Sudan began a transition to democracy after a popular uprising and the ouster in April 2019 of President Omar al-Bashir, an Islamist shunned by the West who had presided over the country for nearly three decades.
Under an August 2019 agreement, the military is sharing power with officials appointed by civilian political groups in a ruling body known as the Sovereign Council, meant to lead the country to elections by the end of 2023.
HAVE THERE BEEN TENSIONS BEFORE?
Although the military's role is supposed to be largely honorary, civilians have repeatedly complained of military overreach in foreign policy and peace negotiations.
The military has accused civilian parties of mismanagement and monopolising power. A coalition of rebel groups and political parties have aligned themselves with the armed forces and have sought to dissolve the civilian cabinet.
Authorities said in September they had foiled an attempted coup, accusing plotters loyal to Bashir.
WHAT ARE THE DISAGREEMENTS OVER?
One point of tension is the pursuit of justice over allegations of war crimes by the military and its allies in the conflict in Darfur from 2003. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking trials for Bashir and other Sudanese suspects. The cabinet has signed off on handing over suspects, but the Sovereign Council has not.
Another is an investigation into the killings of pro-democracy protesters on June 3, 2019, in which military forces are implicated. Activists and civilian groups have been angered by delays in making the investigation's findings public.
Civilians have also pushed for oversight and restructuring of the military, particularly through the integration of the powerful, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which military leaders have resisted.
WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY?
A worsening economic crisis that sent the currency plunging and created frequent shortages of bread and fuel was the trigger for Bashir's downfall.
The transitional government has implemented harsh, rapid reforms monitored by the International Monetary Fund in a successful bid for debt relief and to attract foreign financing.
In the wake of the reforms, inflation rose to historic highs of more than 400% and many Sudanese complain of struggling to get by. There have been occasional protests over economic conditions.
HOW ARE RELATIONS WITH THE NEIGHBOURS?
Sudan is in a volatile region, bordering the Red Sea, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa. Several of its neighbours, including Ethiopia, Chad and South Sudan have been affected by political upheavals and conflict.
Since late last year, conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region has pushed tens of thousands of refugees into eastern Sudan and caused military tensions in disputed agricultural lands along the border.
Sudan is pushing, with Egypt, for a binding deal over the operation of a giant hydropower dam that Ethiopia is building near the Sudanese border. Talks have stalled but Ethiopia has started filling the reservoir behind the dam, which Sudan says could put its citizens, dams and water facilities at risk.",3
1768,"CHINA’S TECHNOLOGY giants are having a torrid time. At home, a regulatory crackdown is intensifying. In the latest move, on August 17th the authorities released draft antitrust rules that would hurt the business models of titans like Alibaba and Tencent. In the West, meanwhile, governments want to make it harder for Chinese companies to do business in their countries and, in America’s case, to list shares. Some global asset managers are calling Chinese tech stocks “uninvestable”.
The firms are thus casting around for friendlier climes. Foreign markets account for a relatively small share of the Chinese groups’ sales. Tencent made around $5bn in revenues outside mainland China last year, less than 8% of the total. So little of Alibaba’s income is derived from abroad that the company doesn’t bother publishing a geographical breakdown. If it were to start, however, no place would feature more prominently than South-East Asia.

The region is home to nearly 700m people, fast-digitising economies and, crucially, no hardened geopolitical persuasion. Having taken an interest in South-East Asian online darlings such as Lazada (an e-commerce venture majority-owned by Alibaba) or Sea Group (in which Tencent holds a 23% stake), China’s giants are expanding more directly in the region. Last year Alibaba bought half of a 50-storey skyscraper in Singapore, the regional commercial hub. Tencent and ByteDance, the unlisted owner of TikTok, a hit short-video app, have also opened beachhead offices there and set out on local hiring sprees.
Cloud computing presents a particular opportunity. Although the cloud market’s total size in South-East Asia is still relatively small, at less than $2bn a year, it grew by more than 50% in 2020, and shows no signs of slowing. And the Chinese firms are winning an ever greater share of this ever larger pie, mostly from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the American e-commerce empire’s cloud division.
According to Gartner, a research firm, in 2020 Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei, a privately held telecoms colossus, had 22% of the cloud market in South-East Asia and the smaller Asia-Pacific economies, up from 18% in 2019. This year Tencent opened its first data centre in Indonesia and its second in Thailand. In June Alibaba said it would build its first in the Philippines.
Unlike AWS and its American cloud rivals, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure, Chinese firms are comfortable with the principle of data localisation. Many South-East Asian governments mandate that data about their citizens be processed and stored in their territory. Whereas Microsoft and AWS publish reports on the data requests made to them by governments and law-enforcement agencies, Chinese firms do not. This makes the Chinese services attractive to authorities unwilling to compromise on localised data. It also complicates embryonic efforts by America to negotiate a digital trade pact with Asian countries, which would almost certainly try to limit data localisation.
Even before it contributes a big slug of revenues, business activity in South-East Asia is a way to learn what works outside China, notes Tan Bin Ru, the regional boss of OneConnect Financial Technology, a subsidiary of Ping An, a huge Chinese insurer. The environment is both familiar (with millions of Chinese-speakers, who often dominate commerce) and diverse (with different legal jurisdictions and a wide range of income levels). Asian companies have used the region as a staging post to global conquest in the past, notably Toyota, which began its international expansion in Thailand in 1957. China’s giants would love to follow in its tyre tracks. ■

1769,"A FEW SUMMERS ago, scores of people packed into a Beirut concert hall for an evening of nostalgia. An Iraqi-born singer performed songs by Umm Kulthum, Egypt’s most famous diva. “The Lady” was an icon of Arab nationalism: a champion of the Palestinian cause and friend of Nasser, who often scheduled his speeches to follow her monthly concerts. On this evening the mostly Lebanese crowd was drawn from a mix of sects and classes. Some wept through “Enta Omri”, a love song that seems to speak to today: “Your eyes took me back to the days that used to be/they’ve taught me to regret the past, and its wounds…”
The evening felt like a nostalgic ode to a time when the region was more cosmopolitan and aspirational. That emotion is hardly unique to the Middle East, but today it is ubiquitous. Nationalists pine for a time when Arab states fought for a cause and stood up to foreign powers. Islamists look back further, to a time when the caliphates were global centres of learning and culture. Less political types reminisce about a past when the electricity was more stable.

The past decade has been one of disappointment. The axis of resistance has become a reactionary force. The Muslim Brotherhood’s slogan, “Islam is the solution”, turned out to be hollow: faith alone cannot solve socioeconomic problems. What seemed a zero-sum contest to reshape the Middle East has been fought to a draw, leaving much of the region miserable. “Some of those battles are not winnable in the short or long run,” acknowledges a diplomat from the Gulf. “We’re going to have to just make sure that we, at home, are in the safest possible position.”
Foreign powers will be less present, though they are not leaving the region altogether. Both Barack Obama and Donald Trump tried and failed to turn their backs on the Middle East. Joe Biden is unlikely to do so either. He has already been dragged into regional politics: dispatching a special envoy to Yemen, playing a role in the Gaza ceasefire, dealing with attacks on American forces in Iraq by Iranian-backed militias. Yet America’s place in the region—measured in troop levels, diplomatic engagement or influence—is not what it was. Talk of freedom and democracy has yielded to a narrower focus on countering extremism and promoting stability. An America focused on China seems unlikely to embark on grand crusades in the Middle East.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, flew to Beirut a year ago after the catastrophic blast that shattered the Lebanese capital, hoping to cajole its venal leaders into serious reforms. A year later he is fundraising to ensure that the Lebanese army continues to feed its soldiers, a more modest ambition. Other European powers have little to do with the region. Russia and China look out only for their own narrow interests. Yet outsiders still loom large in the popular imagination. Indeed, there is an odd nostalgia for a time when they were more active. Arab intellectuals who oppose Iran want America to drive it from the Middle East, but they cannot articulate how it is meant to dismantle groups such as Hizbullah. Others still see America as the source of all woes, and talk of its withdrawal from the region as a panacea.
Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab philosopher, popularised the notion of asabiyyah, a sense of group cohesion which he saw as the linchpin of civilisation. His most famous work, the Muqaddimah, posited a unified theory of how civilisations rise and fall: groups with strong cohesion band together, only to grow sedentary and decadent and lose their solidarity, which leads to inevitable decline. Like all grand theories, this one has flaws: the endurance of the House of Saud, a decadent regime if ever there was one, seems to offer a modern-day counterexample.
The notion of asabiyyah remains relevant. Societies need something to bind them together. But unity of a region of 400m people spread across four time zones cannot be imposed from the top down. “Neither Nasser nor Assad nor certainly Saddam, all of these guys were not democrats,” says Ghassan Salame, a Lebanese academic and diplomat. “Arab nationalism has been tainted by its very intimate association with authoritarianism.”
The EU did not emerge from the womb fully formed: European unity was the work of decades, the result not of grand ideologies but of banal initiatives like the coal-and-steel community and common agricultural policy. The Arab League took the opposite tack, presupposing a unity that did not universally exist. “It was an attempt, so far a failed attempt, to translate a cultural concept into a political one and a strategic one,” says Mr Salame.
When ideologies and institutions fail, people turn to more local identities. In Lebanon it is common to hear talk of federalism as a solution to the country’s woes. At just 10,452 square kilometres, Lebanon is half the size of Wales. While its demography corresponds a bit with its geography—the north is heavily Sunni, the south heavily Shia—its sects are mixed enough to make it impossible to divide them into cantons. A growing number of its citizens want to do exactly that, however, thinking a Swiss model would somehow end Lebanon’s infighting.
Some countries are too far gone to return to the status quo ante. Foreign diplomats still hope for a peace deal that returns Yemen to the control of a UN-backed government. Yet a plethora of armed groups, many with competing interests, makes this impossible. This “Westphalian fantasy”, writes Nadwa al-Dawsari, an analyst at the Middle East Institute, a think-tank, “will not stop Yemen’s fracturing, and could even make it worse.” Such is the state of things: unity has failed, nation-states are failing, but further division offers no solutions.
The Arab world is too big and diverse to be dominated by one ideology. It needs greater unity, but of the boring, technocratic sort: deals to let Arabs travel and trade freely, a security system that works. And it needs national leaders willing to see their jobs as more than zero-sum contests for power and money. That requires respect for human rights and civil society, and economic reform to ensure there are enough resources to go round.
The alternative is more wasted years that the region can ill afford. The problems of the past decade pale before those to come: young populations needing jobs, an energy transition that may gut the budgets of oil-producing states, climate change that could make parts of the region unfit to live in. If the Arab world’s leaders cannot stop fighting over old ideologies, they may find there is nothing left to fight for.■

1770,"DANCING CARTOON lemurs, majestic baobab trees and lush documentaries about the extraordinary biodiversity of Madagascar have much to answer for. They have created an image of the world’s fourth-largest island that is jarringly at odds with reality: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries on Earth. Because it has banned foreign journalists (along with most other foreigners, in an attempt to slow the spread of covid-19), few in the outside world are aware of the famine that has left more than a million people hungry in the south of the Island. Your correspondent evaded the ban.
This is the story of the 110km journey from Fort Dauphin to Ambovombe along the grandly named Route Nationale 13, or RN13. It might as well be dubbed the road of tears.
Fort Dauphin was named in 1643 after the heir to the French throne, the boy who would become Louis XIV, the Sun King. Tolagnaro is its Malagasy name but few seem to use it. From 1825 it was a garrison town for the Imerina troops from Madagascar’s highlands who conquered and subjugated most of the island to create a pre-colonial proto-state. Later, after the French conquest in the late 19th century, it flourished. Now it is utterly isolated. There are no paved roads to get here and very few flights. Some goods come by ship. Some jobs have been created here by a mining company majority-owned by Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian firm. The company paid for roads in town but they soon peter out. Even the pre-electronic flight-announcement board in the airport hints at what is to come as soon as you leave town. There has been almost no development in this region for decades.
Leave Fort Dauphin early in the morning, and the road is packed with people coming into town. Men carry four or five sacks of charcoal perched precariously on the backs of their bikes. Only some 15% of Malagasy have electricity, so charcoal is the main source of fuel for cooking. But chopping down trees for charcoal has devastated Madagascar, resulting in soil erosion, sandstorms and habitat destruction for much of the country’s unique flora and fauna. In 1960 Madagascar had 5m people. Now it has 27m. This population explosion and the subsequent hunger for land has also driven the destruction of its once extensive rainforests.
After the outskirts of Fort Dauphin the road is just a cratered track, muddy after rain and later just dusty. Because there are so few paved roads on the island, it takes between two and three days to drive to Antananarivo, Madagascar’s capital. Fort Dauphin’s port is mainly used only to export from its mine and little else. Poor infrastructure means that there is hardly any trade within the south or between the south and the rest of the country. As a result, anything not produced locally is much more expensive than other more accessible parts of Madagascar. Still, this part of the south is relatively well off—it has been raining. Here villagers toil in the fields and the rice-paddies. Rice is the staple food of Madagascar, a nod to the fact that the ancestors of many Malagasy hail not from Africa but from what is now Indonesia. Living on an island that was long relatively isolated from the continent, Malagasy don’t really consider themselves African.
Twenty-one kilometres west of Fort Dauphin is the little market town of Manambaro. The name means “has a lot of varo”, which is a type of tree, but it does not have a lot any more. Most were chopped down and reduced to charcoal years ago. Even so, the market stalls are groaning with food. As Brigitte scoops out rice in small tins to sell to her customers, she explains that some is Malagasy and some is imported. “Pakistani rice is not as good quality,” she says: “It does not taste as good.” It also might be old, she says. Food there may be, but covid-19 and drought in southern Madagascar have hit the economy hard. Even as people’s incomes have fallen, the price of rice has increased over the past year by 17-30%, depending on the type.
Past Manambaro the road climbs through the mountains. They act as a natural barrier. To the east it rains as the clouds blowing in from the Indian Ocean bump up against the peaks. But to the west it is drier. Descending on the other side, the road passes through a forest of spiny cactus. In the 1920s the French introduced cochineal beetles here to clear land for farming. The result was devastating. Within a few years bugs had utterly destroyed the cactus that the zebu, or native hump-backed cattle, grazed on. This caused the famine of 1930, during which some 10,000 zebu and up to a thousand pastoralists died. Today, with an eye on COP26, the upcoming UN climate-change conference, some officials within the UN are arguing that the drought in the south is the first to be caused by climate change. In fact the region has been afflicted by keré, which means both “drought” and “hunger” for more than a century. The first recorded drought-driven famine was in 1895, followed by dozens since then. In the past they lasted a few months or a season; now they go on for several years.
In Amboasary Sud the RN13 crosses the Mandrare river. It is much lower than it should be at this time of year. The banks are thronged by women washing clothes and themselves. They complain that villagers from out of town are bringing their zebu, which makes the water dirty. Zebu-drawn carts are coming, too, to collect water to sell in parched villages. The hunt for water in this region is a major preoccupation. Getting it takes either time or money.
Climate change has made the droughts worse. So has tree-chopping. Here the colonial French indulged on a grand scale when they were in charge. Just on the other side of the bridge in Amboasary Sud are the beginnings of sisal plantations, which cover thousands of hectares and stretch as far as the eye can see. Sisal is a drought-resistant plant used for making rope, among other products, and these plantations are the result of the French clearing the forest here beginning in the 1930s.
This part of Madagascar is famous for its funerary customs. To honour the dead, zebu must be killed and grand celebrations held in honour of the departed. Huge sums are invested in tombs. The numbers of zebu skulls displayed by the tombs attest to the wealth and social importance of the dead. Honouring ancestors is a big part of local culture. But the prohibitive cost of these ceremonies makes it hard for families to save and invest in their children’s education, their homes, their farms and their futures.
Approaching Ambovombe, the capital of the Androy region, the situation begins to look bleak. A few miles south of the RN13 is the village of Maroalopoty, which has had hardly any rain for several years. In the village clinic, Zemele has brought her grandchild Masy for help. She looks like a plump baby, but that is misleading: she is actually almost four years old and suffering from acute malnutrition. According to Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, 47% of all Malagasy children suffer from stunting caused by malnutrition, a figure that is higher in the south. There are ten people who live in Zemele’s household. Masy’s parents have gone elsewhere to look for work and, in desperation, Zemele has sold three of her four fields.
There is a well in Maroalopoty but it has to supply hundreds of people, and because of the drought the water table is constantly dropping. Several kilometres away, near the beach, there is another well. Here the UN has been paying villagers to plant lines of sisal in order to tamp down the dunes. The beaches are pristine and there is no development whatsoever. Soja Lahimaro, the dynamic 39-year-old Chinese-educated governor of Androy, says that there is more to his region than the keré and that he has 245kms of undeveloped coastline (though, he admits, tourists could not reach the coast even if they wanted to).
I say that it seems incredible to me that this region has been ignored for so long by governments in faraway Antananarivo. Could it be that politicians there don’t care about Androy and also look down on this poor region? “Exactly!” says Mr Lahimaro. Maybe worried he has let something undiplomatic slip that he should not, he rapidly changes gear and says that President Andry Rajoelina has pledged to tarmac RN13. Outside his office stand three earthmovers that have just arrived. It is not the first time Malagasy presidents have pledged to rebuild this road though.
Meanwhile men, women and children struggle through the region’s sandstorms on foot, bike and zebu-drawn cart. Why don’t people get angry? My driver, who works for a company in Fort Dauphin, tells me he has three children and earns €45 ($53) a month and his wife, who is a teacher, earns €50. They cannot make ends meet. Asked why people don’t demonstrate, he says that the authorities would order the security forces to shoot at them. People may be poor and angry, he says, but “they have fear in their hearts”. Forget happy dancing lemurs. This is the real Madagascar.",2

1772,"IN SEPTEMBER 1995 Boris Johnson, a rising star of the Daily Telegraph’s comment pages, spent an evening with the Dulwich Labour Party. His trip to the south London suburb was an act of anthropology, undertaken to study a new tribe: the educated middle classes who had fallen hard for Tony Blair. Mr Johnson’s hosts plied him with Bulgarian red wine and taco crisps, and raged at the dying Conservative government. He was an observant visitor, recalls John McTernan, his chaperone and a future aide to Mr Blair.
Mr Johnson was a keen student of New Labour, whose era coincided with his own ascent to prominence. He was repelled by its “bare-faced quasi-messianic effrontery”, “spin-driven vanilla-flavoured candyfloss nothingness”, and assaults on fox-hunters and smokers. But he was mesmerised, too, for Mr Blair was a winner. Mr Johnson watched how “Supertone” ransacked the Tory wardrobe, played the press “like a master organist” and imposed a new doctrine on his party. (“In the game of political repression, the Burmese police have little to teach New Labour.”) As the years went on, scandals and sleaze seemed not to touch his popularity. In 2002, now editing the Spectator, a Tory-leaning weekly, Mr Johnson named Mr Blair parliamentarian of the year, hailing his “unchallenged dominance of the political landscape”.

These days the two premiers seem to occupy opposite ends of that landscape. Mr Blair marched into Afghanistan shoulder to shoulder with an American president; Mr Johnson, at odds with the White House, is forced to retreat. Mr Blair wanted Britain at the heart of Europe; Mr Johnson delivered Brexit. In university seminars Mr Blair is described as a centrist and Mr Johnson as a right-wing populist. One belongs to Clintonworld and the other is claimed by Trumpland. Mr Johnson’s ministers denounce the Supreme Court and Scottish and Welsh parliaments created by Mr Blair as constitutional vandalism, and stuff quangos once dominated by Blairites with their own fellow-travellers. Fourteen years into his retirement, Mr Blair still outshines Mr Johnson in intellectual discipline, darting ahead of a disorganised government with plans to fix covid-19 testing and vaccinations. They are ancien régime and brutish new order, separated by the Brexit revolution.
Yet the prism of Brexit refracts political hues into artificial separation. Seen through it, the past is distorted, too. Mr Johnson has learned much from Mr Blair. On the campaign trail and in the suburbs, the two men look more alike. That resemblance contains a warning for the prime minister.
Mr Johnson’s premiership, like Mr Blair’s, rests on a supersized personal mandate. His appeal runs deep into places where his party’s does not. (“They know that Tony won their seats,” Mr Johnson once said of Labour’s pliant MPs.) Both are instinctively comfortable in suburban England, never wagging the finger about how people should run their own lives. And they provoke a similar fury in their enemies, who give them the same epithet: liar.
Both focus ruthlessly on what they call “the people’s priorities”, namely jobs, health, crime and education. This is the terrain where elections are won and lost. Today’s Tory leaflets are reminiscent of New Labour’s early work, with endlessly repeated promises of more nurses, teachers and police officers. (Both men, notes Patrick Diamond, a former Blair aide, swept to office after a long period of tight public spending.) The skirmishes over flags and statues that dominate newspapers feature remarkably little. Mr Johnson’s campaign slogan in 2019 to “Get Brexit Done” was a promise to make the wrangling go away, not to prolong it.
Their methods are increasingly similar, too. Mr Johnson lampooned public-sector targets as Soviet and dehumanising. Now he has adopted them and asked Sir Michael Barber, who ran Mr Blair’s “delivery unit”, to construct another for him. Mr Blair declared Whitehall inert and unresponsive long before the same thought occurred to Dominic Cummings, the erratic aide who helped bring Mr Johnson to Downing Street.
Mr Johnson has episodes of Blairite centrism, making promises on climate change and obesity of the sort he once described as nanny-statism. Mr Blair, for his part, sometimes had a Johnsonesque populist streak, dubbing his project the “political arm of the British people”. He searched constantly for eye-catching initiatives that would convince voters that he was “on their side”. Yobs and nuisance neighbours were favourite targets. Mr Johnson once called this stuff authoritarian, ineffective and depressingly popular—but in office, he has embraced it. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is scarcely more draconian than her New Labour predecessors, who mooted tagging asylum-seekers as if they were criminals, or processing them overseas.
His final lesson
Mr Johnson revelled in Mr Blair’s downfall in 2007, squeezed out by his chancellor, Gordon Brown (“a blubfest of nauseating proportions”). Mr Blair left office frustrated. The retail offers that brought him to power—shorter waits for health care, smaller school classes—now seemed to him ridiculously modest. He settled too late on the structural reforms the public sector required, by which point his government was distrusted and tired, weighed by scandal and the war in Iraq.
The question, says Mr Diamond, is whether Mr Johnson is capable of becoming a reformer too. Despite a hiring spree, it will be hard to improve public services before the next election, since covid-19 has created long backlogs for practically everything. Sweeping reforms are in short supply. Tory MPs may neuter his overhauls of social care and planning law. Ideas to “level up” Britain’s poor regions are sparse. Mr Cummings, who had a Blairite appetite for fighting vested interests, has gone. And all the while the government acquires an air of fatigue and muck at remarkable speed. Mr Blair’s most important lesson is that it is not enough to win power: you must use it before it wanes. ■",2
1773,"“RELIGION IS THE sigh of the oppressed creature…it is the opium of the people.” So wrote Karl Marx in 1844. The idea—not unique to Marx—was that by promising rewards in the next life, religion helps the poor bear their lot in this one.
A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Jana Berkessel of the University of Mannheim, in Germany, and her colleagues takes a statistical look at the claim. Ms Berkessel's curiosity was piqued by a counter-intuitive finding in development economics. Researchers know that low socioeconomic status correlates with poor mental health. The assumption was once that, as places became richer, this effect would weaken. Being poor in a rich country was presumed better than being poor in a poor one.

But that has turned out not to be true. Abundant evidence suggests the relationship between status and mental health is stronger, not weaker, in rich countries than in poor ones. Ms Berkessel, who studies the psychological effects of religion, noticed that economic development is also inversely correlated with religiosity—the richer a country, the more godless it tends to be. Perhaps that was driving the change?
To check, she and her colleagues analysed three surveys covering 3.3m people in 156 countries. This set of data reproduced the finding that economic development amplifies the link between mental health and status. It also supported the idea that religiosity could attenuate that effect. Among rich countries, for instance, those with higher levels of self-reported religious belief had a weaker relationship between status and mental health.
Other evidence buttresses the theory. One study covering 11 European countries, all rich, found the link between personal income and well-being was stronger in irreligious places than devout ones. After much statistical crunching, Ms Berkessel concluded that declining religiosity accounted for about half of the effect of growing wealth on the relationship between status and psychological well-being.
The upshot is that religion seems to protect people from at least some of the unpleasant effects of poverty. Exactly how is less clear. One hypothesis is that religious doctrine is directly protective. After all, many of the world’s biggest religions have a sceptical attitude to wealth. Alongside the well-known biblical verses about camels, needles and a rich person’s chance of entering the pearly gates, the researchers point out that the Bhagavad-Gita, a Hindu holy book, says “The demoniac person thinks: So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more.” Similar sentiments can be found in the Koran and in some Buddhist texts. If God teaches that the wealthy are spiritually corrupt, or will get their comeuppance on Judgment Day, then poverty may seem less of a burden.
But there are other possibilities. Ms Berkessel points out that organised religion offers a social-support network which might help attenuate the effects of low status, whether or not its members really believe everything their holy texts say about wealth. Her next research project, she says, will look at exactly this point.
In the meantime, if religion really does help relieve poverty’s burden, one question is what, if anything, to do with that knowledge. The world is, after all, getting steadily richer, meaning relative poverty’s sting will only get sharper. A cynic might recall another well-known quote about religion, this time from Seneca, a Roman philosopher. “Religion”, he wrote, “is regarded by the common people as true, the wise as false, and the rulers as useful.” ■",2
1774,"ARTHUR DO VAL just wanted to be somebody. A sitting lawmaker in São Paulo’s regional assembly—with, as he boasts in his Twitter bio, the second-largest number of votes of any candidate—Mr do Val rose to fame by heckling lefties at marches. He learned this tactic, he explains, from the documentaries of Michael Moore, an American political film-maker.
Mr do Val has since become a talented and prolific producer of web-friendly content. His team pumps out hundreds of images and video clips weekly through social media. People want to be entertained, he argues, so politics must be entertaining, too. Political arguments should be delivered in funny memes and silly videos which, in Mr do Val’s case, tend to focus on promoting economically liberal ideas and bashing the left.

“I tried being a rock star; I failed. I tried to be a fighter, an athlete; I failed. I was simply a frustrated businessman. Then, I saw in YouTube an opportunity to exploit my indignation,” he explains. “I just wanted to stand out, and by accident, it took me to a political career.”
Mr do Val’s rise from a nobody to a state deputy by the age of 32 was both unlikely and impressive. But he embodies a new transnational class of political entrepreneurs who communicate in memes, videos and slogans. They draw on a global flow of ideas, adapt them to local conditions and return them to the ether. Many are activists or ordinary people. Social media are their most important means of influence—both over their followers and each other. The result is not only a new class of unorthodox politicians, but also the globalisation of political ideas, many from America.
America’s films, television and music are loved everywhere. Its consumer brands are world-beating. Its social-media stars have global influence. As the world’s most powerful country, with huge cultural reach, it has always had a hefty impact on political trends and movements.
In 1990 Joseph Nye, a political scientist at Harvard, introduced the concept of “soft power”, which he defined as “the ability to affect others and obtain preferred outcomes by attraction and persuasion rather than coercion or payment”. Hollywood, pop music, McDonald’s and Levi’s jeans are all expressions of America’s soft power.
For many people beyond its shores, consuming these goods was as close as they could get to sharing the American dream. When the first McDonald’s opened in Mumbai in 1996, Indians queued in their thousands to taste its fabled burger (though made without beef), replicating a scene from Moscow six years earlier. (The opening of a Starbucks in Mumbai a decade ago drew a similar response.) Mumbai’s film industry, the biggest in the world, is called “Bollywood” to mimic its counterpart in Los Angeles. Nigeria has “Nollywood”, Pakistan “Lollywood”.
Even if McDonald’s and Hollywood contribute to growing obesity and unrealistic expectations of police forensics, for policymakers the important thing is that, as Mr Nye puts it, “exerting attraction on others often does allow you to get what you want”. A fondness for American brands is positively correlated with favourable views of the American government. What has changed is that the culture the country exports has expanded to encompass its politics. And in the age of social media, it is memes, not McDonald’s, that are the main vehicle for America’s cultural influence.
Take Brazil. Its political scene is full of YouTubers and Facebook influencers. These include supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the president; critics of the government such as Felipe Neto, who rose to fame making videos for young people; and a vast market of political content-makers in between. “There is a lot of influence, even unconscious, of the [American] discourse. What’s happening there, comes here,” says Mr do Val, citing debates on face masks or race. This is not as simple as copying and pasting American arguments, he cautions. Rather, America provides the templates that anyone anywhere can apply.
According to Whitney Phillips, a media researcher at Syracuse University in New York, America’s role in shaping political debates comes not just from the norms it promotes. It also “flows from its cultural production—the actual stuff of media and memes”, she writes in “You Are Here”, a new book examining global information flows. One reason America’s influence is greater now, she says, is that “social media is global. And there are way more people outside the United States who use Facebook than in the United States.”
Black Lives Matter sweeps Nigeria
Consider the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests which erupted in America in 2020. They inspired local versions everywhere from South Korea, where there are very few people of African descent, to Nigeria, where there are very few people who are not. In Britain, where the police typically do not carry firearms, one protester held aloft a sign that read, “demilitarise the police”. In Hungary, where Africans make up less than 0.1% of the population, a local council tried to install a work of art in support of the BLM movement, only to earn a rebuke from the prime minister’s office. Last year the Hungarian government released a video declaring, “All lives matter.”
QAnon, a conspiracy theory that holds that paedophile cannibals run America, began circulating some time in 2017. It has since won many adherents outside America. In a small QAnon protest in London last year, people carried signs that read, “Stop protecting paedophiles”. In France it is finding support among gilets jaunes (yellow jacket) protesters. According to one estimate, Germany has the world’s second-largest number of QAnon followers. The conspiracy theory has even spread to Japan, despite the country’s radically different political culture.
Cultural influence is not a one-way street. British political influencers enjoy big audiences, including in America. The odd Canadian gets a look in. Mr do Val proudly points to the “confused lady” meme as one that started in Brazil but is now in widespread circulation abroad. Yet few people are aware of its Brazilians origins. Nor do Brazilian—or any other—movements inspire similar memes across the world. The ability to influence the world, even if indirectly, is proportional to a country’s cultural heft (see chart).

Much of this is the work of social media. It amplifies new voices, accelerates the rate at which ideas spread, and broadens the scale at which both people and ideas can win influence. But established newspapers and television channels also retain immense influence, even online. CNN is the second-most-visited English-language news website in the world, after the BBC. The New York Times is third. In November Emmanuel Macron, the French president, complained to the newspaper about its coverage of a terrorist attack near Paris. Mr Macron does not contact every media outlet about its coverage. But some 50m people outside America, spread across every country on Earth, read the New York Times online. Of its 5.2m digital subscribers, nearly a fifth are outside America.
Media outlets elsewhere take their cues from their American counterparts. According to analysis by Kings College London (KCL), mentions of “culture wars” in the British press used to be a quadrennial phenomenon, suggesting they cropped up in conjunction with American presidential elections. But in recent years the use of the term has shot up. “We have imported the language of culture wars into the UK wholesale,” says Bobby Duffy, the director of KCL’s Policy Institute.
These factors together help explain why QAnon has gained global name-recognition, lockdown-scepticism has taken on American vocabulary and BLM protests have spread across the world. Just as people everywhere watch Hollywood movies, they also follow American newspapers, television programmes and social media.
The same cannot be said of any other country. Take China. Protests in Hong Kong elicited sympathy and solidarity, but did not inspire similar demonstrations. Few outside China get excited about buying Huawei phones or shopping on Alibaba. TikTok, its only globally successful internet product, is split into a Chinese version—Douyin—and the version used elsewhere. China’s great firewall keeps the rest of the world from getting in, but it also stops Chinese ideas getting out.
Moreover, the openness of America’s politics allows for a ready appropriation of its symbols and iconography, says Craig Hayden, a professor of strategic studies of the Marine Corps University in Virginia. Videos of riots on American streets should, on the surface, damage the country’s standing in the world. Instead people in other countries see unrest in Washington or Minneapolis and think America is “engaged in this kind of struggle that’s parallel to ours”, he says. And America’s aspirational cachet makes its movements all the more powerful. “I can think of a random country somewhere that’s having internal racial strife; we’re not all retweeting what’s going on there,” he adds.
Uncle Sam’s digital megaphone
Just as political power in the age of social media has flowed to disrupters, so too has the power to influence affairs in far-off lands. Social-media users in Minneapolis or Seattle can have an impact on the Instagrammers of São Paulo. Arguments that start on university campuses in New England migrate to the living rooms of old England. The internet promised to help information flow around the world. But social media and their algorithms have just amplified America’s voice. ■",2
1775,"IN MANY PLACES where seaweed used to thrive, often growing in vast “forests”, it is disappearing. The cause is global warming, which, by heating the ocean’s upper layer, reduces its density through thermal expansion—thus making it more buoyant. That extra buoyancy means it is less likely to mix with cooler, denser and more nutrient-rich waters below. This is bad for the marine environment in general. More specifically, it is bad for commercial seaweed farming, a business with revenues of (depending on whom you ask) between $6bn and $40bn a year.
The algae involved, particularly kelp, are popular in Asian cuisine. They are also used as fertiliser, and are processed into carrageenan, a natural binder and emulsifier employed in foods, cosmetics and drugs. Most are grown either on the seabed or on ropes attached to it (see picture above). But some are cultivated on small floating platforms.

To counter the effects of surface heating, which are particularly pronounced in the tropics, researchers are trying to improve the floating-platform approach by assisting the upwelling of cooler waters to stimulate algal growth on such platforms. This would also increase the area available for seaweed farms, by allowing them to be located well away from coastlines. An experimental floating farm installed in August, off the coast of the Philippines, by a group led by the Climate Foundation, an American charity, is one of the largest attempts so far to do this.
Pictures of a floating world
Artificial stimulation of upwelling is not a new idea. It has been touted for years as a way to regenerate kelp forests, in particular. And for good reason. With enough nutrients, fronds of giant kelp, which grow to an average length of about 30 metres, can elongate by more than 50cm a day. Only now, however, is upwelling-stimulation being attempted seriously.
The foundation’s test platform has an area of 100 square metres. It employs solar-powered turbines to suck water up from a depth of several hundred metres through flexible, cylindrical pipes. The foundation plans to experiment with wind-powered and wave-powered turbines, too.

If this works, which early results suggest it does, and can be scaled up, not only could such technology boost seaweed production, it might also help ecosystems that depend on seaweed forests. And—at least in theory—if part of the harvest were sacrificed by sinking it into the deep ocean, that might act as a novel form of carbon capture and storage which could help slow the warming that caused the problem in the first place.
According to Brian von Herzen, who runs the foundation, the organisation carried out smaller-scale experiments, using similar technology, in 2020. These showed that seaweed grows four times faster on platforms irrigated with upwelled water than on equivalent, unirrigated platforms. Moreover, it continues to grow during the warmest months of the year, when seaweed not so irrigated actually shrinks.
Dr von Herzen and his colleagues hope to use experience gathered from their latest rig to develop a platform that would cover an entire hectare of the ocean’s surface—100 times the area of the one just launched. To that end, they are collaborating with the Marine Bioproducts Cooperative Research Centre, a public-private partnership in Australia. At this scale, the partners estimate, a seaweed farm could pay for itself within five years.
Moreover, seaweed farms bring benefits beyond the immediate value of their crop. Seaweed is a habitat for many marine creatures, including fish. Some of these can be harvested for food. Indeed, for artificial upwelling to bring about that desirable state of affairs it may not even be necessary to farm seaweed. Ocean artUp, a project led by the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany, is experimenting with the use of upwelling to encourage the growth of the small, planktonic creatures eaten by sardines.
That could help restore stocks of these fish, which are shrinking rapidly in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Ocean artUp, which began in 2017 and is scheduled to run until the end of this year, has concentrated on simulating and measuring exactly how artificial upwelling affects the quantities of nutrients transferred between ocean layers. One thing the project’s researchers have discovered is that if you pump too hard, some of the upwelled water simply drops back into the depths, without mixing properly. Stirring the ocean in this way may thus require the design of floating water-mixers, too, to keep the nutrients at the surface.
Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Otherlab, an independent research laboratory, is working on an underwater robot intended to screw large tethers firmly into the seabed, to ensure that floating seaweed farms stay put, and can better survive stormy weather. Otherlab is part of a consortium paid for by ARPA-e, an American-government agency that is exploring the idea of using seaweed as a source of biofuel.
Those squeamish about anything that smacks of geoengineering—in other words, technology intended to change the world’s climate in ways that oppose global warming—view artificial upwelling with scepticism. They argue that it could damage other parts of ocean ecosystems, and might even create unwanted side-effects that end up accelerating climate change rather than slowing it. Proponents, conversely, see these early efforts, at least, as simply restoring upwelling that has been suppressed by climate change.
Stratified, not stirred
A study published last year in Nature Climate Change, by a team of researchers from America and China, suggested that the overall stratification of the world’s oceans has increased by 5% since 1960, with up to 20% more stratification in the tropics. This is despite any countervailing effect of the more extreme weather that global warming brings, which leads to greater churning of the oceans. Any such churning is overwhelmed by the extra buoyancy of the warmer surface layers.
Cooling the ocean surface by encouraging upwelling might also have a direct effect on the local air temperature. Warmer surface waters keep the atmosphere above warmer, too. Cooler waters do the reverse. But the technology would have to be deployed on a vast scale—over millions of hectares of the ocean’s surface—before it had a noticeable effect on the atmosphere.
As Dr von Herzen, who does not advocate geoengineering, points out, any such plans would face more than just economic barriers. The London Protocol, an international legal framework that regulates marine pollution, sets stringent limits on deliberate geoengineering of the oceans. The protocol does, however, tolerate justifiable commercial exploitation, along with some carbon capture.
If large-scale seaweed farming were, nevertheless, to be considered for geoengineering, there would be a certain irony in that fact. To do this would mean dumping the algae thus grown on the ocean floor, to stop the carbon in them returning to the atmosphere. That would probably work in the short term. But it was just such a process of sedimentation of organic matter which, over millions of years, produced modern-day petroleum fields. And it is their oil, furiously pumped up for over a century, that has generated much of the excess of greenhouse gases of which the world is now trying to rid itself. ■

1776,"AMERICAN OFFICE workers of an envious disposition must avoid emailing colleagues in Europe this month. The inevitable “try me again in September” automatic rejoinder is unlikely to improve the mood of those spending most of their summer toiling. Perhaps one consolation is the knowledge that holidays are not what they used to be. Rare is the employee who leaves all their work behind these days. Plenty of people will at least furtively scroll through emails while on the beach. Everyone has occasionally shirked work. Now many workers are shirking holidays, too.
In the olden days, office life used to be binary. Establishing whether Bob from accounting was on annual leave was as simple as checking whether he was at his desk. Then BlackBerrys—the executive status symbol of the early 2000s—were granted to those who implicitly agreed to use them outside office hours.

Now everyone has smartphones tethering them to their inbox, and the pandemic means Bob has probably not visited the corporate headquarters for several months or more. Whether he is on holiday or not might be immediately clear only to him, his line manager and the buggy HR computer system logging his days off.
Bosses are mostly mindful not to demand that their underlings do anything while on statutory leave. In Europe policymakers talk of a “right to disconnect”, which allows employees to leave their day jobs behind during holidays (as well as evenings and weekends). But the right is not an obligation. And some individuals might find a small dollop of work a respite from their time off. Even the most petulant colleagues can be more relaxing to deal with than one’s own children.
A few workers find ways to delete the work email app from their phones. And there are arguments for being a holiday hardliner. Time away from work serves to clear the mind. Plenty of jobs now require a measure of inspiration. A stretch away from the office helps, all the more so if it is an actual break, complete with a change of scenery away from home. French workers, many of whom live up to the stereotype of taking much of August off, are expected to fizz with ideas come September.

Severing all links to your quotidian tasks can be salutary for employers too. Refreshed workers are less likely to burn out. Fraudsters inside companies are known to be reluctant to take vacation days, lest colleagues covering for them unveil the mischief. After Jérôme Kerviel, a holiday-dodging French trader, blew a €5bn ($7.4bn) hole in the balance-sheet of Société Générale, a big lender, in 2008, regulators insisted that some bankers be forced to be away for two consecutive weeks so as to make future fraud harder. Even if no one is cooking the books, enforcing a more complete cut-off lets tasks be passed to someone else in the organisation. That builds resilience.
What is the right balance? Nobody suggests toiling on leave at the same pace as in the (home) office. But most people will conclude that if a few minutes spent answering emails can save a stranded colleague hours of work, it would seem churlish not to step in. If nothing else, keeping even a distant eye on things can make a return to the job—whether after a week off or even a month—less daunting. Who wants to deal with thousands of unread emails on their return?
And plenty of professionals quite like what they do for a living, even when they aren’t meant to be doing it. Staying loosely connected might encourage people to take their full entitlement of holidays: in America, more than half of workers reported not taking their share even before the pandemic roiled their working lives.
An intriguing possibility is that the rise of remote work will spawn a new type of holiday. Among his European contacts Bartleby has glimpsed some exotic Zoom backgrounds of late. Some people are “working from home” in what look to be pretty swish holiday destinations. One executive admitted that, having decamped to a Greek island for a couple of weeks in the past, he is now spending most of the summer there. He is toiling a touch less than full whack during the weeks he is meant to be working—but putting in a few hours a day during what is meant to be time off.
Thus the binary nature of holidays—either you are working or you aren’t—may yet become another casualty of covid-19. Plenty of thought has been given to how the pandemic has changed how people work. It may end up altering how they don’t work, too.

1777,"ON AUGUST 26TH central bankers will gather for their annual Jackson Hole jamboree with the shine having come off their record. A year ago they had forestalled a financial crisis during the pandemic’s first wave. Today an inflation surge has made a mockery of the Federal Reserve’s forecasts; a parliamentary committee has said that the Bank of England has a “dangerous addiction” to buying bonds; and everybody expects the European Central Bank (ECB) to undershoot, over a period of years, its shiny new “symmetric” inflation target of 2%, unveiled in July.
The disquieting sense of monetary powerlessness is compounded by the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, which threatens to raise prices and depress global growth. Monetary policy cannot do much about port terminals closing because of outbreaks—as China’s Ningbo-Zhoushan did on August 11th—nor about Australia and New Zealand returning to lockdowns. In America consumer confidence tumbled in the first half of August. It was not for want of monetary stimulus.

Yet the trickiest challenge facing central banks is when and how to reverse the past year-and-a-half of quantitative easing (QE), the buying of long-term bonds using newly created money. On current forecasts rich-world central banks’ balance-sheets will have reached a combined $28trn in size by the end of the year, about two-fifths of which is attributable to QE during the pandemic. Critics says central banks face a “QE ratchet” because their bond holdings only go in one direction: they surged after the global financial crisis and never fell much before the pandemic struck. Even many emerging markets, now grappling with an inflation problem, have dabbled in QE and must soon decide its future.

Debate over QE within central banks is dominated by short-term considerations about the need for stimulus. Yet there is only weak evidence that accumulating or holding bonds helps economies much when, as now, financial markets are calm. The trouble is that investors have been encouraged to interpret decisions about QE as a signal about when central banks might raise interest rates, a policy whose effects are more tangible. The resulting sensitivity of interest-rate expectations to QE announcements makes the policy hard to unwind. The Fed is nervous about triggering another “taper tantrum”, the episode in 2013 when the suggestion that it might curtail its bond-buying shook markets. In the euro zone things are further complicated because QE has also had the side-effect of mutualising some of the debts of member states.
Central bankers should be explicit about the purpose and effectiveness of QE. Buying bonds is an essential tool for stabilising financial markets in a crisis like that of spring last year. But it is increasingly clear that it should fall to government spending or tax cuts to rescue the real economy when interest rates have already reached zero. Today’s economic data bear that out: one reason America has a troublesome price surge while the ECB’s inflation target looks unfeasibly high is that America has had much more fiscal stimulus—cumulative QE, as a share of GDP, has been similar. Being explicit about which tools serve what purpose, and playing down the perceived link between bond-buying and interest rates, would let central banks unwind QE.
That would be welcome because of QE’s long-term downsides, of which there is growing awareness. One danger about which The Economist has long warned is that bloated central-bank balance-sheets are a threat to the stability of the public finances. Purchases of long-term bonds are paid for by creating central-bank reserves—electronic cash which carries a floating rate of interest (commercial banks hold these reserves and receive any interest). Should policymakers need to raise interest rates to fight inflation, the new reserves will become costlier to service. Because central banks are owned by governments—Britain’s has explicitly underwritten QE—any such burden will ultimately fall on taxpayers.
A rapid exit from QE would remove that danger. But the overarching goal should be to recognise the tool’s limitations and consequences. At present central bankers do not want to talk down their own firepower and do not see it as their job to take account of QE’s fiscal threat. Instead the state should take an integrated view of its finances. That may involve redesigning how institutions work, by giving governments the job of weighing up the policy’s costs and benefits. At the same time, central banks might be given an advisory role on the size of government deficit that would help stabilise economies in a downturn. As it is, the justifications for QE have become murky, as have the interactions between fiscal and monetary policies. It is time for transparency and a clear division of labour. ■

1778,"TWELVE YEARS after bitcoin was born, governments are still struggling to cope with cryptocurrencies. Britain has banned Binance, a crypto exchange and the European Union’s regulators want transactions to be more traceable. On August 3rd Gary Gensler, the head of America’s Securities and Exchange Commission, said cryptocurrency markets were “rife with fraud, scams and abuse” and called on Congress to give his agency new regulatory powers. The price of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, gyrates with regulators’ every word.
Governments have an obligation to fight the deception, tax evasion and money laundering that plagues the crypto world. Police seizures of bitcoin suggest that they are becoming more zealous. The harder issue they must grapple with is whether cryptocurrencies threaten the financial system. Were bitcoin to collapse, our crypto “stress test” suggests that its holders would lose hundreds of billions of dollars but that the fallout would be manageable. Yet there is another danger posed by “stablecoins”, a special type of cryptocurrency that pegs its value to conventional money.

Pledges of stability often lead to financial crises. Because banks offer deposits that are redeemable on demand and superficially riskless, but which are backed by longer-term, less liquid and riskier assets, they are vulnerable to runs. Stablecoins are similar. The biggest, Tether, has issued $62bn-worth of tokens which it says are redeemable for a dollar apiece. But of the assets backing the tokens in March only about 5% were cash or Treasury bills, according to Tether’s public disclosures. It says it will update the figures soon and that it is “fully backed by reserves”.

Most of the assets were riskier—about half of them commercial paper. Stablecoins’ growth from a value of $14bn in August 2020 to over $100bn today has given them a big financial footprint. Extrapolating Tether’s disclosures implies that it owns over $30bn-worth of commercial paper, which probably makes it the asset class’s seventh-largest investor, not far off funds run by Vanguard and BlackRock, according to JPMorgan Chase. With estimated leverage of 383-to-1, Tether would be unable to honour all its tokens after losses of just 0.26%—a safety cushion that regulators would never allow at a bank.
Few stablecoins say much about their balance-sheets. Tether’s disclosures of the breakdown of its assets are puny and fall far below the standards expected of a bank. In February Tether was among the defendants who agreed to an $18.5m fine with New York’s attorney-general, which said that in 2017 Tether had misled the market about its US dollar backing and that it had not accurately disclosed the transfer of $625m of its assets to Bitfinex, an online trading platform. Tether says the funds were repaid and that it has a “total commitment to transparency”.
No wonder Mr Gensler calls cryptocurrencies a Wild West. Some policymakers have compared stablecoins to the period of “free banking”, when privately issued banknotes of uncertain backing and worth circulated in America’s economy in the 19th century. A more useful comparison is with money-market funds, which were created in the 1970s to circumvent rules limiting the interest banks could pay depositors. After promising to maintain the value of their shares at a dollar, money-market funds blew up in 2008 in the global financial crisis. American taxpayers stepped in to forestall a fire sale of their assets and a crash in the market for commercial paper, on which the real economy depends. A collapse of stablecoins could look similar.
Regulators must act quickly to subject stablecoins to bank-like rules for transparency, liquidity and capital. Those failing to comply should be cut off from the financial system, to stop people drifting into an unregulated crypto-ecosystem. Policymakers are right to sound the alarm, but if stablecoins continue to grow, governments will need to move faster to contain the risks.
It may be tempting to ban stablecoins, especially if central banks launch their own digital currencies—much as private banknotes were replaced with government monopolies on physical cash. Yet it is possible that regulated private-sector stablecoins will eventually bring benefits, such as making cross-border payments easier, or allowing self-executing “smart contracts”. Regulators should allow experiments whose goal is not merely to evade financial rules. But first they must prevent the repackaging of risks with which the world is all too familiar. ■",2
1779,"Much of America’s Pacific north-west and Canada’s west coast baked in a heatwave. Police in Vancouver reported more than 130 sudden deaths, most of them old people or those with underlying conditions. The extreme temperatures were caused by a phenomenon known as a “heat dome”, in which an area of high pressure in the atmosphere stops air escaping.
President Joe Biden backed down over his claim that he would not sign a bipartisan infrastructure bill worth roughly $1trn unless it was accompanied by more expansive provisions off the Democratic party’s wishlist, such as tax increases. Mr Biden had tied the two together after striking a deal with a group of senators from both sides last week, riling Republicans.

Florida’s governor declared an emergency after a beach-front condominium building in Surfside, a suburb of Miami, collapsed. At least 18 people have died and almost 150 are missing. A study published last year charted subsidence in the ground beneath the building in the 1990s.
Donald Rumsfeld died at the age of 88. The Republican served twice as America’s defence secretary, under Presidents Gerald Ford and George W. Bush. He was instrumental in the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and bore much of the criticism when it led to violent insurgency and sectarian strife.
A high-ranking official at Brazil’s health ministry was fired after being accused of asking for a bribe in negotiations over the AstraZeneca covid-19 vaccine. A whistleblower also denounced alleged irregularities in a contract for the Indian-made Covaxin. The vaccine, which has yet to be approved by a Western regulator, cost Brazil more per dose than any other and was acquired by a third-party firm. President Jair Bolsonaro denied wrongdoing. The health ministry suspended the contract.
Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that sections of a law which prohibit recreational use of marijuana were unconstitutional, in another step towards narrow legalisation. When a bill currently in parliament is enacted, those who want to smoke the drug recreationally, or grow plants at home, would be able to apply for a permit. The sale of cannabis would continue to be illegal; Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the president, has called the idea of a legal market “immoral”.
America carried out air strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon said the militias had conducted drone strikes against Americans in Iraq.

The second round of France’s local elections were a disappointment for Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party. She had high hopes that the party would for the first time take control of one of the regional governments, in the south. But other parties teamed up against her candidates, who lost. President Emmanuel Macron’s La République en Marche also failed to win any regions.
Britain and the European Union agreed a truce in the “sausage war”. They delayed for three months a ban on some British meat products being sold in  Northern Ireland, a consequence of the post-Brexit arrangement which in effect keeps the province in the EU’s single market and customs union.
The military junta in  Myanmar released nearly 2,300 people who had been locked up for protesting against the army’s coup. Some activists and journalists critical of the regime were also released. No reason was given for the move, but the junta may be trying to temper popular ire. A cross-section of society has joined the protests.
India’s government, which is seeking more control of online content, piled pressure on Twitter. In the latest of many twists, the social-media company was accused of treason for carrying a map that placed territory claimed by India outside its borders.
The Chinese Communist Party celebrated its 100th birthday. To mark the occasion, the party’s leader, Xi Jinping, appeared in front of 70,000 people at Tiananmen Square.

Australia’s states closed their borders as new clusters of the Delta variant emerged across the country. Around 80% of Australians are now living under restrictions and their “travel bubble” with New Zealand has been suspended. Just 5% of the population has been vaccinated.
Mixing different covid-19 vaccines could boost immunity against the coronavirus, according to researchers at Oxford University. A shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine four weeks after one of Oxford-AstraZeneca’s, and vice versa, produced a high level of antibodies.
Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, dismissed senior officials for “incompetence and irresponsibility” related to pandemic prevention.

1780,"A two-time killer already serving life without the possibility of parole has been jailed for a further 17 years after stabbing another prisoner in a vicious attack caught on film. 
Footage shows Vester Allan Fernando stabbing the young inmate before calmly dropping his weapon and surrendering to prison officers as the victim writhes in a pool of blood.
Fernando is one of Australia's most violent prisoners and this latest attack has likely ensured he will spend the rest of his life in Goulburn's Supermax, the country's most secure jail.
In 1994 he and cousin Brendan Fernando kidnapped, raped and murdered 21-year-old nurse Sandra Hoare at Walgett in north-west New South Wales.
Five years later Fernando stabbed Brendan to death while they were serving life sentences at Lithgow Correctional Centre, west of the Blue Mountains.
Fernando was transferred to Supermax after that murder but was later moved to the North Coast Correctional Centre near Kempsey. 
It was there he stabbed a 26-year-old inmate in the neck, chest and back on the afternoon of April 8 last year.
Fernando was set to set stand trial in the NSW District Court at Port Macquarie but pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to murder. 
Footage of the attack obtained by Daily Mail Australia captures Fernando stabbing the inmate in a frenzied attack under a common area stairway.
As Fernando repeatedly plunges a weapon into the man's body other inmates do nothing to interfere and the wounded prisoner bleeds out on the floor.
The vision shows Fernando slowly walk away from the victim after trying to kill him, tracking blood across the floor on his shoes.
Fernando then slides his weapon towards approaching prison officers, before he calmly raises his hands in the air and lies down in surrender. 
More than a dozen officers swarm the common area as other inmates nonchalantly walk by the crime scene, some barely looking twice as the victim stops moving.
Most of the officers move to surround Fernando, while two go to the aid of the injured inmate with a towel. 
Emergency services were called to the prison about 3.15pm and the stabbed inmate was airlifted to John Hunter Hospital in a critical but stable condition.
Fernando pleaded guilty to the attempted murder in June and was sentenced by Judge Roy Ellis to a further 17 years and one month in jail.
Judge Ellis set a minimum term of 11 years and one month but due to his previous murder convictions Fernando will never be able to apply for parole. 
Another inmate, 28-year-old Atin Munro, was charged with aiding and abetting the attempted murder over the attack but was found not guilty. 
Fernando, who has bulked up considerably during his decades behind bars, was also convicted in 2005 of assaulting a prison officer. 
The Fernando cousins snatched Ms Hoare after she finished a night shift working alone in the geriatric ward of Walgett Base Hospital on December 9, 1994. 
The NSW Supreme Court heard the pair forced Ms Hoare to endure more than an hour of fear and extreme trauma. 
The cousins took Ms Hoare from the hospital to a nearby oval where Brendan held the nurse down while Vester raped her. 
They then forced Ms Hoare to walk 400m to a paddock where they murdered her with a machete. Ms Hoare's body was found with her head almost severed and her underwear missing.
Vester was 27 and Brendan 26 when they were sentenced to life in prison in 1997. 
The older cousin had denied having anything to do with Ms Hoare's murder and blamed Brendan for his conviction and life term.
The cousins were initially kept in separate prisons but later reunited. In September 1999 Fernando murdered Brendan in Lithgow.
He used the blade from a pair of scissors to stab Brendan in the face and chest, piercing his heart, during a music lesson in the prison' auditorium.
In 2001 Fernando was jailed for a further 30 years over Brendan's murder with a 22-year minimum term.
Justice Rod Howie said sentencing Fernando for the murder of Brendan was 'academic' considering he was never to be released for murdering Ms Hoare. 
The inmate Fernando stabbed last year had only recently come into custody and did not have a lengthy criminal history. 
The Mid North Coast Correctional Centre is a maximum, medium and minimum security centre for men and women at Aldavilla, 455km north of Sydney and 14km west of Kempsey. ",-2
1781,"“PARTY-BUILDING has no borders.” So intones the Communist Party to encourage Chinese firms to set up party branches abroad. “No matter where the project, that country will have a party organisation,” is another slogan. China’s rise has expanded the party’s influence abroad. As Chinese citizens head overseas for work and study, its branches are spreading too.
Browbeating the West to show more respect is the task of party organs in Beijing. The foreign ministry does the grunt work, but the party’s Foreign Affairs Commission, headed by Mr Xi, sets policy. The Publicity Department spreads propaganda through state media such as CGTN, a television network, and Xinhua, a news agency. The United Front Work Department (UFWD) controls organisations seeking to boost the party’s influence abroad, especially among ethnic Chinese. The ASPI Australian think-tank says the UFWD oversees Confucius Institutes, the government-supported cultural centres on university campuses abroad.

Officials know the party is not an attractive brand in the West. So these organs keep the party’s name out when operating abroad. At home, Mr Xi says China’s state media “must be surnamed ‘Party’”, to serve the party’s interests. But CGTN broadcasts do not advertise the connection. The station sometimes employs anchors who are not Chinese, with backgrounds in Western media such as the BBC or CNN. (America has designated CGTN and Xinhua as “foreign agents”; Britain has banned CGTN’s broadcasts.)
Chinese ambassadors are also party secretaries, though they rarely advertise this. This gives them authority over party bosses in Chinese state-owned firms in their countries. They may meet locals as ambassadors, but put on the party hat for talks with Chinese expatriates. Chinese firms often hold party meetings in China’s diplomatic missions, says Chen Yonglin, a diplomat who defected in 2005. And the party wants to develop more structures overseas. The aim seems to be to keep members engaged and ensure they are not seduced by Western political thinking. The party guards against ideological deviance, so its re-embrace of members when they return home is conditional on proof of loyalty.
Before the pandemic, 1.6m Chinese were studying abroad and 1.5m people worked overseas for Chinese multinationals. The share of students in the party was low: many would have gone abroad from school, at an age when few are members. But many graduate and exchange students join before leaving China. And membership is high in state-owned firms: more than 40% of the staff of centrally owned ones belong to the party. So there could be tens of thousands of members abroad.
The party is still coy. In 2017 a newspaper revealed that Chinese firms overseas were guided by a principle called the “five not-opens”: they keep quiet about the existence of their company’s party organisation as well as its activities, do not reveal their employees’ roles in the party or even their links with it, and do not make public any party documents. But under Mr Xi, state-owned firms abroad have to set up party branches. They appear to be complying. “Along the belt and road, the party flag is flying,” state media proclaim, referring to China’s global infrastructure-building.
The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has also called for the establishment of party organisations in the overseas operations of private firms. Huawei, a tech giant that has alarmed Western countries because of fears that China may exploit its network equipment for spying, employs thousands of party members. The firm’s policy is to set up party structures in its overseas businesses “according to local conditions”.
On foreign campuses, in deference to Western sensitivities, the party does not appear to be trying to create explicit branches among Chinese students and academics. But Chinese students are often eager to maintain party connections when abroad so as to restore ties when they return. One way to show political commitment is to organise meetings to study Mr Xi’s speeches. Some students abroad have formed cells for this purpose. University websites and social media in China have reported this at Nottingham University in Britain, South Korea’s Kyung Hee University and Missouri State University in America. In 2017 Chinese scholars formed a branch at the University of California, Davis, but soon dissolved it since American law requires those acting for a foreign political party to register with the government.
If party members form explicit organisations on campuses, they may find their freedoms constrained by the need to report on each other. But China can monitor the behaviour abroad of members and non-members alike even without a party presence. The Chinese Students and Scholars Associations that have been set up with government backing on most campuses with lots of Chinese students have no explicit links with the party, but their leaders report to Chinese diplomatic missions.
The party’s most intimidating global arm is the Chinese security apparatus. Unlike the army, police and civilian intelligence agencies do not belong to the formal party structure. But they are at its beck and call. China’s spies travel abroad to monitor troublesome dissidents. Wherever they are, they read citizens’ messages on social media. Chinese abroad who speak against the party take a risk: family members in China may suffer. There is little need for a party presence to instil fear. The tried and tested methods used by authoritarians the world over serve the party well.■

1782,"SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc is ahead of its hiring targets for its Chinese retail wealth management business and is exploring re-entering  India's private banking business, senior executives said, as part of its plan to make Asia and wealth key pillars of growth.
Under a strategy spearheaded by Group CEO Noel Quinn, HSBC (HSBA.L) is ploughing $3.5 billion into its wealth and personal banking business, in line with its ambition to become Asia's top wealth manager by 2025.
""We are the leading international bank in China, so we want to squeeze that opportunity,"" said CEO of Wealth and Personal Banking Nuno Matos, one of four top executives moving to Hong Kong from London this year as part of the bank's regional pivot.
""On the private banking side, we are now in clear expansion mode,"" Matos told Reuters in one of his first interviews since moving to the region.
Asia is the biggest region for HSBC, and the wealth and personal banking unit contributed 44% or $22 billion to London-headquartered HSBC's adjusted global revenue last year.
The bank is looking to boost its mobile wealth planning service, HSBC Pinnacle, in China by having about 700 personal wealth planners by the year-end instead of the 550 originally planned, Matos said.
HSBC's wealth management services include investments, insurance and asset management products, while private banking caters to the needs of those with investible assets of $5 million or more.
The bank had 20 people operating in China onshore private banking business at the end of last year, said Siew Meng Tan, head of HSBC Private Banking for Asia Pacific.
""By the end of this year, we will get to 64 and by the end of next year, we'll double that,"" she said.
HSBC is exploring whether to re-enter onshore private banking in India, where the ranks of the super rich are growing fast and record high stock markets have created a string of billion dollar start-ups.
HSBC exited the Indian private banking business in 2015 as part of a group strategy. The lucrative but very competitive Indian market has few foreign players.
""We want to bank mass affluent and high net worth customers. At this moment, the two major pillars we are expanding in India are insurance and asset management,"" Matos said. ""On the private banking side, we are not there yet and that's something that demands a strategic decision this year.""
Currently, HSBC is focusing on catering to wealthy Indians from its global hubs in Singapore, London and the Middle East.
'COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY'
HSBC  is also looking to bulk up its Singapore and Southeast Asia presence, Matos said. In August, the bank bought French insurer AXA's (AXAF.PA) Singapore assets for $575 million.  read more 
Though HSBC has a dominant Asia presence with its retail banking, particularly in the financial hub of Hong Kong, global leaders such as UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) rule the market for wealthier clients.
Global wealth managers remain bullish about their growth prospects in China despite an unprecedented regulatory crackdown  in the world's second-largest economy.
In a global wealth report published in June, Boston Consulting Group said Asia's wealth management revenue pools will soar faster than any other market worldwide, nearly doubling over the next five years to $52 billion.
""Asian wealth is expanding twice as fast as the rest of the world. This is a compelling opportunity for us,"" said Matos, who took charge of HSBC's newly combined division in February.
""I'm not going to re-do now our goals but what I can say is that in 2021, we will over-deliver our goals on the wealth side,"" he said.
After announcing plans last year to buy out its life insurance joint venture partner in China, HSBC is also keen to gain full control of its asset management company in the country, Matos said.",3
1783," (CNN Business)Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder and former CEO of Theranos, is taking the stand in her own criminal trial.Holmes began testimony on Friday afternoon in the San Jose courtroom during the first day of the defense's case. She is also expected to testify on Monday and Tuesday next week, the only days court is in session.Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces 11 federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each charge.Whether Holmes would testify was a big question looming over the trial. She has attended the trial each day, typically with her mother and occasionally her partner. On Friday, her partner, mother and at least one person who appeared to be her friend were in attendance. She was smiling as she took the stand and during much of her testimony.Off the bat, Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey asked her if she believed Theranos had developed technology that was capable of running any blood test. ""I did,"" Holmes testified. ""We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all the technologies in a laboratory. The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples and run that formula,"" Holmes testified, adding that by 2009 or 2010, the company had a ""breakthrough."" Downey then stepped backed to establish the background of the company's origin, including how she was a chemical engineering student at Stanford University and her first patent application.""I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money that they had saved for me to be able to go to college to work on my patent,"" she testified. ""Then I went to try to raise or borrow money.""""Were you able to?"" her attorney asked.""I was,"" she replied.The original patent was not for blood testing. Rather, she started with the idea of a pill that could be swallowed without any other actions needed, she said.Holmes went on to explain the evolution of her idea from a pill to a patch to a benchtop device. ""As I started talking to people about what could be useful for a pharmaceutical clinical trial, I learned people were interested in a benchtop or a tabletop device and we moved to trying to build that,"" she said.She testified that she then built out a prototype and set out to raise financing to develop it into a product. She testified she was introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas ""by someone who had gone to college with my dad."" ""I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long-term,"" she testified, adding that he did a ""very comprehensive diligence process.""Holmes said that process included ""giving him a lot of information about our patents."" ""He asked us to get an audit of our financials,"" she testified. ""He wanted copies of contracts and other information about the business. He wanted to speak to people that we were talking to and interacting with.""He ultimately invested and served as Theranos' chairman of the board for a number of years.Holmes' attorneys previously indicated in court documents that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. They indicated that she is ""likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed, relied on, and deferred to Mr. Balwani,"" who is nearly 20 years her senior. The filings were from 2020 and unsealed just before the trial kicked off with jury selection in late August. Balwani, according to a court filing from his attorneys, ""adamantly denies"" the claims.Her attorneys also indicated plans to have an expert testify about the psychological, emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of Balwani.A Stanford University dropout, Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 with the mission to revolutionize blood testing. Inspired by her stated fear of needles, the company promised patients the ability to test for conditions such as cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos had struck up partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway, and a who's who list of board members and investors. Then it all came crashing down. A damning investigation by The Wall Street Journal in October 2015 called into question the capabilities of the company's proprietary blood testing machine, Edison, as well as Theranos' testing methods. Theranos was subsequently sued by investors for fraud and had its US blood-testing license revoked. The firm settled ""massive fraud"" charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately dissolved in September 2018.",0
1784,"ECONOMY PASSENGERS taking one of the few international flights still running have had an unusually pleasant experience of late. Exasperated cabin crew battling to close overhead lockers full to bursting with wheelie-bags, duty-free booze and laptop cases have been replaced by masked attendants presiding over planes two-thirds full at best and often with only a handful of passengers. Some report sleeping across empty rows of seats. The collapse of passenger numbers and revenues will damage the industry. Yet previous disruptions have shaken up the airlines to the benefit of the flying public. It could happen again.
The advantages of the previous big interruption to air travel, the second world war, are debatable. The experience of servicemen crammed into uncomfortably spartan transport aircraft, argues Eric Zuelow in his book, “A History of Modern Tourism”, created a generation without pre-war expectations of air travel as glamorous and luxurious. When those same aircraft were converted for civilian use, travellers accepted being packed in like sardines. The cattle-truck economics worked in passengers’ favour when deregulation brought competition to a previously highly regulated and often state-controlled industry. Air fares tumbled everywhere. Between 1995 and 2014 they fell by half in real terms, according to IATA, a club of the world’s airlines.

World wars aside, past crises have passed speedily. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the financial crisis of 2009 were “nasty shocks”, says Brian Pearce, chief economist of IATA, but “small bumps in the road” compared with covid-19. At its height in April 2020 flying was down by 94% over a year earlier, measured by total revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs). Current estimates are that RPKs in 2020 will be down by 66% on 2019, when (including domestic flights) 4.5bn passengers took to the skies. Only 1.8bn people buckled up last year. By the end of it, some 30% of the global fleet was still grounded, according to Cirium, an aviation-data firm. And the sense of optimism that had slowly grown took a fresh hit early in 2021 as more transmissible and dangerous variants of the virus emerged, leading to renewed border closures and capacity cuts.

The plunge comes after years of bumper growth. In each 15-year period since 1988 RPKS doubled. They were expected to do so again between 2018 and 2033, according to Airbus, the European half of the duopoly that builds the world’s biggest passenger jets. Boeing, its American rival, notes an acceleration over the past decade, when growth averaged 6.5% per year, above the long-term average of 5%. Darren Hulst of Boeing is confident of an eventual return to a growth trend of 5% a year, even if over the decade from 2019 the number may be closer to 3.7%. In the meantime it will be a rough ride for airlines. Only 2.8bn passengers are expected to take to the air this year.

Signs of recovery are scant. Domestic flying in China and Russia has largely recovered, but in Australia it is still down by 86% and in America, the world’s biggest domestic market, it has fallen by 60%. International routes are suffering the most. Despite huge capacity cuts (only a quarter of the international flights scheduled a year earlier were still running in January), load factors are still low. Planes are often taking off a third full at most.
The opportunity for travellers to stretch out comes at a heavy cost. Full service will not resume for a long while. Mr Pearce says the gradual deployment of vaccines merely makes him more confident about his baseline forecast of a return to 2019 levels by 2024. Not all air travel will recover at the same pace. Domestic flying will continue its rebound, followed by regional international traffic. The last part of the industry to refill its seats will be long-haul flying. This has a disproportionate impact on legacy airlines that still rely most on long-haul international routes.
All airlines face a bleak period. Rather than increase by 4% on 2019 levels to $872bn, air-transport revenues in 2020 have plummeted to $340bn, reckons IATA. In a good year the industry makes an operating profit of $50bn. Losses for 2020 are forecast at $118bn and, even if the second half of this year sees a recovery, they will still be around $38bn in 2021.
Airlines have responded by slashing costs, getting rid of staff and cutting fleets, yet carriers continue to burn cash at a rate of $5bn-6bn a month. Looking at the cash and liquid assets of carriers in mid-2020, the median airline had enough funding to last just eight-and-a-half months (or half way through this month), according to IATA. Some big names have succumbed. Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers, sought bankruptcy protection in November 2020. Dozens of smaller airlines including FlyBe, a British low-cost carrier, Virgin Australia and Avianca, based in Latin America, have gone to the wall.
Two types of carrier have the best chance of survival. Those with sound business models and strong balance-sheets, such as Ryanair in Europe, Southwest in America and AirAsia, are all low-cost carriers ready for a rebound. And legacy carriers, mostly propped up by governments, will keep their grip on long-haul flying when it returns.
Subsidies, subsidies
Support for airlines has been prodigious. Governments are used to helping airlines for reasons of national pride and to maintain international connections. Many countries in the Middle East, India and Africa cling to ownership of loss-making national carriers. Others are just returning to the orbit of governments. Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, has promised to “do what is necessary to guarantee the survival of Air France”. Germany’s Lufthansa has had a bumper aid package. America’s airlines, never shy to extend an upturned palm, benefited handsomely from its CARES stimulus act, signed into law in March 2020, which set aside $25bn in grants for airlines and the same in loans and guarantees.
The result will be an industry wallowing in debt and beholden once again to the state. Aviation Strategy, a consultancy, puts the total in 2020 of government support plus loans from banks, other investors and aircraft-leasing companies at $600bn, an increase of $170bn since the end of 2019. Keith McMullen, a partner at the consultancy, points out that most government aid has come in the form of loans, the terms of which incentivise rapid repayment. But the fragile state of the industry will make that tricky. European governments may then be obliged to swap debt for equity.
A return to the days before deregulation and the rise of low-cost carriers, when governments controlled national flag-carriers, set (high) fares and decided routes based on national goals rather than demand, is the fear of Andrew Charlton of Aviation Advocacy, another consultancy. America’s big carriers, Asian giants such as Singapore Airlines, and Lufthansa and Air France-KLM may be subject to government meddling. The terms of bail-outs for Air France stipulate that it must no longer compete with high-speed rail on some routes; Lufthansa’s decide what planes it may purchase.
That could give the low-cost carriers an advantage. Michael O’Leary, boss of Ryanair, admits to mixed feelings about state aid. Although it is “hugely distorting”, it is also likely to “sustain high-cost employment”, he says. And high-cost competitors are what he and his kind thrive on. Legacy airlines, already having to compete harder on short-haul routes and often weighed down by heavy pension-fund deficits, could struggle to adapt to an uncertain future that will require flexibility and nimbleness as well as lower costs.
Moreover, legacy carriers rely especially heavily on lucrative business travellers, a sector that may never recover fully, to subsidise seats at the back of the plane. If business customers and feeder routes dwindle, the complex web of domestic and international flights becomes harder to sustain, reducing connections and forcing up long-haul prices.
Not all will suffer. British Airways has slashed costs and raised capital and is fast-tracking its previous restructuring effort to compete with low-cost rivals. Other models look riskier. The Gulf carriers—Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways—that have grown swiftly in recent years may struggle. They lack a large domestic market to fall back on, unlike their Chinese competitors, and passengers may prefer not to mix with people from all over the world as they change planes at vast airports in the Gulf. If their model falters, the sky will be clearer for China’s state-controlled behemoths, which are already eating away at long-haul routes.
Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Wizz Air, based in eastern Europe, sniff opportunities. Mr O’Leary has promised to slash fares to rekindle his business. His ability to compete with airlines under the heavy hand of the state will be helped by several factors. The availability of bargains from embattled planemakers and leasing companies will help carriers in decent health or with new business models. Ryanair confirmed an order for another 75 Boeing 737MAXS in December, taking its total to 210. The plane’s grounding after two fatal crashes had led to cancelled orders, so a big vote of confidence from Ryanair was surely worth a hefty discount. Wizz Air, which relies on more robust parts of the market such as younger flyers and east Europeans going west for work and returning to visit family, also has big growth plans. Southwest, America’s biggest low-cost carrier, is in expansion mode as the country’s legacy carriers retreat. Tony Fernandes, boss of Air Asia, based in Malaysia, is “quietly optimistic” about 2021, and hopes to start three new airlines in the region.
A surplus of pilots where there was a dearth and unemployed cabin crew looking for work could also boost low-cost carriers. Once-scarce landing slots at busy airports may become more available. And, if prices rise for long-haul seats, this may rekindle interest in low-cost long-haul services, which have a patchy history. The demise of Norwegian was largely down to its inability to make profits on long-haul routes. The business model of short-haul carriers does not easily translate to long-haul flights, where fuel is a bigger share of costs and schedules are compromised by time differences and airport curfews that do not affect short-haul travel. But a new plane, Airbus’s A321XLR, a single-aisle jet with the ability to fly long-haul routes, could change the equation again.
The commercial-aviation business will be smaller for years to come. Yet opportunities abound, especially if legacy carriers fail to adapt. Higher fares and lower costs will attract competitors that threaten the old guard. In 20 years’ time air travel will be back on track and growing again but the old names may no longer be on the tarmac. Just as Pan Am and TWA are distant memories, so a clutch of now familiar airlines may become relics of the past.■",2
1785,"In testimony to Congress, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, admitted that prices are increasing at a faster pace than central bankers have forecast, but reiterated his view that pressures will eventually ease, avoiding any return to 1970s levels of inflation. Fed officials now think consumer prices in America will be 3.4% higher in the fourth quarter than a year before, up from 2.4% in an earlier projection (in May a different measure of inflation hit 5%). Mr Powell pointed out that price rises are sharpest in sectors linked to the reopening of the economy, and will recede.

Microsoft’s market capitalisation reached $2trn, making it only the second American company, after Apple, to do so. It hit a valuation of $1trn in April 2019. Microsoft’s share price is up by 20% since the start of the year, outperforming Amazon and Apple, but not Alphabet, which has seen its stock rise by around 40%.
The median price of a home in America (excluding new builds) was $350,300 in May, a record according to the National Association of Realtors and up by 24% year on year. The NAR has also reported that sales are rocketing of vacation homes, “a hot commodity” as people seek peace and quiet to work remotely.
China’s central bank stepped up its clampdown on bitcoin and other digital currencies, hauling in officials from the country’s biggest banks to discuss the problem of “cryptocurrency speculation”. China eventually wants its citizens to use a government-backed cryptocurrency that is being tested in pilot projects. The price of bitcoin, meanwhile, recovered somewhat after falling below $30,000 for the first time since January.
The market for iron ore is also attracting the ire of Chinese regulators. The National Development and Reform Commission, an agency of the State Council, has said it will investigate “malicious speculation” in trading for iron ore and “severely punish” any wrongdoing. China is eager to dampen soaring commodity prices, which are pumping up inflationary pressures.
The share prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee American mortgages, plunged by more than 30% after the Supreme Court rejected most claims brought by a group of hedge funds, including Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square. They claimed the government, attempting to recoup bail-out funds, illegally seized $100bn of profits earned by Fannie and Freddie since 2012. The justices disagreed.
America’s Federal Trade Commission is to evaluate  Amazon’s proposed takeover of MGM film studio. The commission’s new chairwoman, Lina Khan, is an outspoken critic of Amazon and other big tech. Amazon also faces a broadside over its working practices. The Teamsters union is looking to escalate its fight to organise workers at Amazon warehouses.
The European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation into Google, to establish whether it favours its own online display advertising technology across its platform. The review will probe the heart of Google’s monetising model, including ad buys on YouTube.

Morrisons, Britain’s fourth-biggest supermarket chain, rejected a takeover approach from a private-equity firm. Its share price leapt amid speculation that other buyers may be about to join the queue with their own bids.
John McAfee, the eponymous founder of the computer-security company, died in a suspected suicide in a Spanish prison, where he was awaiting extradition to America for tax evasion. Mr McAfee sold his firm in 1994, and had since led an unsettled life, fleeing Belize after the death of a neighbour and running for president in America as a Libertarian. He had recently been promoting cryptocurrencies.
The Brazilian congress approved a bill to float the shares of Eletrobras, Brazil’s state-owned electricity provider and the biggest utility in South America, on the stockmarket. The government hopes to reap $20bn from the sale, which would be the first major privatisation under President Jair Bolsonaro.
America’s big banks took further steps to prepare workers for a return to the office. Press reports suggest that Morgan Stanley will not allow staff or clients to enter its offices in New York unless they have been fully vaccinated and that JPMorgan Chase wants its employees to register their vaccine status on an internal website.
Peloton, meanwhile, rolled out a corporate-wellness programme for businesses that offer subsidies for its digitally connected fitness bikes, exercise programmes and other workouts for those aspiring to be svelte. That is one incentive that could entice workers back to the office. Or maybe not.",2
1786,"SOMEONE WISE once said that all the problems of capitalism are agency problems. Agency costs arise when somebody (the principal) delegates a task to somebody else (the agent) and their interests are at odds. In the textbook example, the principal is a manager, the agents are employees. It is in the manager’s interest that the agent works hard. The more effort each worker puts in, the higher the firm’s output and the greater its profits. But the employer cannot gauge the true effort of the workers, especially if the results are a team effort. Each worker has an incentive to shirk.
Asset management has a double agency problem. The first lies with the separation of ownership and control in large public companies. Shareholders are the principals, who delegate running the firm to managers. Shareholders care about returns on their investment, but managers have different goals. They may value perks and prestige—a plush office, a company jet, a high-profile merger deal—more than profits. Running a big company is a complex task. It is hard to be sure if the bosses are making a good fist of it. No individual shareholder has a big enough stake to make the effort of monitoring worthwhile.

Mechanisms have emerged to limit such agency costs. A classic paper published in 1976 by Michael Jensen and William Meckling argued that loading a public firm with debt was a useful device to stop managers frittering away shareholders’ cash. Bosses feel greater pressure to cut costs and raise revenues if they must meet regular interest payments. The leveraged buy-out boom of the 1980s was predicated on the idea of debt as a tool to focus the minds of managers. Private-equity firms employ this trick.
Another way to limit this sort of agency problem is to give managers the right to buy discounted shares once their price reaches a predetermined target. Stock options, it is argued, make managers act as if they were shareholders. Yet this device just creates a different sort of agency problem. Traders of shares use quarterly earnings as a rough-and-ready guide to how well a company is run. Managers know this. So they eschew investment projects that are in the long-run interests of shareholders in order to boost short-term profits, lifting the share price and the value of their stock options.
The second agency problem arises from conflicts of interest between asset managers and those on whose behalf they invest. It is in the interests of investors that asset managers seek out the best long-term returns. But fund-management firms are paid a fixed percentage of the value of assets. To attract capital into their funds, they may opt for faddish stocks that do well in the short term, but whose shortcomings become apparent only in the long run. They may shun unfashionable stocks, even if they believe they are good long-term investments. Once an asset manager has captured funds to manage, they tend to stay. A good recent run will lure in more funds. This agency problem has no easy solution—but investors could be quicker to ask searching questions.",2
1787,"AT A KEY moment in the film “Jaws”, police chief Martin Brody, having known that a shark attack was possible, witnesses one actually happen. The director, Steven Spielberg, underlines the transformative nature of Brody’s shock with a shot which makes inspired use of a camera technique called a “dolly zoom”. Nothing on screen actually moves. But Brody’s guilty face seems to rush towards the audience, taking up more and more of the frame. At the same time his surroundings, rather than being displaced, are revealed more fully.
The report released on August 9th by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the first part of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report (AR6), presents the spectacle of the possible becoming real in a similarly unnerving way, mixing close-up alarm with wide-angle context. It is a starker and blunter document than its predecessor in AR5, which was published in 2013. The statements in the summary expressing “high confidence” handily outnumber those that offer only “medium confidence”. Last time around the two categories were roughly level pegging.

Part of that higher confidence is down to better science, which is welcome. Another part is down to bitter experience, which is not. The report stresses that the world is living through climate change, not watching it draw near. Its 234 authors base their conclusions, in a phrase that acts as something of a refrain, on “multiple lines of evidence”. Some of that evidence comes from computer models, and some from improved physical understanding of various planetary processes. Crucially, an increasing proportion comes from direct observations of the way in which the world has changed so far.
Start with the predictions of what lies dead ahead. Over the past decade the Earth has been between 0.95°C and 1.2°C (1.7-2.2°F) hotter than it was in the second half of the 19th century; the best estimate is 1.1°C. That is more than 0.2°C higher than the change that AR5 found when it made the same comparison in the previous decade. Though some of the difference is now put down to AR5 having underestimated the then current temperatures, most is seen as being due to continued heating.
The total amount by which the planet will heat up depends pretty closely on cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions. That allows the “carbon budgets” associated with various levels of worldwide temperature rise to be calculated. For AR6 this exercise in climate accounting has been gone through all over again.
Worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions since 1850 are now put at 2,400bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, give or take 10%. Every subsequent 1,000bn tonnes is likely to cause between 0.27°C and 0.63°C more warming. If that seems quite imprecise, it is a much tighter estimate than was previously possible. Such calculations rely ultimately on how sensitive global temperatures are to rising carbon-dioxide levels. That crucial number is one of those things which is easier to estimate now that there is more experience to go on. The error range is notably smaller now than it was in AR5 (see chart 1).

The budget associated with a 50% chance of keeping warming below 1.5°C—the more ambitious of the two goals laid out in the Paris agreement of 2015—allows just 500bn more tonnes to be emitted. That is about 15 years of industrial emissions at current rates. To avoid busting that budget would require the whole world, not just rich countries, to get net emissions of carbon dioxide down to zero before 2050. That is a tall order, to put it mildly. Even the most ambitious of the various emissions scenarios modelled by the IPCC‘s experts offers less than a 50% chance of staying below 1.5°C of heating.
The very-low-emission scenarios do offer a fighting chance of keeping warming below 2°C. But the emission cuts they require go far beyond what the nations of the world have currently promised. What is more, those scenarios mandate not just heroic emission cuts but also “negative emissions”—techniques that actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus paying back some of the carbon budget spent previously. It is just about conceivable that, if emissions fall very quickly and carbon-dioxide removal scales up really well, warming may exceed 1.5°C during the coming decades but fall back below that level by the end of the century.
Happily, the report confirms that removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere might be a plausible way of reducing temperatures. Since such removals now offer the only way of reconciling the modest near-term cuts currently enshrined in national policies with the much more dramatic long-term ambitions those same countries proclaim, this is just as well. If the IPCC had found large-scale carbon-dioxide removal untenable that would have put the kibosh on the whole idea of reaching net-zero emissions.
But the report also notes that such removals could affect more than just temperatures. They could also have an impact on food production, biodiversity and water availability and quality, especially if they are carried out through the use of huge forestry plantations. And it has nothing to say about how those systems might operate or how much they would cost—that work is left to the reports on impacts and on mitigation, which are due out next year.
You’re going to need a cleaner boat
Meanwhile, in wide-angle, the predicted consequences of a warming world are becoming clearer and more fine-grained. Again, this is partly the product of better scientific understanding, and partly the product of direct experience. In 2013 AR5 referred to just three studies linking extreme weather events to rising temperatures. The authors of the latest report were able to assess hundreds of such event-attribution papers. Those allow it to make the clear statement that climate change is already affecting every inhabited region of the planet, with human influence contributing to many observed changes in weather and climate extremes.

The current trend towards more frequent and intense heavy rainfall will continue, but not monotonically; rain and snowfall will become more variable within seasons and, probably, from year to year. The authors are thus fairly certain that flooding will be more frequent and intense in most of Asia and Africa if the world warms by 1.5°C, and pretty sure the same changes will be seen in North America and Europe. Earlier melting of mountain snow-packs will add to the flood risk in some areas; in others, higher sea levels will raise the risk, as will the greater frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones.
Heatwaves will climb in number and severity. Extreme “wet-bulb” temperatures—a measure which includes the degree to which humidity makes it harder for the human body to shed heat—will become more common more quickly than unadjusted high temperatures do. Temperatures on the hottest days in some mid-latitude regions, including parts of Europe, will rise 1.5 to 2 times as fast as global warming more generally.
The oceans will heat up more slowly than the land. But as they do so they will expand and rise, a trend exacerbated by the melting of glaciers and ice caps. The warming will not be even. The Arctic will heat up more than other seas; in every one of the IPCC‘s scenarios there will be sea-ice-free days in the Arctic by the middle of the century. There will be local aberrations, too. Marine heatwaves—short-lived bursts of hot water which have only recently become a topic of concern—are expected to continue to become more common, especially in the tropics and the Arctic.
Ocean warming will also suppress the tendency of waters from different depths to mix. Both the heatwaves and the increased stratification will have ecological effects that may be profound, both in the Arctic and beyond.
Generally speaking, what is wet becomes wetter, what is dry, drier, and what is uncommon more common. The rarer the event, the higher the likelihood that it will become more frequent. Even at 1.5°C of heating the report warns there will be some events—heatwaves, droughts and such—that are more severe than any that have been observed before. This is true at a global level as well as a regional one. “Low-likelihood, high-impact” events are, by their nature, hard to be specific about. It is a good bet they become more likely with higher temperatures. But even at comparatively modest levels of warming such calamities as widespread forest dieback or a collapsing Antarctic ice sheet are hard to completely rule out.
Recommendations about what to do are not part of this report’s remit. But nevertheless it pushes hard for more and stronger action on methane. In terms of its contribution to warming so far, methane is second only to carbon dioxide (see chart 2). Atmospheric levels of the stuff, like those of carbon dioxide, are higher than at any other point in human history. But unlike carbon dioxide, atmospheric methane is transient—it has an atmospheric half-life of less than a decade. This means that cuts in methane emissions pay off much faster than cuts in carbon dioxide. If the world is really serious about trying to keep below 2°C of warming, let alone 1.5°C, doubling down on attempts to cut methane emissions, both from industry and agriculture, should be a high priority.

As the report points out, this is particularly important because of the effects of another pollutant. Sulphates are given off mostly by coal plants and the sorts of heavy fuel oils that power big ships. They have the opposite effect to methane and carbon dioxide: by reflecting sunlight back into space, they cool the planet. The IPCC reckons sulphate pollution keeps the world about 0.5°C cooler than it would otherwise be. Without it, the world would probably have already breached the Paris aspiration of limiting temperature rises to 1.5°C.
The problem is that sulphates are deadly. Over the past few decades they have contributed a great deal to the particulate air pollution that has killed tens of millions. Clean-air laws have seen them increasingly scrubbed out of fuels and smoke stacks. The IPCC report finds that continuing this good work on air pollution would contribute to global warming in all the emission scenarios it studied. That is another reason, it says, to promote quick and lasting cuts in methane emissions. Without increased ambition on methane, cleaner, clearer air will add to the challenge of rising temperatures.

Mr Spielberg’s coup de cinema in “Jaws” marks the moment when the police chief realises that the opportunity to avert calamity is gone; his inaction has led to a covert threat becoming a blood-in-the-water reality. As a result the chief is seized by a new fervour for action—one which brings him into direct conflict with the mayor, who prefers to minimise the risks so as not to scare off the tourists.
When it comes to climate change the realisation has hardly been instantaneous; it has been dawning for at least a decade or so. But coming as it does in a summer of shattered temperature records and terrifying fires and floods, an IPCC report in which predictions of future global warming are, more than ever before, backed up with observations should offer a similar punctuation. Deciding how much action to take on climate change is politically hard, because it means imposing high costs today for largely hidden benefits tomorrow. But when, in November, the world’s governments get together in Glasgow to discuss how they can improve on the insufficient action they have taken to date, they need to think like people who have seen the blood in the water.

1788,"RAYMOND SHIEH’S “hell vaccine kit” includes three vials in green, blue and red, and a large syringe, all made from joss paper. The kit will be burnt as an offering to the dead, supplying them in the afterlife with something they could not receive in this one: a vaccine for covid-19. The vials’ colours represent Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac, the three main vaccines used in Malaysia, which has reported some 20,000 new cases every day in the past month. Though half of over-11s are now fully jabbed, the country’s death rate from covid is the highest in South-East Asia.

“It has been a hard year for Malaysians and many have died waiting to be vaccinated,” says Mr Shieh, who runs a shop selling prayer items in the southern state of Johor and spent two days crafting the new product last month as covid deaths surged. He says he has received more than 300 orders, at 23 ringgit ($5.50) apiece, from people in Malaysia as well as in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. “I want to keep the kits affordable,” he says. “I hope this item will give my clients some peace of mind.”

For many practitioners of traditional Chinese religions, such as Taoism, the burning of joss paper and other paper paraphernalia is a way to meet the unfulfilled needs of their deceased loved ones. Adherents believe that most spirits go through the ten courts of Diyu, or hell, before achieving salvation. Funerary rituals hasten the journey. Offerings help ease the spirits’ suffering along the way. These rites typically conclude with the burning of “hell money”, as well as any other items that the dead may need for a comfortable afterlife—clothes or houses, for example, but also iPhones and Ferraris—all made of joss paper. Mr Shieh sells a life-size replica of the latest iPhone for 350 ringgit.
Every year during “Hungry Ghost Festival”, which usually falls in August or September, believers across the region pay homage to their deceased ancestors, as well as to sundry spirits, who visit the living as the gates of hell are opened. In addition to burning various paper offerings, the devout leave out food to placate the hungry ghosts. Stage performances of Chinese operas and Getai, or live song-and-dance numbers, were common features to appease the spirits before the pandemic. These are often held outdoors, under a big tent, with at least a front row of empty seats for the ghosts-of-honour, while the living crowd on the back benches. Such performances have gone online in most countries after being cancelled entirely last year.
In normal times Taoist and Buddhist vigils for the dead usually last for several days before the body is cremated. Yet because of covid, bodies must be disposed of immediately. Many believers are pained by the thought of not having paid their respects to family and friends. “Without proper prayer and rites, how will he rest in peace?” says Eric Leong, who recently lost his father to covid. A vaccine for the dead is one way to ease the pain.",2
1789,"JIANGNAN SHIPYARD lies on an alluvial island at the mouth of the Yangzi river. It has grown rapidly since it moved there from nearby Shanghai in 2009, churning out destroyers, icebreakers and landing craft for the Chinese navy. The jewel in its crown is under construction. China is saying little about it, but satellite imagery reveals a near-complete flight deck in a corner of the yard where, less than 15 years ago, there was only farmland.
For now, the vessel-to-be is blandly known to military analysts as the Type 003. It will be China’s second domestically built aircraft-carrier and the largest ship that has ever served in the Chinese fleet. Experts at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think-tank in Washington, have analysed satellite pictures such as the one above, which was taken in June by Planet Labs, an American firm. They conclude that the ship will be about as long as New York’s Chrysler Building is high: about 320 metres. She will mark another leap forward in China’s advance as a naval power.

China got into the carrier game by an unusual route. In 1985 it bought a clapped-out Australian carrier for scrap, then spent years studying its design and putting its deck ashore for flying practice. Thirteen years later Chinese investors purchased a half-built Soviet carrier and towed it from Ukraine to China, purportedly to turn it into a floating casino. Instead it was refurbished by the navy and commissioned in 2012 as the Liaoning. That helped China to build a knock-off, the Shandong, which was commissioned in December 2019 and has been undergoing sea trials.
The Type 003 could be launched this year, state media say. But building carriers is not the same as sailing them. Flying planes off wobbly decks is hard. In America, thousands of jets and pilots were lost in the formative years of naval aviation. It is also difficult to keep a carrier safe from missiles and submarines, and to integrate one into a “strike group” of warships. “It’s taken us over 100 years to get that right,” noted an American admiral in September. China hopes to be quicker.
There are signs that it is upping the tempo. Last year the navy put both of its carriers to sea at the same time. In April the Liaoning sailed through the Miyako Strait, south of the Japanese island of Okinawa; exercised near Taiwan and in the South China Sea; and returned the same way. Its escorts included the Renhai-class destroyer, one of the world’s most capable ships of its kind, as well as a Fuyu-class support vessel, which can replenish carrier strike-groups far from home.
Some Western analysts are impressed by China’s progress. “Considering what they had to start with, they’ve done a very good job,” says Mark Montgomery, a retired American rear-admiral who commanded a carrier strike-group in the Pacific. China had little to go on, he says, other than “History Channel documentaries” and occasional glimpses of American carriers—back in friendlier times when Chinese sailors were given tours of American ships. Even so, a carrier designed in the early 1980s, and another based on it, hardly represent the cutting-edge of sea power. “I don’t worry from a US Navy point of view,” says Mr Montgomery. “These are just targets for our submarines.”
That is where the Type 003 comes in. CSIS reckons she is already 10 metres longer than her predecessors. She is likely to be the world’s largest non-American carrier for many years, says Rick Joe, who studies China’s armed forces, and “perhaps the most capable conventionally powered carrier of its era”. She will have a larger deck and room for more jets than the Shandong’s complement of around two dozen.
More important than the ship’s size is the way that planes will take off from her. The runways of both the Liaoning and the Shandong, like those of Britain’s newest carriers, are curved at their ends like ski jumps, which limits take-off weight. The Type 003 is expected to have a catapult, a system currently used only by America and France. This would allow her to launch planes with more fuel and weapons—and not just fighter jets. The existing carriers rely largely on land-based aircraft for vital tasks such as monitoring by airborne radar, anti-submarine warfare and aerial refuelling. The Type 003 could accommodate such planes, and thus venture farther.
The Chinese navy does not plan to stop there. It is widely assumed that the Type 003’s successor is being planned. It may be nuclear-powered. That would mark another step-change in capability. More fuel could be carried for planes, rather than for propulsion. The absence of a gas turbine would leave more room for weapons and cargo. A nuclear reactor could also power more potent catapults—ones that use electromagnetic induction motors, rather than steam—and, eventually, high-energy lasers for shooting down missiles.
Mastering these technologies and learning the craft of conducting high-intensity air operations at sea will take years. American carriers can launch and recover waves of 10-12 aircraft more than a dozen times a day. The Chinese navy is far from matching this pace. Its planes are lightly armed, even compared with European counterparts, says Alessio Patalano of King’s College London. “I’ve yet to see a single picture of a Chinese plane taking off from a deck with a full payload,” he says.
Yet the Chinese navy will get plenty of practice. America’s Indo-Pacific Command suggests that China will operate four carriers by 2025. British defence intelligence reckons that it may have as many as five by 2030. The expert consensus is that China plans eventually to build a fleet of somewhere between six and ten. That would put it within spitting distance of America’s fleet of 11, the world’s largest.
American and Chinese carriers are unlikely to be pitted against one another at close quarters. They would be targeted by missiles launched from hundreds if not thousands of kilometres away, from sea or land, long before their jets would clash. “China would not deploy its carriers in the front line,” says Hu Bo of Peking University. But, in peacetime, carriers are potent symbols of power. America’s dispatch of two towards the Taiwan Strait during an escalation of cross-strait tension in 1996 is seared in the memory of Chinese leaders. And carriers could help China to defeat a weaker adversary. The Liaoning’s prominent foray into the South China Sea hints at things to come. Carriers extend a protective aerial bubble over the ships around them. That allows their whole flotilla to patrol farther with confidence. The future air wing of the Type 003 will be almost as large as the entire air force of the Philippines.
And China’s sallies need not be confined to the Pacific—a large pier added this year to China’s naval base in the Red Sea port-state of Djibouti will allow Chinese carriers to dock there and thus make regular trips to the Indian Ocean. The Type 003 may be coming to a port near you. ■",2
1790,"A CHINESE APHORISM teaches that “the young should never go to Sichuan, and the old should never leave”. It is but the first rule broken by a wave of youthful newcomers. The ancients reasoned that Sichuan’s joie de vivre would sap adolescent ambition. But today the stressed and the free-spirited come to Chengdu, the provincial capital, to go against the grain. For many, this means rejecting China’s rigid formula for success in work and life.
The city of 16m brims with young subcultures, from rap fans and techno ravers to wearers of Hanfu, an 1,800-year-old style of dress. Its fashions are fresh and whimsical. Oxford Economics, a consultancy, predicts that by 2030 Chengdu’s cool kids will spend over $9bn a year on their clothes and shoes, as much as their counterparts in Melbourne or Miami.

No one is sure how this inland city got so edgy. Local hipsters point out that cool begets cool. Cheap rents, a culture of slow leisure—its ubiquitous teahouses serve it by the flask—and a permissive local government all help. But apparatchiks do not embrace countercultures, and that tension fuels its underground scene.
Twice they have shut down TAG, a small but beloved electronic-music club on the 21st floor of an office building. The club’s owner, Ellen Zhang, has put TAG’s “nice” techno beats on USB sticks and given them to local officials to win them over. That helped: one has taken to playing the mix in his car on the way to work.
Ms Zhang kicks out unruly clubbers and drug users (whom China punishes severely). Fans do not just come for the music. TAG is a space where many feel “comfortable” and it is “easier to feel free than outside”, she says. For long nights that stretch past dawn, ravers escape “To Another Galaxy”. Among the regulars is Shinjil, a soft-spoken teacher from Inner Mongolia, who left home on a whim because he could no longer stand his “clock-in, clock-out” job.
A few escape instead to a spiritual realm. Master Zhao, a 25-year-old Sichuanese monk, starts his day as Shinjil’s ends, by banging gongs at 5am. He once worked in Beijing’s art scene. He calls the monkhood, which he joined two years ago, “a profession of pleasure”. He had grown tired of feeling he was never satisfied in life. “Even if you have 1,000 houses, you can only rest on a single bed,” he points out sagely, sipping tea.
His path is still unusual. But a group of non-conformists in his generation call themselves “Buddhist youths”. This is meant to show that they have no desire to achieve anything; instead of dreaming big, they accept being average. To show this they may eat the same meal every day, or yield to others over decisions. They say they are happy-go-lucky. Real monks sniff that they are slackers. Their passive rebellion irks the state. People’s Daily, a government organ, warned Buddhist youths that they must not forget “the issues that we need to put our hearts into” (support for the Communist Party being presumably among them).",2
1791,"“THE VIRUS MYSTERY”, broadcast on August 12th, drew uncommonly wide attention for a Danish television documentary. That was because it featured Peter Ben Embarek, an expert on food security and zoonotic diseases, casting doubt on the conclusions of a “joint study” on the origins of the covid-19 pandemic carried out earlier this year under the auspices of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Dr Ben Embarek was the senior WHO figure who went to China as part of that study.
In March the joint study reported that it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus had been released in a laboratory accident. Dr Ben Embarek revealed that this conclusion did not come from a balanced assessment of all the relevant evidence but from a steadfast refusal by the Chinese members of the joint study to support anything stronger. Indeed they only allowed even that minimal assessment on the condition that the report did not call for further investigation into the question. He also pointed out that the idea that the point of spillover was someone collecting bat samples for research purposes belongs in the “likely” basket, along with other human interactions with wild bats.

Problems in the joint study had long been clear. Within the WHO one source describes it as “riddled with compromises and sloppiness”. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, was uneasy about the way it was carried out. He pushed back at the marginalisation of the lab-leak hypothesis, particularly when the final report was released in March. He has since called for further investigations into it, as well as into other possibilities.
The further unravelling of the joint study matters because, more than a year and a half after the covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, a city in Hubei, was first recognised as the work of a new pathogen, there has been nothing like a thorough international investigation of how that pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, got into humans and spread round the world. The pandemic’s death toll stands at 9m-18m, according to a model which The Economist has built on the basis of excess-mortality reports and other indicators. The question of how it started matters both for the relatives of the dead and for those who wish to prevent such an outbreak happening again. China’s efforts to stop the world from answering it are both shabby and, to an extent, self-defeating. The more the truth seems hidden, the more it seems suspicious.
Earnest calls for an international investigation into the origins of covid-19 began in April 2020, voiced most clearly by Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia. The next month the World Health Assembly, the gathering of government representatives which serves as the WHO’s decision-making body, passed a motion calling for a study into the origins of the pandemic. But in order to be acceptable to China—which had reacted furiously to Mr Morrison’s original suggestion—the work was set up as a joint research project between two teams of scientists, one Chinese, one international. And it was to be based on “scientific and collaborative field missions”, rather than a targeted and forensic inquiry into all the relevant circumstances.
The terms of reference, which were subsequently negotiated behind closed doors, allowed the Chinese hosts to frame the joint study’s work in the way which best suited them. The study was set up to build on pre-existing Chinese research, not to delve into unvetted data. Investigating the laboratories that had been working with coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan was not part of its terms of reference.
After a lot of wrangling, the international team got to China in January this year. Data about the first reported covid-19 cases, those from December 2019, were one subject of friction with their hosts. The Chinese had reported 174 such cases, but would not share the underlying data on which those reports were based. Hearing that these vital data were not being made available worried Dr Tedros enough that he lobbied the Chinese government for access. The authorities declined, citing concerns over citizens’ privacy. It could have been anonymised.
Elsewhere the team appears to have been knowingly misled. Take, for example, the live-animal trade at the Huanan seafood and wildlife market, a site associated with a number of Wuhan’s earliest recorded cases of covid-19. In its final report, the study group took at face value claims there was no credible evidence that live mammals were sold there in 2019. A lot of eyewitness accounts gainsay that; so does a study published in Scientific Reports, a journal, this summer.
One report and no more
The Scientific Reports paper found that 18 species of mammal had been for sale in Wuhan between May 2017 and November 2019; gunshot wounds and trapping injuries suggested that almost a third of them were taken from the wild. Although the paper was published only recently, it was submitted to the journal in October 2020. Chinese law requires that all covid-19 research be reviewed by the government before it is sent to a journal. Some Chinese authorities would have known of its contents before the team arrived.
The market is not the only way for animals and the pathogens they carry to get into Wuhan. The horseshoe bats in which the closest wild relatives to SARS-CoV-2 have been found do not live anywhere near the city, but the two laboratories there that were known to have engaged in coronavirus research received samples from bat caves around the country. The joint-study team was not allowed to investigate the procedures around, or documentation of, this research; when it visited the laboratories the team was shown presentations on safety procedures but no more.

When the researchers left Wuhan the WHO’s Geneva headquarters told them that their report needed to be laid out scientifically and could express dissenting opinions; the international members and the Chinese members did not have to reach a consensus. However, according to sources within the WHO, the team felt committed to producing a joint report with their Chinese counterparts. Dr Tedros was so unhappy with what finally emerged from the processes that he nobbled the report as it left the starting blocks, rejecting its contention that the possibility of a lab leak needed no further investigation.
On May 26th President Joe Biden ordered America’s intelligence services to report on the pandemic’s origins in 90 days (time will be up on August 24th). When he and his fellow G7 leaders met in June they joined in calling for a timely, transparent and science-based follow-up study. On July 16th Dr Tedros laid out the next steps which the WHO wants to see taken. They include further work on the Wuhan animal markets, studies of early cases and audits of local laboratories.
The Chinese government has reacted angrily to the idea of further studies on its territory. Zeng Yixin, the vice-minister of China’s National Health Commission, said he was “shocked” by the plan to investigate a lab leak, saying it was “impossible” to accept. According to the Global Times, a tub-thumping tabloid run by the Communist Party, 55 countries have sent written complaints about the proposal for further investigations to the WHO. Dr Tedros, elected director-general with China’s support in 2017 and derided by President Donald Trump as China’s puppet, may now face a Chinese-backed candidate when he looks for reappointment later this year.
In the absence of any hope that China will co-operate, sources of data beyond its control have become increasingly important. One area of interest is genetic sequence data. Another is early cases exported from China.
See what you did there
An online open-source-intelligence group which calls itself DRASTIC has been scouring sequencing data to get insight into activities at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). When researchers publish sequences they typically post the raw data from which those sequences are assembled to public databases such as the sequence-read archive at America’s National Centre for Biotechnology Information. Contamination events in the laboratory, or within sequencing machines themselves, mean these data sometimes contain sequences not meant to be there. In theory such evidence could reveal nefarious goings-on.
Such work, while promising, takes a lot of resources. If you have the sort of supercomputers available to America’s national labs it gets easier. Gilles Demaneuf, a data scientist who works with DRASTIC, says he has a hunch the American intelligence community’s 90-day study is working the same angle. It is conceivable that the intelligence services might have been able to filch raw sequence reads directly from Chinese sequencing machines, thus picking up even more data.
Sequencing data only offers a way forward if the virus did indeed leak out of a lab, something which remains a possibility but which is far from proven. The study of early cases should be useful whatever route it took; the closer you get to understanding the when and where of the crossing-over from animal to human, the easier it should be to learn something of the how.
On the basis of information provided by China the joint study concluded it was unlikely for there to have been any substantial transmission in Wuhan before December 2019. That is unlikely to be true. For one thing the South China Morning Post, a newspaper based in Hong Kong, obtained government documents in 2020 which showed one to five new cases a day in Wuhan from November 17th 2019 onwards. Further evidence has strengthened the possibility that the virus could have been in circulation much earlier than the official story allows.

That circulation need not have been limited to China. There is increasing evidence suggesting early infections elsewhere. These cases would have been exported from China; no virologists doubt that Hubei was where the virus got going within humans. But if circulation in Hubei goes back further than thought and cannot be directly assessed through studies there, the presence of cases elsewhere offers an alternative way to get an idea of the timing. If a specific travel link were identified, that might help identify a group in Hubei which was infected early on.
A recent study of blood samples from 9,144 adults in 12 different regions of France found seven which contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, all of them taken in November 2019. An Italian lung-cancer screening trial has found samples taken in September 2019 which seem to contain anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Another antibody study suggests the virus was circulating at a low level in northern Italy at the same time, notably in Lombardy, a region which has close connections to Wuhan through the garment trade, and saw Europe’s first major outbreak of covid-19 in March 2020.
Antibody tests can give false positives. In a preprint published on August 6th by the Lancet, researchers in Lombardy reported on looking instead for SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences. Examining 289 swabs and urine tests taken from people who had presented with a rash as far back as the second half of 2019, they found SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 13, the earliest of which was taken on September 12th.
Sudhir Kumar of Temple University in Philadelphia says the Lancet preprint is likely to inspire other investigators to go back and look at retrospective hospital samples. That should help his own research into the origins of the virus. A family tree Dr Kumar and his colleagues have built from vast numbers of published SARS-CoV-2 genomes allows them to predict the sequence of the progenitor virus from which they are all descended. This sequence differs in three places from that found in the earliest samples taken from patients in Wuhan, meaning there had been enough spread for a certain amount of viral mutation to take place before December. Dr Kumar says that an analysis of the Lombardy sequences suggests that the timeline for the origin of the virus in China might now extend back to the late summer.
More systematic international research into these early infections and their circumstances is needed. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of emerging diseases and zoonoses at the WHO, suggests it may be possible to prioritise work in areas which saw the earliest outbreaks in America, France, Italy and Spain. “I think the floodgates will open one day,” says Dr Kumar.
A last line of light
An early origin would fit with the timeline that lab-leak proponents tend to favour. Early this August, the minority Republican staff on the House foreign-affairs committee released an 84-page report arguing this case. It makes much of a small but deadly disease outbreak which took place at an abandoned copper mine in Yunnan in 2012. As DRASTIC showed last year, a virus studied at WIV which had been taken from that mine is the closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2.
The report sees importance in the removal, on September 12th 2019, of a database containing details of sequences and samples from the WIV. This is read as the beginning of a cover-up, and thus as the point when the authorities first knew something had gone amiss, arguing for a leak in late August or early September. The WIV says it was a response to cyber-attacks.
A leak is not the only research-related possibility. The first person infected could have been someone employed by the WIV or another lab to collect bats and samples—the prospect to which Dr Ben Embarek pointed in his television interview. And it is important to remember that some other form of spillover outside the lab, either directly from a bat or by way of some other species, may well be to blame.
China clearly does not want lab-leaks investigated; but that does not mean it knows one happened. It is also being misleading about Huanan market, denying access to early-case data and obfuscating in various other non-lab-leak-specific ways. The most obvious explanation is that it does not really want any definitive answer to the question. An unsanitary market, a reckless bat-catcher or a hapless spelunker would not be as bad in terms of blame as a source in a government laboratory. But any definite answer to the origin question probably leaves China looking bad, unless it can find a way to blame someone else. To that end China has called for an investigation of Fort Detrick in Maryland, historically the home of American bioweapons research; state media regularly publish speculations about its involvement.
The possibility of spillover from wild bats does not have to be studied in China. Yunnan abuts onto Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, and bats are not sticklers in matters of territory. Samples taken outside China could provide a good idea of viral diversity the other side of the border. A thorough evaluation of the existing farm-animal and wildlife trade in the region would also be useful.
Yet there is an inherent risk in such work that needs to be considered. Efforts to uncover the roots of covid-19 by seeking out a natural reservoir of something very like SARS-CoV-2 would, by definition, expose people to the sort of risks that can seed pandemics. Ironically, the very possibility of a lab leak raises questions about how most safely to pursue investigations into other possibilities.

When he called for further inquiries in July, Dr Tedros also announced the formation of a new permanent group of pathogen hunters, the International Scientific Advisory Group for Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO). He wants it to organise further studies of SARS-CoV-2. But it will also need to look at more general questions for the future—such as how to be sure that, come what may, studies of pathogens involved in past disease outbreaks never create further outbreaks of their own. ■

1792,"THE WEATHER in Brighton was decidedly blustery as the Labour Party gathered for its annual conference between September 25th and 29th. The handful of hardy souls who braved the sea were repeatedly flattened by the waves. But the wind turbines off the coast also whirled furiously, providing an energy-starved country with much-needed power. The mood inside the conference centre matched the squalls outside.
Sir Keir Starmer’s carefully charted attempt to introduce himself to the party he leads (and to Britain; last year’s affair consisted of little more than a speech to camera) was repeatedly blown off course. The big news on the first day was Angela Rayner, the deputy leader, calling Tories “scum”. On the second, it was a fight over the rules for electing the party leader. Then came the resignation of the shadow employment minister, Andy McDonald, over Sir Keir’s refusal to back an hourly minimum wage of £15 ($20), a policy supported by delegates, but with no chance of becoming law.

The squalls were powered by a combination of an ideological battle over the party’s direction and a more subtle one over succession. Labour’s hard left made a great deal of noise in fringe meetings and on the pavement outside. After his departure Mr McDonald, the last remaining fellow traveller with Jeremy Corbyn, Sir Keir’s hard-left predecessor, in cabinet, was welcomed by some as a hero. Ms Rayner and Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, competed to become heir-apparent, Ms Rayner by giving her best impression of La Pasionara and Mr Burnham by presenting himself as a problem-solver (and football-lover).
All the squabbling inspired criticism of Sir Keir’s leadership style. The left accused him of picking an unnecessary fight with the party’s heart and soul. The right worried that he was washing dirty linen in public. One frontbencher described him as a “caretaker”; another dismissed the conference as a “total disaster”. But just as the salty breeze blew the turbines around outside, so the bluster and blasts inside powered the party towards renewal.
The Labour left has been significantly weakened. Sir Keir did not succeed in returning to the electoral-college method of choosing leaders, as he had hoped. But by increasing from 10% to 20% the share of MPs from whom a prospective candidate must gather support, he all but ruled out another hard-left takeover. And by scrapping rules that force MPs to endure periodic reselection by local party activists every year, he further weakened the party’s lunatic fringe. “We’ve nailed the hard left into their coffin,” said one shadow cabinet member. “There’s a lot of kicking and screaming because they know they’re not coming back to life.” A senior adviser gloated: “Job done.”
The conference also saw the outlines of a new Labour philosophy: more mainstream than Corbynism but also more communitarian than Blairism. It is aimed at the just-about-managing in provincial towns, rather than the socially liberal affluent types who formed the core of New Labour. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, focused on what she called “the everyday economy”—that of collapsing high streets rather than lines on a graph. She promised to spend £28bn a year on the green transition, an ambitious figure, but one that is broadly in line with centre-left administrations elsewhere. And she said her party was on the side of workers against companies that don’t pay their taxes and contractors who don’t come up with the goods.
Sir Keir’s speech was too long and his delivery too slow (coming days after a 12,000-word Fabian pamphlet, it suggests that he struggles to self-edit). But it succeeded in advancing his most important aims—to detoxify his party and to define Starmerism. He used his background (a factory-worker father and a mother with a rare, and awful, type of inflammatory arthritis) to lay claim to traditional values such as hard work and aspiration, as well as to more obviously left-wing values such as care and community. He praised the armed forces for defending the country, and the Crown Prosecution Service (which he ran from 2008 to 2013) for tackling criminals. He also praised Tony Blair, the Labour prime minister the Labour left loves to hate, for delivering the “levelling up” that the Tories only talk about. The left played into his hands by heckling after words like “patriot” and gave him a chance to taunt them with his best line—“shouting slogans or changing lives?”—which was taken up by the largely sympathetic audience.
Above all, Sir Keir made it clear that he is serious about winning power. “We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government,” he proclaimed: cue Corbynista fury. He spouted endless detail about policies such as setting up an office to make sure taxpayers get value for money (hence the speech’s inordinate length). He criticised the prime minister, Boris Johnson, not because he is “Tory scum”, as Ms Rayner put it, but because he is a “trivial man”. In tumultuous times, he said, Britain deserves a leader who is dedicated to public service rather than one who treats it as a game.
Batten down the hatches
Among the Labour Party’s biggest weaknesses is a habit of underestimating the Tories, and Mr Johnson in particular. But the Tories may now be doing the same with the man they like to call “the nasal knight” (Sir Keir’s voice is not his best feature). Both are pursuing the same swing voters: the just-about-managing who feel short-changed by globalisation and the 40% of young people who leave school without essential qualifications. They are offering similar policies: higher taxes and bigger government. But Sir Keir’s seriousness and centre-left values may be more suited than Mr Johnson’s bluster to darkening times. The winds of political change have blown left-of-centre parties into power in two of the West’s biggest countries, America and Germany. With Sir Keir fixing the hull and patching the rigging, the same winds might yet do the same for the good ship Labour. ■
An early version of this article was published online on September 29th 2021",2
1793,"Nigel Kennedy is munching biscuits and swigging tea from his Aston Villa mug. It's 10.30am: practically the crack of dawn, given that he was up necking plum vodka — 'My wife made it. I drink it. Teamwork!' he cries — until the early hours.
The virtuoso violinist is wearing one of Villa's vintage 'away' strips: 'Horrible, tasteless neon green and lurid red. I love it!' he chortles.
His allegiance to the Birmingham football club he has supported since boyhood is as ingrained as his commitment to making classical music accessible to everyone, not just an elite minority of 'condescending wannabe gentry', as he puts it.
Since his 1989 recording of Vivaldi's Four Seasons sold more than three million copies, making it the best-selling classical recording ever, he has been resolutely defying convention. And today, as he publishes Nigel Kennedy Uncensored!, a riotous, no-holds-barred memoir, he fires a volley of invective at his detractors and deplores the BBC's descent into political correctness.
He talks about drugs (yes, he smokes cannabis), sex, all-night partying — and how he's standing by his son Sark, 25, jailed earlier this month for drug-dealing after being caught with £15,500 worth of cocaine in his car.
'He knows that I'm around to offer him an alternative life and he knows that I love him. I'm going to see him (in prison) pretty soon so I'll remind him of that.
'I just hope he's going to be successful in what he's trying to do, which is to change his life and turn it around. But I'm not going to pull him up by the ear. It's not my place.
'We have all these relatives in Australia and it would be a really fantastic opportunity to start a new life there, away from his old circles. But he's an adult. You can give people opportunities but they have to make up their own mind.'
Nigel Kennedy, 64, is a man of fierce loyalties and ardently held opinions. I had expected bluster and braggadocio. I hadn't reckoned on humour, affability and charm. He's talking to me via Zoom from the studio of the timber house, remote in the Polish countryside, he shares with Agnieszka, 43, his second wife, and their elderly weimaraner, Huxley.
'We're in the wilderness. There are bears, but they're quite shy, not like American grizzlies, and wolves,' he enthuses. 'We've got a huge vegetable patch — Agnieszka instigated it — and beehives. We go hiking!'
He has always been provocative: his bog-brush hair and concert get-up mark him as a maverick. Long ago he eschewed the performer's traditional black tailcoat — the outfit of a 'poncing underpaid butler', as he puts it — and often performs wearing bovver boots, cargo pants and his football jersey. The stuffy elite deplore his anarchism; his vast army of fans applaud his determination to bring classical music to the masses.
He's been dubbed the 'punk violinist' and more acerbically, 'a latter-day Liberace with his ludicrous clothes'. (This from the late Sir John Drummond, one-time director of the Proms and controller of BBC Radio 3.)
He points out that Sir John — an 'elite toff' — at times garnered as few as 250 listeners at Radio 3, turning it into 'an unattainable exclusive club'. Meanwhile, Kennedy, a glittering alumnus of the Yehudi Menuhin School (the great violinist actually paid his fees) was packing the 5,000-seat Royal Albert Hall to the rafters.
'And I don't think he [Sir John] played the piano as well as Liberace,' he says. 'He was a purist; he didn't like Liberace's white piano and candelabra. I didn't really like Liberace either, but he was a skilful piano player.'
And Kennedy laments the fact that the taxpayer-funded BBC has become 'a teeth-gnashing, pitiful and desperately wannabe politically correct institution', concluding: 'Public reaction to this self-indulgence is already taking the shape of even more apathy and resentment, which will inevitably lead to refusal to pay the licence fee and the discarding of TV in general in favour of the internet.'
Kennedy renames one BBC First Night of the Proms the 'Farce Night', decrying its 'tedious desperation' to burnish its woke credentials after one singer dedicated her performance to 'transgender people all around the world'.
'What for? Why?' he asks incredulously. 'That type of irrelevant superficial claptrap was too much to take and had nothing to do with the music she was performing, unless she thought it couldn't stand up for itself.
'To think that we pay a licence fee to hear that kind of spouting. I respect everyone whatever their gender, but meritocracy is what we're looking for. This insistence on quotas and equality of outcome . . . there should be an equal chance for everyone as long as they're prepared to work hard.'
Kennedy, never reticent about expressing his views, was not prepared to let the singer's comments pass unremarked.
He was due to play Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending and Monti's Czardas, and during his rehearsal with the orchestra, he recalls: 'I quipped in a similar bleating manner to the singer, 'I would like to dedicate my part of the performance to all the forgotten and displaced heterosexuals around the world.' '
This light-hearted riposte misfired. He was met with an 'unamused glower' from two women in the viola section, 'As if heterosexuals shouldn't be recognised or allowed to celebrate anything'. 'The conductor also seemed rather unsupportive,' he adds.
'I know some people suffer from a chronic sense-of-humour shortage and I sincerely wish them a speedy recovery.'
Although he is Left-wing and fervently anti-elitist, he now finds his sympathies veering towards the white British middle classes.
'I've had a fair few good nights at the Proms. I've experienced a mixed feeling or two about the toffs waving Union Jacks. First of all, I found myself a bit averse to all of that jingoism, but now that everyone in the media is so anti-white British my feelings have become a bit more tolerant. Every other group of people is allowed to talk about their race and big it up.
'And once the Scottish finally have to leave our UK, we won't see the Union Jack any more and it's a shame, because it's a killa [great] looking flag.'
Such unfashionable views have, it seems, made him persona non grata at the BBC. 'They won't make any shows with me any more. Jimmy Savile was OK but apparently I'm not!'
He has always been a dissident, his soaring musical talent matched by rebelliousness and an epic capacity for partying.
Does he still love a shindig? 'Of course! There's a lot of adrenaline coursing round your body after a concert, when you're trying to deliver the best performance for the people who have paid to be there.
'Afterwards it's good to hang out with your mates. Often I'll invite members of the audience to a party. Everyone's welcome.'
He's famous for the epic duration of these parties: in his book he enumerates the many events to which police were called, grading various forces throughout Europe on the standard of their response.
(The Met come out top for turning a blind eye to the antics of the carousers at his home during one early-hours revel, merely requesting they kept the volume down.)
He goes off on a riff in praise of our police force: 'It's an amazing privilege to live in a society where we don't have armed police,' he says. 'The people who join the police are trying to help society and we ought to remember that.
'Maybe a few behind desks get a bit addled in the head, but the people on the streets are trying to benefit us. It's not a brilliantly paid job and there are huge expectations.'
He makes no secret of the fact that he smokes cannabis: 'I appreciate a good smoke. It has helped me become the improviser, composer and classical interpreter that I am today.'
But I wonder if his capacity for caning it has waned with age?
'I think you become more professional at handling drink as you get older, don't you?' he asks. When I tell him I hardly drink now he roars with laughter. 'Well there's no point in you coming to one of my parties then!'
I ask about his views on cocaine. When his son, Sark — who lives with Nigel's ex-wife, Eve, in Malvern — appeared at Worcester Crown Court earlier this month, he was jailed for 33 months after admitting possession with intent to supply the drug.
The court heard that he was selling 'wraps' of cocaine at £40 each after getting into debt since becoming addicted as a teenager, but was now determined to become a useful member of society.
'I've always been clear that I don't appreciate it [cocaine] in my circles,' Nigel says. 'I really hate that type of stuff. It doesn't improve the atmosphere. I've got a crackpot theory that coffee is a gateway for cocaine. It revs you up and makes you more hyperactive. I don't think you'd find many tea-drinkers like it.' He tops up his brew and takes another sip.
'My son knows what I think about it. It's not my place to tell him: 'You can't do that.' You give people opportunities and in the end they make their own choices.'
Is he a good dad? 'You learn as you go, but practice does not always make perfect,' he says.
'My son sees a lot of hard work going on in my house and he knows to get a life together you have to really work.'
Indeed, Nigel's work ethic is formidable. He practises for between three and six hours a day, striving constantly to improve.
'It's quite boring, what I'm doing. I write music. I get better at the violin. I work ceaselessly at it. And if I have a killa project like a gig at Madison Square Garden [the 20,000-seat New York arena], or if I'm writing something — I've just finished my first violin concerto — my life becomes very regulated.
'For a couple of months I have no sex or alcohol; no parties or any recreational stuff. It becomes a very focused life, and it really does help.'
I wonder what Agnieszka thinks about this monastic life.
'Oh I think she's pretty happy about it,' he laughs. 'She doesn't have to bother about me.'
'And you can still do a bit of hiking.'
'Exactly.'
They've been married for 23 years or so — he is hazy on dates and chronology, a fact that has got him into deep trouble with his wife, an actor and artistic director.
'Three years ago I forgot her birthday and I had to buy her a car,' he guffaws. 'My mate said, 'Well you've learnt from that. You won't forget next time.' But I did! I couldn't buy her another car — Greta [Thunberg] wouldn't like that — so I got her a toy one instead.'
We go off on a bit of a tangent, talking about Greta, from whom he is loath to take advice.
'Relatively speaking she's just a child.' He's sceptical about man-made global warming but is an ardent environmentalist.
'I hate to think of dolphins swallowing plastic. I went through a phase of leaving plastic packaging outside the supermarket. If they want to propagate it they should deal with it.'
He likes a bit of a rant. When we talk about the house he owns at the foot of the South Downs in West Sussex he says he's likely to sell it. 'The village there has lost its post office and I said, 'When they get rid of the pub, I'm off,' and they've turned it into a horrible wedding venue. It's a crime, isn't it?'
He's easy company; amusing, provocative and for all the privileges his exceptional talent has conferred, his early life was not plain sailing.
His father, John, a cellist, left his mother when Nigel was a baby, emigrating to Australia and returning later to become principal cellist with the Royal Philharmonic. His mum Scylla, a pianist, remarried when Nigel was a child and they moved from his native Brighton to Birmingham.
Nigel's stepfather, a doctor, was physically abusive to Scylla. 'As a small child I did jump on him and try to stop him once or twice, but it resulted in him chasing me round the house with a knife.
'It was a horrible thing.'
At the age of six he says he was subject 'to a form of abandonment' when he was sent away to the Yehudi Menuhin School in Surrey, having won a scholarship.
He was both precociously talented and determinedly single-minded. In his teens, while studying at the Juilliard School in New York, he was invited by jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli to perform with him at the city's Carnegie Hall.
He was told by his teachers that he would scupper his classical career if he did, but he defied them, with glorious results. And his challenging of convention and authority continued.
He recalls how he became the Punk Violinist by mistake when, flying from New York to perform a concerto at the Royal Festival Hall in London, he forgot his 'bat suit', as he calls it. Finding himself on a Sunday without the appropriate attire, he went to the only place that was open in the 1970s, Camden Market, 'and the only clothes I could get were punk stuff with chains and a gothic edge. I got all togged up for less than 50 quid'.
He has infuriated and entertained in equal measure ever since. Refusing to be pigeon-holed, he's performed with rock aristocracy: with Paul McCartney, The Who and Led Zeppelin; with Roy Wood of The Move and Deep Purple's Jon Lord.
Music snobs will always decry what they perceive as his philistinism. They have even, he says, disparaged him for playing Tchaikovsky.
'His music is looked down upon by some pseudo experts as being below top level, and this sets my bulls***ometer right off into the red,' he says.
'These pseuds try to discount this beautiful music because it has committed the cardinal crime of becoming phenomenally popular with classical audiences all around the world.'
He's off on a tirade again, inveighing against 'experts' who 'protect their status by pretending that something popular is s*** in order to appear as if they know more than us poor proletariat'.
'It seems that there's always an 'expert' on every subject, from global warming all the way to poor little music, portraying themselves as knowing better than us.
'But it's all hot air and no substance, reminiscent of the emperor and his new clothes.
'Mind you,' he adds as a coda, 'if we're to believe Greta et al, it won't be long before neither we nor the emperor will need any clothes.'

1794,"ON THE MORNING of November 13th last year Zambia’s vice-president told parliament, “This country will not default.” Hours later the inevitable happened. Having destroyed its relationship with the IMF, struggled to provide clear data on its borrowing from China and failed to win a reprieve from bondholders, Zambia missed a deadline to pay interest and defaulted on its debt. Lenders could only shake their heads in bemusement.
For some poor countries like Zambia, a debt crisis has always been the story of a chaotic and corrupt government that has borrowed carelessly. But in the more complex creditor landscape of today, defaults can also, more than ever, be about struggling nations stuck in the web of diplomatic feuds that bind their creditors together. Each lender enters restructuring talks with the same preoccupation: is someone else getting a better deal? No one wants to be first to give concessions and there is little advantage in showing your hand. More than financial data or legal frameworks, it is these power struggles that have come to define restructuring negotiations.

The pandemic has left many countries struggling to repay their debt. As well as Zambia, five others—Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, Lebanon and Suriname—defaulted last year. For some, health-care and social spending rose just as the global economy tanked. In other cases, like Zambia’s, covid-19 provided an excuse for a profligate government to default. Others could run out of money in the months ahead.
The last time a large number of poor economies were crumbling under the weight of government debt, around the turn of the millennium, the group of creditors was smaller. It included multilateral organisations like the IMF, a handful of commercial banks, and rich countries like Britain and America operating in unison as the “Paris Club”. An unusual mix of other players, including Bono, an Irish rock star, and Pat Robertson, an American televangelist, generated widespread support for debt forgiveness, but even then it was difficult. The resulting programmes—the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI) initiatives—have saved 37 of the world’s poorest countries over $100bn.  
Drop the debt again?
Things are more complicated now. Poor nations have borrowed from new lenders. China and Saudi Arabia have lent a lot of money to developing-world governments. And as yields on rich-country debt have plummeted, poor governments have been able to sell foreign-currency bonds. The average portion of emerging-market public external debt owed to multilateral institutions dropped from 43% in 2008 to 34% in 2019, according to World Bank data crunched by Fitch Ratings, while the share for commercial lenders (largely bondholders rather than banks) jumped from 29% to 45%. Meanwhile, bilateral lending fell.
With the creditor landscape transformed, lenders are looking at recent negotiations, including those in Ecuador and Zambia, for signs of how future resolutions might take shape. Two new power struggles have emerged.
The first is between Chinese lenders and everyone else. The second is between Wall Street and Washington, where official-sector lenders like the IMF and the American government are based. For the 50 most-indebted recipients of Chinese lending, the average stock of debt owed to China reached 15% of GDP in 2017 from less than 1% in 2005, according to data from a group of experts including Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard academic now at the World Bank. Because of the political competition between Beijing and Washington, this lending is—often unjustifiably—framed as a devilish ploy to cripple poor economies and grab strategic assets. People think of China “in almost conspiracy-theory terms”, says Meg Rithmire of Harvard Business School. Governments in Zambia and Ecuador have been renegotiating their debt with one eye on elections this year. In a sign of just how contentious the issue is, the front-runners in the poll in Ecuador, which also owes a lot to China, are running on opposing economic plans: Andrés Arauz promises to scrap the existing deal with the IMF, whereas Guillermo Lasso wants to rebuild investors’ trust.
Beyond suspicion and rivalry, Chinese lending has specific characteristics that complicate talks. The first step in any restructuring is calculating how much a country owes and to whom. That is a thorny business when China is involved. What analysts refer to as “Chinese lenders” includes a variety of institutions, such as state-owned enterprises and policy banks, which act on behalf of the government. “They’re not all on the same team,” explains Deborah Brautigam of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University.  
Keeping track of all this lending is tricky, too. Much of it goes undeclared, and confidentiality clauses prevent governments from sharing the terms of their loans. That has been a stumbling block in Zambia. To offer support, the IMF needs information on loans from China that have been agreed upon but are yet to be handed out, meaning they do not show up in public accounts. Foreign bondholders, who have lent a total of $3bn, have refused to provide a reprieve for fear that their funds will be used to pay off Chinese lenders.

Everyone is seeking clues about the extent to which Chinese lenders will join co-ordinated debt negotiations. So far, they seem eager to look like they are engaging with other creditors. But they are changing their ways gradually, following the Chinese proverb and “crossing the river by feeling the stones”. Policy banks have deferred payments on loans to the Zambian and Ecuadorean governments, but details are patchy. Similarly, China joined the G20 in its Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) announced last year, to pause repayments on bilateral debt for 73 of the poorest nations, and in its “common framework”, which provides longer-term help. But it has curbed the power of the DSSI by treating some policy bank loans as commercial, so they are not part of the standstill.
As for the other main power struggle, it pits official lenders like the IMF and creditor governments, which have a long history of lending to the developing world, against commercial lenders that make money doing the same.
Here, too, trust is an issue. Abebe Selassie, director of the IMF’s African department, points out that one of the biggest recent scandals around undisclosed loans involved European banks, including Credit Suisse. Some $2bn of questionable debt that was taken on by state-owned enterprises in Mozambique in 2013 and 2014 eventually crippled the local economy and forced the government into default. “Transparency is about all lenders, not just China,” says Mr Selassie.
More worrying still is disagreement on the responsibility a fund manager sitting in London or Hong Kong has to a poor-country government. Private-sector lenders have come under pressure to offer concessions, even to solvent governments. Some bondholders, like Yerlan Syzdykov at Amundi, say they have a fiduciary duty to generate returns for clients and that it is not their job to “provide financial aid” to poor governments. “We’re not charities,” he says. Besides, renegotiating foreign-currency bonds might not be in the interest of poor economies if it leads to a credit downgrade, making it more expensive to raise money on international capital markets in future.
Egos involved
Bondholders nowadays are a disparate group. Some funds hold on to debt for a while; some are opportunists, buying bad debt when prices nose-dive. They all have different goals, which is why they have split into multiple committees in recent talks, including those in Argentina. The same fund managers pop up in all emerging-market debt restructurings, too. There are big personalities involved and personal feuds linger.
A government trying to restructure its debts needs not only to get all lenders onside but to do so in the right order. The Paris Club will negotiate only once a country has an IMF programme in place and demands debtor countries ask other lenders for concessions comparable to their own. That is why Iraq, with vast oil reserves and foreign troops on the ground, began negotiations with the rich-country group before other lenders, winning a 90% reduction (in present-value terms) of its Saddam-era debt stock that it could then ask other creditors to match. A country that lacks geopolitical clout is unlikely to get an easy ride from bilateral lenders and might follow a different strategy. “This is a major tactical question for a sovereign that has both Paris Club and commercial debt: what is the right sequence?” says Lee Buchheit, a lawyer who specialises in sovereign debt.
The key to breaking the deadlock between various creditors is often the IMF. Other lenders are more willing to give a government a break when they have data, an economic plan and the promise of supervision from the Fund. “What you generally want is an honest broker,” says Jan Dehn at Ashmore Group, an emerging-market investment manager. In the case of Argentina, the IMF struggled to play that role because it was one of the creditors seeking repayment.
As for Ecuador’s restructuring last year, which was wrapped up in a matter of months, it was crucial that the government had kept up good relations with the IMF. Its request to postpone $800m in coupon payments was conditional on thrashing out the beginnings of a new deal with the IMF. Over 90% of bondholders agreed to the pause and then to a restructuring when the time was up.
Ecuador, a serial defaulter, had some experience navigating its creditors. Not so with Zambia, which sold its first foreign-currency bond as recently as 2012. It wrecked its relationship with the IMF when it kicked the Fund’s previous representative out of the country in 2018. The only reason for optimism now is that Zambia’s new IMF representative flew to Lusaka in December, followed soon after by Mr Selassie, raising hopes that a new programme might break the deadlock.
The fact that the IMF team made the trip points to a final complication hanging over debt talks right now: travel bans. Those officials managed it, but it will be a while before all lenders can meet in person. Hans Humes, a big cheese at Greylock Capital, still cringes as he recalls the day his three-year-old daughter burst into the room during online negotiations over Argentina’s debt, keen to show her drawings to the bankers at Lazard and the Argentine minister for the economy, Martín Guzmán. Mr Humes hankers for the day he can get around a table with his counterparts in a more professional setting, where he can read their body language and sidle over to old allies for an uninterrupted chat. “There is no equivalent to taking a break and having a coffee,” he muses. ■",2
1795,"WESTERN DEFENCE ministries are talking up their willingness to take on a new enemy: climate change. In March Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, wrote that “the changing climate is altering the global security and operating environments, impacting our missions, plans and installations.” The Pentagon set up a “Climate Working Group” after an executive order from President Joe Biden that climate considerations should be considered a greater foreign-policy and national-security priority.
American allies are making similar noises. On March 30th Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) published its “Climate Change and Sustainability Strategic Approach”. In the foreword, Lieutenant-General Richard Nugee, who led the review, wrote: “The character of warfare is changing fast; so is the climate...The imperative could not be clearer: Defence must and will act now.” A few days previously, a meeting of NATO foreign ministers had agreed to make climate change a far greater priority.

Such talk cannot disguise a fundamental problem: there is little oversight or acknowledgment of just how much armies themselves contribute to climate change. “One of the greatest challenges is that we lack numbers,” explains Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general. This lack of data stems from armed forces’ historic reluctance to disclose information that might place limits on military activity.
The Kyoto protocol, adopted by the UN in 1997, was the first international climate-change treaty to commit countries to slashing their greenhouse-gas emissions. But it came with a loophole: military emissions around the world were exempt from reduction obligations, and even from reporting. The exclusion was granted at the request of America, where some insisted that calculating emissions and making them public could create pressure to curtail the country’s military activities and thus represented a security risk. (Despite this, the country ultimately did not ratify the protocol.) Climate change, it seemed, was seen as a lesser danger to the armed forces than climate-change mitigation.
The military exemption was removed by the Paris agreement of 2015. But the signatories agreed among themselves that each would decide individually whether to set specific targets for their armed forces, or whether to separate out military emissions in the reports they make under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The result is that, usually, some military emissions are lumped in with other totals, while others are not calculated at all, explains Louise van Schaik, of Clingendael, a Dutch think-tank. Emissions from buildings and vehicles used by the armed forces might be included in the figures provided for government or transport, for example. And only domestic emissions have to be counted and reported, so the activities of armed forces overseas are excluded. In the American armed forces, 70% of energy consumption comes from moving and using troops and weapons, mostly abroad.
Various groups have tried to estimate the level of greenhouse-gas emissions armed forces are actually responsible for, as opposed to the numbers they report. In February 2021, a report commissioned by a group of left-wing members of the European Parliament tried to work out the bloc’s military emissions, based on military expenditure. They estimated that the total footprint for EU armed forces was 24.8m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in 2019 (including estimated emissions from military industrial production.) That is more than three-quarters of the emissions for the whole of Denmark. In 2018, however, the 27 countries of the EU attributed just 4.5m tCO2e to military activities—roughly 0.1% of the total they emitted that year. France—the EU’s most militarily active member—was estimated to have been responsible for one-third of the EU’s total military emissions in 2019 but had reported none at all.
Similarly, for 2017-18, Britain’s MoD declared it had emitted 942,283 tCO2e, which made up half of the central British government’s emissions. A report by Scientists for Global Responsibility—a British advocacy and research group—found that the MoD’s total direct emissions were closer to 3m tCO2e (excluding emissions from the production of equipment or supply chains). 
These figures are dwarfed by estimates for America, with the Pentagon thought to be the largest institutional consumer of petroleum products in the world. A paper published in 2019 by Professor Neta Crawford, a political scientist at Boston University, estimated that America’s armed forces emitted 59m tCO2e in 2017. For comparison, total emissions from all sources and sectors for the whole of Switzerland were 44m tCO2e in 2018.
In recent years, many Western armies have adopted cleaner technologies—including electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. Others are experimenting with new fuels for aviation: the Dutch Ministry of Defence, for example, is phasing in biofuels (as is America) and now uses them to power all F-16 Fighting Falcon jets from its base in Leeuwarden. In the absence of transparent emissions reporting or targets, this is often trotted out as evidence of their green credentials. But the changes have been driven  mostly by the imperatives of operational efficiency and continuity.
Reliance on fossil fuels for energy—once described by General David Petraeus, a former director of America’s CIA, as “the lifeblood of our warfighting capabilities”—creates security risks and threatens missions. Transporting fuel to remote bases typically requires long convoys of military vehicles, vulnerable to enemy attack. Between 2001 and 2010, for example, over half of American casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan occurred during land transport missions. Many of these missions involved the delivery of fuel to remote bases—a study by the Army Environmental Policy Institute published in 2009 estimated that the average load allocation for convoys in the region was 50% fuel. Fossil fuels are also costly: between 2010 and 2018 the American armed forces purchased roughly 100m barrels of fuel each year, with an annual bill of $8bn-17bn. And securing access to the fuel adds more costs still. It is estimated that America’s armed forces spend around $81bn annually defending the global oil supply. Besides the expense, the adoption of green technologies in civilian markets will also drive the armed forces to follow suit.
Despite these pressures, most Western armies are yet to cut their emissions significantly. Meanwhile, climate change is increasingly shaping the environment in which they operate, and the risks for which they are trying to prepare. Higher sea- levels threaten infrastructure: operations at the world’s largest naval base, in Norfolk, Virginia, are regularly disrupted by flooding. Western countries with territories in places susceptible to extreme weather—such as the Caribbean for both Britain and the Netherlands, and the Pacific for France—have also found more demands being made on the armed forces based there to provide humanitarian relief and assistance after disasters. Fears abound about new geopolitical tensions—driven by melting ice in the Arctic, instability caused by migration and resource scarcity as temperatures rise. America is now explicitly incorporating such scenarios into its modelling, simulations and war-gaming; NATO has recently agreed to launch new research into the link between global warming and security.
The result is a curious mixture of resignation and urgency. Britain’s recent climate-change strategy, for example, stated baldly that the country’s armed forces are preparing for a “climate-changed world of between +2 and 4°C” above pre-industrial levels—ie, above the 2°C ceiling set as a target in Paris. But the amount that temperatures will rise depends on progress in reducing emissions. Doing so efficiently requires accuracy and openness about emissions. This is coming at last from military forces themselves. Mr Stoltenberg, for example, recently announced that he wants NATO alliance members to pledge at a summit later this year to make their armies carbon-neutral by 2050 and NATO is currently developing an emissions-reporting methodology to facilitate this. Britain’s MoD has also now promised to set specific targets for reducing its carbon emissions. Lieut-General Nugee’s report, for instance, says that Britain’s sprawling defence estate—the MoD is one of the largest landowners in the country, with hangars, houses and barracks—will reduce emissions by at least 30% by 2025.
The difficulties in balancing armies’ desires for combat effectiveness with the need to cut emissions will persist. Yet attitudes are, slowly, changing. “Climate change makes the world a more dangerous place,” says Mr Stoltenberg. “And therefore it matters to NATO, and therefore we need to be part of the answer to global warming.” Earlier this month, speaking at a climate summit, Mr Austin called the climate crisis an “existential” threat, and pledged that the Pentagon would be “doing our part” to alleviate it.

1796," (CNN)The White House and top Democrats are expecting a highly anticipated estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to show that their sweeping plan to expand the social safety net will fail to meet President Joe Biden's promise to not add to the federal deficit.But behind the scenes, they have been launching a preemptive strike for weeks to prepare their colleagues for that likelihood, arguing that the CBO numbers would diverge from the White House's projections that $320 billion would be raised by increased tax enforcement, a difference the administration says stems from the different methods used to calculate the revenue gained.The question now facing Democratic leaders is whether those assurances from the White House will be enough to assuage moderates, who have withheld their support for the roughly $1.9 trillion bill until information from the CBO show its costs are offset.""I am undecided on the bill,"" said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a vulnerable Democrat from a swing district in Michigan. ""I remain undecided on the bill. I want to see these scores, and I want to make sure I understand the details before I cast a vote.""Democratic leaders have very little margin for error, since they can only lose three votes to pass the bill that they are hoping gets a final vote as soon as Thursday.""We want to have the confidence that what we fiscally have said is the reality in the bill is the reality,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday.The White House has spent months explaining and preparing members for why their estimates may not line up with the CBO on increased IRS tax enforcement. But aides say that knowing the estimates and then seeing CBO's report could cause some members to react differently.Two House moderates, who have withheld their support for the $1.9 trillion bill until the CBO scores are released, told CNN on Tuesday that the shortfall on the IRS provision won't affect their view on whether to support the plan.""I think it is OK,"" said Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Blue Dog Democrat from Oregon, calling it a ""legitimate difference of opinion."" ""That would not dissuade me."" Added Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida: ""I think we for a long time have understood that there is a discrepancy between Treasury's analysis of the revenues that come from tax enforcement and what CBO's number is. We knew that based off of our negotiations during the infrastructure bill, so it doesn't come as a surprise to anyone.""Another Democrat said if any moderates defect now, it's because they want to scuttle the whole effort.""That this wouldn't line up with CBO isn't a surprise,"" one House Democrat who has worked on the revenue side of the proposal told CNN. ""If this is a deal breaker for any members, it's because they want it to be a deal breaker, not because they weren't aware of it beforehand."" Administration officials hope that their argument made to lawmakers -- that their estimates over the IRS enforcement provisions wouldn't line up with those of the due to differences in methodological approaches -- will carry weight with Democrats.""If we're telling you that we're paying for something over a 10-year period, are we giving you that service for 10 years?"" Sen. Joe Manchin, the key West Virginia moderate, said Tuesday. ""Or is it for one year, four years, three years, five years? But I think other people had that same concern."" Biden proposed the increased tax enforcement as a revenue source in negotiations over the bill that would become the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law, before dropping it after Republican objections. It then became a central component of the revenue side of the second piece of Biden's domestic agenda -- the Build Back Better Act. For months, the Treasury Department has laid out their data and research backing their conclusion the $80 billion dedicated to enforcement would net out to raise $320 billion. Embedded in those estimates has been an implicit critique of what the CBO would likely estimate. Administration officials have pointed to the indirect effects the enhanced enforcement would have, something that historically has been difficult for the CBO to score. Improvements in outdated technology infrastructure and taxpayer services are also difficult to account for, administration officials have told lawmakers.  ""When analyzing proposals that provide increased enforcement resources to the IRS, the conventional approach is to merely estimate the increased revenue collected by the IRS through additional audits and additional collection activities, but not to ascribe any changed behavior on the part of taxpayers who potentially would be subject to added enforcement scrutiny,"" Mark Mazur, then the acting assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, wrote in a September memo circulated to lawmakers. ""This convention leads to an underestimate of future revenues generated by the proposal."" Mazur's analysis, along with several derived from outside sources, have been circulated to members throughout the last several months as Biden's negotiators have made the case for the provision, officials said. How moderates react to the shortfall will remain a key question this week. ""We know what we are expecting on these different lines,"" said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat. ""We have been talking back and forth with the White House and Treasury for 10 days.""Earlier this month, five moderate Democrats signed a letter to leadership pledging they'd be ready to vote on the Build Back Better plan once they received ""fiscal information from the Congressional Budget Office"" and ""no later than the week of November 15th,"" but one member who signed onto that letter, Murphy, told CNN Monday night that she still wants to see more estimates before she votes.""The CBO estimates that we received today amount to about $70 billion, so I think there is still some more CBO estimates that we'll need to take a peak at,"" she said. While the CBO is expected to roll out estimates for each section of the bill as they have them, the CBO said on Monday that ""a complete cost estimate"" would be ready ""by the end of the day on Friday."" If that timing holds, it could push back Hoyer's hope to vote Thursday or during the day on Friday.   One senior aide to House moderates warned that a CBO score that came back showing the bill was much more than $100 billion away from meeting the budget neutral target would be a ""big problem.""""You don't want to f*** up your messaging,"" the aide said.This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",0
1797,"NEITHER POPULISTS in general, nor Boris Johnson in particular, are known for tackling difficult problems if they can be left to future governments. Yet Britain’s prime minister did just that on September 7th when he unveiled a plan to break an election promise and raise taxes by an annual £12bn ($17bn), or 0.5% of GDP. The money will go to the National Health Service (NHS) and social care, including residential care for the elderly. Taxes could be raised more fairly. The government nonetheless deserves praise for taking on an issue that had seemed intractable.
Britain, like many rich countries, is ageing. In 2011 there were four 15- to 64-year-olds for every person aged 65 or over; by 2028 there will be fewer than three. The consequences include a strained NHS and more households discovering the inadequacies of the existing social-care system, which exposes the elderly and their heirs to huge financial risks. Today the government helps to pay for care only for those with assets worth less than about £23,000. But around one person in seven will spend more than £100,000—sometimes much more—on care during their lifetime. The result, which is not unique to Britain, is a lottery in which unlucky households must liquidate most or all of their assets.

Mr Johnson’s attempt to solve these problems—and also to help the NHS clear the massive queue of patients that has accumulated while it has fought the pandemic—is welcome. To reform care, he will cap care costs per person at £86,000, beyond which the state will foot the bill. The main beneficiaries will be elderly homeowners and their heirs. Although they may not seem like the most deserving beneficiaries, helping people share uninsurable risks is a worthy goal for governments. The NHS is not means-tested, and it is reasonable to move social care in this direction, too.

But this necessary expansion of the welfare state is being paid for in the wrong way. A measure that insures the estates of the elderly against catastrophe should have been funded by levying an insurance premium on older people in the form of higher taxes on property or inheritance. The government instead decided to raise all the new money by lifting national insurance (a payroll tax) and taxes on dividends. Outrageously, income from pensions and property will escape higher levies, meaning many well-off elderly voters will be spared from paying anything for a reform of which they are major beneficiaries.
Had the government raised income tax instead, every generation would have contributed. Mr Johnson says that national insurance is preferable, because firms pay part of the cost. This is a fiction. In the long run the burden of payroll taxes, even those paid by companies, falls on workers, whose wages fall as their employers’ tax bills rise.
The reform is not Mr Johnson’s only breach of an election pledge. His government also announced on September 7th that it would temporarily suspend the “triple lock”, which has ensured since 2010 that the state pension rises by the minimum of earnings, inflation or 2.5%. The pandemic has distorted the official measure of earnings growth, partly because employment has fallen in the lowest-paying industries. Maintaining the triple lock, as the Conservatives had promised, could have pushed the increase in the state pension above 8%. Instead, this year it will be set with reference only to inflation and the 2.5% floor.
The government should go further and abandon the triple lock. The savings should go on working-age people, thus helping to offset the unfairness of higher payroll taxes. Mr Johnson’s reinvention as a politician willing to take an unpopular but necessary decision is welcome. Many more will be needed. ■",2
1798," (CNN)Many of the stars taking the stage at Thursday's Latin Grammys will be familiar not just to fans of Latin pop but to most consumers of American pop culture.For decades, well-established Latin artists rerecorded their music in English and made other adjustments to cross over into the American mainstream. Now, Latin pop artists like J Balvin and Bad Bunny grace the covers of major magazines and appear on late night talk shows without changing their music -- English-speaking listeners are instead crossing over to them.""You go to Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, and every week almost there's a Latin artist performing in Spanish. And it's perfectly normalized,"" says Leila Cobo, author of  ""Decoding 'Despacito': An Oral History of Latin Music."" ""That just is an example of how popular the music has gotten and the fact that now it's regarded as mainstream pop not just niche music.""As many of these artists prepare to take the stage at the Latin Grammys on Thursday, here's a look back at how Latin pop music -- with influences from reggaeton to cumbia to bachata -- became the cultural force that it is today. Latin artists have been crossing over for decadesPerhaps the first Latin artist to ""cross over"" was Dámaso Pérez Prado in the 1950s, says Cobo.The Cuban band leader, pianist and arranger rose to fame in Mexico for playing mambos and other Latin rhythms and soon became the label RCA Victor's biggest artist in the Latin American market, Cobo writes in her book. After a version of Pérez Prado's ""Que Rico el Mambo"" recorded by American big band leader Sonny Burke became a hit in the US, the label moved Pérez Prado from its international division and began promoting him in the American pop market. ""They discovered this guy whose music was very popular around the world and in the States, and they said, 'Well, why don't we treat him as if he were an American artist instead of treating him as if he were a Latin American artist only for Latin America?"" Cobo says.From there, his popularity exploded, Cobo writes in her book. He launched a US tour, selling out concerts across the country. With songs such as ""Mambo No. 5,"" ""Cherry Pink (And Apple Blossom White)"" and ""Patricia,"" he helped popularize the mambo across North America, reaching Latin and non-Latin audiences alike.Over the decades, there were some similar crossover success stories. Ritchie Valens made the Mexican folk song ""La Bamba"" a hit on the US charts in the late 1950s. Miami Sound Machine, the band fronted by Gloria Estefan, recorded a number of English-language albums in the '80s. Spanish singer Julio Iglesias would go on to record songs with Willie Nelson, Diana Ross and Frank Sinatra, among others. But these examples were anomalies, according to Cobo. ""Coming from Latin America and singing in Spanish was still a little bit strange and not common for the mainstream, even though it was happening everywhere,"" she adds.All that changed in the late '90s with the arrival of the so-called ""Latin Explosion.""The '90s turned the crossover into a movementRicky Martin's performance at the 1999 Grammy Awards marked a breakthrough for Latin music.The Puerto Rican captivated American audiences with a bilingual rendition of ""La Copa de la Vida"" (The Cup of Life), a song that had been the anthem of the World Cup a year earlier. By that time, Martin was already a star in Latin America, performing for years as part of the boy band Menudo before going on to sell out stadiums as a solo artist.Executives at the label Sony Music Entertainment, which signed Martin to its Latin music division in the early '90s, were already looking at ways that they might market Martin to an English-speaking audience, Cobo says.""Here was a guy that was playing stadiums in Latin America,"" Cobo says. ""If you [were a label executive and you] went to a Ricky concert in Argentina and you saw 50,000 people, you wanted to see what you could do with the guy elsewhere."" But before that moment at the Grammys, most Americans had no idea who he was.Soon after his rousing performance, Martin released his first English-language album, which feaured the smash hit single ""Livin' La Vida Loca."" The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, breaking sales records, while the single topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks straight. Martin set in motion a pop culture phenomenon that saw other Latin artists at the time achieve similar success on the US charts. Some were US-born like Jennifer Lopez (whose debut album was recorded in English) and Marc Anthony (who primarily recorded his music in Spanish before his 1999 self-titled solo album was released). Others were international artists like Shakira and Enrique Iglesias. Four out of these five crossover stars were signed to Sony Music, which some credit for engineering the Latin Explosion.""Right in the crux of 1999, 2000, it was a very unusual time where you had five extraordinary artists coming out at the same time, which is not common,"" Cobo says. ""There was a bit of accident, a bit of planning ... All the pieces came together.""While artists like Shakira debuted in Spanish and later recorded English-language albums that led to their stateside success, others like pop star Christina Aguilera -- who released the album ""Mi Reflejo"" after the success of her self-titled debut -- found fame with US audiences before they started making albums in Spanish. (Lopez's Spanish-language debut didn't land until 2007.)Then streaming changed the gameBut the phenomenon was short-lived, as critics later documented. And after a few years, the so-called ""Latin Explosion"" that promised to transform the US pop market -- as well as the US itself -- imploded.""Not only did the boom's stars prove to be mere comets, but the flash and bang of the carefully manufactured pop boom blinded the public to what's really worthwhile in Latin music -- organic, cross-cultural sounds that continue to evolve under the mass media's radar,"" former columnist Agustin Gurza wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2004.After that period, Latin music fell into a slump, according to Cobo.While some Latin pop hits such as Daddy Yankee's ""Gasolina"" broke into the US mainstream, the Latin music industry took a downward turn as music went digital, she says. Piracy was rampant in Latin America, she explains, causing major labels to lose money and invest less in artist development.But as music shifted toward streaming, the industry began to recover. And in 2017, one song would catapult Latin pop to an entirely new level of global success: ""Despacito.""Three months after the song from Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee was released, Fonsi got a call from his record label telling him that Justin Bieber had heard the track at a Colombian nightclub and wanted to record a remix.Days later, the ""Despacito"" remix featuring Justin Bieber was released. The rest is history -- the song rose to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for 16 consecutive weeks, breaking a record at the time. It was the first Spanish language song to top that chart since ""Macarena"" in 1996. It also topped the charts of dozens of other countries, and became the most-watched YouTube video of the decade.""It's not very easy to [top the Billboard Hot 100] when it's a different language,"" Fonsi said in a 2017 interview with CNN. ""That is very special -- that we were able to break that language barrier and just connect with people through music. From a career level, it's very important. But to me, I'm just very proud that Latin music has grown so much and people are just really connecting to it.""We're living in the reverse crossover eraThe success of ""Despacito"" kickstarted a new wave of mainstream success for Latin music -- one that shows no signs of slowing down.Since ""Despacito,"" other predominately Spanish-language tracks have performed well on the charts, too -- from J Balvin's ""Mi Gente"" to Rosalía's ""Malamente"" to the No. 1 hit ""I Like It"" from J Balvin, Cardi B and Bad Bunny.Streaming has made it easier for listeners to discover music scenes such as reggaeton and Latin trap without those artists needing the marketing machine of a major label -- in other words, English-speaking audiences are crossing over into Latin music.""The world is coming together and sort of getting smaller,"" Fonsi told Rolling Stone in 2019. ""Nowadays people are not afraid to change their normal listening habits and listen to different things. It's like, 'Hey, maybe I don't understand every single word that they're saying, but this song makes me feel this and it makes me move and I connect to it.' To be able to sing in both languages, to work with people from around the world and mix styles and cultures? I think that is truly what music should be about.""Despite finding major success outside of Latin America, artists such as J Balvin and Bad Bunny have recorded few songs in English and have indicated that they feel no compulsion to do otherwise. ""Why do I have to change?"" Bad Bunny said during a recent appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah. ""No one has [told] a gringo artist that you have to change. This is who I am. This is my music. This is my culture. If you don't like it, don't listen to me. If you like it, you know.""However, there's still progress to be made, some critics argue. Suzy Exposito of the Los Angeles Times pointed out earlier this year that the 2021 Grammy Award nominations largely shut Latin artists out of the top categories and relegated them to the Latin categories. But there have been some changes. The Recording Academy announced in April that it would be adding a fifth category to the Latin field, meaning the 2022 show will have more awards for Latin music than pop, rock, rap or country.Others, like Cobo, are more hopeful. The landscape, she says, is much more fluid in today's era -- crossover not required. Some Latin artists switch seamlessly between collaborations with other Latin artists and US pop artists and between bilingual songs and exclusively Spanish-language tracks. Others choose to record mostly in Spanish because it feels authentic to them -- knowing that despite their decision, or perhaps because of it, they have legions of fans behind them. ",0
1799,"TO HEAR CHINA’S Communist Party tell it, the nifty thing about autocracy is that it lets rulers plan for the long term. Apologists for one-party rule hail China’s leaders as enlightened technocrats who think in centuries, while decadent Western democracies struggle to see beyond the next election cycle.
By the autocrats’ logic, China should excel at tackling climate change. For it faces stark long-term risks. As an arid country that lacks clean water and productive farmland, and where the richest regions lie on the coast, China is exceedingly vulnerable to global warming and rising sea levels. Sure enough, the supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, seems to be taking charge. Last September he decreed that China’s emissions of CO2 will peak by 2030 and that by 2060 the country will become carbon neutral. A China-wide emissions-trading system goes live this summer. Vast wind farms and arrays of solar panels have been built, and more are coming.

In fact, Chinese climate policy is a mess of contradictions. Perhaps time will show that Mr Xi is serious about making the unpopular, expensive changes that are needed to wean his country off fossil fuels, notably the coal that supplies nearly 60% of the country’s energy. But it is difficult to be sure. China’s coal consumption has risen significantly since it joined the Paris climate agreement in 2015. At home, a ban on new coal-fired power stations was lifted in 2018. The total capacity of such plants approved for construction or being built is larger than America’s entire active coal-fired power sector. Overseas, despite pleas from America, the European Union and others, Chinese development banks lend billions of dollars each year to build coal-burning plants, though a state-owned giant, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, says it will phase out coal financing.
Provinces and cities, especially in the coal-reliant north-east, are hesitant about publishing carbon “peaking plans”. They want more time to pursue growth before curbing greenhouse gases. The rules governing the emissions-trading scheme have been loosened so that only a handful of plants will face real constraints, at least initially. This reflects the leading role apparently granted to the main economic planning agency, at the expense of the environment ministry, in bodies charged with deciding how, and how fast, to tackle climate change. Some big steelmakers have been allowed to expand production again, months after they were caught breaking environmental rules and ordered to cut emissions.

Climate-related efforts in China are not always as mysterious or prone to sudden reversals. Take the China operations of foreign multinationals. Responding to consumers and politicians back home, many such firms have promised to make their global businesses carbon neutral, and to seek big cuts in emissions from their supply chains. As a result, the China bosses of some well-known European companies have told officials, including in the north-eastern cities of Tianjin and Shenyang, that they will find it hard to expand or open new production sites if the electricity or heating on offer locally continues to come from coal. “In an energy-intensive industry, if the electricity is coal-based, you can’t build a new plant,” says Harald Kumpfert of the European Union Chamber of Commerce’s branch in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province.
The largest taxpayer in Shenyang is a BMW joint venture that makes 600,000 cars a year at two plants. In 2016 the city had no green electricity to sell. Now a new wind farm in Liaoning—a blustery coastal province with huge potential for green energy—provides about two-thirds of BMW’s power. More energy comes from solar panels built over car parks where vehicles await delivery. On a recent visit, Chaguan was shown technologies that have cut carbon emissions per vehicle by 84% since 2016, such as cleverly controlled ovens in the paint shop. In a nicely dramatic touch, freshly baked car bodies emerge on a raised conveyor that carries them on a bridge through an office building, on their way to assembly lines.
Alas, hundreds of BMW suppliers in China have “huge trouble” obtaining renewable electricity, say engineers at the car firm, suggesting that the foreigners have snapped up most green energy on offer. To avoid simply shuffling dirty energy around and to increase demand for renewables, energy-intensive Chinese suppliers, such as steelmakers or aluminium foundries, need to start installing efficient technologies and using low-carbon energy. Progress also requires changing the incentives that guide officials. BMW makes the case to governments that “jobs using renewable energy are sustainable jobs,” says Johann Wieland, head of the carmaker’s main China business.
Long-term plans, short-term incentives
China’s political system, for all its multi-decade plans, is run by officials who may stay in a given job for five years, and whose next promotion depends on economic growth now. Zhang Lei, the chief executive of Envision, a big wind-energy and battery company, is confident that top-down orders can overcome local inertia. “The most important thing is that President Xi has made a huge commitment and continues to push that agenda,” says Mr Zhang.
Ma Jun, an environmentalist, sees a role for pressure from above and below. He runs the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an influential Beijing-based organisation that tracks and publishes pollution and emissions data. “It is too much to expect a foreign company to change the energy mix of a city,” says Mr Ma. But nudges from foreign and local businesses might push officials to a tipping point. “To change minds we need both market-based and policy-based interventions,” he says.
Multinational corporations are not saints. Many were happy to run profitable but dirty plants in faraway places. Too many are still reluctant to demand transparency from suppliers. But Western voters are growing serious about the climate, and about holding governments and businesses to account. That pressure might just be helpful in China. Pluralism is messy but potent stuff. ■

1800,"THE END OF Britain’s 47-year experiment in Europe had a Scottish air to it. On January 29th last year the European Parliament ratified the Brexit divorce, after three years of negotiations which had exhausted Britons. On the square outside in Brussels a bagpiper played “Flower of Scotland”, a folk tune, and “Ode to Joy”, the European anthem. Aileen McLeod, a member of the parliament for the Scottish National Party (SNP), told other members that her country would soon be back: “In the meantime, I hope very much that you will leave a light on for Scotland.” After the vote was cast, many of the MEPs joined hands and sang “Auld Lang Syne”, a song of friendship by Robert Burns, Scotland’s national poet.
As prime minister, David Cameron oversaw two constitutional referendums with the potential to change the United Kingdom irrevocably. He expected to win both handily. In 2014 he had permitted Scots to vote on independence from the rest of Britain. They rejected it by 55% to 45%, and the following morning Mr Cameron declared the issue settled for a generation. In 2016, he was not so fortunate. In the referendum on membership of the European Union, Britons voted by 52% to 48% to leave.

Those two decisions are now inextricably entwined. Scots, more Europhile than the English, voted by 62% to 38% to remain in Europe. So Brexit has reopened the question of Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom, provoked demands for a new referendum, and reshaped the independence movement as an avowedly Europhile cause. For a growing number of Scots, independence has become the escape route from Brexit. Their movement—full of young, educated idealists, who are green, pro-migration and increasingly stirred by the politics of gender and race—looks like the opposite of the alliance of English traditionalists who supported Brexit.

The movement hopes soon to have its moment. Scotland will hold elections on May 6th for its devolved parliament in Edinburgh, which since 1999 has run education, health care and transport (foreign relations, defence and the economy are still run by Westminster). Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, will seek another term as first minister. An SNP government, she says, will have a mandate to hold a second vote on independence. If it won, that would lead to separation talks with London, and open the door to Scotland’s accession to the EU. Around 65% of Scots still want to rejoin the bloc.Polls show a small lead for separation (see chart 1).
But victory in a second referendum would bring Ms Sturgeon a similar challenge to the one which Britain faced in 2016, of extracting a nation from a political and economic union without unleashing chaos. The SNP’s top brass believe they can avoid such trauma and learn from British errors. The Brexiteers had wildly different ideas about what Brexit meant, made no preparations for negotiations, and refused to anticipate problems such as the border with Ireland. Nationalists, by contrast, are clear about Scotland’s destination as a new EU state, and the Scottish government is studying the EU accession process. In private, senior nationalists are a little more candid these days about the obstacles: the need for a trade border with England, a new currency and a legally complex transition period for the chilly years between leaving one union and joining the other.
Yet many of the technical and legal challenges would look similar to those brought about by Brexit: settling bills, splitting assets, fixing the right to work and study, and access to fishing waters. The union has stood since 1707, so Scotland is far more deeply stitched into the United Kingdom than Britain was into Europe. The hidden systems of daily life—tax collection, immigration controls, electricity distribution—must be unwoven. Unlike Brexit, Scottish negotiations would need to grapple with the fate of nuclear weapons, sovereign debts, and oil and gas reserves. Only once Scotland was a state could accession talks with Europe begin. Unionists warn that, rather than an escape from the turmoil of Brexit, Scotland would be choosing its own “Brexit on steroids”.
But we can still rise now
Unlike British rule in Ireland, for most of its life the union has rested on Scots’ consent, which they have been, for the most part, happy to grant. Scotland had a stake in Britain’s government, producing prime ministers and cabinet members. Empire and free trade with England made it wealthy and the union did not interfere with Scotland’s church, legal system and universities. Demands for a parliament grew in the 20th century, but calls for independence only came from a noisy fringe.
The pillars of consent were weakened under Margaret Thatcher. She was more willing to impose London rule on Scots in areas such as higher education and local government. The collapse of coal, steel and manufacturing that followed privatisation hit Scotland hard, drove up unemployment, and gave the SNP its “anti-Scottish” villain. In the 1980s, the idea that Westminster lacked consent and legitimacy in Scotland gained ground in the Labour Party. Tony Blair hoped the devolved parliament would forestall independence. The SNP hoped it would be a stepping stone.
The Labour Party dominated the new parliament but became detached and complacent, and the SNP displaced it as the force of the Scottish left. In 2011 it won a majority in the Scottish Parliament. In 2015 it swept Labour’s Scottish MPs out of Westminster, too. As the devolved parliament has thrived, so the political news Scots digest has become increasingly different from England’s. Scots migrate south less, so cultural ties weaken. Yet, given the choice in 2014, they still opted to stay.
There the story might have ended, were it not for Brexit. Mr Johnson has chosen a hard exit, ditching the EU’s single market and customs union. He has spurned membership of Erasmus, an exchange programme popular with Scottish students, and an easy migration regime. That has cracked the pillars of consent. Scotland has looked suddenly powerless: the views of its voters, their parliament and their MPs in Westminster have counted for little. Brexit cuts deep into the courts and universities, and will make it poorer, as fishermen and bankers encounter trade barriers to Europe where before there were none.
In 2014, with Britain still in Europe, an architect in Glasgow could vote against independence, for she could have it all, seeing herself as Scottish, British or European, and working as freely in Munich as in Manchester. Now she is being asked to choose which identity she prioritises, and in which single market she wants to work.
Unionists see the SNP’s Europhilia as opportunistic. The party had opposed Britain’s entry into the EU in 1973, reckoning Europe remote and undemocratic. But it changed as dictatorships fell and Europe’s purpose evolved from stopping old countries going to war to helping new ones find freedom and prosperity. Ms Sturgeon welcomed Europe’s embrace of former communist states in 2004 as evidence of the “sheer normality of independence in Europe for small nations”.
The bloc does the hard work of independence for young, small states: it provides a ready-made currency, a trade policy and market of 450m consumers, and heaps of funding for motorways and wind farms. The EU’s breadth and reach, say nationalists, means independence is not a leap in the dark like Brexit, but a defined destination for which they can prepare. “Our answer to absolutely everything is whatever is working for Ireland, we’ll do,” says one SNP bigwig.
Scotland would blend in fine, as a middling EU member by size and disposition. It has typically European interests—financial services and green energy—and European problems, too—poor demographics and urban decay. Ms Sturgeon sees it as part of an arc of Nordic social democracies (new parents are sent a box of baby things, a policy borrowed from Finland) and has won the sympathy of European leaders.
But Europe may be leaving a light on for a long time. The first step is getting a referendum. Polls suggest Ms Sturgeon will keep her job after May 6th, either with an outright majority or in a pro-independence coalition. A toxic feud with Alex Salmond, her predecessor, has led to his launching a rival pro-independence party, Alba, but it does not seem to have badly dented SNP support. Her main problem will be getting a British prime minister to approve a new poll. Britain has no equivalent to Article 50, the EU’s unilateral exit clause. Under British law, the union is the exclusive concern of the Westminster Parliament, and the last referendum was held with Mr Cameron’s permission. Ms Sturgeon would like Mr Johnson to follow his lead, arguing that a vote must be deemed legally sound in London and overseas to result in statehood. If he does not, Ms Sturgeon will seek to force his hand by pushing ahead with a referendum law in the Scottish Parliament and daring him to approve it or to challenge it in the Supreme Court.
Mr Johnson says he will refuse, and that a referendum is reckless while Scotland recovers from covid-19. An unauthorised plebiscite would be a significant change in SNP strategy, which he could simply ignore or legislate to ban. Nearly half of English voters would be pleased or indifferent about Scottish independence, according to YouGov, a pollster, but it matters to the Conservative and Unionist Party, as the Tories are properly known. Scottish independence would cause both allies and adversaries to rapidly downgrade Britain’s global role, and inflict emotional trauma. “It would feel like chopping off your own arm,” says one Scottish Tory.
Whereas Mr Cameron offered greater devolution, Mr Johnson’s strategy is to reinforce London’s power, to fly the Union flag and splash the cash. EU funds for bridges and roads used to be handed to the Scottish government, but in future the British government will apportion the cash directly. Such a strategy risks strengthening support for independence. A new referendum, under a future government, may simply become a matter of time.
Unionists will ask Scots to focus on the economics of independence, which are liable to be tougher than Brexit’s. Around 60% of Scotland’s exports go to the rest of Britain, and leaving will cut GDP over the long run by between 6.5% and 8.7%—two to three times more than the cost of Brexit—according to a paper from the London School of Economics. EU membership will do little to mitigate that, it argues, as joining the single market would mean stricter controls at the English border.
The currency is a central weakness. In 2014, the British Treasury rejected the SNP’s plan to use sterling. The SNP now says it would use it unofficially, as Panama uses the dollar, before adopting a Scottish currency “as soon as practicable”. Since the EU states must consider their exchange rates with the euro “a matter of common concern”, Scotland would need to have a new currency or agree to a short transition before joining, notes Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.
As a condition of membership, Scotland would promise to adopt the euro. The SNP argues this can be deferred indefinitely, as Sweden and Poland have done. Fewer than one in five Scots wants the euro, but the difficulties of creating a currency may make Frankfurt’s embrace more attractive. With a new Scottish currency, big exchange-rate risks would suddenly appear in cross-border contracts. Wages paid in it may shrink relative to mortgages agreed in sterling, a lesser risk with the more stable euro. Large banks would shift some of their activity overseas, fearing a Scottish central bank would struggle to act as a lender of last resort.

Scotland’s public finances would be squeezed, which would frustrate nationalists who want a more generous welfare state. Scotland raises less tax and spends more per person than Britain as a whole. The implied deficit (currently plugged by the central government) was 8.6% of GDP in 2019-20, compared with 2.6% for Britain as a whole (see chart 2). Tax revenues from oil and gas are volatile and fell from £10bn in 2008 to £650m last year. Scotland would be expected to meet the EU’s deficit criteria of 3% before or soon after joining. A paper commissioned by the SNP in 2018 proposed doing this within ten years by holding down public spending. While the British government can borrow at low interest rates, a new Scottish government would have to establish its own fiscal credibility, a task made harder by raising funds in a new currency.
The Remain camp relied on dry economics before the Brexit vote. Unionists face the same problem. Nationalists counter that trade patterns will shift and independence will give Edinburgh the levers to lift productivity. Goldman Sachs, a bank, has told clients that as well as big challenges, there are “potential economic upsides” to independence if Scotland can spur investment and improve skills. Polls suggest that, despite the gloomy predictions, Scots think Brexit more economically damaging than independence would be, and those most pessimistic about Brexit are the ones most enthusiastic about breaking away. After Brexit, Tories can hardly ask Scots to heed businesses’ concerns.

Unionists, with good cause, argue that the negotiations would be eerily familiar, too. Much of the content would resemble the 177 pages of legalese of the Brexit divorce treaty. That calculated Britain’s share of the EU’s financial liabilities, the rights of EU citizens in Britain, and tied up a long list of administrative loose ends, creating rules for personal data, nuclear fuel and legal disputes. Independence talks would cover a wider range, and be playing for higher stakes. The SNP wishes to eject Britain’s nuclear arsenal, which alarms American military planners. Britain’s £2.1trn national debt (98% of GDP) would need to be apportioned, as would its assets, including properties and oil and gas reserves.
The work would consume both governments. Brexit involved 25,000 civil servants (the Scottish government has just 5,000) and crowded out other issues for several years. The two parliaments would churn through a flurry of legislation to dissolve their relationship, create a new Scottish constitution and government, enact their divorce terms and remodel what was left of the rump British state.
And be the nation again
In the Brexit talks the EU had powerful leverage as the bigger party. As for Scotland, its deep integration with Britain would give Westminster the upper hand. The question is how far it would exploit it. “A brutal rupture would pretty much turn the lights out in Scotland,” says Philip Rycroft, a former British official who took part in informal preparations for a yes vote in 2014. He would urge ministers not to abuse that power, but an “antagonistic, zero-sum, Brexit negotiation mindset” could prevail, he warns.

Just as Europe feared a cascade of exit votes after Brexit, the fear of Wales and Northern Ireland also wanting to go their own way would drive a hard deal, says the Scottish Tory. “I see very few incentives to go kindly with them.”
Accession negotiations with Europe would be more cordial, but exacting. After five decades inside, Scotland should meet the EU’s core entry requirements—upholding democracy and the rule of law, and operating a robust market economy—relatively easily. It would need to bring its statute book back into line with Europe’s. A bigger task will be building new agencies to enforce rules in fields such as competition, data protection and customs.
Spain, which is fighting Catalan separatism, would be alarmed and wields a veto. Scotland would need nimble diplomacy, stressing that its exit was strictly in accord with Britain’s constitution.EU leaders would want to know that Scotland would not replace Britain as an awkward member, nor demand British-style opt-outs of major policies, says Fabian Zuleeg of the European Policy Centre. “But unless there were unreasonable demands, I can’t see that you wouldn’t get there in the end,” he says.
The whole process would strain Scotland’s parliament, just as Brexit split Westminster. Senior nationalists want to build a broad coalition for exit talks. They know it would be a gradual process. The Institute for Government, a think-tank, reckons leaving Britain and rejoining the EU would take most of a decade, but the nationalist rank and file want a fast and clean divorce.
Mr Cameron thought the threat of economic and administrative disruption could secure victory in referendums. But it is consent to a union that holds it together. Scottish independence, like Brexit, is a constitutional project, not an economic one. Fixing who governs you takes precedence over an easy life for supermarkets or civil servants. The British divorce from Europe has shown that a committed government, with the mandate of a referendum and an appetite for dislocation, can go a long way. The road back to Europe is long, but bagpipes may play again in Brussels. ■

Northern Ireland’s unhappy centenary (Apr 2021)",2
1801,"IT WAS A deliberate provocation, patriotically timed. On October 1st, the country’s national day, China flew 38 aircraft, including fighter jets and bombers, towards Taiwan (one type, the J-16, is pictured). They entered the island’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), a buffer region where intrusions often prompt military alerts. It was the year’s daily record. Over the next three days China sent another 111 planes. In response, Taiwan scrambled jets, broadcast warnings and tracked the Chinese aircraft with missile systems. The island’s defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, called it “the toughest situation I have seen in more than 40 years of my military life”.
The skies around Taiwan were quieter as The Economist went to press. On October 6th China flew no military planes through the ADIZ. So far none of the flights has crossed into Taiwan’s territorial airspace, which extends 12 nautical miles (about 22km) from the island. The intruders typically fly 35 nautical miles or more from the Taiwanese coast. But American officials clearly share Mr Chiu’s anxiety. On October 6th America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, called on China to halt its “provocative” activity near Taiwan. Also that day, Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, conveyed America’s concern at a meeting in Switzerland with Yang Jiechi, China’s most senior diplomat and a member of the ruling Politburo.

China is unabashed. Its state media have described the sorties as a demonstration of the country’s ability to conduct “a wartime air attack”. In recent years China has been ratcheting up displays of its growing military capability, especially at sea and in the air, as a warning to Taiwan. Its message is that if the island refuses to accept China’s claim to sovereignty over Taiwan, China may use force. Mr Chiu, a retired general, told Taiwan’s parliament on October 6th that China would be able to mount a full-scale invasion of Taiwan by 2025, at a cost that the Communist Party in Beijing may consider bearable.

Taiwan’s ADIZ extends over a part of China’s coast, so it is not surprising that Chinese military aircraft often fly into it (see map). But China has taken to probing parts of the ADIZ that are much closer to the island, skirting around the south-western end of what is known as the “median line”, an informal boundary in the Taiwan Strait midway between the island and the mainland. China now conducts such flights near southern Taiwan almost every day. They could be intended to wear down Taiwan’s defences (its air force is much smaller than China’s) and condition it into treating big sorties as normal in order to make it easier for China to disguise the early phase of an attack as an exercise.
Assessing China’s intentions is extremely difficult. It is fond of sabre-rattling when it believes that Taiwan is moving too close to asserting permanent separation from China, or when America cosies up to the island. Recent sorties may relate to such developments. Earlier this year the Biden administration secured public statements of support for Taiwan from the European Union, the G7, Japan and South Korea. September was an especially irksome month: Taiwan sought entry to a trans-Pacific free-trade group just after China had made the same request and American and British naval ships sailed through the Taiwan Strait. On September 15th America, Britain and Australia agreed to a security partnership, AUKUS, that is viewed in Beijing as an alliance aimed at keeping China in check. In the days that followed, China ramped up its flights into Taiwan’s ADIZ.
If China’s planes were to edge closer to airspace over the island itself, it is unclear how Taiwan would respond. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, has said that Taiwanese pilots should not be the ones to shoot first—at least not without explicit orders. Taiwan’s latest Quadrennial Defence Review, produced this year, was vague about this, saying only that the island’s responses should get stronger the closer that Chinese aircraft get to the island.
Some analysts wonder whether a Taiwanese fighter would be authorised to fire anything more than a warning shot, even if a Chinese plane were to fly over Taiwanese land. In a forthcoming article, two think-tankers in America, Bonny Lin of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies and David Sacks of the Council on Foreign Relations, note Taiwanese press reports which say that Taiwan may have divided its airspace into three zones of engagement: a “surveillance zone” of 30 nautical miles, a “warning zone” of 24 nautical miles and a “destruction zone” of 12 nautical miles. Ms Lin and Mr Sacks say that if any engagement were to lead to the death of a pilot, even accidentally, “both sides would be ill-equipped” to keep tensions under control.
There has been no such casualty since 1958. But accidents have happened nearby. In 2001 a mid-air collision off the coast of southern China between a Chinese fighter and an American naval spy-plane killed the Chinese pilot. The crippled American plane landed at a Chinese military airbase. Ten days of tension ensued before the crew were allowed to leave. Twenty years later, such an encounter may be far harder to resolve. Relations between America and China are considerably worse. China suspended official contacts with Taiwan after Ms Tsai became president in 2016 and she failed to endorse the view of leaders in Beijing that there is only “one China”.
Should a crisis occur in Taiwan’s skies, nationalist sentiment in China could further complicate matters. Global Times, a jingoistic party tabloid in Beijing, declared in April that if Ms Tsai’s government were to continue its “hostile” behaviour (working closely with America counts as such, it suggested), China’s fighter planes would be prepared to fly across the island and disregard the “red line” relating to territorial airspace. Ms Tsai appears unfazed. In an upcoming issue of Foreign Affairs, she writes that Taiwan hopes to “shoulder more responsibility by being a close political and economic partner of the United States and other like-minded countries”. She warns that people in Taiwan will “rise up should the very existence of Taiwan be under threat”. Such words will not stop the sorties, nor assuage fears that a mishap could turn into something far bloodier. ■

1802,"SANTIAGO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chile's Senate voted against removing President Sebastian Pinera from office on Tuesday, ending an impeachment process that had successfully passed a lower house vote last week over alleged irregularities in the sale of a mining company.
The Senate vote fell short of a two-thirds majority, or 29 votes, needed in order to oust Pinera, who is set to leave office in March next year. Chileans will vote in presidential elections on Sunday, in which Pinera is not a candidate.
After fierce debate and speeches defending and attacking the center-right president, Pinera's allies reached the threshold needed to block the opposition from getting the necessary number of votes, a higher bar than the simple majority in the lower house.
The vote saves Pinera - a billionaire businessman - from being removed from office and being disqualified for five years from holding public office.
The impeachment proceedings spring from the so-called Pandora Papers leak, a cache of documents that revealed offshore transactions involving global political and business figures.
Among them were documents that appear to outline a deal involving the 2010 sale of the Dominga copper and iron mine. At the time, Pinera was in his first year of his first term in office.
The papers suggested that the deal, involving a firm linked to Pinera's family, was contingent on favorable regulations. The sale was examined and dismissed by courts in 2017.
Center-right Pinera rejects the accusations, saying the details of the contract were in a file previously reviewed with no irregularities found.",3
1803,"BAI SHUANG stayed overseas longer than most. After a degree in Paris, Ms Bai worked for a French company, then went to London for a Master’s and got another job. By 2017 two forces pulled her home. First was her salary, which Ms Bai thought too low; she heard she could earn more in Shanghai’s startup scene. The second was her parents, who were aghast at the terrorist attacks that rocked both her adoptive cities. China was safe, they said, and Ms Bai could “shine” here. “If there is a place where you can have it all, then why not?” Ms Bai reasoned. She bought a ticket home.
Ms Bai is a “sea turtle”, a play on the Chinese homonym haigui, meaning “to return from abroad”. Of the 6.2m Chinese who left to study overseas between 2000 and 2019, more than 4m have returned, says the education ministry. The rate of return has picked up. In 2001 just 14% went home. But in every year since 2013, China has welcomed back at least four in five overseas graduates. Amid the unusual stresses of covid-19, it is thought that 800,000 came home in the first nine months of 2020, up from 580,000 in 2019.

The pandemic has cut short stints abroad. When it is over, educational flows should pick up again. But a new confluence of factors had already been turning well-educated Chinese away from the West, and America in particular. More than just covid-19 and terrorist incidents are making the West seem unsafe and hostile. Trips to America by Chinese students fell by 70% in the first nine months of 2020 over a year earlier. But only 50% fewer Taiwanese and 56% fewer South Korean students went to America, despite the fact that both places beat back covid-19 as effectively as China.
One reason is that America is making it harder for Chinese graduates to stay. In 2018 it cut from five years to one the validity of visas issued to those in sensitive fields of study, including computer science. In September America revoked visas of 1,000 students and researchers whom it deemed security threats. Donald Trump repeatedly accused Chinese students of stealing American technology. In the words of Christopher Wray, his FBI director, China is no longer just a “whole-of-government” threat, but a “whole-of-society” one.
It is little surprise that young Chinese wonder if they are welcome. Last year over half of American youths polled by the Pew Research Centre expressed negative views of China. Across the population this number hit an all-time high of 73%. The feeling seems mutual. In a survey of 20,000 Chinese run by Cary Wu of Toronto University last April, four in five respondents under 30 said that they did not trust Americans.

The experiences of covid-19 and Mr Trump have formed views in young Chinese that will linger long after both are gone. Mr Trump threatened to ban Huawei, a national champion; TikTok, a winning export; and WeChat, a lifeline to family back home for those overseas. A popular joke online is that Mr Trump encouraged the Chinese to rally round the flag. In nationalistic circles he was even praised for laying bare America’s hypocrisy on espousing liberal values and openness.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans in America have risen. Anti-Chinese sentiment can persuade Chinese overseas students—cosmopolitan, politically liberal types—to stick up for China. A study by Jennifer Pan and Yiqing Xu of Stanford University conducted in elite American universities found that students who encountered racist taunts were more likely to back China’s political system. Those who had previously been least nationalistic showed the biggest rise in support for Chinese authoritarianism.
At home and overseas, young Chinese were appalled by how Western democracies botched their response to covid-19, when tough measures in China stopped it in its tracks. A survey last year by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, found that university-educated Chinese youths displayed the largest jump in support for Xi Jinping’s regime. In a post-covid world its competence, public order and efficiency look attractive. This has been manna for propagandists, who have censored news of the early cover-up and suffering in Wuhan, where the virus was first found. One of those who wrote bravely about these themes was Fang Fang, a 65-year-old novelist. Millions rushed to read her online diary before censors took it down. Then news broke that her account was to be translated and published in America. The fiercest backlash came among young, keen readers of her work. After state media attacked Fang Fang, many felt she had “turned her pen into a knife, and handed it to the West”.
The young pit the starry-eyed admiration of Fang Fang’s generation for the West against their own clear-eyed confidence. They think China is best served by picking aspects of Western culture that suit it. “Lots of young people think that America is declining, and that its flaws could be solved with a Chinese political arrangement,” notes Feng Chucheng of Plenum, a think-tank in Beijing. “They are more confident that we do not have to follow the same path—in fact, that our path might be better.”
The thinking was that students abroad might embrace Western values. Now it often goes the other way. A saying popular with Chinese students overseas is: “Pretty mountains, pretty lakes, pretty boring”, expressing their longing for China’s efficient, clean and fast-paced cities. When Dylan Zhou arrived in San Francisco for a PhD in physics in 2017, he thought America was “really fantastic, really liberal”. With time, Mr Zhou liked it less: its courts were too lenient, its policies for minorities too indulgent, and American investors would crack jokes he did not understand. Mr Zhou is returning to China early, to set up a fintech company.
Like Mr Zhou and Ms Bai, who runs an online-learning startup, many are lured by China’s zingy tech sector. Earlier returnees are credited with getting it off the ground, building local versions of Facebook and Twitter. Now Facebook and the rest steal ideas from pioneering Chinese apps, a source of pride for young Chinese. Financing from venture-capital funds is easier to come by. And if returnees have influential parents, their guanxi, or personal connections, can give children a head start.
Feeling territorial
A lack of sympathy for liberal values is becoming evident closer to home. Many of the grievances that drive Hong Kongers to protest, such as graduate unemployment and high house prices, once resonated with mainlanders. Luqiu Luwei, a journalism professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, says her mainland students were “full of curiosity” during the mass sit-ins of the “umbrella movement” in 2014, rushing to observe and even join them. But the protests that roiled Hong Kong in 2019 left them cold. “Why are they allowed to be so disruptive?” her students asked. Police on the mainland called some students’ parents to warn their children to stay clear of the protests. But Ms Luqiu also observes that few seek out news from sources other than Chinese media, which have vilified the protesters as separatists. This is despite the fact that Hong Kong’s internet is open, so they do not need to use unauthorised virtual private networks to access foreign news sites, unlike on the mainland. Powerful domestic platforms such as Weibo, WeChat and Douyin mean few form the habit to read widely, thinks Ms Luqiu.
And what of young views of Taiwan, which China claims as its own? In 2011 China allowed students to study in Taiwan at a time of warmer ties with a China-friendly government. Thousands have thus been able to see democracy up-close in a place with a familiar language and culture. A few, like 27-year-old Anderson Yu, who arrived in 2011 from southern Guangdong province, relish the experience. “I love this place,” says Mr Yu, who hears out pro-independence Taiwanese friends even if he is “sceptical”. Lots of other young Chinese flock to the island for trinkets and pop culture.
But many experience discrimination from locals and barriers that stop them from applying for grants or staying on to work. Taiwanese youths mistrust China more than their elders do. Chinese students also make no effort to mix, says Mr Yu. Attitudes have hardened since Tsai Ing-wen was elected president in 2016 (and re-elected in 2020). Many are “upset that Taiwan is not grateful to China for the freedoms it has granted the region,” says Mr Yu.
Soft power matters in shaping opinion. Older Chinese grew up listening to Cantonese songs and watching Taiwanese films, forming a special admiration for both territories. Youngsters do not have the same bond, says Fang Kecheng of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. They now watch their own shows—and Hong Kong youths tune in. This appreciation for home-grown culture can be a force for good. Many overseas students echo Ms Bai, the startup founder, when she says she returned to China “because if I am here, then I can change something”. Whether on debating shows or through home-grown rap music, young people are creating new identities. The next chapter delves into some of them.■",2
1804,"IN 2020 CALIFORNIA’S population shrank for the first time, as people left for less expensive places. Recently, however, headlines have been focused on who is coming to the Golden State: a parade of Democratic luminaries, to drum up support for Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, as he fends off a “recall” election to remove him from office on September 14th.
The high-profile visitors demonstrate how much is at stake. If voters recall Mr Newsom and elect a Republican, it could flip the US Senate. (California’s governor will appoint the successor to 88-year-old Dianne Feinstein, should she retire.) A new governor could also appoint judges and the heads of departments, issue executive orders and veto line items on the budget. One legislator warned that replacing Mr Newsom with a Republican would produce a “lost year in California state government.”

Recent polls should give Mr Newsom some comfort: The Economist’s polling average shows he has the support of roughly 54% of voters But it is not just his record facing scrutiny. This election has called attention to the recall itself—a quirk that is being abused for partisan ends.
California is one of nineteen states that permits the removal of state-level officials through a vote. Only four gubernatorial recall elections have made it to the ballot in America; Mr Newsom’s will be California’s second. Voters removed California’s governor through a recall only once, in 2003, when the unpopular Gray Davis failed to manage an electricity crisis and was replaced with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
But Ken Miller, a professor at Claremont McKenna College, notes that this election differs from 2003. None of the more than 40 candidates running against Mr Newsom has Mr Schwarzenegger’s celebrity. The frontrunner, Larry Elder, is an African-American shock jock who dubs himself “the sage from South Central” and has a Trumpian predilection for provocation, including suggesting that the descendants of slave owners could be owed reparations. The electorate has also changed, notes Mr Miller: in 2003 35% of California voters were registered as Republican, versus only 24% today. Democrats now outnumber Republicans by nearly two to one.
Republicans have not won a state-level office in California since 2006, when Mr Schwarzenegger was re-elected as governor. Recall attempts have become the only way that Republicans have a chance of getting back into office, says Sherry Jeffe, a political analyst. The exercise is also eyebrow-raising because of its timing: if voters are so unhappy with Mr Newsom, they could vote him out of office when he runs for re-election next year.
Mr Newsom won election in 2018 with 62% of the vote (the greatest share of any Democratic candidate for governor in state history). Republicans had tried to recall him five times before the sixth attempt gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Two things helped Mr Newsom’s critics: a judge granting a four-month extension for signature gathering due to covid-19 and Mr Newsom’s idiotic decision last autumn to eat indoors with friends at a fancy restaurant while he was telling people to socially distance and not even see their own families for the holidays.
Judgment day
Whatever its outcome, the recall election has taken a toll on Mr Newsom. But the state is losing out too. The recall election will cost $276m in taxpayer money. Toni Atkins, president pro tempore of the California State Senate, says “having to deal with a recall takes away focus from critical issues that the governor should be spending his time on.” That includes fires, drought, the pandemic and affordable housing, among other issues.
Since the beginning, recalls have had their critics. In the 1780s, Alexander Hamilton decried the “state of vassalage and dependence” a senator would feel if a state’s legislature could recall him, as was being discussed. In 1911, President William Howard Taft vetoed Arizona’s statehood resolution partly because of a provision that would have let judges be recalled. In 1911 voters amended California’s constitution to allow for recalls, as a Progressive-era tool that would allow voters to bypass the influence big business exerted on the legislature. But since then “interest groups have learned how to game the system to subvert the democratic will” by making use of recalls and ballot initiatives, says Rick Rivas of Govern for California, a good-governance group.
Because of the way that California designs its recall process—with a majority needed for removal but just a plurality for the winner—Mr Newsom could win 49% of the vote but be replaced by someone with a much smaller share of support. “I have no doubt that next year we’re going to see a number of ideas on recall reform from the legislature,” says Ms Atkins. The legislature could tweak the recall process to dissuade partisan meddling by, for example, mandating that the lieutenant-governor automatically ascend if the governor were recalled. It could also establish a “malfeasance” standard, which would require that the governor commit an illegal act in order to be recalled, or raise the number of signatures required to put a recall on the ballot.
Any of those actions would require a Constitutional amendment, which a majority of the electorate would need to approve. In the end, the voters may decide on a total recall of the recall.■

1805,"SOME CHEERED it as a necessary intervention into a broken political system. Others called it a “coup”, the possible end of Tunisian democracy. No one is playing down the significance of President Kais Saied’s decision to enact Article 80 of the constitution, under which he suspended parliament for 30 days and dismissed the prime minister, Hichem Mechichi.
The president’s decision, delivered late on July 25th in his customarily awkward style, came after a day of widespread protests. Tens of thousands of Tunisians, defying a covid-19 lockdown, called for the downfall of the government. Some attacked the offices of Ennahda, the biggest party in parliament. After Mr Saied’s announcement many of the protesters again took to the streets—to celebrate (pictured).

Tunisia is the one true democracy to emerge from the Arab spring protests of 2010-11 that toppled dictators in a handful of countries. But it has struggled in the decade since. Ten governments in ten years have failed to stem corruption or revitalise the economy, which shrunk by 8.6% last year. Covid-19 has added to the strain. The government declared victory over the virus a year ago. Now Tunisia is suffering a new spike in cases. The health service has collapsed. Oxygen supplies are at a premium. About 200 people (out of a population of 12m) are dying each day from the disease (see chart).

Earlier this month the government opened dozens of centres offering covid-19 vaccines. Large crowds showed up expecting to be jabbed, only to find chaos, confusion and rumours of vaccine shortages. The dismissal of the health minister did little to appease an angry public—nor did the prime minister’s claim of ignorance over the operation. In a harbinger of things to come, Mr Saied stepped in, asking the army to assume management of the country’s pandemic response.

The president’s power grab was condemned by the largest parties in parliament. But Mr Saied seems unswayed. He has since fired the defence minister and acting justice minister, while lengthening an existing curfew and banning public gatherings of more than three people. The police raided the office of Al Jazeera, a media outlet seen as sympathetic to Ennahda.
Mr Saied was elected two years ago as a protest against the political class. A former constitutional-law professor with no previous political experience, he won with 73% of the vote, drawing support from young Tunisians and others who viewed him as incorruptible. The same election produced a fractious parliament, with no party or coalition claiming a majority. Mr Saied has thus attempted to play a larger role in domestic policy, previously the preserve of the prime minister and government. Since January the president has refused to swear in 11 new ministers.
It is no secret that Mr Saied, who helped to write Tunisia’s constitution (but later criticised it), wants to upend the political system. He would like the president to have more power and to do away with political parties and some elections. Instead, he suggests that Tunisians should elect local delegates, based on their merit, not their ideology. These delegates would appoint regional representatives, who would then appoint members of a national assembly. According to the constitution, two-thirds of parliament would need to approve any revision of the charter.
What Mr Saied has planned for the near term is unclear. He has claimed the power to extend the 30-day suspension of parliament “until the situation settles down”. For now he says he will assume executive authority with the help of a new prime minister, whom he will appoint. Mr Mechichi released a statement saying he would not be a ""disruptive element"" and would hand over power to whomever Mr Saied selected.
Ennahda, a party with roots in the Muslim Brotherhood (a regional Islamist movement) which now styles itself “Muslim democratic”, has also tried to calm things down. It has been a political force ever since the revolution, and many Tunisians blame it for the country’s woes. But its leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, who is also speaker of parliament, helped get Tunisia through its last big political crisis, in 2013-14, by joining a national dialogue. His party has suggested holding another one and withdrew calls for protest.
America and European democracies have expressed concern over Mr Saied’s move. But Tunisians say they have not done enough to support their country over the past decade. The president faces an immediate challenge in managing Tunisia’s relationship with the IMF. The government had been negotiating a much-needed loan from the fund, which may now think twice about making any commitment.
Tunisia is also caught up in a regional rivalry that pits countries such as Turkey and Qatar, which supported the Arab spring and the Islamist groups that benefited, against those such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which opposed the uprisings. Saudi and Emirati commentators were quick to hail Mr Saied’s actions as a blow to political Islam.
In meetings with civil-society groups Mr Saied has promised to protect Tunisian democracy. Yet he seems likely to try to reshape it in a way that gives him more power. Tunisia will not emerge from the crisis looking like Saudi Arabia. But it will probably be a little less democratic. ■",2

1807,"THE APPLE will surely fall, even if ever so slowly. When Tim Cook took the helm from Steve Jobs, the firm’s co-founder, a decade ago, even the most boosterish of Apple fanboys worried that the company was destined to decline. Without Apple’s original Willie Wonka, the digital chocolate factory was about to be run by an automaton who made his career organising global supply chains and scrutinising spreadsheets. How could someone with so little dazzle inspire Apple employees to continue creating “insanely great” products, in Jobs’s famous formulation?
It turned out Mr Cook could. As he celebrated his tenth anniversary as Apple’s boss on August 24th, no one made a peep. And for good reason. He has staged what is arguably the greatest succession success in tech, an industry littered with managers who failed in the effort to follow in the founders’ footsteps. In fact, in pure financial terms, he has been a far more successful chief executive than the late Jobs, who succumbed to pancreatic cancer six weeks after stepping down.

No chief executive in history has created as much overall shareholder value as Mr Cook (see chart 1). When he took over from Jobs the company had a market value of $349bn. Today it is worth $2.5trn (see chart 2), more than any other listed firm ever. Under his aegis annual sales surged from $108bn in 2011 to $274bn last year. Net profit more than doubled, to $57bn, overtaking Saudi Aramco’s oil-fuelled earnings and turning Apple into the world’s most profitable company. Less widely noticed, during his tenure the “Apple economy”—its own annual revenue plus everything other companies make on one of its platforms—has grown sevenfold, to more than $1trn.

Given such achievements, Mr Cook could have retired amid gushing tributes around now (and with a spot in the billionaire club). Instead, he is likely to stick around at least until 2025, when his current stock grant will fully vest. This in turn raises the question of how long he can keep Apple on its stratospheric trajectory. The short answer is that it will be much harder than in his first decade. Many of the global tailwinds that have lifted Apple to such dizzying heights are now reversing.

For a longer answer it helps to understand what Mr Cook got so right. Besides being an exceptional manager, he proved adept at harnessing the forces that have powered the tech industry—and with it global economy—in the 2010s.
The first of these was the mobile-led digitisation of life. To satisfy the world’s voracious appetite for mobile computing, he kept pushing for constant improvement of the iPhone. Whereas the iPhone 4s, announced shortly after he became chief executive, was still essentially a souped-up mobile phone, the iPhone 13, expected to be launched in September, will be a hand-sized supercomputer with a processor nearly 50 times faster. Even Apple’s Watch and AirPods, the main new products since he took over, can be seen as extensions of the mighty iPhone. More than a billion of Apple’s smartphones are now in use globally, one for every seven Earthlings.
Another force which Mr Cook has deftly harnessed is globalisation, in particular the rise of China. Even before he took over from Jobs, he was instrumental in outsourcing assembly of Apple’s devices to the country. Its biggest contract manufacturer, Foxconn, now employs about 1m people there. Most of them assemble iGadgets. On top of that, untold numbers work for suppliers of other components. And besides using China as a factory, Mr Cook was early to see its potential as a market—now Apple’s biggest after America and Europe, generating 19% of revenue and, possibly, a bigger share of profits.

Mr Cook’s third coup was understanding the importance of network effects—the economic mechanism in digital markets which makes big businesses even bigger. That is something that eluded even Jobs, who was ambivalent about the iPhone’s App Store. By contrast, Mr Cook doubled down on the digital “flywheel”: the App Store attracted more app makers, which attracted more users, which attracted even more developers and so on—until it became the world’s foremost digital marketplace by revenues. Today it hosts nearly 2m apps, which facilitated $643bn in billings and sales in 2020 for app developers, according to a study sponsored by Apple.
Mr Cook was also the first big-tech boss to signal, loudly and often, that companies of Apple’s size and reach must take some responsibility for their impact on the wider world. Under Jobs, a gadget’s looks were more important than how they were made. Today Lisa Jackson, a former head of America’s Environmental Protection Agency and now a vice-president directly reporting to Mr Cook, is involved in product development from the start. Apple has set itself the laudable goal of becoming carbon-neutral across all its products by 2030. And Mr Cook has called privacy “a fundamental human right” and, among other things, forced app makers to ask users whether they want to be tracked by advertisers.

Admittedly, being pro-privacy aligns with Apple’s business model, which unlike those of Facebook and Google does not make money by collecting data to sell targeted ads, and climate-cuddling plays well with the sensibilities of Apple’s mostly well-off users at little cost, given Apple’s relatively shallow carbon footprint. This has helped keep regulators off Apple’s back—and made it into the world’s most valuable brand, according to one estimate.
Cooking lessons
In other words, after ten years of Cookery Apple is a bigger and better version of itself, says Horace Dediu, a long-time Apple watcher. That, though, is not to say it is invulnerable. Three challenges stand out: growth, geopolitics and competition.
On the surface, growth looks healthy enough. To the surprise of those analysts who have for years predicted the iPhone’s decline, the device keeps raking in money. Global unit sales are down from a peak of 231m in 2015, but only a bit: Apple still sold 200m of them last year. But the market for smartphones will eventually mature. And even if this takes time, Apple will increasingly run up against a problem familiar to all large firms: the bigger they get, the harder it becomes to grow rapidly.
Mr Cook has been able to tap into other sources of revenue, notes Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a website that analyses all things Apple. The firm’s services business, including the App Store and Apple Music, has surged from $8bn in sales in 2011 to $65bn in the past four quarters (see chart 4). Though wearables like the Apple Watch and accessories such as the AirPods are a smaller business than the iPhone, they generate lots of revenue: nearly $9bn in three months to June. Last year AirPods ended up in more than 200m ears and Apple Watches on 34m wrists, respectively outselling all other high-end ear buds and all Swiss timepieces combined.

At some point, however, Apple will need another keystone innovation like the iPhone. Hence talk of “iGlasses”, which would add a digital layer to the physical reality perceived by the wearer, and even an “iCar”. Although the firm does not confirm this, it is an open secret that it has been working on both for years. Leaks suggest that augmented-reality glasses may finally be coming in the next year or two and Apple reportedly has plans to release a vehicle that is both electric and self-driving in 2024. But it is also widely known that things have not been going well and timelines have slipped in the past.
The car, which unlike the glasses is not a natural extension of Apple’s current consumer-tech line-up, would be difficult to pull off. Even without a petrol engine and a gearbox, a vehicle is much harder to manufacture than a smartphone. Apple’s automotive thinking appears to have gone back and forth between building its own self-driving cars from scratch or providing the necessary electronics and software to other carmakers.
Mr Cook’s second big challenge is geopolitics. Apple has so far escaped the mounting tensions between the West and China, where most of the firm’s products are assembled and many of them are sold. Mr Cook has made all sorts of concessions to the authorities in Beijing, from moving its Chinese users’ information to data centres in the country, where they can be accessed by local law enforcement, to taking down some apps in the Chinese version of its App Store. “We follow the law wherever we do business” is Mr Cook’s motto.
Now, though, the pugnacity with which the Chinese government has gone after its own technology giants must be making some in Apple’s futuristic headquarters in Cupertino, Silicon Valley, nervous. Though it has been beefing up manufacturing in other countries, particularly in India and Vietnam, Apple does not have an alternative to China for the bulk of its assembly. It is hard to see where else it might find one. Only China has a ready army of workers needed to quickly ramp up production of the latest iPhone.
Judging by Apple’s latest supplier list, the firm has even increased its reliance on Chinese companies. Of the top 200 suppliers, 51 were based in China, up from 42 in 2018. At the height of the trade war then-president Donald Trump waged with China in 2019, Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, estimated that in the worst-case scenario Chinese retaliation could reduce Apple’s profits by nearly 30%.
Apple’s jams
The fallout could be worse if Apple’s products and services were banned in China. As the Communist Party turns increasingly authoritarian and the West increasingly suspicious of China, Apple may become a target of Beijing’s wrath or the sort of nationalist-tinged boycotts that have hurt Western brands from the NBA to Zara.
And if Apple’s importance to China’s economy continues to offer a protective shield, this may anger governments and consumers in the West. According to human-rights groups, some of Apple’s suppliers are linked to forced-labour camps for Uyghurs, an oppressed Muslim minority, in Xinjiang. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, has called out Apple for hypocrisy for touting privacy protection at home while allowing the government in Beijing to access personal data in China. “At some point something will happen that becomes a loyalty test,” thinks Willy Shih of Harvard Business School.
Apple says that it has found no evidence of any forced labour in its supply chain. And Mr Zuckerberg himself could also be accused of being hypocritical, since Facebook is making billions from Chinese advertisers on its social networks. But even if those controversies end up being resolved in Apple’s favour, they are feeding into pushback against its behaviour at home: witness the recent brouhaha over its plans to scan private pictures on iPhones for child pornography.
Mr Zuckerberg’s China-related broadside also hints at Mr Cook’s third challenge: competition. Network effects are not the only thing benefiting firms like Apple. Another is the lack of real rivals. Some view Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft as a cartel whose members have tacitly agreed not to encroach on each other’s core businesses. Apple has never made an effort to be a social-media powerhouse and Facebook has not attempted to create an alternative app store. Instead of building its own search engine, Apple cut a deal with Google, making it the default search engine on the iPhone (and charging an estimated $8bn-12bn annually for the privilege, equivalent to 14-21% of Apple’s net profit in 2020).
Such cosiness is fraying. To sustain trillion-dollar valuations all the tech giants are searching for new sources of growth—and finding them on one another’s turf. Giving iPhone users more control over their data may be rooted in a genuine wish to protect their privacy, but it also keeps data out of Facebook’s hands, which could help Apple build its own advertising business. Apple is also rumoured to be working on its own search engine.
The rivalry is heating up in its principal hardware business, too. In America the iPhone remains dominant. Globally, however, iPhones account for one in seven smartphones sold, according to Canalys, a data provider. Earlier this year Xiaomi, a Chinese firm, overtook Apple as the world’s second-biggest smartphone-maker by volume.
Apple’s forays into newer markets face stiff competition. Its HomePod smart speakers came late and did not make much headway against Amazon’s and Google’s products. Apple’s mixed-reality glasses, should they indeed see the light of day, will have to duke it out against Facebook’s Oculus, Microsoft’s HoloLens and other fancy headgear. And an iCar would be taking on Teslas and a car park’s worth of offerings from established carmakers.
Regulators may also try to make digital markets more competitive. Apple is expected to win its trial against Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite”, a popular online video game, which accuses Apple of illegally protecting its App Store. A ruling should come later this year. Even if Apple prevails in American courts, however, trustbusters elsewhere may not let it off the hook as easily.
In July Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s deputy head and the EU’s trustbuster-in-chief, warned Apple that the bloc’s proposed Digital Markets Act will not allow it to hold up privacy and security as reasons to limit competition in the App Store, as Apple has argued in the Epic lawsuit. Loosening of the App Store’s rules and lower commissions (currently up to 30% on most app purchases) could make a serious dent in the company’s lucrative services business.
An executive of Mr Cook’s stature and experience may well be able to overcome these headwinds. Whether that will be Mr Cook himself is less clear. He is 60 and has said he will “probably” not stay on for another ten years. This raises the question of who might have the vision and the skills to succeed him.
One former executive has a radical proposal: Apple should stop being a pedlar of luxury goods. The firm’s “obscene” gross margins of more than 40% in the past quarter make it lazy, he argues. To maintain them, the firm squeezes developers and suppliers. Instead, it should use its power and cutting-edge technology to develop devices and services for the 3bn people on Earth who have yet to enjoy the benefits of the digital era.
Too many Cooks?
This could help solve Apple’s growth conundrum. But it is unlikely to fly with its margin-loving shareholders. The possible successor to Mr Cook mentioned most frequently, Jeff Williams, is a less radical departure from the status quo. Mr Williams is considered by many insiders to be “Tim Cook’s Tim Cook”: a doppelganger not just in looks (tall, lean and grizzled) but also in thinking and experience. He has been doing Mr Cook’s old job overseeing Apple’s supply chain and operations since 2010. Those skills have served the company remarkably well in the past decade. To keep thriving Apple’s next chief executive may need a different set of abilities. ■

Then 17, Jordan managed to escape her home out a window with a cell phone, which contained evidence of the abuse, walking down the middle of the street not knowing where she lived and shaking as she struggled to dial 911.   
'My whole body was shaking, I couldn't really dial,' Jordan, choking back tears as she described the moment she finally escaped the House of Horrors and made the 911 call, said during a 20/20 special set to air Friday.
Their parents, David and Louise Turpin, pled guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison in 2019.

The 911 dispatcher had stayed on the phone with the frightened girl until an officer arrived. Jordan is seen noticeably frantic, taking a moment to calm herself as she begins speaking with the officer. 
'Okay. I just ran away from home. And I live in a family of 15. My two little sisters right now are chained up,' she say as her voice shakes sounding much younger than 17. 
When the officer asks where the siblings are chained up she replies: 'On the bed now mother didn’t chain them up just to be mean. Okay. They’re chained up because they stole mother’s food.'
She strains to maintain her calm as she speaks to a person outside her home for the first time in her life. 'But…I’m sorry if I talk too much. Okay. I’ve never talked to anybody out there so I don’t- I’ve never been alone with a person so this is very hard for me to talk,' she tells the officer.
Questioning the frazzled teen who struggles to speak clearly, the officer asks if she's on any medication. 
'Medication? What's medication?' she asks back. The officer tries to help Jordan understand asking if she takes pills. 
'Oh. I don’t think I’ve ever tooken a pill before. Right, I haven’t,' she confirms in her broken vocabulary. 
She's then seen putting on a baseball cap, which ABC's Diane Sawyer explained in her interview was a reminder of one of her sisters. After nervously fixing the cap on her head, she dives back into the reason for her call. 
'Our parents are abusing. They abuse us. But the reason I called and the reason I managed to get out here this is one of the most scariest things I’ve ever done. I’m terrified. But I called because my two little sisters they’re chained up right now.' 
The officer asks if Jordan has any photos of the girls chained up and she excitedly confirms she took photos after one of her sisters told her to. 
'I don’t have proof of everything but I have proof that my sisters are chained up.'
Not knowing the word 'bruise' she tells the officer: 'See? Those are the places that make in on them. And see how dirty she is? We’re so filthy. We don’t take baths.'
The officer asks one more time: 'Your parents chained them up?'
'Yes, because they stole food. But they stole it because they were hungry,' Jordan confirms.  
Audio from the bodycam recorded the deputy asking Jordan: 'What are your parents going to do when they find out you left?'
'They are going to want to literally kill me,' she answers. 
Jordan's call to police lasted for 20 minutes because the girl struggled to work out her address because she had not been outside alone before.
'I had to make sure that if I left we wouldn't go back and we would get the help we needed,' she told Sawyer. 
Explaining her decision to finally escape, Jordan told Sawyer: 'I think it was us coming close to death so many times.'




'It was literally a now or never. If something happened to me, at least I died trying.'
'The only word I know to call it is 'hell,""' Jordan's sister Jennifer, 33, added in the trailer for the 20/20 special, set to air Friday.
'My parents took my whole life from me, but now I am taking my life back,' she said.
Jennifer doesn't doesn't want her siblings to be remembered as victims, but instead as fighters.
'I want the Turpin name [to be] ""Wow, they're strong. They're not broken. They've got this,'"" she said.
Jordan, describing life post-rescue, said: 'It's so free. Like wow, this is life.'
Jordan said she and her siblings came 'close to death so many times.'
'Mother, she choked me and I literally thought I was going to die,' she shared.
In her harrowing 911 call, Jordan sounded clear but agitated as she walked away from the home she was confined to most of the time and revealed everything to the dispatcher. 
'Um hello? I just ran away from home because I live in a family of 15. OK? Can you hear me? And we have abusing parents. Did you hear that?' Jordan Turpin tells a dispatcher.
When the dispatcher asked how her parents abused her and her siblings, she replied: 'OK, They hit us. They like to throw us across the room. They pull out hair. They yank out our hair. I have two ... My two little sisters right now are chained up.' 
Bodycam footage later shows officers enter the house, confront the parents and discover the children, at least two of whom were shackled to their beds. 
'Sarge, we've got another room in the front right here with two kiddos in the bed,' an officer says in the video.   
The siblings, ranging in age from 2 to 29 years old, were freed from the home in January 2018 after being regularly beaten, starved and strangled by their parents. 
The house was covered in filth and the stench of human waste was said to be overwhelming. Jennifer confirmed that the kids would often be chained up for months.
The parents' abuse and neglect was so 'severe, pervasive, [and] prolonged' that it stunted their children's growth, led to muscle wasting and left two of their daughters unable to bear children. 
Since the 13 Turpin children were rescued from their parents horror house in January 2018, they have been actively working to take back their lives. 
'They're all happy,' Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People in April 2020. 'They are moving on with their lives.'
His interview revealed the siblings still live in Southern California and remain close to each other, regularly getting together.  
'They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they'll meet somewhere kind of discreet,' he shared.
Beecham shared that the six youngest children had been adopted and, since they had experienced fewer years of abuse due to their ages, were able to quickly adjust to their new lives.
One of the older siblings has earned a college degree.  
Others are in school, living on their own and working jobs.
'Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,' Beecham explained. 
A few of the siblings, at the time of the interview, were still living in group homes as they received therapy and counseling.
Two of the Turpin sisters spoke out to Diane Sawyer, in an interview airing on November 19, revealing that they were moving forward with their lives. 
'My parents took my whole life from me, but now I am taking my life back,' one sister told Sawyer. 
The other described her new life as being 'free.'



Following David and Louise's arrests in January 2018, horrific details began to emerge of the extent of torture, abuse and neglect that the children.
Deputies testified that the children said they were only allowed to shower once a year.
They were mainly kept in their rooms except for meals, which had been reduced from three to one per day, a combination of lunch and dinner. 
For years, the siblings' diet consisted of nothing but two slices of bread with peanut butter or bologna. The couple were also accused of taunting their children with pies and other food that they were forbidden to eat.  
The Turpin parents chowed down on fast food in front of them, chaining the children to filthy beds if they tried to steal food. 
'They still can't look at peanut butter or bologna,' Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham told People magazine last year.
'I made the mistake of mentioning peanut butter during one of our meet-and-greets, and one of the girls almost threw up. And when they're at the grocery store, they can't look at peanut butter. They can't even go down the aisle where there's peanut butter.'
The Turpin offspring weren't allowed to play like normal children and were deprived of things other kids had, including toys and games. 



Sawyer also spoke with Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin, who was involved with the case. He says it is one he will never forget.
'It stopped me dead in my tracks,' he said. 'There are cases that stick with you, that haunt you.' 
David and Louise pleaded guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse in 2019 and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
They are both eligible for parole in 22 years.
The 13 siblings remained out of the public eye as their parents' case unfolded in court and they learned to adapt to normal life outside the confines of the house of horrors. 
Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People magazine that all of the siblings 'are happy.'
'They are moving on with their lives,' he added.
At that time, one sibling had graduated college, while several others had jobs or were going to school. 
'Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,' he shared. 
He also noted that the siblings see each other regularly.  
'They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they'll meet somewhere kind of discreet,' he said. 
Several of the siblings have changed their names to rid themselves of the stigma of being a victim in the high-profile case. 
'It would be difficult for them to carry that name, that label of being a victim, forever,' Beecham said. 
But Jennifer told Sawyer she wants to change what people think when they hear the Turpin name. 'I want the Turpin name, like wow, they're strong, they're not broken, they've got this,' she explained.

1809,"IF DELEGATES TO the Glasgow COP fancy a day out, they could do worse than take a 50-minute train journey to Wemyss Bay and a 35-minute ferry journey across the Firth of Clyde to Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. Rothesay’s charms as a resort have faded, but its distance from the madding crowd and wonderful sea views remain. So do the lessons it holds about how fossil fuels became integral to industrial growth.
The first cotton mill in Rothesay opened in 1779, using the water that flowed out of Loch Fad to power a new type of spinning machine which was transforming the textile industry: Richard Arkwright’s water frame. But the stream proved fickle and underpowered. By 1800 the mill was running on steam engines based on James Watt’s design. But shipping coal to the island was pricey, and Rothesay’s industrial future looked increasingly bleak.

Robert Thom, an engineer, turned things round. In the 1810s he increased the water supply with a dam and drainage cuts to feed it, and installed an ingenious, self-acting sluice to govern the flow of water, ensuring its perfect evenness. The power for the mills doubled, and the steam engines were retired.
The school-book version of Britain’s Industrial Revolution is that the steam engine drove it by providing more power than previously possible. By the end of the 19th century that was true. But to explain the rapid take-up of coal in the late-18th and early-19th century only in terms of steam power is to put cart before horsepower. As Andreas Malm of Lund University in Sweden points out in “Fossil Capital” (2015), steam triumphed when there was still lots of untapped hydropower. Even in the 1830s industry was not taking out more than 10% of the water energy that was available in the English Midlands. Although watermills were an old technology, they were open to improvement by modern entrepreneurs like Thom. And unlike steam engines, they rarely exploded.
What set steam apart were several advantages which appealed to investors. The most important was the ability to build new steam-powered mills close to old ones in towns which already had textile industries, so long as a supply of coal was nearby. The cheeks of cloth-producing factories could run up against the jowls of garment producers. The owner of a new mill could get workers from old ones without having to move them to some faraway river.
The large industrial cities which this produced also encouraged the flow of ideas and skills that made it quicker and easier to improve steam. Watt’s development of the condenser did not just improve one particular mill and steam engine, in the manner of Thom’s changes at Rothesay. It made all subsequent steam engines better, and built improvement into the very idea of such things. What is more, however good water wheels might have become, they were never going to drive locomotives or ships, as steam had begun to do.
Putting that engineering culture into big cities spun it even faster. Alfred Marshall, an English economist, waxed poetic about this in the 1890s, noting that “The mysteries of the trade become no mysteries; but are as it were in the air.” As the 19th century wore on, growth was increasingly driven by the more systematic pursuit and application of technical knowledge, for which the steam engine provided the paradigm model. And it had ever greater amounts of energy at its disposal.
Coal-powered machinery may not have initiated the Industrial Revolution, let alone created the new attitudes to capital, growth and investment which underlay it. But it universalised what began as something peculiarly British and parochial. It allowed industry to be moved—indeed, when boilers and pistons were attached properly to appropriate wheels or propellers, to move itself—around the world. And as sustaining further growth required ever more energy, it was later joined by other fossil fuels, notably oil and gas.
Some, including Mr Malm, take the centuries of structural intimacy between fossil fuels and the capitalist system that was inaugurated by England’s mill-owners and mines to mean that one cannot get rid of the first without also demolishing the second. It is a matter of “Capitalism vs. the Climate”, as Naomi Klein, a writer and activist, puts it in the subtitle to her bestselling book “This Changes Everything” (2014). In this view the fossil-fuel industry’s insistence on putting its own profits ahead of the global risks posed by its effluent is not just a brake on sensible climate policy but a sign of a systemic inability to reach climate goals in a capitalist economy.
It is essential that the world proves this thesis to be wrong. Doing so means embracing the aspect of capitalism which most worries environmentalists: growth. To develop while reducing dependence on fossil fuels—the only sort of growth with a real future—the poor world needs new technology and new investment. The growth supplied by capitalism is what provides both these things, which is why most economists see it as crucial to bringing the fossil-fuel age to an end. All that is needed is to find ways to ensure that growth does not have to be linked to rising CO2.
The issue is nicely summed up in a formula credited to Yoichi Kaya, a Japanese energy economist, which links the size of the economy, the scale of emissions and the amount of carbon in the energy system:

Emissions are the product of population, GDP per head, energy used per unit of GDP and carbon emissions from that energy. To reduce emissions one must reduce one or more of those four factors. Private and government action on the climate has concentrated on the last two: carbon emissions per unit of energy (decarbonisation) and energy use per unit of GDP (efficiency). But given insufficient progress, some say it is time to look at the first two.
The history of the 20th century shows that reducing population, though still spoken of as a long-term goal by some greens and predicted by demographers for much of the world later this century, is not a course of action that governments can effectively and decently pursue (though dealing with unmet contraceptive needs certainly is). That leaves GDP per head. When this grows, as it has by a factor of ten worldwide since the carbon needle began to tick up in the 19th century, energy efficiency and carbon intensity must improve merely to keep carbon emissions stable. If growth stops, the benefits from increased energy efficiency and reduced carbon intensity can go straight into reducing emissions.
The degrowth debate
Since the Paris agreement of 2015, discussion of degrowth has become an increasingly hot topic among some ecologists, heterodox economists and other scholars. Some see it as a strategy solely for the rich world, which they feel does not need any more affluence, while accepting the need for continued growth in poorer places. Others are dubious about the whole idea of sustained growth. Either version, though, has huge moral, political, and economic drawbacks.

The moral problem is that, fine though it may be for individuals to renounce increased consumption, it is not for them to impose their choice on others. There are specific things that societies can require people not to produce or consume, and there may be reasons for rationing some things during emergencies and in special circumstances. But production and consumption in general should remain matters of individual choice.
If those devoted to degrowth could persuade everyone else, their goal might conceivably come about as a voluntary, consensual moral revolution. Otherwise they would need to gain political power and impose their aims. And that raises the problem of political practicality. Governments can and do suppress growth in various ways. Often they do it through wrongheadedness, haplessness or as the result of capture by pernicious interests. Sometimes they do it as explicit policy—as in the austerity imposed on some countries in the early 2010s. But an overt policy of deliberately slowing, stalling or reversing long-term growth, even if presented as being for the good of the world, is a highly unpromising platform on which to win elections.
Even if it were not both wrong and impractical, enforced degrowth would still be a bad idea. Much of the increase in prosperity in poorer countries over the past 20 years has been driven by rising demand from rich countries. Remove that motor and the rate at which the world’s poor are raised out of poverty would slow. It would also hobble the fight against climate change. Rapid decarbonisation requires massive investment in renewables everywhere, but most of all in emerging economies. Much of the money must come from investors in rich countries seeking returns, even if rich-world governments commit resources too. Without huge amounts of investment, decarbonisation will take longer.
And without accelerated innovation it will be incomplete. The current system is not the only way to get from bright ideas to products used on a broad, even world-changing, scale. But it has the best record. A lot of innovations are still needed if the world is to speed up its decarbonisation—better ways of storing energy, of heating houses, of cooling houses, of processing crops, of growing crops, of powering large vehicles, of producing plastics and more. A contracting, low-demand, low-investment economy is not likely to provide any of these.
This case against degrowth does not necessarily mean business as usual, however. To serve the goal of decarbonisation, innovation must be directed towards specific goals with particular properties—it cannot simply roam freely in search of ideas that look profitable. Some of this purpose can come from founders and investors. Tesla is a good example: a company built up by Elon Musk to make both money and electric cars, and, by showing that it could do so, to establish the need for other carmakers to follow suit. But without the certainty of a price on carbon to constrain their sense of the possible, it is asking too much of private innovators to expect them to provide all the tools needed.

Making good the lack requires governments not just to help the private sector through tax credits targeted at innovations which decarbonise—one of the parts of President Joe Biden’s climate package that seems most likely to pass—but also to find ways to bridge the gap between research and development and full scale deployment with a more serious commitment to large-scale demonstration projects.
The ways in which the emission-free technologies to hand and yet to be developed reshape the energy economy will be less marked than those seen with the advent of coal. In an increasingly electrified world, sources of energy are less distinctive and more fungible. The plug does not care where the socket gets its power. An example is the way today’s grid-linked gigawatt world of skyscraper-topping turbines and solar farms spreading over cropland and desert alike has little place for the putatively innate characteristics which first attracted greens to solar panels and wind turbines in the 1970s and 1980s. They saw them as “appropriate” technologies suited to decentralisation, self-sufficiency and the living of less industrialised lives.
But if renewables no longer have the smallness once seen as beautiful, they have special characteristics that come to the fore the more that grids depend on them. The most obvious is intermittency. The flows powering renewables are familiar to the farmer more than to the industrialist. They change with the passing of clouds, the turning of Earth, the rolling of weather fronts, the succession of seasons and the differences between good years and bad.
Dealing with this variation will require new ways of balancing flows of energy and storing it for later use. As Robert Thom discovered, you need to have both storage and a careful approach to regulating flows through the system. But those principles must be applied on scales both local and continental, and measured in both split seconds and years. Grids need to become larger, to make up for shortfalls in wind or sun, and smarter, to balance demand to supply rather than always working the other way round. To what extent markets can be designed to provide all this remains an open question. But it seems a fair bet that a more centrally planned approach will often be necessary.
In return renewables promise to provide grids and their customers with a new resistance to scarcity. The overweening power of coal-miners and oil ministers alike will be broken. With energy freed from physical fuels things will be far harder for would-be rentiers. As in Rothesay, once you have invested, you have guaranteed power with minimal operating expenses and minimal risk.
And they should allow a new form of energy-abundant environmentalism. Environmentalist worries about growth are not limited to relationships between carbon emissions and GDP. There are deeper worries that the demand will break nature’s bounds in other ways. But in a world of copious clean energy the demands industrial civilisation makes of the natural world may in principle be curbed through reuse and recycling. What some call the circularisation of the economy could be spun round more quickly and smoothly. Clean energy need not undermine the capitalism that commoditised fossil fuels built. It could still change its complexion, its political economy and its geopolitical setting.
But it is unlikely to do this in the time demanded by Paris. So the world needs more than an energy system without emissions. It also needs innovation and investment to reverse them.■

1810," (CNN)A new lawsuit has been filed on behalf of more than 280 Astroworld Festival concertgoers, the Thomas J. Henry Law firm announced in a news release Thursday. Ten people died as a result of the chaotic crowd surge at the Houston concert when headliner Travis Scott began performing on November 5.The suit, filed Wednesday, names defendants including Apple Music, Scott, the rapper Drake and Live Nation, alleging they were negligent and stood to make ""an exorbitant amount of money"" from the event but chose to ""cut corners, cut costs and put the festival attendees at risk.""""Many in the crowd were knocked to the ground and trampled, some were trapped and crushed against other concert attendees, while others were compressed against metal barricades,"" the lawsuit says. ""The resulting catastrophic incident and carnage were easily foreseeable and preventable had the Defendants acted in a reasonably prudent manner in planning a large-scale festival like Astroworld Fest.""CNN reached out to the defendants but did not immediately hear back. Scott said in a statement following the event he was ""devastated"" about what happened. He also pledged to cover all funeral costs for the victims. Live Nation previously said in a statement it was ""heartbroken for those lost and impacted"" and ""will continue working to provide as much information and assistance as possible to the local authorities as they investigate the situation."" Drake said in a statement posted on Instagram last week his ""heart is broken for the families and friends of those who lost their lives and for anyone who is suffering. I will continue to pray for all of them, and will be of service in any way I can.""The lawsuit seeks $2 billion in damages resulting from ""extreme pain and suffering, loss of earnings, emotional distress and medical expenses.""""My clients want to ensure the defendants are held responsible for their actions, and they want to send the message to all performers, event organizers, and promoters that what happened at Astroworld cannot happen again,"" attorney Thomas J. Henry said in a statement. At least 140 lawsuits have been filed in connection to the festival tragedy, according to Harris County District Court records.A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 125 plaintiffs earlier this week is seeking more than $750 million in damages to ""fix, help or make up for the harms and losses suffered"" by them. Among the plaintiffs is the family of Axel Acosta Avila, a 21-year-old college junior from Tieton, Washington, who died at the event.Witnesses described event as traumatizingHouston Fire Department Logs obtained by CNN last week show spectators at the event had already breached the main gate of the festival shortly after the 9 a.m. start time and that at least eight more breaches were reported throughout the day. Shortly before 5 p.m., Houston police reported ""dangerous crowd conditions"" at one stage.Minutes before Scott took the stage at 9 p.m., more than 260 people had already been treated, according to the logs. At 9:33 p.m., the police reported ""multiple people trampled, passed out at front stage."" A ""Level One MCI"" -- mass casualty incident -- was reported at 9:52 p.m., according to the logs.Between 10 p.m. to roughly 11:40 p.m., 17 people had been transported to hospitals, including at least six in cardiac arrests. Alex Pollak, the CEO of the medic company hired by the festival's organizers, said this week his staff had to treat 11 people with cardiac arrests at the same time. ""This is something I'll have nightmares about for the rest of my life,"" Pollak said. ""The team is extremely broken up about it. Seeing so many young people getting CPR at one time, it's just something no one should have to go through.""Witnesses described traumatizing conditions, some saying they saw lifeless bodies being trampled amid the chaos while others had to fight their way out of the crowd as the music continued.""It felt like it was the end for me,"" said attendee Selena Beltran, describing losing her balance as a crowd around her began jumping. ""To think that's how I'll die, I was so scared."" ""I did not know what to do. It was all happening so fast, but so slow and I couldn't react. I just screamed,"" Beltran added.It is unclear what Scott saw from the stage and whether he was aware of the crowd conditions, but he continued to perform until about 10:10 p.m. Scott's attorney said the artist did not know of the mass casualty declaration until the following morning.",0
1811,"Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, was shot dead at his private residence. The police said that they killed four suspects during a gun battle and had arrested two others. It was unclear who ordered the assassination, or why. Claude Joseph, the interim prime minister, who was due to be replaced this week, said he would take charge as interim president. The opposition had been seeking Mr Moïse’s removal from office, saying his term had expired. In February the government claimed it had uncovered an attempted coup against him.

1812,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)Journalist Roger Parloff, who wrote the first major cover story on Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes and later issued a retraction, was called to testify in her criminal trial Thursday.The government has alleged Holmes used the media, and Parloff's Fortune Magazine story titled ""This CEO is Out for Blood"" in particular, to perpetuate a scheme to defraud investors.Parloff's testimony comes as the government has said it is close to resting its case against Holmes. She faces a dozen counts of federal fraud and conspiracy charges, and up to 20 years in prison over allegations that she knowingly misled doctors, patients and investors in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty.Parloff is set to return to the stand Friday for continued cross-examination. Thus far the defense has focused on Parloff's note taking and reporting process.Holmes was for a time upheld in the media as a rare female founder who'd raised significant sums of capital and driven her startup to an eye-popping $9 billion valuation. Parloff's story was the first of many laudatory cover stories of Holmes and has been shown repeatedly in the San Jose courtroom. Through Parloff's testimony, the government pieced together various layers of the alleged fraud that it has spent more than 10 weeks establishing before jurors through witness testimonies. Parloff testified he has interview notes, as well as 10 hours of audio recordings from interviews associated with his 2014 Fortune story, clips of which have been played for the jury. The recordings contrast how Holmes represented the company's capabilities with what jurors have heard from other witness testimonies. In one recording, Holmes explains that the company can do tests for 1,000 ""CPT"" or medical codes, despite its website stating 200 tests. Jurors have previously heard Theranos could only perform around a dozen tests using its proprietary technology, one of the numerous points prosecutor John Bostic sought to highlight through questioning Parloff about what Holmes told him in his interviews.Parloff said Holmes did not tell him about Theranos' reliance on third-party devices. When Parloff asked Holmes about use of venous draws instead of its finger stick method, Holmes is heard ticking off a list of reasons why it may conduct such a sample, but does not disclose, as Bostic elicited, it is because of the limitations of Theranos' devices.Parloff testified that Holmes told him that its tech had been used in Afghanistan, but that ""she did not want me to publish that."" While Parloff interviewed James Mattis, the former US Secretary of Defense and onetime Theranos board member, he testified Holmes told him the retired four-star general couldn't discuss deployment and not to ask him about it.During his reporting, Holmes sent Parloff the reports, affixed with Pfizer and Schering-Plough logos, purporting to validate its blood tests, which jurors have learned were not legitimate. Parloff testified that after the article's publication, Holmes ""praised it effusively,"" and said he believed she linked to it on Theranos' website. The article, which contained false and misleading statements, circulated to stakeholders and how it played a role in validating the company to outsiders.""This morning I had one of the most interesting meetings I can recall with the women [sic] profiled in the attached Fortune magazine article,"" read one email shown to jurors from the CEO of RDV Corp, the family office of the billionaire family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The email was sent to members of the DeVos family before they invested $100 million into Theranos.Investor Chris Lucas, whose firm Black Diamond Ventures invested more than $7 million across two funding rounds in 2006 and 2013, testified earlier this month that the piece made him ""proud of the situation. Proud that we are involved. Proud of Elizabeth."" ""Great article, great pictures, the whole thing,"" testified Lucas.In a column more than a year later titled ""How Theranos Misled Me,"" Parloff acknowledged that the article ""helped raise to prominence"" Holmes. (There is now an author's note at the top of his original article that links to the column and reads, ""On December 17, 2015, I published a protracted correction to this article here."")""As much as I'd like to say that Holmes lied to me, I don't think she did. I do believe I was misled — intentionally — but I was also culpable, in that I failed to probe certain exasperatingly opaque answers that I repeatedly received,"" wrote Parloff, who was formerly an attorney.The government said in a court filing that it will not seek to admit the follow-up column but ""reserves the right to introduce that article for a non-hearsay purpose should the defense open the door by questioning Parloff about statements he made in that article.""For weeks, attorneys have been wrangling over what Parloff can testify to, and what information he can be compelled to provide. While Parloff has turned over audio recordings and notes from his interviews with Holmes and former Theranos COO Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani as part of a grand jury subpoena order, he successfully fought a trial subpoena order by Holmes' defense team for notes and recordings from interviews he conducted with others for his story. (Balwani faces the same charges as Holmes; his criminal trial is slated to begin next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.)Holmes' attorneys argued those notes may serve to refute the claims that Holmes misled Parloff, and through him, investors. Judge Nathanael Cousins, who presided in a hearing on the matter, called the quest for Parloff's additional notes ""a fishing expedition as to whether there might be material out there that could be helpful to the defense.""Parloff's remorse over the story has been well-documented. ""Roger was first [to the story] and felt a tremendous amount of guilt,"" said Alex Gibney in 2019. Gibney is the prolific documentary filmmaker whose HBO film, ""The Inventor,"" chronicled the rise and fall of Theranos. Gibney, who has said his work started with interviewing journalists who felt duped, has called Parloff the ""beating heart"" of his film. (CNN and HBO share a parent company.)In addition to Parloff's article, a 2013 piece by a Wall Street Journal opinion writer, who has since passed away, has been frequently brought up in the courtroom. The government has alleged that, prior to its publication, Holmes approved the piece, which offered a glowing look at Holmes and Theranos, but also contained misleading claims about the company's capabilities at the time. The article corresponded with a broader unveiling of the startup after years of operating in stealth and was leveraged by Holmes as validation of the company.In a statement to CNN Business in September, Journal spokesperson Steve Severinghaus said, ""editors make publishing decisions based on their independent judgment.""The statement continued, ""Our writer asked Elizabeth Holmes to confirm complicated facts on a technical subject, not to approve publication. Our writer visited Theranos, spoke with numerous sources in and outside the company about its technology, and had his blood tested on a Theranos machine that appeared to offer credible results. If that was all a deception, then the responsibility lies with Ms. Holmes and Theranos.""",0
1813,"Son Masayoshi, the boss of SoftBank, said he was curbing his conglomerate’s enthusiasm to invest in Chinese startups until the extent of the Chinese government’s crackdown on the tech industry becomes clearer in the coming years. The Japanese company is a big investor in Alibaba and Didi Global, two targets of the ire of regulators in Beijing.
Uncertainty about the future of internet firms in China was one factor behind the poorly received IPO of Krafton, a South Korean video-games developer that produces the “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds” series. Krafton is backed by Tencent, which distributes its games in China. However, Krafton also had to reduce the listing price for its shares when the Korean regulator questioned how it was calculated.

The American government’s ban on Chinese tech firms with suspected military ties obtaining American technology hit Huawei hard in the first half of the year. Revenue fell by almost 30% compared with the first six months of 2020, and by almost 50% in its consumer-electronics business, which relies on American chips for smartphones.
Bukalapak raised $1.5bn when it listed its shares on the Jakarta stockmarket, making it Indonesia’s biggest-ever IPO. The e-commerce group has the backing of big foreign investors, including Microsoft and Jack Ma’s Ant Group, and is the first unicorn startup to go public in the country.
America’s Securities and Exchange Commission approved a controversial requirement by the Nasdaq for companies that list on its markets to disclose statistics on the diversity of their boards and to have at least two “diverse directors”, or explain why they do not. One director must be a woman and the other from a racial or sexual minority; all must “identify” with their diverse group. Firms have a few years to comply.
American employers created 943,000 jobs in July, the most since last August. Employment is yet to reach its pre-pandemic level, however, and is not expected to do so for at least another six months. America’s annual rate of inflation, meanwhile, remained at 5.4% in July.
Britain’s GDP expanded by 4.8% in the second quarter over the previous three months, boosted by the end of pandemic restrictions on restaurants and pubs (just in time for the Euros football tournament). The economy is now 4.4% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, before covid-19 struck; it is on course to return to its pre-pandemic level by the end of this year.
All that carbon
Saudi Aramco reported a net profit of $25.5bn for the second quarter. That was an increase of almost 300% on the same three months last year and more than the combined quarterly profits of BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total. Like its rivals, the Saudi company has gained from a buoyant oil market as economies reopen. Troubled by the hot topic of high petrol prices, the White House has publicly called on OPEC to boost output in order to curb oil prices.
The bidding war intensified for Kansas City Southern, a railway company that transports freight in America and Mexico. Canadian Pacific raised its offer to $31bn in an attempt to derail a proposal from Canadian National that the board at KCS has accepted.

Deliveroo reported earnings for the first half. The food-delivery company, which floated on the London stockmarket in March in a dismal IPO, took almost 149m orders in the January-to-June period, twice as many as during the same six months last year. It has expanded even more into grocery deliveries and restaurant fare. The lifting of lockdown measures in Britain, its prime market, has not had a material impact on its business; ordering meals from home has now become routine for customers who acquired the taste during the pandemic.
Jab or job?
The chief executives of American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said they would not impose a requirement on existing staff to have the covid-19 vaccine, but they will encourage them to do so. This came after United Airlines instructed all its workers based in America to get vaccinated by October 25th at the latest.
Virgin Atlantic is reportedly planning to list shares on the London stockmarket for the first time since its founding in 1984. The airline is owned by Virgin Group and Delta. During the pandemic it has cut costs by slashing jobs. It is expecting a surge in transatlantic travel as restrictions ease.
A least $611m-worth of cryptocurrencies vanished from Poly Network, a decentralised finance platform, in one of the largest cyber-heists targeting the digital-asset industry. Within hours, however, crypto sleuths tracked down the unnamed hacker, who started returning the funds after declaring “he was not so interested in money.”",2
1814,"A junior who played on a winning basketball team stayed behind with arena staff for three hours to help clean up the stands and pick up the trash left behind by fans.
Dexter Dennis who is known for his for his fast moves on the court was praised for what he did off the court long after the game, held  in Wichita, Kansas, was over.
Dennis who was on the Wichita State University men's basketball team that beat Tarleton State 65-51 decided to help tidy up the stadium after the game instead of heading off to celebrate the victory with teammates.
Dennis, who hails from Louisiana, helped propel the team, known as the Shockers to victory and into a tournament in Las Vegas. 
Dennis scored 13 points, 10 of those in the second half, for Wichita State (3-0). He was 3-of-4 from 3-point range. 
Wichita State shot 42.9 percent from the field, and Tarleton State finished at 38.3 percent. 
But it was Dennis' humble act long after the spectators had gone home that got people talking. 
The simple act of him staying behind to pick up trash was captured by a reporter who was in the stands opposite after everyone else had left the court. 
The cleanup can normally takes up to three hours.  
'Dexter is a different kind of dude,' sports reporter for The Wichita Eagle, Taylor Eldridge, tweeted together with the video he shot that has since gone viral. 
'Wasn't in trouble or anything. Didn't have to. He just wanted to help out the cleaning crew,' Eldridge added. 
Dennis tweeted about the incident stating: 'Didn't do it for attention. Just gives me perspective on life. It could always be worse.' 
His efforts were recognized by Wichita State University Facilities Director David Gomez.
'We have several folks who have been here for decades and I know for some of them, that's probably the first time they've seen something like that happen,' said Gomez to CBS News. 
'And I just, from our custodial staff, out to him, we just want to say thank you for leading and showing us that there are still folks out there who recognize the hard work that's done around here.' ",-2
1815,"MANY QUESTIONS are on the minds of business leaders in the run up to the UN’s COP26 climate summit from October 31st to November 12th. For CEOs making the trip to Glasgow, they range from the mundane (travel by train? eat only plant-based food?) to the profound (why am I going in the first place?). The most important question, though, is barely asked: what would happen if governments agreed, sooner or later, to commitments serious enough to limit global warming to 1.5-2.0°C above pre-industrial levels, as stipulated in the Paris climate agreement of 2015? This question has an answer most multinationals shy away from. It would send shock waves through their entire business models.
Businesses, as a rule, do not like being forced to do anything. They prefer to make voluntary gestures—just enough to keep governments off their backs. Right now they are throwing around promises to cut carbon emissions to “net zero” like confetti, on the grounds that such vows attract investors, employees and customers. It is a step in the right direction. And yet some of those pledges are paper-thin. Of more than 4,200 firms in the G20 club of big economies that have disclosed their climate ambitions, only a fifth have committed to so-called science-based targets that would keep the world on track to meet the Paris agreement’s goal. That requires firms to start slashing emissions within years, not decades. For big emitters this poses an instant threat to profitability. It strains credulity to think that altruism is enough to convince firms to act. Governments will have to apply the thumbscrews.

Even business folk realise that the best way to apply pressure is by imposing a global system of carbon taxes, with some form of redistribution to ease the pain on the poorest thumbs. The trouble is that only about one-fifth of global emissions is covered by a price on carbon. As a result the global average price is just $3 per tonne of carbon dioxide. To meet the ambitions of the Paris agreement, the IMF says the global carbon price needs to rise to $75. Others believe it should be almost double that. For some heavy emitters covered by the European Union’s emissions-trading system, it is already above €60 ($69). In China’s new (limited) scheme, by contrast, it is a pittance. America has no federal scheme of any kind.
A higher global price would affect all businesses—albeit unevenly. For now, it is treated as too much of a long shot to take seriously. But assume for the moment it actually happened.
The first important thing would be to separate out the heavy emitters from the rest. Early adopters of bold emissions targets come from industries such as retail, where abating is relatively easy. In countries like Britain, where the grid is decarbonising fast anyway, that may require no independent effort on the part of energy users. A small number of sectors responsible for the bulk of listed companies’ emissions—power utilities, oil and gas firms, steel- and cement-makers—have a much harder challenge. As demand for carbon-intensive stuff collapses, they would have to find new ways to generate cashflows. Some are dabbling in renewables. Some see a future in low-carbon plastics and materials. But if they cannot turn these swiftly into huge sources of income, they would be better shutting down operations and returning cash to shareholders. Western firms may hope they can sell off their dirtiest assets to state-owned companies in the developing world. Yet these, too, would be subject to a truly global carbon tax. For some, the sooner they start lightening their carbon load, the better.

For a broader set of businesses, supply chains would be the main issue. Standard Chartered, a bank, says almost three-quarters of multinationals’ emissions come from their suppliers. Tackling those is an immense task. Take coal-addled China, where many of them are based. Guido Giacconi of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China says that though the country is investing heavily in renewables, it is “difficult if not impossible” to guarantee that a firm’s energy use is free from coal, because of the opacity of the electricity grid. That makes it hard for firms like Apple to certify that their supply chains in China (where iPhones are made) are carbon-neutral. If its Chinese suppliers were consequently subject to a carbon tax, it might have to raise prices of iGadgets.
Moving supply chains out of China would bring costs, too. In some Asian alternatives, such as Vietnam or Indonesia, fossil fuels are more prevalent than in China. In emerging markets with a lot of clean energy, such as Brazil, the costs of bad infrastructure and red tape are unappealing. Reshoring is unpalatable for many Western firms; the costs of rich-world labour are just too high.
This feeds into a third problem: consumption. A high carbon tax is bound to push up prices, which will change consumer behaviour, especially among lower earners. The tourism industry, for instance, would have to rely less on customers arriving by cheap flights. Supermarkets would need to provide more local foods. People might start tracking the carbon trail of some things they buy, creating headaches for retailers like Amazon.
The flip side would be more innovation. The International Energy Agency, which represents energy-consuming countries, said last year that investments in low-carbon research and development had barely budged since 2012, and was a fifth of what was spent on health and defence. This is pitiful. A carbon tax would change that. Think of hyperloops for long-distant transport; eating bugs, seaweed and lab-grown meat; an endless stream of virtual-reality entertainment as people stay at home rather than consume goods that become less affordable owing to the carbon bill.
Extinction rebellion
Inevitably, some firms which fail to see the writing on the wall will die. But others will swiftly realise that the future is “adapt or perish”. This is not a mantra CEOs will chant at COP26. It should be. When it comes to action on the climate, they are all-too-keen to show off their halos. The thumbscrew is a less appealing accoutrement—but a far more necessary one. ■

1816,"AS ALEXEI NAVALNY, Russia’s leading opposition politician, was being hauled off to jail in January, four editors of “Doxa”, an online student magazine, posted a YouTube video. The two men and two women were students at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, generally considered to be Russia’s best liberal university. They spoke out about the intimidation being deployed by the staff of schools and universities in order to dissuade young people from joining a planned protest against Mr Navalny’s mistreatment.
The four appealed to universities across the country. “Expelling students for taking part in peaceful action is illegal. All you will achieve is to destroy science and education in Russia,” said Armen Aramyan, one of the four. But they also appealed to fellow students. “Don’t be scared and don’t abstain. It is our lawful right to express protest by any peaceful means. The state has declared war on youth, but the youth is us and we will certainly prevail,” said another of the quartet.

On April 14th, as part of that war, Russian prosecutors arrested Mr Aramyan and the three other “Doxa” editors and charged them with “encouraging minors to take part in illegal action”, by which they meant the protest in January. Their video has been taken down and they have been under house arrest ever since. The case has brought them recognition beyond anything they could have imagined when they recorded their video.
The unsuccessful attempt to kill Mr Navalny with poison on a plane a year ago marked the start of a new wave of repression in Russia. Other opposition politicians have been barred from public appearances, chased out of the country or even arrested. The few remaining independent media outlets have been barred as “undesirable” or stigmatised as “foreign agents”. The latest such “foreign agent” is TV Rain, an independent online channel that extensively covered the protests; the designation means that advertising will dry up, and the station may end up having to close.
But going after politicians and the media, and arresting students and activists, is no longer sufficient. The Kremlin is now trying to get a grip over schools and universities in a more systematic way. In the past nine months some 20 universities and institutes across Russia have had their deans replaced. In July the Kremlin “accepted” the resignation of Yaroslav Kuzminov, the head of the Higher School of Economics, better known as HSE, Russia’s first and most successful post-Soviet university.
In a parting note on social media Mr Kuzminov claimed he was stepping down to concentrate on his work as an economist. Few took this at face value. “He would never have left of his own volition. This was the Kremlin’s decision,” wrote Kirill Rogov, a political analyst.
Mr Kuzminov had long navigated his way around the Kremlin to carve out some space for his university while also providing advice to the government. That space has now shrunk and the advice is no longer needed. His departure marks the end of an era. He helped set up the HSE in the early 1990s, as Russians newly liberated from Soviet controls sought ways to connect with the West. At around the same time St Petersburg University, Russia’s oldest, teamed up with Bard College from America to set up Smolny College, Russia’s first liberal arts and science college. It was backed by Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister who is a rare liberal voice in Mr Putin’s entourage.
These institutions survived Russia’s turn towards authoritarianism in the 2000s. The Kremlin did not fear them, not least because young Russians in the 2000s and early 2010s were among Mr Putin’s most loyal supporters. It was also partly due to a centuries-long tradition in which autocratic rulers allowed a degree of freedom to a few exclusive institutions, says Andrei Zorin, a professor of Russian at Oxford University. The aim was to nurture a sophisticated cadre familiar with Western ideas and technology, who might then modernise and strengthen the state.
But now any Western influence is seen as a threat. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the Security Council of Russia and a key ideologue of Russia’s new isolationism, said in a recent interview that “the destructive liberal political forces [of the West] are paying particular attention to the educated and successful young people in prestigious universities.”
Less than a fortnight before Mr Kuzminov’s departure, prosecutors banned Bard College from Russia, designating it an “undesirable foreign organisation”. And a recently passed law put all educational activity in Russia, from popular science lectures to public discussion clubs, under tight state control.
Russian students and young people, once lauded by the Kremlin as part of Mr Putin’s base, are now seen as one of the biggest dangers to its power. The shift in young people’s sentiment first became visible in 2017, when Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption videos triggered protests that were dominated by students and high-school graduates. They were also angered by the Kremlin’s infringement of their personal freedoms and attempts to impose “patriotic” and “traditional” values on them. At around the same time, Mr Aramyan and his friends started publishing “Doxa”.
Over the past few years, Mr Putin and his circle have gradually become alienated from the young and the economically active. “In fact it is not the young cohort that is an outlier, but Putin’s own generation that is increasingly at odds with the rest of the population,” says Ekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political scientist. Surveys show that young people rarely watch television (the main vehicle for government propaganda). Instead they rely on social media and the internet, which the Kremlin is now targeting. They have a more positive view of the West, particularly Europe, and care more about human rights than they do about the greatness of the state or past victories, the staples of Mr Putin’s ideology.
With parliamentary elections due later this month, on September 19th, and a presidential one in 2024, Mr Aramyan says a crunch is approaching. “Either they will purge and suppress everything in sight, or we will deprive them of their majority.” Mr Putin, who will turn 70 next year, has plenty of repressive tools at his disposal. But the young have one crucial advantage. Time is on their side, not his. ■

1817,"TO SHOW HOW her husband would hit her, Ana (not her real name) makes a fist with her slender fingers and swings. He began soon after their marriage when she was 16: he was bullied at work but brutish at home. One night he drunkenly told Ana to leave their house in León, Nicaragua’s second city. When she tried to, he put his machete against her neck while she clutched their baby daughter. Five years ago the beatings abated. Threats to call the police quietened him, says Ana. He may not respect her, but he respects the authorities.
Now 53, Ana may never leave the relationship. But her bravery in managing it, and discussing it in a café over hibiscus tea, attests to surprising changes that have come to Nicaragua. In 1995 and again in 2016, foreign researchers asked women in León if they had suffered physical violence from their partner in the past year. In 1995 some 28% said yes. In 2016 just 8% did. The number who said they had never been beaten by a partner rose from 45% to 72%. Surveys over the same period show a similar shift across the country.

Such population-wide success stories are rare. Mary Ellsberg, who conducted both studies, reckons only America, after the passage in 1994 of the Violence Against Women Act, can boast of such a steep drop in domestic violence over so short a period. America’s government spent billions to achieve that. Nicaragua, the second-poorest country in the Americas, did it on the cheap. Its example suggests how other cash-strapped countries can tackle the scourge.
The revolution of 1979, led by Daniel Ortega, bequeathed to Nicaragua a strong women’s movement. The presidents who followed Mr Ortega after his ousting in 1990 were hardly feminist, but they let women’s groups organise and listened to them. Their efforts helped pass laws which made domestic violence a crime, and prompted various governments to issue five-year plans with policies to curb it. Shelters proliferated across the country, as did women’s police stations with counsellors, medics and privacy.
Women also toiled to change attitudes. Campaigners knocked on doors and went into classrooms. An NGO helped launch “Sexto Sentido” (“Sixth Sense”), a slick telenovela full of messages about domestic violence, safe sex and other taboos. It helped women understand their rights and their worth, says Johana Ocon, an activist in Malpaisillo, a town outside León. She describes women’s private chats as hormigas (“ants”): one will achieve little, but thousands will create a support network to help women avoid and flee violence.
Progress faltered after Mr Ortega returned to power in 2007. He distrusts women’s groups, perhaps because they believed his stepdaughter, Zoilamérica, when she accused him in 1998 of sexually abusing her as a child. His government has abolished women’s police stations and halved the number of shelters. Foreign donations dried up as Mr Ortega turned Nicaragua into a dictatorship. Ms Ocon has been unable to visit schools for half a decade. Domestic violence seems to be worsening with the pandemic.
That does not mean the recent advances will be reversed. Ana sees a new generation, with strength and self-esteem that cannot easily be taken away. Her daughter, now 30 years old, has never been beaten.",2
1818,"Poppy Day bomber Emad Al Swealmeen's ball bearing-packed explosive may have been accidentally set off when the taxi he used to get to his target suddenly stopped.
Counter-terrorism police confirmed today they believe the 32-year-old's Remembrance Day weapon would have caused 'significant injury or death' if it had gone off outside.
But the fact it detonated inside innocent David Perry's taxi outside Liverpool Women's Hospital, meant only the bomber was killed.
Police also disclosed today that devious Al Swealmeen purchased components from his bomb individually and by using a number of fake names to avoid flagging systems.
They have also ruled out any connection to the horrific Manchester Arena atrocity carried out by jihadi Salman Abedi.
Counter-terror officers are near completing of a full picture of Al Swealmeen's recent state of mind after speaking last night to his brother. 
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Police North West said: 'We continue to make significant progress in relation to the CT incident at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.
'Officers spoke with the brother of Al Swealmeen yesterday evening and this has given us an insight into his early years and an understanding of Al Swealmeen's life and his recent state of mind which is an important line of investigation. We are grateful for members of the public who knew him and have contacted us. 
'Although there is much scientific work to do on the device to determine what made it up, we have learned a great deal over the past five days.
'It was made using homemade explosive and had ball bearings attached to it which would have acted as shrapnel. Had it detonated in different circumstances we believe it would have caused significant injury or death.
'We still do not know how or why the device exploded when it did, but we are not discounting it being completely unintentional, and it is a possibility that the movement of the vehicle or its stopping caused the ignition.
'We are spending considerable time seeking to understand the way the purchases for the ingredients to make the device were made. This is complicated because purchases have spanned many months and Al Swealmeen has used many aliases. We are confident however that in time we will get a full picture of what purchases were made and how, and if anyone else was involved or knew what Al Swealmeen was up to.
'We have found no connection between this incident and the terrible events of Manchester in May 2017. The device was also different to the one used in the Manchester Arena attack.
'The investigation is still moving at a very fast pace and will continue into the weekend and the coming weeks.' 
The Church of England was today accused of aiding asylum seekers to 'game' the immigration system by helping hundreds to convert from Islam and 'pray to stay' in the UK as it emerged people smugglers are using Instagram to urge migrants to follow Jesus to help them gain British citizenship. 
Emad Al Swealmeen lost his first bid to stay in Britain in 2014 but appealed again in 2017 after he worshipped at Liverpool Cathedral and his case was still outstanding when he blew himself up in a taxi on Sunday.
He was baptised and confirmed having apparently spoken 'endlessly and passionately about Jesus', but members of the city's largest Anglican church admitted they 'lost contact' with him within months of the ceremony. He was one of around 200 asylum seekers to adopt the faith there over a four-year period.
A clergyman at Liverpool Cathedral previously raised concerns about asylum seekers cynically posing as Christians to boost their chances of being awarded refugee status. Rev Mohammad Eghtedarian admitted in 2016 that 'plenty of people' were lying about their intentions after it emerged that the Church of England had christened hundreds of asylum seekers under a scheme dubbed 'pray to stay'. 
He said: 'There are many people abusing the system... I'm not ashamed of saying that. But is it the person's fault or the system's fault? And who are they deceiving? The Home Office, me as a pastor, or God?'  
MPs are to demand a ­formal Parliamentary probe into whether fake Christian converts are duping the Church of England to avoid being deported back to strict Muslim countries they came from. 
It came as new statistics revealed that between January 2020 and June this year, 29% of all migrants arriving by boat say they are from Iran and 20% say they are from Iraq. 91% of all migrants came from just 10 countries - including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and Yemen. These are also nations named in the top 20 countries where Christians are the most persecuted for following Jesus. 
Priti Patel said last night that Al Swealmeen, who changed his name to Enzo Almeni shortly after finding Jesus, exploited the UK's asylum 'merry-go-round' while a Home Office source said changing from Islam to Christianity is now 'standard practice' among asylum seekers 'to game the asylum system'.  
Experts believe had the bomb functioned as intended, metal fragments would have been flung in all directions, shredding the car and cutting down passers-by.
Forensic tests are expected to reveal why it failed.
Mr Perry is thought to have escaped serious injury because the blast was largely confined to the back seat before the vehicle erupted in flames.
Early accounts of Mr Perry's bravery suggested he had stopped the taxi after spotting parts of his passenger's device.
The new police theory on the early detonation being triggered by the cab halting means the driver effectively foiled the deadly plot.
Yesterday it emerged that Al Swealmeen, 32, had spent months trawling the internet to buy chemicals and metal components in small quantities to avoid detection.
The failed asylum seeker, who arrived in Britain from Iraq, is said to have had online shopping packages constantly arriving at his rented flat in Liverpool.
Officers have recovered traces of chemicals from the bomb factory indicating that he experimented with various explosives.
One of the recipes he is understood to have followed was for hexamethylene triperoxide diamine – the same material used by the July 7 2005 London bombers.
In previous terror attacks such as the Manchester Arena bombing and the Parsons Green tube explosion, key ingredients were bought on Amazon.
Yesterday, the company said it was checking to see if Al Swealmeen had bought chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide.
An Amazon spokesman said: 'We only sell products that comply with UK laws. In addition, we also continue to work closely with police and law enforcement agencies.'
The motive for the attack remains unclear because officers have yet to access the bomber's computers.
Al Swealmeen had converted to Christianity in Liverpool Cathedral and attended services in the suburb of Fazakerley until 2019. But he later dropped out of sight, according to the leaders of his local church.
Yesterday there were reports suggesting that he had regularly attended a local mosque.
Far-Right extremism has for the first time overtaken Islamism as the main reason for referrals to the Government's anti-radicalisation programme Prevent, say official figures.
It was behind 1,229 referrals, about a quarter of the 4,915 made from April 2020 to March this year.
There were 1,064 about Islamism – 22 per cent. Most of the rest were for individuals with mixed, unstable or unclear ideologies.
The impact of coronavirus curbs led to a 22 per cent drop in referrals to Prevent, the first since records began in 2016. Under-20s account for 48 per cent of cases – and men for 88 per cent.",-2
1819,"THE HIGHWAY nearly 500km long that links Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, to its second city, Kandahar, was once hailed as a sign of great progress in America’s campaign to pacify Afghanistan. When Hamid Karzai, then president, inaugurated the first stretch in 2003, he said it was one of the best days of his life. Yet the road quickly became a troubling example of what was going wrong. A month after the Taliban took power, the journey from Kabul to Kandahar illustrates both how the country changed overnight and the failures that helped precipitate that shift.
Only weeks ago, driving down this stretch of Highway 1, a sort of national ring road, was unthinkable for many Afghans. Impromptu Taliban checkpoints stopped traffic and scoured buses and taxis for members of the armed forces to kidnap or kill. Military convoys were blown apart by bombs hidden under the road. Some districts, such as Saydabad in Wardak province, not far from Kabul (see map), became notorious as danger spots.

The biggest dangers have subsided now that the very fighters who once attacked the road are the ones guarding it. The Taliban’s checkpoints are still there, but now they are formal, waving traffic through. By contrast, the American-built security posts which lined the road in an unsuccessful effort to protect the route are already decaying. Some fly the white banner of the Taliban. Others are deserted. In the oldest, scrap merchants have removed the wire holding up the giant sandbags that ring the outposts. All that remains are sinking cubes of earth being reclaimed by the desert.

With the danger of attack gone, it is the quality of the road that is the biggest ordeal. When the resurfaced road was first opened, it could convey drivers from city to city in six hours. The same journey now takes nearly twice as long. Bombs have destroyed some stretches; overladen lorries have carved deep ruts into others.
Road-building was once the second-biggest beneficiary of international aid. NATO generals saw it as a way to win hearts and minds. But the deluge of cash, more than $4bn, attracted the sort of corruption that undermined most development schemes. Road-builders subcontracted their work and skimmed off as much as they could. The resulting highways were of poor quality and quickly fell apart, owing not just to explosions but also to more mundane and predictable problems such as flooding and heavy traffic. Other failed development projects line the road, including several electricity substations, complete with pylons but no power cables.
For the residents of rural Wardak, Ghazni and Zabul provinces, the foreigners’ efforts were of questionable value, says a journalist in the city of Qalat, in Zabul. “The whole focus was on the centres and I could not see any development in rural areas,” he says. “That’s why people started rising against the government.” The war over the road also brought night raids, air strikes and disappearances to the districts. Both sides were ruthless.
The Taliban, too, see the road as important. Just like the previous Afghan government and its foreign backers, they boast of road-building. On September 10th the public-works ministry announced that it had started “comprehensive reconstruction work” and engaged two construction companies to build three bridges and 40 culverts. With foreign aid frozen, the Taliban have little money for such works, but they have the benefit of security.
Those who once fought over the road are returning to their normal lives. At a wholesale dried-fruit market in the backstreets of Qalat, labourers weigh sacks of raisins. One has just returned to work after eight years in the fields with the Taliban. Eyeing this correspondent warily, he asks a friend: “Is he left over from the last lot of foreigners, or have new ones arrived?”

1820,"UNTIL 2013 Salma Tanveer ran a private school in a suburb of Lahore, Pakistan’s second biggest city. She and her husband, a civil engineer, were pious Muslims who had travelled to Mecca six times. Then things went wrong. The preacher in a local mosque accused her of blasphemy, claiming she had suggested that Muhammad might not have been the last prophet. On September 27th a lower court in the city pronounced its verdict. Ms Tanveer is to be fined 50,000 rupees ($290), and also “hanged by her neck until death”.
That may never happen. So far no one sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan has actually been executed—although of the nearly 2,000 people charged with the crime since the law was made more ferocious in the 1980s, 128 have been killed by angry mobs. In Ms Tanveer’s case it is the supposed experts who have run amok: in 2014 a panel of psychiatrists had declared her mentally ill and so unfit for trial, only to change its mind five years later.

Ms Tanveer’s situation is extreme, yet her predicament is in some ways a reflection of the peculiar, precarious balance that Pakistan itself has long sustained. In one avatar it is a nuclear-armed modern state that can hold elections, rely on scientific advice from highly qualified professionals and run courts where simple decency sometimes prevails. Yet its other face is a country of cruel and primitive laws, ill-educated mobs and people in power who are happy to make use of both.
Pakistanis are skilled at smoothing over such tensions, or simply ignoring them, but at crucial moments it is hard to do either. The dramatic return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan, which shares a 2,640km-long border with Pakistan, has been one of those moments. Since the ignominious collapse of Afghanistan’s Western-backed regime last month, after an expensive and violent 20-year experiment in democratisation, Pakistan has oscillated uncomfortably between relief and anxiety. Pakistan’s powerful deep state has for decades quietly backed the Taliban. Now, as the group’s closest friend and main conduit to the outside world, Pakistan bears a big responsibility for Afghanistan’s fate. Yet it is far from clear whether the tactical advantage won by chasing other players out will translate into longer term gains—boosting Pakistan’s diplomatic weight and opening opportunities for commerce—or whether this unsteady country of 220m will be sucked into yet more Afghan turmoil, this time with no one else to blame.
Many in Pakistan—55% according to a recent Gallup poll—are pleased to have the Taliban ruling next door again, and delighted to see a bunch of sandal-clad Muslim peasants humiliate an infidel horde equipped with drones and satellites. “It is a great achievement,” crows Zainullah Achakzai, a soft-drink vendor in the border town of Chaman, midway between Quetta in Pakistan and Kandahar in Afghanistan.
Other Pakistanis see the end of the Western-sponsored regime in Kabul as an ominous warning. They fear the return of old disorders associated with Afghanistan, such as jihadist terror, an influx of destitute refugees and ostracism by other countries. Already radical Islamists have raised the Taliban flag over mosques in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, and attacks by Muslim radicals within Pakistan have ticked up again after several years of decline. According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, a monitoring site, Pakistan saw more big incidents in the first nine months of this year—67, with 329 people killed—than in all of 2020. The steepest rise has come in the past two months, in areas along the Afghan border.
All the more worrying for Pakistanis is the fact that the Taliban, on capturing Kabul, opened prisons and freed, among others, Faqir Muhammad, a leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a terrorist group responsible for some of the worst massacres in Pakistani history. The TTP is thought to have as many as 5,000 men hiding in Afghanistan. On his release Mr Muhammad declared that the imposition of sharia in Afghanistan proves that it is possible to adopt it in Pakistan, too. He was referring to the same violent interpretation of religious law that the Taliban practise, and meant that his group would fight to bring it to Pakistan. “Every day brings renewed evidence of the extreme dangers posed to Pakistan,” tweets Mosharraf Zaidi, a columnist. “Taliban enthusiasts have to choose between the (Pakistani) republic and their ridiculous juvenile fantasies.”
You know my other side
In some ways Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, also embodies the country’s contradictions. A product of its privileged Anglophone elite, a former cricket star and global playboy, he is also a moralising religious conservative, an economic populist and an obedient servant of the generals who call the shots in Pakistan. His government recently proposed a law that would prescribe up to two years in jail for any civilian who “ridicules, brings into disrepute or defames the armed forces of Pakistan”. The draft stipulates that such cases should be tried in military courts. In a meeting with Islamic scholars last month, Mr Khan declared that under his rule no new law would ever go against religious guidelines.
Dismissed by some as “Taliban Khan”, and so far not even accorded a phone call from President Joe Biden, the prime minister has been a passionate and articulate defender of Pakistan’s Afghan policy. Given space on the opinion pages of the Washington Post, he detailed the heavy cost in lives and money that Pakistan has paid because of the troubles next door, and voiced exasperation that Western governments failed to grasp that many Afghans viewed NATO troops as no different from the Soviet ones who invaded two decades earlier. “Surely Pakistan is not to blame for the fact that 300,000 well-trained and well-equipped Afghan security forces saw no reason to fight the lightly-armed Taliban,” he wrote.
Mr Khan left out other pieces of the puzzle. He did not mention that much of the Taliban leadership has enjoyed a long and close relationship with both Pakistani Islamists and the ISI, the country’s intelligence service. He failed to note a crucial difference in perspective: for Pakistan’s generals the danger of blowback from jihadism in Afghanistan, while real—Mr Khan says his country suffered 16,000 terror attacks between 2006 and 2015—was always weighed against the crucial mission of keeping Pakistan’s greatest enemy, India, out of their backyard.
The prime minister also neglected to explain that Pakistan’s spies have long favoured the Taliban because, unlike traditional Afghan nationalists, the religious fanatics care little for historic Afghan claims to bits of Pakistani territory and do not speak of uniting Pushtuns, a 60m-strong ethnic group that is divided by the border. And needless to say Mr Khan did not remind his American audience that Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader, spent years concealed in a big house in Pakistan, next door to an army base and retired army officers, before being found and dispatched by American Navy Seals.
Still, the outcome in Afghanistan would seem to be good for Mr Khan. Since winning power in 2018 the prime minister has struggled to maintain popularity. Many Pakistanis, aware that the army is the real power in the land and more concerned with rising prices than political antics, see little change in their lot. Mr Khan’s relentless crusade against allegedly corrupt former officials, which included hounding the previous prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, out of the country, has proved more divisive than popular, although it has succeeded in disrupting and weakening opposition parties. His government’s clumsy efforts to tame Pakistan’s often surprisingly feisty press, by threatening reporters and owners, blocking websites and proposing a law to create a mostly state-appointed oversight board for all media, has not so much won kinder coverage as generated mistrust of the government.
Yet Pakistan’s victory-by-proxy in Afghanistan now makes Mr Khan look prescient, with his forthright argument for the world to accept the reality of the Taliban and to send aid to Pakistan’s poor “brothers”. It helps, too, that for reasons that are not yet understood, covid-19 appears to have hit Pakistan far less hard than its neighbours. The death rate per million in Iran is more than ten times Pakistan’s. Criticised in spring last year for his decision not to impose a sweeping lockdown as India did, Mr Khan now appears wise. An opinion poll at the end of August gave the prime minister a 48% approval rating, his highest yet. With the full backing of the deep state guaranteed, and opposition parties reduced to regional rumps, there is no one significant to stand against him in the next election, in 2023. Not only may Mr Khan become the country’s first prime minister to complete a full term. He may be the first to serve two consecutive ones.
Can no longer hide
That would please Rawalpindi, the twin city to Islamabad that houses army HQ and is synonymous with its overweening power. Having tried coups d’état in the past, Pakistan’s generals, fixated on the struggle against a far bigger India and enjoying a comfortable lifestyle of “cantonments”, have learned that it is better to erect a presentable political facade than to get too involved in the messy business of direct rule. But this can be tricky. The previous prime minister, Mr Sharif, often chafed against orders. Not so Mr Khan. “Both sides seem to be working very well together, essentially as one unit, in this government,” says Madiha Afzal of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington.
From the generals’ point of view there is no ambiguity about the outcome in Afghanistan. It is, after all, what they have worked for, stealthily and patiently, for years. They viewed the departed regime as at best unreliable and at worst hostile. Correctly or not, Pakistani intelligence has long obsessed over Indian spies using Afghanistan as a springboard for sabotage. Now Pakistan can with greater assurance face an India that has grown more aggressive under the Hindu-nationalist government of Narendra Modi.
That the collapse in Kabul was swift and almost bloodless was an added bonus. Another plus is that Pakistan has shown its closest ally, China, that it was right all along: that the Americans would not last, and that Pakistan, which has been a sink for Chinese aid without really extending the Asian power’s strategic reach, may in the end have something to deliver.
In the Taliban Pakistan’s generals have gained not perfect allies, but a group over which they exercise more leverage than anyone else. Significantly, the interim government announced by the Taliban in September appeared to demote several figures seen as estranged from Pakistan and to promote those closest to it. Senior members of the Haqqani network, widely seen as a cat’s paw of the ISI, hold several positions in the cabinet, including minister of the interior. Mohammed Yaqoob, the new defence minister and son of Mullah Omar, a Taliban founder, is also pally with Pakistan. It was no coincidence that a relaxed-looking Faiz Hameed, then the Pakistani intelligence chief, had himself appeared in Kabul shortly before the announcement. Many in Islamabad caution, however, that, although the Taliban clearly listen to advice, they may not always do as they are told, and may indeed split into factions and thus be unable to do so in any case.

If Pakistan’s military and civilian bosses have both profited from the change of guard in Kabul, what about everyone else? Despite escaping the worst effects of covid-19, the country is not in good health. Over the past decade GDP per person has grown by less than 2% a year on average (see chart 1). At barely $1,200 it is not even two-thirds of India’s.

By other development indicators, too, Pakistan trails its region. The only South Asian country with a lower life expectancy is Afghanistan. With its exports performing poorly and imports from China soaring (and crushing many local industries), Pakistan has grown increasingly reliant on remittances—worth $21bn in 2019—to prop up its balance of payments. Its other crutch has been bail-outs from the IMF: Pakistan has received 22, more than any other country (see chart 2).
Though the prospect of becoming a regional trading hub remains a distant dream, Pakistan faces a more immediate crunch. Mr Khan ran for office promising to build an Islamic welfare state. What Pakistanis have experienced instead is inflation—which reached 11% in April but has now cooled to 9%—and a currency that has lost a quarter of its value against the dollar since he became prime minister. Rising global oil prices are set to deliver another unwelcome jolt.
Shaukat Tareen, Mr Khan’s fourth finance minister, has been trying to persuade the IMF to ease terms on a $6bn bail-out that was agreed in 2019, but then delayed until February this year after the prime minister balked at the required belt-tightening. The release of an added $2.75bn in special drawing rights in August, Pakistan’s automatic share of the IMF’s global push to compensate countries for covid troubles, came in the nick of time to prop up sliding confidence. In July the stock of Pakistan’s foreign debt swelled to some $122bn, close to 50% of GDP and, more worryingly, almost five times the value of its net foreign-currency reserves.

Much of this debt is now held by China, Pakistan’s “all-weather friend” and its partner in one of the most ambitious branches of the Belt and Road Initiative. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is supposed to see some $67bn of Chinese investments in Pakistan (see map), much of it in vital power plants and transport links. But according to a new study by AidData, a research group, of the $34.3bn in assistance promised by China between 2000 and 2017, at least $27.8bn has come in the form of loans on commercial terms, rather than the concessional lending typical of Western aid.
To the discomfort of Pakistan’s generals, who might wish for greater independence, the country has also grown increasingly dependent on China for arms. Pakistan alone soaked up a hefty 38% of total Chinese weapons exports between 2016 and 2020, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a think-tank.
Yet China has not always been happy with what is, in effect, its closest ally of any size. Repeated terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers, including one in July that left nine of the visitors and four Pakistanis dead, have diminished trust. The remoteness of China’s border with Pakistan from its industrial heartland and still-poor road linkages mean there is little overland trade. Whatever the alignment of their interests, Pakistan’s economy is just 1.75% of China’s. Small wonder that Mr Khan, a champion of Islamic causes everywhere else, keeps quiet about the incarceration of China’s Muslim citizens in Xinjiang.
The payoff to Pakistan for such loyalty is that China lends immense and increasing weight to its otherwise disadvantageous balance of power with India. This has a downside for regional stability, in that it makes Pakistan unwilling to compromise over its eternal claims to the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which in turn provokes Indian mulishness over its own counterclaims. In 2019 a suicide bomb, for which a Pakistani group claimed responsibility, killed some 40 Indian soldiers in Kashmir, provoking clashes that came close to open warfare between the nuclear rivals. Later that year Mr Modi’s government stripped Kashmir of its limited autonomy. This might in the past have roused international condemnation. The lack of it has painfully exposed Pakistan’s waning influence.
Let you down so many times
Mr Khan’s current diplomatic offensive comes in the context of the dwindling options bequeathed by his country’s feeble economy, hypocrisy over Xinjiang and long history of double-dealing. “Pakistan is trying to use Afghanistan to rehabilitate itself,” says Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank. “Its message is that we were right all along, there never was a military solution, so it is wrong to blame us.” What Pakistan now wants is for other countries to lend a hand, and help shore up the Taliban government as the only way of sustaining regional stability. The trouble is that, just as Pakistan’s leaders imagine the country’s strategic significance to have grown because it holds unique influence over the Taliban, the West’s withdrawal has entailed a steep decline in its interest in the region.
Mr Khan may well be right that the best hope for preventing a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan now, and for keeping a grip on jihadist groups that linger on its soil, is to help the Taliban keep a lid on things. “If Afghanistan destabilises, the spillover effect comes to Pakistan,” says Moeed Yusuf, Mr Khan’s national security adviser. “After Afghanistan we are the biggest victim of the past four decades and we are not interested in going there again.” But coming from a country that has for so long run with the foxes while hunting with the hounds, as Pakistan has, such words carry limited credibility. ■

1821,"AFTER BARELY four tumultuous years of revolutionary government, Thomas Sankara was gunned down in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso’s capital, in 1987, during a coup. It was hatched by his erstwhile best friend, Blaise Compaoré, who has said that he did not order the killing, but who then ran the show until he in turn was turfed out after an uprising in 2014. Since 2015 this poor, arid country of 22m has wobbled along more or less democratically.
In the past few years, however, a wave of jihadist violence across the five countries of the Sahel (the others are Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger) has washed over Burkina Faso, too, giving everyone the jitters. So what is the point of the trial, which opened on October 11th in Ouagadougou, of 14 men accused of being involved in the killing of Mr Sankara and a dozen or so of his comrades all those years ago, seeing that the chief defendant, Mr Compaoré, is snug in exile next door, in Ivory Coast?

Another leading defendant, Hyacinthe Kafando, Mr Compaoré’s security chief, is also abroad. But Mr Compaoré’s right-hand man, General Gilbert Diendéré, sat dressed in camouflage among the other 12 accused in the packed courtroom, not far from the families of the victims of the coup, including Mariam Sankara, the late president’s widow. “We are expecting justice to be done,” she says. “It is unfortunate that all the accused are not here.”
Sankara, a self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist and admirer of Fidel Castro and Muammar Qaddafi, is still revered in left-wing circles across Africa for his firebrand populism and fierce hostility to the West. He was especially critical of France, his country’s former ruler. Aged 33 when he took power, he promptly changed the country’s name from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (The Land of Upright People). He expropriated feudal landholdings, promoted education and health care (with mass-vaccination programmes), opposed female genital mutilation and forced marriage, urged reforestation and rejected foreign aid (“He who feeds you, controls you”), rebuffing the IMF and railing against corruption and capitalism.
He also banned political opposition, muzzled the media, clobbered trade unions, terrified much of the country’s small, beleaguered middle class and summarily executed a clutch of figures tied to the previous regime. He set up Cuban-style “committees for the defence of the revolution” and “popular revolutionary tribunals” that sometimes chastised people for “laziness”. Pioneers of the Revolution, his youth movement, wore berets like Che Guevara. Many Africans liken Sankara to Che. Whether this is a compliment or an insult depends on one’s view of handsome, violent Marxists.
“He was dedicated to everything he did. He sacrificed everything to serve his people,” says Pierre Ouedraogo, an old friend who presides over a memorial in his name. “Most African intellectuals think first about themselves, but he thought about the people first,” he says. Sankara’s friends and fans in Ouagadougou hope the trial will expose the murky details of Mr Compaoré’s plot to oust him, punish the alleged assassins and so bring belated comfort to the families of those who were killed.
Less clear is whether details of France’s suspected involvement in Sankara’s demise will be revealed. Brian Peterson, a biographer of Sankara, doubts there will be a smoking gun implicating any foreign powers. “This will disappoint many people,” he says. If France were candid about what happened, the trial could help to redefine its relations with Burkina Faso “as a partner, not as imperialist overlord”. President Emmanuel Macron may not agree.
Some reckon the current president, Roch Kaboré, will try to use the trial to boost his own government’s popularity, which has been waning in part because of its failure to fend off the growing jihadist insurgency linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State. Thousands have perished and more than a million have been displaced. Moreover, Mr Compaoré still has a following in the country, especially in the army. So it is not certain that bringing him to book, even in absentia, will enhance national reconciliation, as the government claims.
The insurgency caused 335 civilian deaths in May, June, July and August, up from 80 in the previous four months. Both sides have committed atrocities. “The Sankara trial should not be made to bear the sole burden for tackling Burkina Faso’s long-held culture of impunity,” says Corinne Dufka of Human Rights Watch. ■",2
1822,"ONE OF THE biggest concerns in science is bias—that scientists themselves, consciously or unconsciously, may put their thumbs on the scales and influence the outcomes of experiments. Boffins have come up with all sorts of tactics to try to eliminate it, from having their colleagues repeat their work to the “double blinding” common in clinical trials, when even the experimenters do not know which patients are receiving an experimental drug and which are getting a sugar-pill placebo.
But gathering the data and running an experiment is not the only part of the process that can go awry. The methods chosen to analyse the data can also influence results. The point was dramatically demonstrated by two recent papers published in a journal called Surgery. Despite being based on the same dataset, they drew opposite conclusions about whether using a particular piece of kit during appendix-removal surgery reduced or increased the chances of infection.

A new paper, from a large team of researchers headed by Martin Schweinsberg, a psychologist at the European School of Management and Technology, in Berlin, helps shed some light on why. Dr Schweinsberg gathered 49 different researchers by advertising his project on social media. Each was handed a copy of a dataset consisting of 3.9m words of text from nearly 8,000 comments made on Edge.org, an online forum for chatty intellectuals.
Dr Schweinsberg asked his guinea pigs to explore two seemingly straightforward hypotheses. The first was that a woman’s tendency to participate would rise as the number of other women in a conversation increased. The second was that high-status participants would talk more than their low-status counterparts. Crucially, the researchers were asked to describe their analysis in detail by posting their methods and workflows to a website called DataExplained. That allowed Dr Schweinsberg to see exactly what they were up to.
In the end, 37 analyses were deemed sufficiently detailed to include. As it turned out, no two analysts employed exactly the same methods, and none got the same results. Some 29% of analysts reported that high-status participants were more likely to contribute. But 21% reported the opposite. (The remainder found no significant difference.) Things were less finely balanced with the first hypothesis, with 64% reporting that women do indeed participate more, if plenty of other women are present. But 21% concluded that the opposite was true.
The problem was not that any of the analyses were “wrong” in any objective sense. The differences arose because researchers chose different definitions of what they were studying, and applied different techniques. When it came to defining how much women spoke, for instance, some analysts plumped for the number of words in each woman’s comment. Others chose the number of characters. Still others defined it by the number of conversations that a woman participated in, irrespective of how much she actually said.
Academic status, meanwhile, was defined variously by job title, the number of citations a researcher had accrued, or their “h-index”, a number beloved by university managers which attempts to combine citation counts with the importance of the journals those citations appear in. The statistical techniques chosen also had an impact, though less than the choice of definitions. Some researchers chose linear-regression analysis; others went for logistic regression or a Kendall correlation.
Truth, in other words, can be a slippery customer, even for simple-sounding questions. What to do? One conclusion is that experimental design is critically important. Dr Schweinsberg hopes that platforms such as DataExplained can help solve the problem as well as revealing it, by allowing scientists to specify exactly how they chose to perform their analysis, allowing those decisions to be reviewed by others. It is probably not practical, he concedes, to check and re-check every result. But if many different analytical approaches point in the same direction, then scientists can be confident that their conclusion is the right one. ■",2
1823,"Editor’s note: Twelve months on from the killing of George Floyd, The Economist is publishing a series of articles, films, podcasts, data visualisations and guest contributions on the theme of race in America. We begin our coverage with the publication of a special report by our US editor.
WHEN DEREK CHAUVIN knelt on George Floyd’s neck at the corner of 38th and Chicago on a warm, cloudy night in Minneapolis a year ago, there was little unusual about the scene. Not for Mr Floyd, who had been arrested before. Not for Mr Chauvin, who had been disciplined twice for misconduct and had 17 complaints against him. And not for America, where police kill over 1,000 people a year—three-quarters of them, unlike Mr Floyd, armed. Sorted by race, more whites die like this than any other group. But black Americans (13% of the population) are over twice as likely to be killed by the police. In this, as in many other ways, African-American men who are poor are at the bottom of the heap. To find someone else’s knee on their throat is, sadly, unsurprising.
The reaction to this murder was a shock, though. Mr Floyd’s death, which was filmed by a bystander, sparked the biggest civil-rights protests in America’s history. Some 20m Americans took part, flouting covid-19 restrictions. There were 7,750 protests in over 2,440 places, in every state. Beyond America, Black Lives Matter protests were staged in Brazil, France, Japan and New Zealand, among others. Companies around the world have been busily examining whether, through their hiring, buying and selling, they play a part in perpetuating racism. A year on, footballers in England’s Premier League, who play in a country where just 3% of the population is black, still take a knee before games, a gesture that is broadcast to 188 countries. Thus America’s struggle to defeat racism shapes other societies too.


The image of a white-skinned man, wearing a uniform that reads “To Protect With Courage, To Serve With Compassion”, kneeling on the neck of a dark-skinned man evokes the worst of America’s past so strongly that there seems little doubt what killed Mr Floyd. Police violence was part of it, as was poverty. But the real culprit was racism. The jury that on April 21st, after a short deliberation, convicted Mr Chauvin of murder seemed to agree.

For many African-Americans, watching a constant stream of death videos, combined with the country’s still racialised politics, feels like “drowning in the news”, according to Eddie Glaude of Princeton University. “I never really had faith in the United States in the strongest sense of the word,” he writes in “Begin Again”, a book about James Baldwin published after the protests. “I hoped that one day white people here would finally leave behind the belief that they mattered more. But what do you do when this glimmer of hope fades, and you are left with the belief that white people will never change—that the country, no matter what we do, will remain basically the same?”
Drowning in the news makes it easy to miss the profound improvements in racial attitudes in America that have taken place just in the past generation, a change reflected in the scale of outrage about Mr Floyd’s murder (and the rare conviction of a police officer for it). When Bill Clinton became president, a majority of Americans disapproved of interracial marriages. Cynthia Duncan, a sociologist who worked in the Mississippi Delta during the 1990s, observed that “when blacks describe a white who does not seem racist, they say, ‘she treated me like a person’, repeating the phrase to emphasise how rare and remarkable the encounter had been.” And this was 30 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
Now another 30 years have passed, 90% of Americans approve of mixed-race marriage. Measuring changes in racial attitudes is fraught, because as people become more conscious that prejudices they hold are no longer widely accepted, they may become more reluctant to admit them. Yet changes in behaviour suggest the shift is real, not just what people believe they should say to pollsters. More than 10% of babies born in America are now mixed-race. Research drawing on data from dating apps suggests that one in three couples who meet online are too. This is part of a demographic transformation. Since 2019, white, non-Hispanic children have been in a minority in America.

African-Americans, whose opinion on the matter ought to count, think there is less racial discrimination than there was. In 1985 three-quarters of African-Americans thought that the fact that whites had better jobs, better wages and better houses was mainly down to discrimination. By 2012, less than half thought this was the case (a share that rose after Donald Trump was elected). And yet among the general population, racism is rated a more important issue in Gallup’s polling than health care, poverty, crime, the environment or national security.
How can the country have become both less racist and yet more worried that the prevalence of racism is growing? And if racism is indeed declining, why do so many African-Americans still seem to be so stuck?
Racism and awareness of racism are related but distinct. Sometimes they move in opposite directions. In the old South, where people were denied the right to vote for a century after the abolition of slavery because of the colour of their skin, it was a cliché for whites to claim not only that they were not racist but also that they understood African-Americans better than did those progressives in northern cities. Similarly, many whites who may have been unaware of racism when it was far more prevalent are more conscious of it now, as the protests after Mr Floyd’s murder showed.
Guess who’s coming to dinner
Since Barack Obama’s election in 2008, left-leaning white Americans have undergone what Matt Yglesias, a journalist, dubbed a Great Awokening on race. R.T. Rybak, a former mayor of Minneapolis, calls it “reality therapy”. The Trump-powered birther movement, which asserted that the country’s first black president was a foreigner, the well-publicised killings by police of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Eric Garner in New York, a mass-shooting at a black church in South Carolina: all these made people realise that racism was more widespread than they had thought. And then Mr Trump was elected president.
The share of whites who thought black Americans had worse jobs, lower incomes and crummier houses because of discrimination shot up. The share of whites who thought government should give no special treatment to black Americans shrank by a third in six years. In the year Mr Obama was elected, half of white Americans thought racial differences in incomes and wealth were caused mainly by lack of will. By 2018 that share had fallen by 15 points. Now black respondents are slightly more likely to blame African-Americans for their circumstances than whites are.
Understanding race and racism in American means grasping a set of contradictions. Despair at the slowness of improvement can be a sign of progress. Racial attitudes have changed, but black and white Americans are as segregated as they were in the era of James Brown and John Denver. As a true multiracial democracy, America has existed for less than the span of a lifetime. It is home to the biggest black middle class in the world, but also to a large black underclass that has made little economic progress since the 1960s. Writing about race is normally shorthand for writing about African-Americans, Hispanics or Asians. But as they are becoming more aware, whites are a race too.
In a multiracial democracy, emphasising race can be a recipe for zero-sum competition for public resources. Partly for this reason, the French government largely bans collection of data on race. But ducking the issue can mean that racial inequality persists. In 1967, another time of despair at racist violence, James Baldwin wrote that he wanted black Americans “to do something unprecedented: to create ourselves without finding it necessary to create an enemy.” America’s task now is to make multiracial politics work without setting groups against each other. No other big, rich democracy is as multiracial, but plenty will be one day. So America is once again a testing-ground for a great democratic experiment. For it to work, the first thing to understand is why it was Mr Chauvin’s knee that was on Mr Floyd’s throat, and not the other way around.■

1824,"IN MARCH, President Joe Biden asked his spooks how the covid-19 pandemic had started. Contradicting claims made last year by Donald Trump, who said the intelligence services had shown him very strong evidence on the matter, they told him that they did not know. So on May 26th he asked them again, publicly this time, admonishing them to try harder and to report back in 90 days.
This is a direct rebuke to China’s secretive government. When experts convened by the World Health Organisation (WHO) travelled to Wuhan, the city where covid-19 was first identified, in January and February this year their hosts refused to share crucial data. A senior Biden administration official said recently that he found those efforts to “undermine serious investigations” into the pandemic’s beginnings particularly troubling, and that they left “many more questions than answers”.

At the crux of this distrust is the possibility that SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes covid-19, may have emerged accidentally from research on animal coronaviruses conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or another nearby lab. In early 2020 this idea, sometimes conflated with the idea that the virus had been developed as a biological weapon, was publicly dismissed by eminent scientists. In February 2020 a number of them used the pages of the Lancet, a medical journal, “to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that covid-19 does not have a natural origin”. Most in the media followed their line. By far the most plausible account of covid-19’s origins, they reported, was “zoonotic spillover”—that is, a virus jumping unaided from animals to humans, as is taken to have been the case for SARS, a disease caused by a different coronavirus, in 2002. Lab-leak theories were widely dismissed as conspiracy-mongering.

In the past few months, though, discussion of lab-leakery has gained currency among politicians and policy elites and in the mainstream media, as well as in influential blog posts by science reporters. This is in part because of the departures of Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state, who promoted the theory with gusto. To be able to consider the possibility without giving them succour will have made it easier for some.
But the resurgence is not a purely political phenomenon. On May 13th Science, a journal, published a letter from a group of senior scientists who had not previously weighed in on the matter arguing that “theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable”. In this they were taking the same position as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s boss, who refused to rule out the possibility of a laboratory origin after the WHO mission in January and February was stonewalled, and has since called for further inquiry.
This is not going down well in China. On May 21st, at a Global Health Summit convened by the EU and G20, Xi Jinping, China’s president, urged world leaders to “firmly reject any attempt to politicise” the covid-19 pandemic. On May 25th China’s representative at the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, said the country considered the inquiry into the origins complete and that the focus should shift to other countries, strongly suggesting that it would not accommodate further investigation.
High on the assembly’s agenda were responses to the current pandemic and the prevention of future ones. Felicity Harvey, chair of an oversight committee for the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said that new virus threats must in future be handled with more transparency, better data-sharing and an ability to give informal early warnings to the world. Earlier in May a WHO panel of experts recommended that countries be placed under a greater obligation to report new outbreaks and that the WHO’s authority to seek out and share relevant information with the world be strengthened.
It would be surprising if China (and, indeed, some other countries) were to accept all these ideas. Its leadership has consistently fought to deny international bodies the right to stick their noses into the affairs of sovereign countries, and it does not always welcome the WHO’s attentions. In 2018 it declined requests from American officials, made under WHO guidelines, for lab samples of the H7N9 strain of avian flu.

China has instead recently indicated it will reform its own public-health system. On May 13th the authorities announced a reorganisation of the national public-health bureaucracy under a new entity, the National Administration of Disease Prevention and Control. A priority in the shake-up is to improve top-down control, so that lower-level officials have more incentive to report new public-health threats up the chain of command.
Chinese authorities tried to deal with a similar issue after the SARS outbreak of the 2000s, in part to tackle the problem that national health officials were outranked by provincial authorities who had covered up the early spread of that coronavirus in southern China. They made the monitoring of new threats more systematic, raised their game with the WHO and even co-operated with America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the model for China’s own CDC—the Wuhan office of which is now being mentioned in the context of a possible laboratory origin.

There is as yet no evidence in the public domain that a laboratory leak actually took place; just evidence that the possibility is real. Mr Biden’s request suggests anything the secret world can currently add to that is pretty weak stuff. His statement says that, at present, two “elements” within the intelligence community lean towards the zoonotic explanation, one prefers the laboratory origin, and no one has high confidence in any of these assessments. Without help from China, a harder look will not necessarily change this. But it is still worth taking, even given the risk of a confrontational response which will make the enhanced transparency and co-operation talked about at the World Health Assembly unlikely to blossom any time soon. ■

1825,"THE PAST year and a half has served up a reminder, if one were needed, of how unequal America is. The wealthiest Americans have seen their assets increase in value thanks to a stockmarket rally, especially in the tech sector. At the opposite end of the ladder, millions of mostly low-wage workers have lost their jobs, while also facing a higher risk of death from covid-19. But there is also some good news to set against this: the incomes of poor Americans have grown more quickly than those of rich ones.

The earnings out-performance for poorer Americans started in 2018. JPMorgan Chase Institute, a think-tank within the bank, parsed data on more than 7m households. Early in the 2010s, as the economy recovered from the global financial crisis, the top quartile of income earners reaped the fastest income gains and the bottom quartile brought up the rear. However, a few years ago their positions flipped. And over the course of the pandemic the gap has widened, such that, by May, incomes for the lowest earners were growing by about 7% annually, compared with 4.5% for the highest earners (see chart).

What explains the shift in fortunes? Some of the credit goes to policymakers’ willingness to run a hot economy before the pandemic. Traditionally, economists have worried that low unemployment pushes up wages and, by extension, inflation. But even with unemployment rates below 4%, inflation remained subdued. At the same time, wage growth was most pronounced at the lowest rungs of the income ladder (given an additional boost in some states by higher minimum wages), a relationship that was first observed by Arthur Okun, an American economist, in a paper in 1973 about how “high-pressure” economies tend to promote upward labour mobility as companies pay more for workers.
The spread of covid-19 created a low-pressure economy, almost overnight. Unemployment, which would normally depress wage growth, soared. And without any help from the federal government, that is what would have happened. But thanks to an expansion of unemployment insurance as well as a series of stimulus cheques, the reality was very different. Poorer Americans have been the main beneficiaries, with far fewer suffering drops in incomes than would have otherwise been the case.",2
1826,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Media entrepreneur Byron Allen has raised $10 billion in preferred equity and debt for his bid for U.S. regional TV station operator Tegna Inc (TGNA.N), hoping to prevail over a rival offer from investment firms Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) and Standard General LP, people familiar with the matter said.
The financing is backed by a consortium of 14 banks and 10 investors, including Ares Management Corp (ARES.N), Fortress Investment Group, Oaktree Capital Management and Michael Milken's family office, one of the sources said.
Ares is leading a $2.2 billion preferred equity investment in support of Allen's financing package, another of the sources added.
Tegna could choose a winning bidder as early as this month, the sources said.
Spokespeople for Tegna, Apollo, Oaktree and Michael Milken declined to comment.
Allen, who acquired the Weather Channel TV network for $300 million in 2018, made a $23 per share offer for Tegna in September, while Apollo and Standard General offered $22 per share, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tegna wants both bidders to raise their offers, one of the sources said. It also expects assurances from both bidders that they will entertain all regulatory demands necessary to complete the acquisition, and views the Apollo/Standard General bid as most likely to raise antitrust concerns, the source added.
Apollo owns 33 TV stations in 20 markets through its portfolio company Cox Media Group, while Standard General owns four TV stations, according to their websites.
Tegna reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday and said on a call with analysts it was still evaluating acquisition proposals versus its stand-alone prospects.
The company recorded $756 million in revenue in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. It has 64 television stations in 51 U.S. markets, and a market value of $7.75 billion including debt.",3
1827,"Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, were on the brink of war. The crisis began with clashes around the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third-holiest site. Israeli police fired stun-grenades and rubber bullets at rock-throwing Palestinians. Hamas and its allies then fired more than 1,600 rockets at Israel, which responded with hundreds of air strikes on Gaza. Scores of people, mostly Palestinians, were killed. Israel said it had killed Hamas officials. Adding to the turmoil, street fighting broke out in several Israeli cities between Jews and Arabs.
Iran confirmed that it was talking to Saudi Arabia, its arch-rival, in an effort to resolve the many issues that divide them. The secret discussions were mediated by Iraq and started in Baghdad early last month. Meanwhile, an American Coast Guard ship fired warning shots at boats from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in the Strait of Hormuz when they got too close to American naval vessels, the second incident in two weeks.

Republicans in the House of Representatives ousted Liz Cheney from her senior leadership role. The eldest daughter of Dick Cheney, George W. Bush’s vice-president, Ms Cheney has bona fide conservative credentials; her sin was to reject the lie that last November’s election was stolen. A defiant Ms Cheney urged her party to stand up to Donald Trump, warning that “remaining silent, and ignoring the lie, emboldens the liar.”
An attempt by the National Rifle Association to declare bankruptcy and move its legal headquarters to Texas was thrown out of court.

Protests continued in Colombia for a third week. At least 13 people have been recorded as being killed, though the actual number may be higher. Around 60 investigations into police brutality have opened. President Iván Duque attempted to negotiate with protest leaders, with little success. What started as an outcry against an unpopular proposed tax law has broadened into a larger push for reform.
The Scottish National Party’s drive for an independent Scotland faltered after it failed to win an outright majority in elections to the Scottish Parliament. Together with seats held by the pro-independence Greens, there is a majority for a referendum in the Parliament, but polling has swung a bit against holding another vote. A bruising battle to break from the rest of the United Kingdom wouldn’t be easy. Brexit has proved that.
Britain’s Labour Party lost Hartlepool in a by-election, a constituency it had held since its creation in 1974. A huge swing gave the Conservatives 52% of the vote, nearly twice that of Labour; sitting governments have won by-elections only a handful of times. Labour’s leader, Sir Keir Starmer, came under more pressure when the party lost many seats in council elections. Labour’s candidate in Hartlepool said voters did not know what the party now stood for.
At a summit meeting in Portugal, EU leaders rejected proposals by Joe Biden to waive covid-19 vaccine patents as a way to increase the supply of the drugs. They argued that it would be more helpful if America were to relax its restrictions on the export of vaccines.

A car bomb outside a girls' school in Kabul killed at least 85 people, mostly pupils. The Taliban denied responsibility. The attack, which occurred in a part of the city that is home to the Hazara ethnic minority, has intensified concerns that the American withdrawal from Afghanistan in September will be followed by greater violence against women and minorities. Meanwhile the Taliban seized control of a district near Kabul, the second in a week.
India’s covid crisis continued to engulf the country, spreading into the rural hinterland and spilling over the country’s borders. Daily recorded infections in Nepal have jumped by a factor of 25 in the past month and one in every two tests returns a positive result, twice India’s already high rate, suggesting many cases are going undetected. Infections are also rising across South-East Asia, testing the capacity of health systems.
Debris from China’s Long March 5B rocket plunged into the Indian Ocean. The Chinese government announced that the “great majority” of the material had burned up before reaching the Earth’s surface.

China finally released details of its census, which showed that its population reached 1.41bn last year, up by 5.4% from a decade ago. The results contradicted media reports that suggested China’s population had fallen below 1.4bn, which would have marked the first decline in six decades.

1828,"A LONG LEGAL chapter in America’s opioid epidemic, which continues to kill tens of thousands of people a year, at last came to an end on September 1st when a federal judge in New York approved the bankruptcy plan of Purdue Pharma, which developed and manufactured OxyContin, a highly addictive painkiller. The deal settled thousands of lawsuits against the firm filed by states, localities, tribes and individuals. Purdue will be reorganised as a public-benefit company called Knoa Pharma, and its future profits will go towards alleviating the damage done by opioid addiction. Members of the Sackler family, who own Purdue, will relinquish control of the firm and contribute $4.5bn to the settlement. But nine states and Washington, DC, opposed the final deal and some will appeal against it. Their objections stem from a legal arrangement shielding parties associated with bankrupt companies from liability. Many people want it changed.
Bankruptcy comes with costs and benefits. The debtor must disclose all assets, which are distributed to creditors. But in return the debtor—in this case Purdue—is freed of legal liability. As a condition of their participation in the deal, the Sacklers sought and won immunity from civil lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic, without declaring bankruptcy themselves. The arrangement is known as a non-debtor release from liability (or a third-party release). It originated in the 1980s to protect insurers in bankruptcies arising from asbestos liability, and was codified by Congress as a protection in those cases. As a result of the settlement, the Sacklers (not all of whom were involved in the management of the company) will not relinquish most of their fortune, estimated at $11bn. Richard Sackler, Purdue’s former president and chairman, last month told a court that neither he nor his family nor the company is responsible for America’s opioid crisis.

Last year five members of the family paid $225m to settle civil charges brought by the federal government that they sold OxyContin while knowing it to be “unsafe, ineffective and medically unnecessary”. Lots of states and individuals would probably file similar suits if they could. But non-debtor release means that will no longer be possible, since the terms apply to all parties with a claim against the Sacklers, even if they did not participate in the deal or assent to it. Only a fraction of those who used OxyContin have filed claims related to their use of the drug: about 130,000. But the number of OxyContin users—all of whom were potential claimants—is probably at least ten times that, estimates Adam Levitin of Georgetown University Law Centre. They will get no piece of the settlement and no opportunity to sue the Sacklers for opioid-related claims.
The use of a non-debtor release has also been mooted in the reorganisation of two groups that filed for bankruptcy amid child-abuse lawsuits, the Boy Scouts of America and USA Gymnastics. For defendants in sprawling litigation, moving to a bankruptcy court and securing a non-debtor release is appealing: it binds absent parties, foreclosing future claims from victims who have not yet come forward. Some Democrats want to ban the arrangement, which they say has been expanded beyond its original intent. In July a group of senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, introduced a bill to close what they call a loophole used by “bad actors”.
In the case of Purdue, the settlement does at least mean that money will be disbursed. But those who had hoped the family would have to pay more will be disappointed. “The Sacklers negotiated how much money they would turn over, and it’s as little as they thought they could get away with,” says Lindsey Simon of the University of Georgia. The settlement will probably survive an appeal, bringing an unsatisfying legal resolution to a long chapter of a painful public-health crisis. For many, alas, the pain continues. ■",2
1829,"The IMF said that it now thinks the world economy shrank by 3.3% last year, less than it had feared, mainly because of the huge stimulus packages that propped up many economies and without which the contraction may have been three times as great. It increased its forecast for growth this year to 6%, as rich countries rebound from the pandemic with “smaller scars” than from the financial crisis of 2007-09. But the IMF warned that poorer countries, especially those that rely on informal work and tourism, will take longer to recover, leading to rising global inequality.
The new infrastructure spending plan unveiled by Joe Biden will fuel the American economy. Among the many commitments are $621bn on transport—such as roads, bridges, public transport, but also electric cars—$400bn for care homes and $100m for modernising the electric grid. Mr Biden’s plan faces a rockier road through Congress than the $1.9trn covid-relief package, as even some Democrats are questioning the additional burden on the national debt.

The White House wants to pay for all its extra spending mostly through higher corporate taxes, which it hopes will raise $2.5trn in revenue over 15 years. It will raise the domestic rate of tax and increase the levy on foreign profits. The administration is also pushing hard, through the OECD, for a global minimum corporate tax.
OPEC and Russia agreed to increase oil production gradually from May for three months. Saudi Arabia had resisted the move, arguing that prices are still volatile.
A grilling in the markets
Retail investors began buying and selling shares in Deliveroo, a week after the food-delivery company’s IPO was judged to have been a disaster; the stock lost a quarter of its value on the first day of trading in London. After an unappetising start, small investors looking for a slice of Deliveroo might eventually boost its share price.
Credit Suisse said it lost $4.7bn from its dealings with Archegos, a collapsed investment fund, a bigger amount than had been thought. The Swiss bank’s chief risk officer and head of investment banking are leaving; it is also cutting its dividend and suspending share buy-backs. Credit Suisse is still assessing the damage from its exposure to the implosion of Greensill, a financing firm.
A decade-long legal battle reached its conclusion when America’s Supreme Court ruled that Google had been legally entitled to use bits of Oracle’s Java code when it developed its Android platform. The decision found that application programming interfaces (APIs), which let developers access other code, are significantly different from other computer programs. The wider industry greeted the ruling with relief, since it appears to give legal sanction to a practice that is routine.
LG decided to pull out of the phone business and focus on connected devices for smart homes, components for electric vehicles and other products. The South Korean company was the fourth-biggest seller of mobile phones in 2005, but never broke through in smartphones.
Toshiba confirmed that it had received a buy-out offer, reportedly worth $20bn, from CVC, a private-equity firm. The Japanese conglomerate has been beset by accounting scandals and a disastrous acquisition. Shareholders recently forced it to set up an independent investigation into its alleged attempts at silencing activist investors.
It was a busy week for acquisitions involving Japanese companies, as Hitachi sealed a deal to buy GlobalLogic, a software-engineering company based in Silicon Valley, for $9.6bn. The Japanese industrial group said the takeover will quicken its transformation from being a supplier of hardware to a provider of digital solutions, which also involves selling off some subsidiaries such as its metals business.
Keeping it in the air
The French government said it would provide €4bn ($4.7bn) in additional funding to Air France to ease the troubled airline’s heavy debt load. The recapitalisation plan was signed off by Air France-KLM’s board; the Dutch government is still in discussions with the EU about similar measures for KLM. The French government, the group’s biggest investor, will increase its stake to just under 30%.
Hollywood breathed a sigh of relief upon the release of “Godzilla vs Kong”, a beast of a hit that raked in $48.5m over its first five days in America, the biggest box-office draw since the start of the covid crisis. That’s still some way behind cinema’s pre-pandemic golden age: “Sonic the Hedgehog” earned $164m over its opening weekend in February 2020. “Godzilla vs Kong” was simultaneously streamed on HBO Max, but fans still put their bums on cinema seats.",2
1830,"JUST UNDER one year has passed since Suga Yoshihide became Japan’s prime minister. It was enough time for him to lose the confidence of both the public and his colleagues in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). On September 3rd he bowed out of the LDP leadership race that will take place later this month; his replacement will immediately become prime minister. Despite his flailing approval ratings, Mr Suga’s decision caught allies and critics alike by surprise. It seems to have been precipitated by two crucial missteps in the past week—threats to reshuffle the LDP’s leadership and to dissolve the Diet ahead of schedule—that left him too isolated within the party to continue. His departure leaves the LDP leadership race—and, by extension, Japan’s political future—in flux.
The LDP will vote for a new president on September 29th. The winner will lead the party in lower-house elections that must be held by late November. A handful of potential contenders stand out. Kishida Fumio, a former foreign minister, had already declared his intention to run against Mr Suga. He has good relationships within the party, but limited popular support. Kono Taro, a former foreign and defence minister and the current vaccine czar, now seems likely to enter the race too. Mr Kono, who is American-educated, social-media savvy, and, at 58, on the younger side by Japanese standards, has long been a public favourite, but his reputation as a maverick puts off many in the LDP’s old guard.

Ishiba Shigeru, another former defence minister, may enter the fray as well. He too has sizable public support but little amongst colleagues, and has failed to break through in previous LDP elections. Seiko Noda and Takaichi Sanae, two former internal-affairs ministers, both hope to become Japan’s first female prime minister, but may struggle to secure the backing of 20 lawmakers that they need to run. Some whisper that Abe Shinzo, who preceded Mr Suga as prime minister, may mount another comeback, though that seems unlikely given lingering concerns about the scandals and health issues that begat his resignation last year.
None of the main candidates represents radical change in policy terms. All are staunch supporters of the alliance with America, and favour shoring up Japan’s own defences in the face of Chinese expansionism. No one will move to reverse the Bank of Japan’s loose monetary policy or to impose fiscal austerity. Yet there are subtle differences. Mr Kishida favours more fiscal stimulus and more support for the economically vulnerable than Mr Suga did; he has pledged a big economic stimulus package to counteract the pandemic. Mr Kono has taken some heterodox stances in the past, such as phasing out the use of nuclear power, and would probably put more political capital into Japan’s shift toward renewable energy in the pursuit of carbon neutrality. Mr Ishiba might focus more on measures to revive Japan’s rural regions. Ms Takaichi has positioned herself as a face of the party’s right wing, taking up the cause of revising Japan’s post-war constitution.
As ever when it comes to LDP politics, the contest hinges mostly on personalities and internal power games. The main fault lines this time are stylistic and generational. In many ways, the choice is shaping up to be one between a predictable, old-style party man, such as Mr Kishida, and a younger, more charismatic leader, such as Mr Kono. The outcome will depend on backroom wheeling-and-dealing and inter-factional horse-trading, but also on how worried the party leadership is about the looming Diet elections and how much influence younger backbenchers can exert. Before Mr Abe’s eight-year-long premiership, Japan had cycled through six prime ministers in six years (including Mr Abe’s own failed first term in 2007). There is a risk that Mr Suga’s resignation will precipitate a similar spell of turmoil at the top of Japanese politics. But it may also open the door to a new era. The only certainty is that Japan has entered a period of uncertainty.",2
1831,"IN 1991 AMERICAN audiences had an introduction to Xhosa, one of South Africa’s most click-filled languages, when Miriam Makeba (pictured) appeared on “The Cosby Show”. When the celebrated South African singer started flicking her tongue as she said her name, four-year-old Olivia asked, “Oh I’m sorry, do you have a cold?”
In most parts of the world the clicks of Zulu and Xhosa, the languages spoken most commonly at home in South Africa, sound completely foreign. Duolingo, the world’s biggest language-learning platform, is hoping to make them more familiar. Next year it will offer lessons in both to its 40m active users.

This poses new challenges. For the first time its course designers will have to figure out how to teach clicks in an app. There are three types: c (a ‘tsk tsk’ sound), x (the sound you’d make to get a horse to speed up) and q (a bit like the sound of a champagne cork popping). Recording native speakers and using audio lessons will be much like teaching sounds in any other language, says Myra Awodey of Duolingo. But it will also have to explain how one should thrash one’s tongue about to make the lateral (not to be confused with the alveolar or dental) click that so confounds people trying to say nothing more than “Xhosa”.
The firm says the courses will have a large potential audience, but migrants and refugees living in South Africa are a group that could particularly benefit. Elsewhere Duolingo has stumbled upon some unexpected uses of its app, such as a large number of people learning Swedish in Sweden. The reason, it found, was that migrants were trying to integrate into their new country. In South Africa there are more than 2.9m of them, including 500,000-1.5m from Zimbabwe.
Learning Zulu or Xhosa can help migrants blend in. Those coming to South Africa from elsewhere in Africa often face abuse if they stand out by not speaking an indigenous language. There is even a derogatory term for black migrants who speak their own languages, Makwerekwere, which supposedly mimics the “kwere kwere” sounds they make that grate on the ears of locals.
Speaking one of these languages has other perks, too. The two have many similarities, so that people who speak Zulu, say, can easily understand and talk with someone who speaks Xhosa or any of the other tongues in the same family, which includes Swati (spoken in Eswatini) and Ndebele (which is common in parts of Zimbabwe). Those who pick up Zulu or Xhosa can thus chatter with at least 40% of South Africans.
Ms Awodey says Duolingo has “a role to play in preserving and teaching endangered languages”. It may be a stretch to call Zulu or Xhosa endangered. But local non-profits and Trevor Noah, South Africa’s funniest export, have teamed up with the firm to bring them to its platform. The polyglottic Mr Noah has a particular interest in one. His Xhosa-speaking mother raised him using English, a fine language, but one that is exceedingly difficult to get a click out of.",2
1832,"VISITORS TO A big supermarket in America these days could be forgiven for feeling disoriented. From one angle, all-American consumerism is on full display, with throngs struggling to steer overflowing trolleys. Retail sales (excluding cars) rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.8% in August, compared with July, the fastest since March. Other images, though, look distinctly unAmerican. To their horror, some shoppers see empty shelves where their favourite brands of biscuits, detergents and loo roll typically sit—the result of supply-chain disruptions as outbreaks of the infectious Delta variant of covid-19 shut factories and ports around the world.
Unlike early in the pandemic, when shops were stripped bare by panic-buying, America’s consumers mostly have alternatives to pick from. But the shortages are a sign that things in the country’s $5.6trn retailing industry are not back to normal. If the supply shock weren’t enough, retailers must also deal with demand from shoppers once again keen to stroll the aisles rather than scroll through apps. Having survived the initial pandemic upheaval, shops are in the throes of another.

Start with the bottlenecks. Congestion in ports from China to California has pushed shipping rates to record highs. Domestic trucking costs are up, too, owing to a surge in online deliveries. This is less of a problem for premium goods like iPhones than for the cheaper wares peddled by big retailers, where shipping makes up a bigger slice of the list price. Walmart went so far as to charter vessels directly to ensure steady supplies.
Companies also face a shortage of labour. Depending on whom you ask, this is down to workers being spooked by Delta, spoilt by generous covid-era benefits or rethinking their lives and careers in the wake of the pandemic. Whatever the reason, the result is an absence of customer service at big stores. Helpers who normally direct shoppers to the right shelf are nowhere to be found. With many cash registers closed, long queues form at the few open ones. In-store placards that used to promote products now advertise vacancies.
In August Walgreens, a chain of chemists, said it would raise wages, matching a move earlier in the month by its main rival, CVS. Target raised wages earlier this year. Walmart has done so several times in the past 12 months. As with higher shipping costs, this puts pressure on margins. Additional expenses might be coming from the federally mandated covid-19 tests for employees who refuse to get vaccinated. This month the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which counts Target among its members, warned about insufficient domestic testing capacity to meet this requirement.

The shift back to bricks and mortar presents a second set of problems. E-commerce, which shot up from 11% of American retail sales before the pandemic to nearly 16% in the panicky second quarter of 2020, has fallen back to 13% of the total. Target’s comparable digital revenues grew by 10% year on year in the three months to June, down from a rate of nearly 200% the year before. Meanwhile, offline sales shot up by a third in the same period, to $1.4trn, handily outpacing e-commerce (see chart 1). Coresight Research, a firm of analysts, reckons that so far this year shop openings have exceeded closings (see chart 2). If the trend continues, it would be the first time since 2016 that America has added net new outlets.

The retailers’ investments in online capacity will not go to waste. Once seen as a costly mistake, Walmart’s $3.3bn takeover in 2016 of Jet.com gave America’s mightiest conventional retailer a platform on which it built a successful digital business. Some 3,000 of its 4,700 domestic stores now offer same-day deliveries. Similarly, Target’s $550m acquisition of Shipt, a same-day delivery platform, a year later formed the basis of an integrated technological network that now stretches from a data centre in India to its 2,000 or so stores in America.
Even Amazon recognises that the future is “omnichannel”, mixing digital and in-store experiences, and plans to expand its piddling physical footprint, maybe with a chain of department stores. Americans’ rediscovery of the pleasures of in-person shopping helps explain why the online giant no longer looks unstoppable; its share of American retail sales dipped from 7.8% in the first quarter to 7% in the subsequent one (though it is above its pre-pandemic level of under 6%). Target, Walmart and their peers stand to benefit more in the short run from renewed physical shopping than the beast of Bezosville. But a shopper stampede to outlets requires another reshuffling of resources, before the retailers’ foray into cyberspace has been completed.

Investors have faith that the biggest firms can withstand the pandemic aftershocks, as they did the original covid-quake. The combined market value of the three largest bricks-and-mortar generalists—Costco, Target and Walmart—has swelled to some $730bn, from $520bn or so at the start of the pandemic (see chart 3). In the past year Costco’s and Target’s share prices have outperformed that of Amazon by a factor of two and nearly four, respectively.
Beyond the big firms, which have more or less maintained their market shares in the pandemic, the picture is one of wreckage. As in many sectors, covid-19 has put struggling merchants out of their misery. Last year nearly 9,000 shops shut for good, while just over 3,000 opened, according to Coresight. Casualties include such venerable names as Neiman Marcus (a department store for the well-off) and JCPenney (one for everybody else). Targets and Walmarts may be abuzz with activity. Derelict malls marooned amid the cracked concrete of empty parking lots have replaced rustbelt factories as the poster children of creative destruction’s toll. ■

1833,"CLINICAL TRIALS are expensive, time-consuming and risky for those taking part. The hunt is therefore on for computer models good enough to replace warm bodies for at least the preliminary phases of trials. In a paper in Nature Communications, Alejandro Frangi of the University of Leeds, in Britain, and his colleagues have published the results of the most comprehensive such virtual trial yet attempted.
Dr Frangi and his team are investigating stent-like devices called intracranial flow diverters. These control the passage of blood through brain arteries and are often used to treat cerebral aneurysms—bulges that form in an arterial wall, in which blood then accumulates. If a cerebral aneurysm bursts, it causes a so-called haemorrhagic stroke, damaging surrounding tissue by engulfing it in blood. Inserting a flow diverter directs the bloodstream away from the aneurysm, permitting blood already within the bulge to stay in place and clot, thus blocking the aneurysm up.

The researchers’ experimental “subjects” were computer models derived from detailed three-dimensional scans of the brains of 82 volunteers with cerebral aneurysms. The team inserted software representations of flow diverters into these models and recorded the consequences for virtual blood flow through the virtual brains in question. They then compared their results with those from three trials of the procedure carried out in the real world in recent years. They confirmed what these real trials had found—that the flow diverters do indeed encourage clots to form in aneurysms—and they rated the stents’ effectiveness at this task as similarly good.
Besides confirming what was already known, Dr Frangi’s virtual trial also investigated previously untested phenomena. For example, past reports in the literature have suggested that for aneurysms near places where arteries fork into two branches, inserting a flow-diverter actually increases the risk of a second type of stroke, ischaemic strokes. But this has never been definitely proved.
Ischaemic strokes are a consequence of a vessel getting blocked. This stops blood flowing to the part of the brain distal to the blockage, which then dies. The virtual trials showed that the risk of an ischaemic stroke did indeed rise if a flow-diverter was fitted near an arterial fork. It also predicted that patients with higher than normal blood pressure were at even greater risk of such fork-related strokes—a finding that had not (and still has not yet) been shown in the real world.
Trial offer
Though it is hard to imagine virtual trials of this sort completely replacing real ones, they could certainly reduce their number by suggesting in advance which avenues are worth exploring. They might also reduce the need for animal trials—and might indeed be more effective than these if they proved better models of human physiology than the laboratory mice now popular for the purpose.
Virtual trials bring other advantages, too. One is that the same procedure can be tested over and over again in the same “patient”, but with different variables. The observation about blood pressure which emerged from Dr Frangi’s work was made this way. And procedures that would be hard to get past an ethics committee if proposed for trial on people can be tested first in a computer, so that only those reckoned most likely to work will need to undergo ethical scrutiny.
Preliminary virtual trials of this sort would also reduce the cost of real-world trials, which clock in at around $40,000 per patient. Regulators would clearly need persuading that virtual tests were reliable enough to yield appropriate data, but successful “hindcasting” of the sort Dr Frangi has just demonstrated will presumably help that happen. ■

1834,"IN 2015 ALEXIS SÁNCHEZ, a Chilean footballer, scored the decisive penalty in the Copa América final against 14-times winner Argentina, ending Chile’s 100-year dry spell in the tournament. Now Chilean officials hope he will give the country’s export market a similar boost. He is the face of a campaign launched in June by ProChile, a government agency. Arturo Clément, the president of SalmonChile, an industry body, hopes it will depict the country as a world-class exporter of sustainable fish.
Fish farming is supposed to provide cheap piscatorial protein while also relieving pressure on the oceans. But critics say its environmental virtues are overstated, because carnivorous farmed fish, such as salmon and trout, are given feed derived from wild fish. Globally much of the industry has become more sustainable over the past two decades, by putting salmon on a partially plant-based diet or reducing the use of antibiotics to treat their diseases.

Chile’s fish-farming industry still has a way to go. It uses more antibiotics than its competitors: for every tonne of salmon produced, fish are showered with an estimated 500g of bacteria-killing medicine, compared with hardly any at all in Norway. Chile lags in standards for the discharge of nutrients into waste water, which are around 15 times stricter in Europe, Australia and the United States. In 2016 two harmful algal blooms, caused in part by unusually high ocean temperatures, poisoned shellfish and killed millions of farmed salmon. Many accused producers of exacerbating the problem by dumping into the ocean 4,500 tonnes of rotting fish that died in the first bloom. A government report dismissed the possibility that the salmon industry fuelled the blooms, but an independent task-force said it was possible that rotting biomass had contributed.
The country’s environmental rules are a hangover from the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. The military junta wanted to diversify the country’s exports from copper; salmon farming was seen as a valuable way of doing so. It is now Chile’s second-biggest export. But fishing policies rarely took the environment into account. Over the past decade reforms have benefited fish producers rather than try to mitigate farming’s ecological impact, argues Beatriz Bustos at the University of Chile.
Some producers are trying to change. Between 2017 and 2019 antibiotic use declined by nearly a third. More than half of the 155 members of Chile’s constitutional assembly, elected this year to write a new constitution, want to boost environmental protections. This reflects a growing demand for greener policies. If the fish farmers do not mend their ways, they risk being regulated out of existence.■",2
1835,"Multiple federal agencies are looking into 15 vials - including five alarmingly labeled as 'smallpox' - that were discovered at a pharmaceutical lab outside of Philadelphia Tuesday night.
The vials, 10 of which were labeled 'vaccinia' after the virus used to make smallpox vaccines, were discovered by a lab worker who was cleaning out a freezer, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 with a successful mass vaccination campaign after it killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone.
Samples of the deadly virus are only supposed to be kept in two labs: the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Russia. 
The FBI and CDC are now investigating Tuesday's discovery.
The two agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. 
The finding was first reported by Yahoo News, which obtained a copy of an alert sent to the Department of Homeland Security labeled 'For Official Use Only.' 
It is not known how the vials ended up at the Merck facility in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania or if they really do contain the virus.
Smallpox is a serious, life-threatening illness causes by variola virus.
A person may not look or feel sick for 7 to 14 days after exposure, but initial symptoms include high fever, headaches, backaches, and vomiting.
Around a third of people who contract the disease, die. 
After the initial symptoms, a body-wide rash appears. The person is most contagious during this stage.
Rashes develop in the tongue, mouth and throat. They then spread to the face and arms, torso and legs.
Pus-filled bumps, also called pustules, form and begin to scab over and fall off over a period of about 10 days.
It was mostly spread by prolonged face-to-face due to respiratory particles. The virus was also spread by sharing sheets, towels and clothing.     
Source: Cleveland Clinic 
After they were discovered, the vials were secured immediately and the facility was put on a lockdown that was lifted by Wednesday night.
'Merck is in the process of figuring out why it was there,' the source told NBC10 on Wednesday 
Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com.
'There is no indication that anyone has been exposed to the small number of frozen vials,' a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo. 
'The frozen vials labeled 'Smallpox' were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker while cleaning out a freezer in a facility that conducts vaccine research in Pennsylvania.'
The discovery took place at the Merck Upper Gwynedd facility in North Wales, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, according to WCAU. 
'CDC, its Administration partners, and law enforcement are investigating the matter, and the vials' contents appear intact. The laboratory worker who discovered the vials was wearing gloves and a face mask. We will provide further details as they are available,' the spokesperson said. 
The incident is likely to renew questions about what should be done with the world's Smallpox samples, which are kept in only two labs in the world. 
Smallpox is an infection caused by the variola virus. Patients develop a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash, according to the CDC.  
Most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, meaning an outbreak could have devastating consequences.  
The vaccine leaves a dime-sized lesion that gradually forms a scab and leaves a scar, the CDC says. The lesion is contagious before the scab forms, and those who receive it have to protect the vaccination site from other parts of their body and other people.
In 2014, a government scientist cleaning out an old storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland - just outside of Washington, DC - found six decades-old glass vials containing freeze-dried smallpox, according to the Washington Post.
The samples were packed away and forgotten in a cardboard box. At the time, it was the first such discovery in the country. 
In 2019, an explosion at the state-owned Russian lab holding some of the samples sent one worker to the hospital, though the World Health Organization said the blast didn't occur near the stockpiles, according to NPR.  
Earlier this month, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates said the US and UK should invest 'tens of billions' in virus research, including how to possibly prevent smallpox attacks from being unleashed in places like airports, according to Yahoo News. 
'So along with the climate message and the ongoing fight against diseases of the poor, pandemic preparedness is something I'll be talking about a lot,' he said in an interview with British health policy official Jeremy Hunt.
The origin of smallpox is unknown, but the earliest written description of a similar virus appeared in China in the 4th century.
It has typically worked in outbreaks and was brought to North America by European settlers in the 17th century.
About a third of infected patients died. Those who survived were sometimes left with various scars or even blind.
The 'basis for vaccination' began in 1796 when English doctor Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had gotten cowpox were also protected from smallpox, according to the CDC.
In the 1800s, the virus used to make the smallpox vaccine changed from cowpox to vaccinia virus. (Five of the fifteen vials found in Philadelphia on Tuesday were labeled 'vaccinia.')
Before the vaccine, variolation was a common method of protection against the virus. People who had never had smallpox took material from pustules of infected people and scratched it into their arm or inhaled it through their nose to develop immunity. 
In 1948, the virus was infecting about 50 million people a year throughout the globe, according to the WHO. 
Experts estimate that the virus killed about 300 million people in the 20th century.
Soviet scientist Viktor Zhdanov proposed a four-year global vaccination campaign starting in 1959, and the campaign got a global boost aided by US funds in 1966 and 1967, with the Intensified Eradication Program.
'Laboratories in many countries where smallpox occurred regularly were able to produce more, higher-quality freeze-dried vaccine,' the CDC notes. 
'Other factors that played an important role in the success of the intensified efforts included the development of the bifurcated needle, the establishment of a case surveillance system, and mass vaccination campaigns.'
The last known naturally occurring case happened in 1977 in Somalia. The last natural US outbreak was in 1949. 
By 1980, the WHO declared the disease wiped out.
At this point, most Americans are not vaccinated against the disease and those who are probably have waning immunity, according to Yahoo News.

1836,"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub
IN THE SIMULTANEOUSLY global, parochial and precise view of the scientists of the Global Carbon Project (GCP), it was April 7th which marked peak lockdown. The parts of the world where there was some sort of confinement order in place on that day would normally have accounted for 89% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions, the highest such percentage of the whole pandemic: the day before, less of America was locked down; the day after, more of China had gone back to work. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted on that peak day was, the GCP calculates, 17% lower than 2019’s daily average.
That is a huge difference: more than 11m tonnes of carbon dioxide. It is also a small one. For years, environmentalists have been calling on people to change their lifestyles in order to protect the planet. In the face of covid-19, governments have made some of their strictures official policy. The world now knows what can be achieved by closing a vast number of shops, as well as offices and factories, and stopping a great many people from travelling: a reduction in emissions which, though striking, is not enough to fundamentally change things, gained at an enormous price in terms of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

The measures governments have taken against covid-19 are entirely unsuited to a campaign against climate change that has to last for decades, rather than days. But the financial muscle brought to bear and the willingness to use the full force of the state is nevertheless suggestive. Climate-minded academics, public intellectuals and think-tankers have worked themselves into a lather over the benefits which action on such a scale could provide if effects on climate were actually part of the remit.
As Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental think-tank, points out, government decisions guide about 70% of the world’s spending on energy. “In a very short period of time,” he says, “governments will make enormously consequential decisions.” Total stimulus spending will be in the trillions. If a decent fraction of that is earmarked for climate action, it could be world changing.
This idea is not new. Similar pleas were heard—from some of the same people—a decade ago, when policymakers were trying to get the world out of the slump brought on by the financial crisis of 2007-09. Roughly an eighth of the stimulus money disbursed by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)—some $90bn—went into clean-energy loans and investments.
This greenery is remembered in political circles mainly because the first loan issued under the scheme—for a meaty $535m—went to Solyndra, a company devoted to cylindrical solar cells which went bust soon afterwards. The overwhelming majority of its loans, though, were repaid. One of them helped to finance Tesla’s first car factory.
Defenders of those clean-energy investments argue that they drew in $150bn of private and non-federal investment in clean energy—2009 and 2012 proved to be bumper years in America’s wind-energy sector—and paved the way for great progress over the subsequent decade. They did not, though, have any prompt appreciable effect on the global emissions trajectory. That was dominated by China’s post-crisis stimulus, which relied on ramping up coal-fired power stations. If American emissions did not rise as fast as they might have, it had more to do with cheap natural gas from the fracking boom providing a profitable alternative to coal-fired electricity than to any effects of ARRA.
Whatever ARRA’s role in the matter, though, renewables did start to have an appreciable effect in later years. They helped global emissions plateau in 2014-16, and again in 2018-19, even as the economy expanded. Renewables are now often cheaper than fossil fuels in large parts of the world. This is one of the reasons why today’s calls for a green stimulus are not carbon copies of those made ten years ago. They have less stress on renewable-energy R and fewer calls for demonstration projects. There is more emphasis on deploying technologies for types of decarbonisation not easily achieved with electricity, and on energy-storage systems and greatly improved electric grids that will open the way to much needed further expansion of renewables.
In America, the precise details of what is on the stimulus menu seem immaterial; President Donald Trump’s administration is much more interested in helping coal and oil companies than it is the renewable sector. That said, a block of Republican senators from states with significant clean-energy industries—including wind farms of the sort that blossomed after the financial crisis—has convinced the Treasury to consider extending tax-incentive schemes for renewable developments which have been stalled by the response to the epidemic.
The fact that renewables now have lobbying power is one demonstration that things are different this time. Another is that politics have changed, too. The Paris agreement of 2015 required its signatories to develop plans for emissions reduction, and to stand ready to increase their ambition at another big UN summit, co-hosted by Britain and Italy, which was originally planned for this year but has now been deferred to 2021. Polling suggests that citizens would be happy to see them take that commitment seriously. In April Ipsos MORI asked people from 14 countries whether they thought climate change was as serious a threat as covid-19. The greatest assent was in China, where 87% agreed that it was; but even in America, where the assent was lowest, 59% agreed. Nearly two-thirds of respondents, including 57% of Americans, went on to say that it was important that government actions aimed at economic recovery prioritise action on climate change.
Gizza job
Green boosters have always been keen to claim that strong climate policies have the added advantage of producing copious jobs; the Obama administration credited clean-energy investments under ARRA with supporting 900,000 job-years of employment. In recent years of low unemployment such claims have come to seem somewhat beside the point. With joblessness now having bounced back above Great Depression levels in many places, green jobs have again become a selling point.
Some see mass unemployment not just as a symptom to assuage, but as a unique opportunity to get things done which, if everyone had a job, would be much harder. Such ideas fit with the growing need for large-scale infrastructure that gets the most out of private investments. With renewable energy growing fast, getting it to the places where it can do the most to edge out fossil fuels—for example, the batteries of electric vehicles—is an obvious next step. The British government is one of those considering rolling out a huge network of car-charging facilities.
Many economists might prefer to see governments simply provide incentives for endeavours they think worthwhile, leaving industry to meet those goals with whatever number of workers seems most efficient, rather than how many the government wants off the dole. This is particularly true given that much covid-related unemployment has fallen on the service sector; the jobs that need doing and the people who need jobs might be a poor fit.
Against that needs to be considered the problem of the “90% economy”. Some service-sector jobs will come back quite slowly, if at all. If governments incentivise, say, home insulation and offer training and certification, all sorts of local companies might provide the actual service, and they would be quite labour intensive.
In Pakistan the unemployed are being released from lockdown to work on a tree-planting programme that predates the crisis. The climate impact may not be that high; but refugees from service sectors around the world might rather enjoy similar opportunities, at least for a while. And they would not need all that much training. As Cameron Hepburn of the University of Oxford points out, you can go from pulling pints to planting pines pretty quickly. ■",2
1837,"SOMETIMES CHINA makes shrewd decisions. At other times it is capable of grave mistakes, even acts of wickedness. But the Chinese government is rarely silly. In particular, officials do not stake the prestige of their supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, on a whim. That makes it worth revisiting dismissive foreign reactions to a move that, though dry-looking, is important and revealing.
On September 16th China formally asked to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), an 11-nation trading block that is home to 500m consumers in Asia and the Americas. Though China’s timing was sudden, the move was predictable. Months ago Mr Xi said China would “favourably consider” applying. His word is law. But many foreign analysts (and in private, some foreign government officials) confidently predict that China will never be admitted.

Scepticism is understandable. In the name of market opening and fair competition, the CPTPP’s current members—Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam—agree to limit subsidies for large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), permit most cross-border flows of data and outlaw forced labour, among many other promises. If those standards seem hard for China to meet, given its statist, security-obsessed turn in recent years, that is no accident. The CPTPP is the orphaned offspring of an earlier, American-led agreement, the TPP. That was crafted by the Bush and Obama administrations with the aim of making Asia and the Pacific into a bastion of rules-based free trade, leaving China with the choice of reforming its model of state-dominated capitalism or remaining on the outside. Then came President Donald Trump, whose scorn for free trade and indeed rules led him to quit the TPP on his first full day in office. When Japan guided other founding members to forge a Trump-less alternative, the CPTPP, China spotted an opening.
Officials in Beijing have spent two years studying how hard it will be for China to join. Their conclusion is that China will find accession arduous, not least because of strained relations with existing members who have a veto, notably Australia, Canada and Japan. But they also reckoned that China would face still harsher scrutiny were America to be inside the CPTPP—a distant prospect currently, due to Biden administration pledges to put American workers ahead of corporate profits and expanded global trade.
China, in short, is serious. Its ambition is best explained by different forms of rising confidence, some more alarming than others. Start with a benign, cautious optimism among those sometimes called reformers. That camp once promoted economic liberalisation. In a China intently focused on political control, stability, security and self-reliance, reformers now find it safer to push for a more efficient state, not a smaller one. These scholars, technocratic officials and business types argue that China is so strong and technologically advanced that it gains, on balance, from removing barriers to trade and upholding common international rules, for instance to protect Chinese intellectual property. Such advocates of openness believe that China can compete in a free-trading world, but is not yet ready to write trade regulations on its own. They welcome a chance to help shape norms during negotiations such as the CPTPP-accession process, which they expect to take years. They hope that external pressure will overcome special interests at home, as happened when China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001. Given the consensus in official Beijing that America is bent on thwarting China’s rise, pressure from the CPTPP—a pact without America in it—is especially welcome. Wang Huiyao runs the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think-tank that champions CPTPP entry. China’s economy has grown 11-fold since admission to the WTO, he notes. It is “an easy sell” to call CPTPP a new chance to join a mini-WTO.
A different sort of confidence moves nationalists, including government leaders, who embrace the CPTPP. They do not just think China’s state-led system capable of competing in the world. They think it is manifestly superior. Nationalist-minded Chinese officials and scholars think that market forces bring desirable efficiencies, but their priority is stability, which they see as China’s secret weapon. As exhibit A they point to their strict, collective handling of the covid-19 pandemic, in contrast with grim death tolls in the freedom-obsessed West. Their gamble is that joining the CPTPP will increase foreign trade and impose useful disciplines, without undermining strong political control of the economy. They sense a historic chance to advance a cherished goal, namely to make the world respect China’s political system.
Sceptics about China’s chances assert that CPTPP rules ban subsidies and aid for state firms. In fact there are exemptions for local-government SOEs and those delivering unprofitable domestic services. In accession talks China may accept regulation of SOEs operating abroad in profitmaking commercial sectors, while insisting that state firms at home are needed to supply jobs, manage critical resources or maintain an orderly financial system. China’s ever-stricter rules about cross-border data flows will be harder to finesse, though public-order exemptions may help. China simply denies it has forced labour, daring trade partners to disbelieve it.
America vows to work with allies, then doesn’t
The biggest barrier to China’s entry is not this or that rule, but trust. A senior Japanese official expresses worry about China offering to write domestic laws that purport to comply with the CPTPP, but fall short. It would be easier to challenge such moves with America at the table, he sighs. Fears are justified. China has a free-trade pact with Australia, but is currently blocking many exports from that country, in an unofficial boycott imposed after Australian leaders called for a global probe into covid-19’s origins. Some CPTPP members think China is too big a bully to join. China’s bet is that, for a decisive number, it is too big to keep out.■",2

1839,"COUNTRIES HAVE to make revealing choices as they craft patriotic messages for children. To put it kindly, young minds are tiny treasure-houses that deserve to be stocked with only a nation’s most precious beliefs. To be more blunt, small children are easily distracted, so are best taught only a few important things.
It is therefore worth studying what China’s propaganda chiefs have in store for youngsters this summer. As usual, June 1st was marked this year in China as International Children’s Day, a festival of visits to museums, school picnics and wholesome games. A month later there will be a much larger event: celebrations on July 1st of the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding in 1921.

China’s leader, President Xi Jinping, is presented to the young as “Xi Dada”, or “Uncle Xi”, an austere but caring patriarch. Mr Xi stresses the importance of loyalty, which is why children’s choirs are busy performing such songs as “Me and My Country” and “Follow the Leadership of the Communist Party of China”. Party history is being used to inspire the masses. That explains reports of kindergarten pupils being dressed up in miniature combat fatigues and told to crawl on their bellies while clutching straw-wrapped “rations”, to re-enact Red Army supply runs. There is much talk of China entering a “new era” of prosperity, national strength and global influence. It is not hard, as a result, to find children’s drawings on public display, showing high-speed trains and space rockets adorned with Chinese flags. The young are urged to be proud of ancient glories too, as heirs to what they are told is the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.
This year’s Children’s Day saw the release of a new patriotic film made especially for children. It depicts the pre-teenage life of Zhou Enlai, who was China’s prime minister from 1949 until his death from cancer in 1976. This brilliant, disappointing man is a puzzle for historians. To this day, many Chinese revere Zhou as a moderate who tempered Mao’s worst excesses, especially during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Too often, alas, the record shows Zhou enabling Mao’s follies and failing to defend close allies from political attack. Born in 1898 into a once-grand family of scholar-officials, Zhou was a precocious student of the classics. But his childhood was blighted by the deaths of his mother and adoptive mother and by money woes that, at the age of 12, forced him to leave his birthplace, Huai’an, in the plains between the Yellow and Yangzi rivers, to seek a new life with an uncle in the north.
During the first decades of Communist rule, his privileged class background had to be explained away. A biography published in 1977, “The Early Life of Zhou Enlai” by Hu Hua, depicts Zhou as a “rebel against feudal society”, who as a boy came to hate the gentry class into which he was born. Deepening poverty turned him into a “great proletarian revolutionary”, it relates. That official history manages to praise Zhou’s traditional education while reflecting the party’s then-noisy disdain for pre-Communist codes of ethics, such as those taught by Confucius. Describing Zhou poring over books from his grandfather’s library, Hu asserts that the boy was stirred by histories of “laudable national heroes” fighting foreign invaders, but was uninterested in Confucianism.
Biographies written in the 1990s by historians in the West, including Chae-Jin Lee, Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgen, take a different view. They find that Zhou had a conventional Confucian education, which marked him for life. Nor do they agree that he was an angry rebel, noting his later, loving praise for his two mothers. Both were educated, tradition-minded daughters of scholar-officials. Indeed, they link Zhou’s survival at Mao’s side to a reverence for Confucian teachings about self-restraint and the need for officials to swallow small insults in the national interest.
The new film appears to agree. Chaguan watched “Zhou Enlai in his Childhood” on Children’s Day in a cinema in Huai’an. The movie does not hide Zhou’s ancestral wealth. It portrays him as a solemn little boy in a silk gown, visiting relatives in antique-filled mansions. Confucian customs are shown as expressions of love. The young Zhou kowtows to his elders and studies cobwebbed texts to make his dying mother proud. His adoptive mother teaches him to swallow an unjust punishment with tales of an ancient general who endured humiliations on his way to greatness.
The film is not fast-paced. There is much fidgeting in the cinema, though children perk up at a brief shot of a boy’s bare bottom, and again when Zhou urges his adoptive mother to drink ink as a medicine. The Zhou family’s struggles to afford a middle-class life are crafted to resonate with older cinema-goers. Zhou’s father, a petty official in another town, is depicted as a migrant worker—largely absent, always fretting about money, and emotionally distant from his own son. The film shows health crises that wreck family finances and trigger rows about whether to spend money on medicine or school fees. Such dilemmas remain common today. The film’s ending unites all ages. Over swelling chords, young Zhou waxes indignant on learning that Russia and Japan have taken territory from the ailing Chinese empire, then declares that he studies hard so that China may rise. That phrase of Zhou’s is taught in schools to this day, and triggers murmurs of recognition.
Nationalism instead of class struggle
After the film, a mother in the audience, Lu Ye, calls it “very educational” to see the orphaned Zhou confront debt-collectors, endure hardships and assume responsibilities beyond his years. Ms Lu’s 12-year-old son, Rongye, says that he “really liked” the film. He praises an episode in which Zhou picked and sold wild vegetables to help repay those debts, until his hands bled. “For the welfare of the family, he didn’t care,” Rongye notes approvingly.
The film-makers say that their aim is to promote education and family harmony. China is a deeply conservative place, even as it prepares to celebrate its revolutionary past. Chinese children, told constantly to be diligent and obedient, sensed that all along. ■",2

1841,"The United Kingdom on Saturday recorded 40,941 daily COVID-19 cases, a decrease of seven percent on last week's cases, government data showed.
The figures also showed 150 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test - versus 157 seven days earlier - bringing the country's total deaths to 143,866.
Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 168,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. 
Release of the figures came after a SAGE adviser moved to reassure Britons the UK will not see a spike in Covid-19 cases like Austria and Germany.
But Professor John Edmunds said that opposition to stringent restrictions on the continent have demonstrated the importance of booster jabs, warning, 'it is pretty clear immunity does wane'.
'What you see now in central Europe with these rapid increase in cases, you see the importance of vaccination,' Mr Edmunds told Sky.
He added: 'Frankly here in the UK, we've had high rates of infection for many months now so we're in a slightly different position to Austria and Germany and so on.
'I don't think things will quite happen in the same way here as they have done there. But it is a warning to us. I think it's pretty clear that immunity does wane.
'I'm sure you do still have some protection from the vaccine but it's nowhere near as strong as shortly after you've been vaccinated. It's very clear the booster doses do give a very clear boost to your immune system.'
Asked whether the Government should re-introduce control measures, Mr Edmunds told Sky: 'The plan B measures, we could've implemented them at any point. It's a government decision whether to take that step.
'They have to look at the potential effectiveness and measure that against the potential cost of some of those things.' 
This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was 'very worried' about the spread of Covid-19 within Europe as the continent battles a fresh wave of infections.
Regional director Dr Hans Kluge told the BBC that some 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March unless urgent action is taken.
But Mr Edmunds said the UK was unlikely to be hit by the Christmas chaos because the country 'is in a slightly different position'. 
The British Government has repeatedly rejected pleas to implement its Plan B, which would see similar measures to what are being levied on Ireland. But Boris Johnson has admitted a full-blown lockdown could still be on the cards if cases spike.
This comes amid a fresh wave of Covid infections on the continent that has sent nations back into draconian restrictions and could see excess deaths start to rise again.
Italy is considering a lockdown of the unvaccinated, it emerged yesterday, which would make it the latest country to impose the controversial intervention after Austria announced lockdown would return on Monday.
And Germany's incoming government has said that it wants unvaccinated people to be barred from going to work and travelling on public transport amid what Angela Merkel calls 'dramatic' infection levels. The Netherlands has also introduced a 7pm curfew for pubs and restaurants amid rising cases there.
Both Austria and the Czech Republic have announced the return of lockdowns from Monday, with Germany poised to follow suit after health officials warned they cannot rule out a full shutdown.
Meanwhile, Slovakia intends to bring in harsher restrictions if its current lockdown of unvaccinated people does not curb the rise in cases.
The reintroduction of restrictions across Europe have sparked a fierce backlash and fevered protests broke out in cities including Rotterdam overnight, where riot police fired warning shots - injuring protestors marching against the Covid measures.
Today, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Vienna with the far-right opposition Freedom Party among those who have called for the protest and vowed to combat the new restrictions.
Demonstrations against virus measures are also expected in other European countries including Switzerland, Croatia and Italy.  ",-2
1842,"IT IS AN Instagram account to inspire envy. In one picture Ramon Abbas, a Nigerian who calls himself “Hushpuppi”, is leaning against a white Rolls-Royce. In another the Roller is purple. Lest his 2.5m followers think he is partial only to palatial British cars, other posts show him with a red Ferrari and sporting a red Chanel handbag or lounging in a private jet (pictured above).
Nowhere on Hushpuppi’s feed is there a picture showing him in handcuffs being led away by police in Dubai. Nor of the $40m in cash that they seized in raids on several apartments there before handing him over to America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to face charges of money-laundering and cybercrimes.

Few were surprised when they learned that Hushpuppi had pleaded guilty in April. But Nigerians were stunned on July 28th when court documents were unsealed implicating their most famous cop, Abba Kyari, who is known for tracking down and locking up kidnappers, of whom Nigeria has far too many. Mr Kyari is now himself wanted by the law, oddly enough for locking up one of Hushpuppi’s accomplices. In this case, though, it was not sleuthing that got Mr Kyari his man. The indictment alleges that Hushpuppi promised to pay him for the arrest.
The plot began, according to the indictment, with a wheeze to swindle $1.1m out of a businessman who wanted a loan to build a school in Qatar, by impersonating bankers and setting up a fake bank website. Of the money raked in, $230,000 was spent on a watch that was hand-delivered to Hushpuppi in Dubai.
But then the thieves fell out over the size of the cut going to Kelly Chibuzo Vincent, whose job it had been to set up the fake bank website. Feeling cheated, Mr Vincent called the businessman and told him of the scam. Hushpuppi, furious, allegedly offered the Nigerian detective money to arrest Mr Vincent and give him the “beating of his life”. Job done, Mr Kyari, a deputy commissioner of police, took photos of the arrested man and sent them as proof—along with details of a bank account into which payment could be made.
Mr Kyari insists he is innocent and said he arrested Mr Vincent only because he had threatened to kill members of Hushpuppi’s family in Nigeria. He denies accepting money. But an affidavit submitted by the FBI, backed up by messages between cop and fraudster, showed that Mr Kyari was told to hold Vincent until the scam was completed and that he had asked for a cut of the profits. Mr Kyari allegedly received some $20,000 for his role.
Unusually for an organisation that often overlooks wrongdoing by its officers, Nigeria’s police force has suspended Mr Kyari and opened an investigation. Nigerians gripe that cops are more likely to try to extort money from them than to respond to distress calls. In 2005 a former police chief, Tafa Balogun, pleaded guilty to money-laundering and was made to forfeit 16bn naira ($120m), several houses and a “jeep farm” with hundreds of pricey cars. Shortly after the seizures the recovered loot vanished and the houses and cars were auctioned off for peanuts to cronies, prompting parliamentarians to demand that Mike Okiro, Mr Balogun’s successor, account for the looted loot.
Mr Kyari’s indictment may not be the biggest scandal to hit the police. But it is demoralising for the public. His heroics in battling kidnappers had earned him a presidential medal of courage and made him unusually popular for a policeman. His fall would be a blow to the many who saw him as proof that a cop can rise to the top by working hard and staying clean. Perhaps he may have been too good to be true. ■",2
1843,"LONDON/MILAN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Italy on Sunday ended talks with UniCredit (CRDI.MI) over the sale of Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) (BMPS.MI) in a major setback to years-long efforts by the Rome government to return the ailing Tuscan bank to private hands.
Failure to bridge a multi-billion euro valuation gap between the parties leaves Italy unable to complete the restructuring of its banking system which it started six years ago.
The announcement confirmed what Reuters had exclusively reported from sources on Saturday.  read more 
Rome will now seek an extension of deadlines agreed with European Union authorities to re-privatise MPS and a Treasury official said it did not expect discussions to be difficult.
The Treasury will do its part to recapitalise MPS and plans to go ahead with the measures to improve the balance sheet which it had offered to UniCredit after MPS emerged as the most vulnerable euro zone lender in this summer's health check of the sector.
""The postponement will be accompanied by managerial measures that will strengthen the bank,"" the official said.
""European authorities are fully aware that we have seriously tried to conclude a transaction at market terms within the end of the year, and that this has not been possible, because the proposal we have received is not acceptable,"" he added.
Italy had started working towards re-privatising MPS not long after rescuing it in 2017 for 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion), proceeding as a first step to rid of most of its remaining soured debts.
Rome saw a merger with a stronger peer as the best way to fix the country's biggest banking woes and had singled out UniCredit after rival heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) pushed its market share to antitrust limits with last year's UBI takeover.
""Despite the effort from both sides ... the negotiations pertaining to the potential acquisition of a defined perimeter of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena will no longer continue,"" UniCredit and the Treasury said in a joint statement.
The news is likely to rock shares in the two banks on Monday and hit in particular MPS' riskier debt, which has suffered in recent months due to worries MPS' junior bondholders will be called to bear losses under European Union rules on state aid for banks if Italy puts more taxpayer money into MPS.
Early discussions to cut the state's 64% stake in MPS through a deal with UniCredit started more than a year ago, but the ousting of CEO Jean Pierre Mustier brought them to an abrupt halt.
In agreeing to enter exclusive talks with the Treasury in July, new UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel demanded the deal targeted only parts of MPS, in addition to being neutral for UniCredit's capital and offering a 10% earnings boost.
The Treasury calculated the assets selected by UniCredit had a market value of between 3.6 billion and 4.8 billion euros given 600 million euros in annual net income, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
That opened a yawning gap with UniCredit's 1.3 billion euro valuation of the same assets, the source added. UniCredit declined to comment.
The Treasury also opposed accounting adjustments UniCredit had factored into its 6.3 billion euro capital request on the basis of its own more conservative risk models, sources have said.
With the parties at odds also over the assets to be sold and the Treasury pushing UniCredit to take on MPS units it did not want, Rome concluded a merger was too costly an alternative for taxpayers.
MPS has plans to raise 2.5 billion euros in capital if it failed to find a buyer and the Treasury official said the government was ready to do its part on the basis of ""a credible business plan"".
Italy is likely to overhaul MPS' leadership to deliver the scheme devised as part of the UniCredi deal, which would see the bank's remaining soured loans transferred to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO and its legal risks carved out and guaranteed by the state, this source said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), which is yet to see a standalone plan according to a source close to the matter, has no immediate concern over MPS' capital position.

1845,"THEY RAN from safe house to safe house across Kabul, dodging Taliban gunmen. When given the green light over WhatsApp, the women rushed to one of the gates manned by American soldiers at Kabul’s international airport. In Washington, Meighan Stone of the Council on Foreign Relations and other volunteers passed their information to the State Department, in the hope that the women are on the list for one of the flights that day. At the airport perimeter the women navigated Taliban checkpoints, stampeding crowds and sporadic gunfire. As they headed to the gate, praying it remains open, the volunteers corresponded with officials to make sure soldiers on the ground could identify the refugees. They are the lucky ones. For thousands of other vulnerable Afghans spread across the country, even taking the road to Kabul is dangerous.
After a chaotic start the operation to remove US citizens greatly improved, though it remains perilous, as the explosions outside the airport on August 26th, in which at least 13 American troops and 60 Afghans were killed, confirmed. But the abandonment of Afghans who worked with American forces was both swift and a long time in the making. Many are eligible for the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV). Reforms by Congress in 2009 mandated a nine-month process, but the paperwork took applicants around three years. Almost 2,000 were brought to America in the two weeks before the fall of Kabul, while 71,000 applicants and their family members waited in the growing backlog. There may be up to 80,000 Afghans eligible for these visas across Afghanistan. Congress, long frustrated by the administration’s glacial pace, passed a bill in July to accelerate the process. But for now, boarding a flight still requires visa papers or an American passport.

The State Department created a Priority 2 (P-2) designation in early August for Afghans who had worked with American forces or on American projects but are ineligible for the SIV programme. They, along with P-1 refugees, who must be referred by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, an American embassy or certain NGOs, are at the mercy of the limited charter flights and an unforgiving bureaucracy. American citizens, permanent residents and SIVs have priority. But rather than risk capture by Taliban fighters, who say Afghans will no longer be allowed access to the airport, many refugees have opted instead to attempt the dangerous crossing into neighbouring Iran, Pakistan or Tajikistan.
The president could circumvent these logistical hurdles, but has refrained from doing so. Mike Waltz, a Republican congressman and a former Green Beret who served in Afghanistan, points out that President Gerald Ford granted humanitarian parole for Vietnamese refugees leaving crumbling South Vietnam in 1975, and cajoled Congress into funding the operation. This allowed American forces to bring more than 100,000 refugees to Guam before granting visas.
In addition to presidential haste and bureaucratic coldness, Afghans who worked with America may be victims of an electoral calculation. The administration is frequently attacked as soft on immigration. Tucker Carlson, a TV host, and Stephen Miller, an adviser to President Donald Trump, have warned of the supposed threat posed by Afghan refugees.
In the absence of help from the federal bureaucracy, a volunteer army of hundreds of former American diplomats, aid workers and veterans has sprung up over email chains and Signal threads to pool funds for charter planes and pass along vital information. Many feel an obligation to Afghans they worked with during the 20-year war. One group of veterans, Allied Airlift 21, provides logistical support to Afghan SIV applicants and their families. As the sun sets in Washington and rises in Kabul, the veterans start their watch, constantly communicating with refugees and trying to guide them to safety.
Almost 20,000 people were evacuated on the best day, according to the Pentagon. But America is struggling to keep the airfield secure and find third countries to host Afghans while their visas are processed. The retreat is meant to end on August 31st, by which date Mr Biden has promised to get every US citizen out. The State Department reckons a thousand may still be in Afghanistan. Mr Waltz says many more Afghan allies will be left behind: “We’re handing them a death sentence when the last American soldier leaves.” ■

1846,"BEFORE THE pandemic, Celso Vigo walked for 90 minutes each day through the streets of Serrana, a town of 45,000 people surrounded by sugarcane fields in the state of São Paulo. But when covid-19 hit, the 75-year-old retired bank clerk, who played football “well into my 60s”, was reduced to doing loops around his house. It reminded him of how Brazil, too, was going in circles. After a second wave killed 87,000 people in April, cases and deaths remain high.
But Serrana was given a way out. Between February and April, all adults were offered jabs as part of a study by the Butantan Institute, which produces CoronaVac, a vaccine developed by Sinovac, a Chinese firm. More than 95% of serranenses got jabbed, despite Jair Bolsonaro, the president, claiming that it was unsafe. Preliminary results released on May 31st showed that symptomatic cases and deaths fell by 80% and 95%, respectively. Only two covid-19 patients remain hospitalised in the local clinic (both refused the vaccine). Mr Vigo is once again pounding the pavements.


Serrana is a tantalising glimpse of an alternative reality in Brazil—one in which Mr Bolsonaro did not squander his chances to mount an effective public-health campaign and, later, to buy vaccines. But the study also has global implications. In phase three trials, CoronaVac had efficacy rates as low as 50%, the minimum required by the WHO. The lower the efficacy, the higher the share of people who must be jabbed to slow contagion. The trial in Serrana sought to discover that share. The town was split into four cohorts, that got jabbed in successive weeks. Contagion dropped dramatically after three out of the four had received two doses of the vaccine, suggesting that herd immunity is attained at around 75%.
These results could boost vaccine uptake across Brazil, hopes Ethel Maciel, an epidemiologist. But 75% is a long way off. Only 11% of Brazilians are fully vaccinated, and the rate has slowed because of a shortage of ingredients for CoronaVac, which are imported from China. Chile, which has vaccinated 45% of its population, mostly with CoronaVac, is also suffering near-record cases.

But Serrana itself has become an oasis. On a recent morning, children ran round a fountain in the plaza. Across the street a fabric shop that caters to elderly women had a steady stream of customers. A gang of old men occupied their usual benches. They discussed Mr Bolsonaro’s decision to host the Copa América, a football tournament, even though a third wave seems imminent. “Stupid,” a 97-year-old said. Half of them scattered when an outsider showed up. “We’re still scared,” explained Florivaldo Leandro, a retired police officer. Serrana’s calm came at a cost, he said. “We lost friends, neighbours and relatives. Our conscientiousness was forced upon us.”

IN MARCH, WHEN Britain went into lockdown for the first time, Andrew Davidson, a 69-year-old retiree who lives alone, was in the middle of renovating his house in the small town of Leamington Spa. The kitchen was a building site so he accepted an offer from his sister to move in with her and her husband in Birmingham for a couple of weeks. Before leaving he asked the builder to put in temporary kitchen surfaces so he could move back in if they couldn’t stand living together. Mr Davidson ended up staying away for nine weeks. It was “absolutely brilliant”, he says.
In the mornings he would go for a walk with his sister or brother-in-law, or they would do gardening. In the afternoons they retreated to their own spaces to work on their own hobbies: German lessons via Zoom, Spanish study, and textile printing. They ate dinner together, sharing cooking and all-important baking duties. “Living together was a bit of a revelation,” says Mr Davidson. “I was quite sorry to move out.” He says after his experience he would consider moving in with other people on a permanent basis in the future.

As lockdowns have limited socialising beyond cohabitants or small groups known as “pods” or “bubbles”, stories abound of people moving in with others to lessen isolation or share housework. In fact, the pandemic may merely have accelerated an existing trend. More and more, people in the rich world are once again choosing to live together.
In Britain households where couples share with at least one other adult were the fastest-growing type in the two decades to 2019. In Canada 6% of the population lived in multigenerational households by 2016, and it was the fastest-growing type of living. By the same year a fifth of Australia’s 24.5m people were living with others from outside their immediate family, a 42% increase on 15 years earlier.

Such enthusiasm runs counter to Western notions of individual freedom and privacy. Fights with family or flatmates are the stuff of common lore. But it is single-family households that are the outlier in the broad sweep of human history. From hunter-gatherers to workhouses, people lived in big groups, often including non-relatives, pooling resources such as food and sharing tasks such as cooking and child care. It is only after industrialisation, when work moved outside the home, that people in the Western world started to live in nuclear families.
In much of the world living in bigger family groups never stopped. Almost two thirds of households are extended family ones in Senegal, for example. Extended families provide a safety net where the state does not, pooling cash to pay medical bills and letting jobless nephews eat from the communal pot. Even in the West, the perception that the two-adults-two-kids family is the norm is outdated. In America the share of households made up of married couples with children halved between 1970 and 2019. People are marrying less and later. Marriages are less likely than they were to last until death.
Yet the splitting of the nuclear family has taken its time to create an explosion of new household types. Instead, much of the West has seen a dramatic rise in single-person households. From France to Japan, they make up over a third of the total number. In Germany they account for 40% of the total, in Finland 41%. Communal living, at least beyond student halls, retirement villages or monasteries, is “often seen negatively or as a cult”, says Irene Pereyra, a designer who is running a project on communal living with IKEA, a Swedish furniture firm.
Indeed, that is the appeal to some people. David and Kim Gotterson, an Australian couple in their 60s who lived for many years in communes, said they were rebelling against the materialistic society of their post-war-generation parents. “We wanted a pure, more natural way to live,” says Mr Gotterson. Environmentalists note that sharing homes is friendlier on the environment than having separate ones. Since the 1970s some feminists have emphasised the benefits for women of living with other women.
Communal infiltration
Although some choose to share out of belief, recent interest in shared housing has been sparked in large part by economic pressure. In Britain, where NIMBYism makes it extremely difficult to build new homes, the average house costs more than eight times the average salary, up from four times in the mid-1990s. Homes are less affordable for single women, who earn less than men. The number of older divorcees who live alone has gone up. In the absence of new construction, this squeezes the supply for younger people, who are less wealthy. “As more people lose their jobs [because of the pandemic] or have their pay or their hours cut, sharing a household with more people is a way to pay the bills,” says Bella DePaulo of the University of California, Santa Barbara, the author of “How We Live Now”.
Companies have jumped on this opportunity. The Collective, a British outfit, runs three co-living buildings, one in New York and two in London. Its “members”, whose average tenancy is nine months, live in studio flats but share lounges, gyms and a roster of events from cocktail-mixing to running clubs. The firm has another 9,000 units in development.
Although urban buildings run by the likes of The Collective are aimed mainly at young, single professionals, the types of people seeking to live this way are growing more diverse. The Collective houses people aged 18 to 67 years old (the average is 30). A survey by Build Asset Management, a British firm that runs serviced accommodation, said that in the year to June 2020 it saw a 136% rise in inquiries about shared rental accommodation from couples. Kin, an American company, last year opened two buildings in New York designed for families rather than singles or couples. Would-be residents can choose an apartment with up to four bedrooms and access to communal facilities and services, including a play area and nannies.
The most experimental housing today involves multiple generations of unrelated people who did not get a say on whom they lived with. Perhaps unsurprisingly it is found in Scandinavia. Some 60% of the residents of the 51 apartments in Sällbo, a public-housing project in the Swedish town of Helsingborg, are over 70. The other 40% are young people, half of them refugees. Residents must pass an interview to get into the community, and sign a contract to spend two hours per week socialising with neighbours. This could mean sitting in a shared lounge reading a book or doing shopping for one of the older members. The project is to run for two years. If it is judged successful, tenants will be given permanent homes.
Crossing multigenerational boundaries has social benefits, says Dragana Curovic, the manager. The young, especially the newcomers, learn from the older people, who in turn appreciate the young people’s help with practical things, she says. Isolation is unhealthy. One metastudy reported that people without strong social connections have a 50% higher chance of dying early—equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. A Swedish study of people over 75 years old found those with a variety of happy connections with friends and family had a lower risk of dementia.
Many other aspects of life can benefit from communal housing, too. Parents of small children find it easier to go out to work if they can leave their offspring at home with other friendly adults. Chloe and Alex Wolff, a couple in their 30s, and their baby son moved in with Alex’s parents for seven months from March to September. Ms Wolff says she would not have been able to go back to work six months after giving birth, had she not been living with her in-laws. At that point all the nearby nurseries were shut because of covid-19.

Ben Brock-Johnson, a 40-year-old journalist, moved from New York to live in Pioneer Valley, a community of 32 homes in rural Massachusetts, with his wife and their now five-year-old twins. The community has shared gardens, as well as a large communal dining area and an events space. He says it is “like having 100 parents for your kids”. There are people around—including his parents, who live on the same estate—who can play with them, baby-sit them and just generally look out for them. His family, he reckons, have a much better work-life balance for it.
The disadvantages of sharing can be mitigated by design. Grace Kim, a Seattle-based architect who lives with eight other families in a building designed by her and her husband, says her development balances community and privacy—most people’s concern about living communally. “You can see into some people’s kitchens but not their living rooms,” she says.
Decision-making can be slow. You have to work with neighbours even if you do not like them. You cannot simply ignore them. However, as in the workplace, people who have to get things done together often put aside their differences and get on with the job. Communal living might, conceivably, help bring divided societies together, at least a little.
Fallout shelter
Few governments promote it, though. Landlords in Britain need a special licence to let single homes to multiple families. In New York individually rented apartments with shared bathrooms are banned (to discourage brothels). During the pandemic governments have warned of the dangers of big households: sociable youngsters may bring the virus home to their grandparents. Multigenerational living may partly explain why ethnic minorities have been so hard-hit by covid-19 in Britain.
Proponents of communal living say it has made lockdowns more bearable. Ms Kim’s community stopped having 40-person communal meals. Instead, it set up pods of two to three families who could dine in well-ventilated shared spaces. In Sällbo, younger residents have gone out to shop for older ones who are shielding, says Ms Curovic. Lisa Feardon, a doctor who worked long, arduous shifts, says returning to her home at The Collective in London was “a lifesaver”. In a normal rented flat she would have “just come home and collapsed doing nothing,” she says. “But as everything is under one roof here I was able to still have some sort of work-life balance.”
Mr Davidson, whose house is now renovated, says while the pandemic continues he will be staying at his sister’s a couple of nights each week (in a support bubble). The pandemic has forced people apart. But for an increasing number, communal living offers a way to stay connected. ■",2
1848,"LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates will require all gold refineries to undergo annual audits to ensure their suppliers are responsible, it told Reuters, in an effort to combat illicit trading.
Industry figures said this should raise standards in the UAE, one of the world's biggest bullion trade hubs, but may also shift flows of gold linked to crime or human rights abuses to other countries, for example in Africa, where the number of gold refineries is growing rapidly.
A Reuters investigation in 2019 found that UAE took in gold worth billions of dollars smuggled from Africa, some of it mined in grim and polluting conditions and countries in conflict.
Organisations including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental anti-money laundering monitor, are pressing the country to tighten rules and enforcement. UAE has said doing so is a national priority.
UAE's Economy Ministry told Reuters a UAE Good Delivery Standard would require refiners to properly scrutinize suppliers and prove to outside auditors they have done so.
""All gold refiners will be required to adhere to the responsible sourcing obligations,"" it said. ""The UAE Good Delivery Standard will also require annual compliance audits.""
The ministry said its goal was to bring the whole industry in line with responsible sourcing standards. It declined to comment further before an announcement at a precious metals industry conference in Dubai later this month.
CORE TO ECONOMY
Millions of people work in small scale gold mines that can be brutal on workers and leak toxic chemicals. The metal is often used to finance crime, conflict and terrorism.
The FATF last month placed Turkey on its ""grey list"" -- potentially eroding foreign investment -- due in part to ""serious issues of supervision"" in its gold trade.
Last year, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which runs the biggest responsible sourcing accreditation scheme for refineries, said it could stop refiners it certifies from taking gold from countries with inadequate controls.
UAE said it had taken numerous measures to combat illicit trading, including requirements for firms to register with anti-money laundering authorities and declare large cash transactions.
""The gold and precious metals industry is core to our economy,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi, who chairs a committee overseeing the gold trade, said in a statement to Reuters.
The good delivery standard ""will further strengthen the UAE's AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism) framework, which is a critical national priority and a central focus of the UAE leadership,"" Al Zeyoudi said.
SQUEEZING A BALLOON
UAE said its standard was an extension of the Dubai Good Delivery Standard, a voluntary accreditation scheme run by the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a UAE free trade zone.
DMCC accredits two of UAE's more than 10 refiners, requiring responsible sourcing policies and audits. Most UAE gold refiners and dealers lack accreditation or outside scrutiny of how and where they get their gold.
""This is the most significant thing the UAE government have done (to stop unethical trade),"" said Tyler Gillard, who advises governments and companies on responsible sourcing at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
But illicit trading will not disappear, he said. ""It's like squeezing a balloon ... there's still enough gaps and opportunities in other countries for gold to enter the market.""
Most countries do not require sourcing audits. Dozens of refineries are operating or under construction in sub-Saharan Africa, and India, a big importer of gold from small-scale mines, has many refiners not subject to scrutiny.",3
1849,"SHORTLY BEFORE Ángel Hernández handed his wife the glass of barbiturates that would kill her, he asked her once again if she wanted to die. “The sooner the better,” she replied. Ravaged as María José Carrasco’s body was by multiple sclerosis, she struggled to swallow the poison. In the end she forced it down through a straw.
Ms Carrasco’s death in 2019 provoked a media storm in Spain. In Madrid the investigating judge initially referred the case to a court that specialises in violence against women. The prosecutor pushed for Mr Hernández, then 70, to serve six months in prison. But on June 25th Spain enacted a law allowing those with a “serious or incurable illness” or a “chronic or incapacitating” condition to seek help to end their own lives. Twelve days later, Mr Hernández was acquitted.

In much of the West public opinion has long been in favour of assisted dying. In 2002 60% of Spaniards supported voluntary euthanasia, a share which had risen to 71% in 2019. Writ large, secularisation and increasingly liberal values have solidified support. But so has personal experience, particularly that of baby-boomers who, having witnessed the suffering of their parents, are fighting for the right to deaths of their own choosing.

Change has been rapid. Assisted dying is now legal or decriminalised in at least a dozen countries, with legislation or court challenges pending in many others. On November 5th Portugal's parliament approved a revised bill which would allow those with “grave, incurable and irreversible” conditions to receive help to end their lives (the constitutional court had in March blocked an earlier version as being too imprecise). Other largely Catholic countries such as Chile, Ireland, Italy and Uruguay are also moving towards enshrining a right to die. In Belgium, Colombia and the Netherlands governments have broadened assisted dying laws to include terminally ill children.
After years of struggle, activists and politicians have found ways through or around reluctant legislators. The right to die has been ticked through American ballot boxes, squeezed through Australian legislatures, and gavelled through Canadian and European courts. Proponents are using public consultations, campaigns and petitions to demonstrate public support. And growing evidence from countries with assisted-dying laws has undermined fears it will become easy to “kill granny”. The changes are snowballing as advocates in one country learn from their counterparts elsewhere.
Assisted dying remains uncommon. Most cases are cancer-related, and the number of deaths is tiny. But they are nonetheless changing how people think about dying. In some countries assisted dying has been extended to those with mental disorders and dementia, and even to old people who feel tired of life. A clandestine network of baby-boomers who share methods to kill themselves has sprung up on the internet. Even some proponents are beginning to worry about a slippery slope.
Thirty years ago, assisted dying was illegal everywhere bar Switzerland. But in 1997 the state of Oregon approved the Death with Dignity Act, initiating a spate of liberalisation. In Oregon, two doctors must agree that a patient is of sound mind and has less than six months to live before he or she can receive the lethal drugs. These must be administered by the patient (known as physician-assisted dying) rather than injected by a doctor (voluntary euthanasia). Around 2,000 people have died under the law, with no wrongful deaths reported. Versions of the law are now on the books of ten states, home to a fifth of Americans, as well as Washington DC.
Oregon’s rules are also being copied internationally, with some modifications. New Zealand’s Oregon-style law came into effect on November 7th. In Australia, the state of Victoria passed a similar law in 2017, and since then all but one of Australia’s six states have followed suit. In Britain, an Oregon-style bill passed its second reading in the House of Lords in October. But to become law it would also need the support of the House of Commons and the government, which looks unlikely. Three-quarters of Britons support a right to die, but only 35% of MPs do.
Some campaigners are circumventing cautious representatives by going through the courts. In February Peru’s constitutional court ruled that the Ministry of Health’s refusal to help a woman with degenerative polio end her life violated her rights to “dignity” and “autonomy”. Several countries, such as Austria, are beginning to flesh out a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011 that people have the right to decide the time and manner of their deaths. After Germany’s highest court declared in 2020 that a ban on repeatedly helping others die was unconstitutional, Dignitas Germany, a non-profit, began to help people kill themselves.
Even after a legislature or court opens the door to assisted dying, those pursuing the option can face high hurdles. With 68 safeguards, Victoria’s law excludes some of the people it was intended to help. Doctors are forbidden to bring up assisted dying with their patients, so many do not know it is an option. Colombia decriminalised voluntary euthanasia in 1997, but is only now regulating the practice. As a result, many Colombian doctors refuse to get involved for fear of prosecution. Approval is rare and can be withdrawn.
Despite such strictures, the expansion of the right to die is not without controversy. In Canada, the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that a ban on medical assistance in dying (MAID) violated the national Charter of Rights. Now MAID is available to all Canadians who suffer from chronic physical illness or disability. Uniquely, the law allows patients to determine what constitutes “unbearable” suffering. In 2020, only 6% of written requests for MAID were refused.
Some advocates for the disabled shudder that the amended law devalues the lives of those with disabilities. It’s “literally unthinkable” that MAID would be doled out instead on the basis of race, sex or any other protected characteristic, says David Shannon, a quadriplegic lawyer who campaigns against assisted dying. Others argue that the foundations of the disability movement lie in creating the freedom to make one’s own choices.
Opponents also fear that Canada may end up helping people die before it has helped them live. Disabled people who do not receive enough support may choose to die because society has failed them, opponents argue. They worry this may prove particularly true for people whose lives have been filled with abuse, racism and poverty, though data from America show that those who choose assisted death are overwhelmingly middle-class, white and educated. Proponents contend that those who want to die should not be held hostage to society’s failures.
From 2023, Canada will extend MAID to those who suffer solely from mental illness, on the ground that to do otherwise would be discriminatory. Many Canadians find this troubling. They worry that doctors may indulge the suicidal urges that are a symptom of many psychiatric disorders: one in ten schizophrenics kill themselves, according to some studies. Other critics question whether a patient could have tried every possible treatment when the medical and social understanding of mental illness remains so rudimentary, and mental-health services are so often inadequate.
But most people underestimate how serious an intractable psychiatric condition can be, says Mona Gupta, a Québécoise psychiatrist and bioethicist. They see depictions of mental illness in popular culture but have never met someone severely affected. John Scully, who has lived with severe depression and PTSD for decades, agrees. At home at night in Toronto, Mr Scully, who is 80, is haunted by the horrors he witnessed as a war correspondent: the dead torn apart by vultures, the AK47 scoped to execute him. He also experiences physical pain. “There is no cure,” he says. Nineteen shock therapies, countless medications and six stints as a psychiatric patient have failed to bring relief.
The “only help available”, Mr Scully believes, is assisted dying. He sees it as a far more dignified choice than suicide, which he has attempted twice, and he thinks it would be less painful for his family. Like other bioethicists, Dr Gupta thinks mental disorders should be seen in the same light as other conditions that create chronic pain. For doctors, she says, the assessment process would be much the same: distinguishing between an impulsive death-wish and a considered one, and determining if a patient is mentally competent. Such cases are rare. In 2020 in the Netherlands, only 88 people with mental illnesses—12% of all those who made requests—had their requests for help approved by a specialist euthanasia clinic. Many are heartened by simply having the option.
Canada is making the same mistakes as the Netherlands, reckons Theo Boer, a Dutch ethicist who once supported his country’s euthanasia laws. Since Dutch doctors pushed to legalise assisted dying 20 years ago, he believes that voluntary euthanasia has gone from being a “last resort to prevent a terrible death to a last resort to prevent a terrible life”. Voluntary euthanasia is a short-cut to death, like a C-section is a short-cut to birth, he reasons. In the Netherlands as a whole one death in 25 is assisted, he notes, but in some cities that figure can be as high as one in seven.
The choice to die is often murkiest for those with dementia. In 2016 a Dutch woman with severe Alzheimer’s awoke during her euthanasia and, as she struggled, her family had to hold her down. Before dementia overcame her, she had made a written request for euthanasia, and the doctor prioritised that choice. In 2020, after the doctor was cleared of wrongdoing, the Supreme Court clarified that doctors cannot be prosecuted for carrying out euthanasia on patients with advanced dementia, even if they no longer express an explicit wish to die. The Netherlands averages around two such cases a year.
Bert Keizer, a geriatrician who has carried out some of the Netherlands’ most controversial euthanasia cases, is deeply uneasy about the new guidelines. Typically euthanasia happens with the agreement of the patient, doctors, and the family. But in cases of dementia, he muses, “the one who it’s all about'' is “removed from the event”. Implicit in the court’s ruling is a judgment that the person one was has more value than the person one has become. A patient who wanted to live could be denied that choice.
Swiss law, by contrast, mandates that those seeking to kill themselves be mentally competent. This can create a different terror. Alex Pandolfo has early-onset dementia. He has decided to die in Switzerland, yet he has postponed the day of his death once. If he waits too long, he will condemn himself to the future he does not want.
Some proponents of assisted dying are pressing to expand eligibility, to include those who feel they have lived a “completed life”. In 2020 the liberal D66 party in the Netherlands proposed a law to make suicide pills available to people over 75 who felt they were done living. Critics point to research from the University of Humanistic Studies in Utrecht, which shows that death wishes in older people are subject to change, and in some cases are caused by loneliness and social isolation. Few truly want to die, and those who do often meet other criteria for euthanasia, a commission found in 2016. Supporters argue that it is important to provide the option, even though few will take it in the end. Just 3% of the members of Dignitas, which campaigns for assisted dying, end up receiving help to end their lives.
Some who are simply tired of life do choose to press ahead. At 76, Dawn Voice-Cooper, who suffered from several debilitating but not life-threatening ailments, saw her future and did not want to live it: The pain of having her ears syringed; the indignity of swimming with a colonoscopy bag; the diminishing freedom to move as her arthritic joints stiffened. Life was exhausting and would only become more so. “I don’t want to die but I can’t live like this,” she said. In October she travelled from her home in Britain to an industrial estate on the edge of a Swiss forest. After listening to Nick Drake’s “Day is Done”, she died, with her friend Mr Pandolfo (and a tabloid reporter) by her side.
“Many people are not waiting for laws to pass,” warns Katie Engelhart, author of “The Inevitable”, a book about the right-to-die movement. It reveals a secret world where people, fed up with restraints imposed by laws or doctors, order lethal substances over the internet. Their reasons are often existential rather than physical: a loss of purpose, fear of being a burden or of losing their dignity. People who seek death through legal channels have similar reasons. In Oregon the most common concerns among people who qualify to die owing to terminal illness include loss of enjoyment (94%), loss of autonomy (93%) and loss of dignity (72%).
Some shrug off this phenomenon, arguing, “Assisted dying is not suicide.” But Ms Engelhart believes that such deaths are inevitably linked to the strictures around assisted dying. In New South Wales, Australia, for example, one in five people over the age of 40 who kill themselves have a terminal or debilitating illness. Yet many lonely suicides are not planned and considered, so a black market in suicide can also bring terrible risks. Earlier this year a 28-year-old Dutch woman died after taking a substance from an affiliate of Last Will Cooperative, a right-to-die organisation, seemingly impulsively. Several members of the group, including its leader, have since been arrested. Prosecutors suspect the group is involved in dozens of deaths.
In the West, assisted dying is helping to change the culture of death and dying. People are talking about death more, and even scripting it, says Naomi Richards, a British anthropologist. Death is becoming an event to be scheduled, controlled, reached via a byway past ageing or suffering. In an Instagram age, it is possible to imagine a “good death” being idealised and curated. Ellen Wiebe, a Canadian doctor, says she has helped people die “on a beach, in a forest and in the middle of a party”. Such deaths may seem particularly appealing when, for generations, dying has been medicalised and hidden, and during a pandemic in which so many have died alone in hospital.
For those left behind, an assisted death can feel like a blessing or a curse. Some, such as Tom Mortier, who has taken his case to the European Court of Human Rights, feel angry and resentful that their relative was taken too soon. But most find solace. Heather Cooke’s son, Aaron Ball, chose to die last year, at 42, while suffering from metastatic colon cancer. Ms Cooke suffers the agony of a mother who has lost her only child, but is also glad that he died in peace, at home, surrounded by his family. Medically assisted dying was a “gift” for us, she says. “But I understand why people fear it.”",2
1850,"NOW Cop26 has drawn to a close, you may be left feeling a little befuddled about how best to do your bit for the planet.
Does it make sense to stop eating imported fruit if you plan to fly to the sun for some much-needed family time next year?
Is a shower more eco-friendly than a soak in the tub?
To answer such questions — and help us better understand the implications of our consumer choices — PROFESSOR MIKE BERNERS-LEE, professor of sustainability at Lancaster University, has calculated the carbon footprint of absolutely everything . . . with some surprising conclusions.
Like most people I don’t particularly enjoy instructions on how to live.
I may have spent 15 years researching the impact of the carbon emissions that are slowly heating our planet.
But I’ve also had plenty of practice in not being quite as good as I’d like to be.
We all want to live our lives responsibly but we have to live. That’s not to say we don’t need to change our habits. We do. We are in a climate emergency. But a sense of scale is required.
A friend once asked how he should best dry his hands to reduce his carbon footprint — with a paper towel or electric drier? This same person flies across the Atlantic dozens of times a year.
The flying is hugely more significant than the hand-drying, so my friend was just distracting himself from the real issue.
The reason I decided to work out the carbon footprint of everything I could think of was to help you get a feel for roughly how much carbon is at stake when you make simple day-to-day choices.
Everything we do has some impact — where we travel to and how, whether we buy an apple in season or asparagus in winter, whether we have a quick shower or luxuriate in the bath.
What is a carbon footprint? It’s a measure of the impact of our activities on the amount of greenhouse gases being produced and released into the atmosphere.
All we consume and do and think about, both at home and work, has a carbon impact — that is, a climate change impact.
But you might be very surprised by some of the things that have a hefty carbon load and some that don’t.
I use a measure called ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ to calculate the volume of harmful gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, refrigerant and other gases) generated in the making and consumption of any product or service.
Take a tomato: any calculation needs to take into account how it was grown (naturally or in a heated greenhouse), the type of fertiliser used (some require a complex manufacturing process, others emit greenhouse gases), and how it was packaged and transported (by road, ship or air, the latter being a carbon disaster).
As a consumer, you need to consider that 1kg of locally grown tomatoes has a carbon footprint of 400g CO2e compared to an astounding 50kg CO2e produced by 1kg of organic, ‘on the vine’ UK cherry tomatoes grown out of season in March.
Choose those tomatoes and they can be the highest-carbon food of all, even though grown here.
Bananas, on the other hand, may travel far before they land in our fruit bowls, but as they tend to be shipped rather than airfreighted and require less packaging because they are protected by their skins, they are a low-carbon — and extremely nutritious — food.
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS BAD FOR PLANET
Gold and diamonds are precious precisely because it takes effort, industry and resources to extract them, and this takes their carbon footprint sky high, particularly for jewellery which comes from far afield (£500 worth of gold and diamonds from Africa has a carbon footprint of 710kg CO2e).
That’s aside from the bad working conditions for some miners. Far better to wear jewellery passed down through the family, re-fashioned from existing gems or made from natural materials like shells.
GROW YOUR OWN BOUQUETS
Out-of-season cut flowers are bad news for climate change, because they either have to be put on a plane to get here or grown with artificial heat.
A single red rose may be romantic, but when grown in a Netherlands hothouse or outdoors in Kenya and airfreighted to Europe, it will set you back 2.4kg of CO2e compared to zero carbon for a rose grown in your own garden.
A bouquet a week of imported flowers could add 1.5 tonnes of CO2e a year per person.
Grow your own flowers or look for bouquets of local-grown, seasonal blooms (1.7kg CO2e for 15 UK outdoor-grown stems).
An alternative is indoor plants, which are far less carbon-intensive.
DON'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT A DISHWASHER
A high-efficiency dishwasher always wins on carbon footprint over washing the dishes in hot water as long as you run a full load (between 470g to 600g of CO2e per full load) and particularly if you set it to run at night when electricity demand is low and the grid becomes more efficient.
Rinsing plates before stacking the machine is the worst option and ranks alongside ironing your spouse’s socks. If this is your routine, liberate yourself, sharpish.
ORDER A COFFEE WITHOUT MILK
The quickest way to slash the carbon footprint of your morning coffee (or tea) is to drink it black (49g of CO2e per cup for instant coffee or 87g a cup for a black filter or Americano compared with 235g CO2e for a large cappuccino).
Cow’s milk has such a high emissions toll that even the splash in tea accounts for three quarters of a cuppa’s carbon footprint. For a large latte (552g of CO2e) you could have nine Americanos or 25 cups of black tea.
If you buy takeaways, add 110g of CO2e for the disposable cup. At home, use one sturdy mug and only wash it at the end of the day.
JUST HOW BAD ARE IMPORTED BANANAS?
The distances bananas travel to reach us are vast.
But at just 110g of CO2e each, bananas are actually a great food for anyone who cares about their carbon footprint.
Grown in natural sunlight with no hothousing required, they keep well.
So although they are often grown thousands of miles from the end consumer, they are transported by boat (about one per cent of the carbon footprint of airfreight) and they require hardly any packaging as they have skins.
The only really bad bananas are those you allow to rot in your fruit bowl.
These join the scandalous 22 per cent of food binned by consumers in the UK.
Use overripe bananas in baking or enjoy with lashings of custard.
GO FOR THE UGLIEST APPLE IN THE SHOP
Buy the most misshapen apples. It encourages the supply chain not to chuck less-than-perfect-looking fruits away.
Apples are low-carbon but local and seasonal is best (32g of CO2e per kg). This changes when out of season.
UK apples bought in early summer will be last year’s fruit, which will have been kept refrigerated, so requiring electricity. This makes imported apples (80g of CO2e per kg) a better option.
NO WINTER ASPARAGUS
Perhaps the single most carbon-intensive winter vegetable is fresh asparagus flown in from Peru (4.7kg of CO2e per pack.)
That’s because a mile by air typically has about 100 times the carbon impact of a mile by sea. The same applies to airfreighted baby corn, baby carrots, mangetout, green beans, fine beans, okra, shelled peas, lettuces, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.
Enjoy lashings of UK asparagus in summer (270g of CO2e per pack) then wait a year to eat it again.
THE SCOOP ON THE MOST ECO ICE CREAM
A soft scoop from a van comes with a hefty carbon price tag of 500g of CO2e per cone as the vanilla ice cream’s dairy-based and kept cold in a less efficient mobile refrigeration unit, often belching out diesel fumes.
A chocolate flake makes the footprint of an ice cream higher again, though perhaps we can agree this is a necessary evil.
Opt for a plant-based ice cream for your cone, instead. Better still, buy a choc ice (140g of CO2e) or an ice lolly (70g of CO2e) from a shop, which has a lower figure as its refrigeration will be more efficient.
CROCS ARE TOPS
Shoes vary a lot in their carbon footprint, depending on what they’re made of and how long they last.
Running shoes made in China might come in at 8kg of CO2e a pair, but specialist leather is more (15kg of CO2e).
At the lowest end of the scale are a pair of Crocs, made with just 250g of expanded EVA (foam rubber).
They are sold unpackaged so the carbon toll is just over 1kg CO2e per pair.
ARE REUSABLE NAPPIES THAT SAINTLY?
A cloth nappy may seem better than a disposable but if washed at 90 degrees and tumble-dried to soften, it’ll carry a higher carbon footprint (165g of CO2e per nappy) than a disposable (130g per nappy).
The lowest carbon option is reusable nappies washed at 60 degrees, line dried, and passed on to a second child (60g CO2e per nappy).
Up to 20 per cent of the carbon footprint of a disposable nappy arises from the methane it emits as it rots down in landfill.
Biodegradable disposable nappies break down more rapidly in landfill so give off more of the gas.
WINE BOXES OVER BOTTLES
The bottle usually has a bigger footprint than the wine. Shipping is only a small part, so it doesn’t matter much where your wine comes from.
Far more important are the road miles — in your country and the country of origin.
For this reason, locally produced wine could cut the footprint by 20 per cent (1.3kg CO2e a bottle from Britain or France) and, oddly, I estimate Australian wine shipped to the UK (in huge sealed tanks) probably has a slightly lower footprint (at 1.4kg) than Sicilian transported in bottles by road (1.65kg).
By buying wine boxes or cartons you can reduce the footprint by a factor of about five.
EAT FROZEN BERRIES WHEN IT’S COLD
Fresh strawberries flown in from South Africa in winter or those grown in a hothouse come with an eye-wateringly high carbon cost of 3.65kg CO2e for a 250g punnet.
Far better to eat UK strawberries in summer. Or opt for frozen British berries (770g CO2e for 250g) which are super-nutritious and easier than fresh fruit to eat without wastage, as you can take just what is needed from the freezer.
NEVER, EVER FLY BUSINESS CLASS
Flying, particularly long haul, is bad for the planet. Emissions from airborne planes have a greater impact on greenhouse gases than those burning the same amount of fuel on the ground. A business class seat, as it takes up more room, has a greater percentage of the flight’s total carbon footprint. A single flight is equivalent to using 340,000 plastic bags.
If you do fly, choose economy. Go abroad less often, stay away for longer and only fly to do something you can’t do here in the UK.
RATION BATHS AND TIME YOUR SHOWERS
abandon a daily bath, folks — just have one a week. A quick dip can be anything from 500g to 1.5kg of CO2e depending on your heating system.
Far better to have a quick, daily shower. Five minutes is 160g to 250g of CO2e (depending on your hot water system). You could treat yourself to 15 minutes under a power shower for the 1kg of CO2e you generate running a hot bath.
ONE TAP THAT YOU SHOULD TURN ON
At 400g of CO2e per litre, bottled water is 1,000 times more carbon intense than tap water, so it really pays to ditch the plastic bottles.
The carbon emissions come mainly from packaging and transport, but add 83g CO2e per litre for the plastic, and 20g CO2e to melt the plastic pellets and mould them into bottles.
Transport is also significant because water is so heavy.
SWAP YOUR CAR FOR THE TRAIN 
Trains are generally a lot greener than cars, though a good petrol car can beat a train’s carbon footprint if the car is full of people. Even two people travelling together are better off driving an efficient car than travelling first class by train.
The carbon cost of a train trip depends on how fast it goes (air resistance increases with speed), how many stops there are (each stop wastes energy) and type of fuel used (electricity beats diesel).
Travelling by an Underground train is lower-carbon per passenger mile than an intercity train (68g of CO2e) — mainly because people are packed in so tightly.
YOU MUST EAT YOUR (SOURDOUGH) CRUSTS
Homemade sourdough or locally baked artisan loaf has a smaller carbon footprint than mass-produced sliced bread (630g of CO2e per loaf compared to 1kg of CO2e for mass-produced).
More than 60 per cent of the emissions of all bread production comes from the wheat cultivation (and most of that is the fertilizer used). A third comes from the milling and baking.
Transport is a tiny fraction if bought locally. Buy only what you need and always eat the crusts! Food waste thrown into landfill is very bad news.
Rice, unlike bread, is a surprisingly high-carbon staple (at 4kg to 7.1kg of CO2e per kg depending on planting practices).
This is due to the methane that bubbles out of the flooded paddy fields and the carbon-excessive nitrogen fertilisers that are often applied. This means a kilo of rice can cause more emissions than burning a litre of diesel.

1851,"THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS thronged the streets on July 11th. Some stoned the police and looted posh shops. Such outbursts are unprecedented in Cuba since the communists secured their hold on power in the 1960s. “Freedom!” and “Down with the dictatorship!” they chanted, and “Patria y Vida!” (Fatherland and Life), quoting an underground reggaeton song that mocks Fidel Castro’s tired slogan of “Fatherland or Death”.
All this poses an extraordinary challenge to the dull bureaucrats who rule Cuba, after the death of Fidel and the retirement of his younger brother, Raúl, earlier this year. The regime has responded with repression. “Revolutionaries, to the streets,” urged Miguel Díaz-Canel, the president who this year took the helm of the Communist Party, unleashing troops, police and loyalist mobs wielding baseball bats. At least one person was killed. Scores have been detained and the government has sporadically cut access to the internet.

Repression may work in Cuba, as it has elsewhere. But something there has snapped. The tacit contract that kept social peace for six decades is broken. Many Cubans used to put up with a police state because it guaranteed their basic needs, and those with initiative found a way to leave. Now Cubans are fed up. When Mr Díaz-Canel blames the protests on “American imperialism”, all he shows is how out of touch he is. The protesters are young, mainly black and dismiss the Castros’ revolution of 1959 against an American-backed tyrant as ancient history.
They have plenty to complain about. The pandemic has shut off foreign tourism, aggravating the economy’s lack of hard currency. Raúl Castro launched economic reforms, but they were timid and slow, permitting only minuscule private businesses. It was left to Mr Díaz-Canel to take the most momentous step, by ordering a big devaluation in January. Without measures to allow more private investment and growth, that has merely triggered inflation. As its sanctions-hit oil industry collapses, Venezuela, Cuba’s chief foreign patron over the past 15 years, has curbed its cut-price oil shipments, prompting power cuts during the heat of summer. Chronic shortages of food and medicine have become acute. Despite Cuba’s prowess at public health and its development of its own vaccine, the government has failed to contain the pandemic. The sick are dying, abandoned at home or on hospital floors.
Two other factors explain the outburst. One is the change of leadership. The Castros commanded respect even among the many Cubans who abhorred them. Mr Díaz-Canel, without a shred of charisma, does not. And the internet and social media, allowed only in the past few years, have broken the regime’s monopoly of information, connecting younger Cubans to each other and the world. They have empowered a cultural protest movement of artists and musicians. Its message, in the unanswerable lyrics of “Patria y Vida”, is “Your time’s up, the silence is broken…we’re not scared, the deception is over.”
Mr Díaz-Canel faces a choice: to turn Cuba into Belarus with sunshine, or to assuage discontent by allowing more private enterprise and greater cultural freedom. That could weaken the army and the Communist Party, but it would eventually salvage some of the revolution’s original social gains.
Curiously, many Republicans in the United States echo Mr Díaz-Canel’s description of America’s role in the protests. President Donald Trump tightened the economic embargo against Cuba, barring American tourists, curbing remittances and slapping sanctions on state firms, largely reversing Barack Obama’s opening to the island. Like Cuba’s president, Republicans argue that the unrest proves the embargo is working at last.
Not so. True, the embargo has made life harder for the Cuban government. But its restrictions mainly hurt Americans. The regime can still buy American food and medicine and trade with the world. The causes of Cuba’s social explosion lie at home.
Open the windows
Joe Biden should draw the obvious conclusion. So far he has left Mr Trump’s Cuba policy intact, so as not to annoy hawkish Cuban-Americans. Instead he should return to Mr Obama’s approach. The big threat to a closed regime is engagement with the world, especially the United States. Mr Biden should lift the embargo and deprive the regime of an excuse for its own failures. ■",2
1852,"“IF WE DO well, the country does well, and if the country does well, that is the way for us to do well,” reads the inscription on the walls of the former Hyundai Heavy shipyard in Gunsan on South Korea’s west coast. The quote from Chung Ju-yung, the late founder of Hyundai, one of the country’s biggest conglomerates, is an apt summary of South Korea’s development strategy. Equating manufacturing prowess with the national interest drove the massive state-led investment in heavy industry that made South Korea rich.
Today the fading letters are an ominous sign of things to come. Four years ago the Hyundai shipyard and the GM car factory in Gunsan shut within ten months of each other, resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. There is a risk of more such devastation in the future. The country’s industrial behemoths have no clear plan to eliminate greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, which the government has promised to do. How they do so will determine the future not just of South Korea’s industries but of its industrial cities, too.

South Korea’s coastal cities are the most visible markers of the country’s rapid industrialisation. Starting in the 1960s, sleepy fishing ports and trading posts turned into sprawling industrial centres, filled with shipyards, car factories, steel mills, oil refineries and container terminals. Industry generates 37% of GDP, compared with the rich-country average of 27%, and more than 80% of exports. GDP per person in Ulsan, the most important industrial city, is 75% higher than the national average. At a museum in the city you can wander around model versions of industrial installations to take in the story Ulsan wants to tell about itself. “We went from a GDP of $100 per person to this,” beams Shin Hyeong-seok, the museum’s director.
But as South Korea joins the rest of the world in the effort to curb climate change, its centres of heavy industry are turning from drivers of growth into liabilities. Their reliance on fossil fuels is one reason why South Korea is the world’s seventh-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. President Moon Jae-in has promised to reduce emissions by 40% below 2018 levels by 2030, and that South Korea will be carbon-neutral by 2050, a target that was written into law in August.

Environmental groups point out that Mr Moon’s targets are still insufficient to meet South Korea’s commitments under the Paris agreement. The government itself freely admits that it is lagging behind other rich countries in reducing emissions. But the announcement has alarmed industry representatives. They warn of production cuts and large-scale job losses unless businesses are given more time and support to reach the targets.
The transition to a low-carbon economy, if pursued seriously, will be the biggest challenge for manufacturers since the transition from light to heavy industry in the 1970s, says Park Sang-in, an economist who focuses on South Korea’s conglomerates at Seoul National University. The fact that South Korea is so late to the game makes the task harder, because bigger reductions will now have to happen over a shorter period of time.
If the government is to achieve its targets, carbon-intensive manufacturing industries will have to reduce their emissions by as much as 80% over the next three decades (what carbon is still emitted will have to be captured and stored in facilities yet to be developed). De-industrialising and shifting towards less energy-intensive services would be one way to achieve that. But given the importance of manufacturing to the economy, the consequences for workers and the industrial centres where they live would be devastating. The only alternative is for industries to change. “We do not want to lose the role these industries play in the economic growth process, so it is critical that they be transformed,” says Kang Sung-jin, who studies industrial development at Korea University in Seoul.
What will this transformation look like? Factories that make petrol and diesel cars will have to switch to making batteries and electric vehicles. Shipbuilders will have to produce carriers that run on greener fuels, and the petrochemical industry will have to provide those fuels. Steel furnaces will have to run on something other than coke made from coal. Electricity for both industry and households, now produced mostly by coal-fired power stations, will have to come from renewable sources.
Just as during the switch from light to heavy industry, the change will be most visible in industrial cities. In the future the government envisions, places like Ulsan and Gunsan will be connected to huge offshore wind farms and covered in solar panels. Green hydrogen will power next-generation container ships and carbon-neutral steel furnaces.
Just reinvent yourself
The government’s most recent plans have spurred companies into action. Yet the lack of preparation means that the road to net zero is likely to be bumpy, with industries vulnerable to shocks. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the pledges will survive the next election. Climate change is not yet a big issue in the presidential-election campaign, and the next government may not feel the need to keep up pressure on the conglomerates.
That means that many of South Korea’s industrial centres could end up looking more like Gunsan, as investment in green tech yields results in other countries and higher emissions render some of South Korea’s industries obsolete. Government efforts to get Gunsan’s laid-off workers into new employment have progressed only sluggishly. Thousands have left the city.
At the site of the old colonial port, where city officials have launched a series of urban-regeneration projects, visitors to a large ship-shaped museum can relive the experience of trading rice in a 1930s version of the city. Unless South Korea’s green economy gets whirring, the museum in Ulsan on the opposite coast may soon acquire a similar old-timey vibe. ■",2
1853,"EVERY NIGHT Lee Ah Huat (not his real name) turns on the news. The 60-something engineer lives in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, but he does not bother with local channels. He goes straight to CCTV, China’s state broadcaster, and usually watches its international broadcast in Chinese. Mr Lee’s family left China and settled in Malaysia decades ago. He maintains few direct connections to his ancestral home and has complicated feelings about it.
Yet when it comes to current affairs, his views are straightforward. The protests in Hong Kong and the oppression of the Uyghurs, an ethnic minority, are “China’s domestic issues”. American politicians who bang on about the Chinese state’s human-rights abuses are, in this view, hypocrites. Just look at “how America treats African-Americans or Native Americans. They murdered them, stole their land. America is just causing trouble.”

Mr Lee’s remarks would delight the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). At least 30m members of the Chinese diaspora, 60-70% of the total, live in South-East Asia. They are the targets of increasingly sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored influence operations. Though few members of the diaspora are Chinese citizens, the state expects them to have strong sympathies with their ancestral homeland. They have an important role to play in what the party calls China’s “great rejuvenation”.
In 2018 the United Front Work Department, the main organ responsible for influence operations among people who are not party members, absorbed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, responsible for tending to those abroad. Jacob Wallis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think-tank, thinks that “the CCP sees the diaspora as a powerful vector of influence” and is trying to recruit its members.
The South-East Asian diaspora is of particular interest to China’s info-warriors because China thinks it has a “natural right” to primacy in the region, says Kenton Thibaut of the Atlantic Council, an American think-tank. “China sees it as an easy proving ground,” she adds, where it can “start to express itself as a global power”.
How to recruit these potential partisans? “Wherever the readers are, wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend their tentacles,” said Xi Jinping, China’s president, in 2015. Their grip can be felt almost everywhere. “Over the past decade, top CCP officials have overseen a dramatic expansion in efforts to shape media content and narratives around the world,” according to a report in 2020 by Freedom House, a watchdog.
“This push feels particularly strong in South-East Asia because there are more outlets that are willing to rebroadcast some of these claims,” says Ja Ian Chong of the National University of Singapore. Prominent state media like CCTV are broadcast in every South-East Asian country. Some, including Xinhua, a government news agency, have struck attractive content-sharing deals with cash-strapped local newspapers, wire services and television broadcasters in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. In 2017 a Chinese firm and the Cambodian interior ministry launched a TV station which carries content from China’s official media.
The complexion of some local media is increasingly red. Cambodian media now carry “journalism with Chinese characteristics”, according to Reporters without Borders, another watchdog. Chinese-language outlets in Malaysia are muzzling journalists who do not toe the CCP line. In April Lianhe Zaobao, a Chinese-language Singaporean newspaper, renamed its “Greater China” section (covering China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) simply “China”, reflecting China’s claim that Taiwan is its territory. It is one of the few foreign newspapers which are allowed to circulate in China.
China also spreads disinformation. A recent investigation by Malaysiakini, a news website, found that during the mass unrest in Hong Kong in 2019, mainstream Chinese-language media in Malaysia regurgitated false reports from Chinese state media claiming that protesters threw Molotov cocktails at school buses. China manipulates digital outlets, too. Its lies often pop up on social-media platforms in Taiwan, which is a “testing ground for [the] PRC’s worldwide propaganda”, according to DoubleThink Lab, a local outfit that tracks digital-information operations. From there it spreads to South-East Asia, piggybacking on the Twitter, Facebook and WeChat accounts of South-East Asian migrants in Taiwan or ethnic Chinese in South-East Asia.
Chinese propagandists have a few favourite themes. They include China’s benevolence, as illustrated by its donations of vaccines to South-East Asian countries (true) and the invention of the first covid-19 vaccine by a Chinese general (false). Democracy is portrayed as a messy, chaotic form of government and America as a racist country. A video purporting to depict black and white Americans beating a Chinese man with sticks was shared widely on South-East Asian chat groups earlier this year. The caption was false: the video actually depicted a prison riot in Ecuador.
There is also evidence that the Chinese propaganda apparatus, which has become “much more sophisticated, multi-layered and international facing” in the past two years, is conducting digital operations intended to manipulate public opinion in South-East Asia about domestic politics, says Mr Wallis.
It is hard to establish whether China is winning hearts and minds with such tactics. A Pew poll conducted this year found that in Singapore, which is about three-quarters Chinese, nearly two-thirds of respondents did have favourable views of China. Older Singaporeans were more likely than youngsters to hold such views. Last year, a Singaporean woman posted on Reddit, an online forum, about her father who was “self-radicalising every night with extreme pro-China videos”. Scores of Singaporean users recounted similar experiences with their own parents.
Sometimes influence operations backfire, however. In 2015, the perception that China was interfering in Malaysia’s affairs led tens of thousands of Malays to march through Chinatown in Kuala Lumpur, stirring memories of past race riots.
And if Mr Lee, the Malaysian engineer, is anything to go by, the party still has work to do. Lofty rhetoric about the Chinese diaspora belonging to a “community of common destiny” is all well and good. But his mainland-Chinese colleagues “look down on us…They think we come from a small, poor and weak country.” He adds: “[They] don’t see us as one of them”. Nor does Mr Lee. He identifies not as a Chinese national but as Chinese Malaysian. ■",2
1854,"FRANCO BLOISI is puzzled. Mr Bloisi is the chef of Assunta Madre, a restaurant attached to Billionaire, a nightclub on the Costa Smeralda. With its turquoise waters and hidden coves, this region of north-eastern Sardinia has long been a summer playground for Arab potentates, Russian plutocrats and Silicon Valley tech czars. “We’ve got the stylish Italians this year,” says Mr Bloisi. But he has seen no trace of the super-rich foreigners. “Their yachts are here. But they’re not going out.”
The absent billionaires are the talk of the Costa Smeralda. This is a land of endless villas and dry-stone walls draped with oleander, of five-star hotels with heart-stopping vistas and heart-stopping prices; a land of poodles, helipads, bespoke swimwear and bronzed middle-aged men in two-seater convertibles. More stylish than tacky, the Costa Smeralda gives its wealthiest holidaymakers, who in the Caribbean might worry about burglary or kidnapping, a reassuring degree of security—or did, until the advent of covid-19.

After a disastrous 2020, the luxury hotels are full again. There is “not a suite to be had anywhere”, says Paolo Manca, president of the island’s hoteliers’ association. At the local airport, outside Olbia, the volume of private flights is 10% higher than in 2019. On the last Sunday in July there were 174. Among them was a private Airbus 340 carrying Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan. His wife and first vice-president, Mehriban Aliyeva, flew in on an equally private Boeing 767.
At the marina in Porto Cervo, among the few in the Mediterranean that can handle the biggest yachts, Carmine Sanna, the general manager, has seen a notable increase in chartered vessels more than 90 metres in length, mostly booked by Americans. The bays south to Porto Rotondo are sprinkled with gleaming super-, mega- and giga-yachts (usually defined as having lengths of more than 24, 50 and 80 metres respectively). Yet the traces of their owners and charterers are scant.
“They don’t want to go out and about, because they fear infection,” says Silvio Pippobello, the airport’s boss. As the Delta variant seeped through Italy, Sardinia experienced a particularly steep rise in the incidence of new cases. In the week to August 5th it was 138 per 100,000, the highest of any Italian region.
Partying during a pandemic can lead to some bizarre juxtapositions. An event staged by Marco Fava, a hairdresser from Rome with a celebrity clientele, was in full swing in the town of Poltu Quatu when a group of paramedics escorting a doctor in head-to-toe protective overalls barged through the crowd of guests.
Some of the wealthiest visitors have been using a testing centre at Olbia airport to have their entourages checked, sometimes three times a week. But fear of covid-19 may not be the only reason why the moguls are missing from their usual haunts. Someone who makes a living from catering to their whims, and who prefers to remain anonymous, says wealthy Russians had begun to withdraw even before the pandemic struck: they no longer felt a need to win acceptance in western European society, and the wine selection at most Costa Smeralda restaurants is beneath their standards. “They prefer to organise dinners aboard their yachts and in their villas,” he says. There they can serve whatever they like. At Olbia airport’s terminal for private flights, a Romanée-Saint-Vivant 2016 is on sale in the duty-free shop at €5,140 ($6,020) a bottle. ■
Correction (August 13th 2021): This article originally stated incorrectly that the party took place in a luxury hotel in Poltu Quatu. It in fact took place in a public space in the town of Poltu Quatu. The Economist regrets the error.",2
1855,"WHO IS RISHI SUNAK? Listen to the chancellor’s recent rhetoric, and you could be forgiven for thinking he was cast in the mould of a predecessor, George Osborne, who slashed the state in response to the global financial crisis. In a speech to the Conservative Party faithful on October 4th Mr Sunak described borrowing as “immoral”, and emphasised his eagerness to restore order to the public finances. But the budget he delivered on October 27th confused the picture. Reeling off spending measures, he refused to apologise for raising taxes and lauded the spending they supported. “The Conservatives are the real party of public services,” he trilled.
Mr Sunak displayed rare munificence. Government departments will get real increases in their budget of 3% a year on average until 2024-25, an increase reminiscent of largesse last seen consistently in the 2000s. Even more eye-popping are the chancellor’s plans for the size of the post-pandemic state. According to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), a watchdog, spending will grow from 39.8% of GDP before the pandemic to 41.6% by 2026-27, the highest sustained share since the 1970s. Tax will rise from 33.5% of GDP to 36.2%, a level not seen since the early 1950s. The announcements recalled not Mr Osborne, but a very different predecessor: Labour’s Gordon Brown.

The Brownite giveaway was prompted by a surprisingly perky economy. In March the OBR projected GDP growth of 4.1% this year. Now, thanks to rosier employment figures, it predicts 6.5%. In the same period, medium-term damage expected from covid-19 has gone from a gloomy 3% of GDP to a cautious 2%. Part of this is simply the passage of time revealing that investment has performed better than expected. But Mr Sunak is also benefiting from his adroit handling of the pandemic, which limited the hit to corporate balance-sheets.
All of this means Britain is borrowing less than expected. People are earning more, which increases the tax take. And Mr Sunak has raised taxes. In September he announced a health and social care levy, which will bring in a net sum of £12bn ($16bn) by 2024-25, and increased dividend tax rates. This year has seen the biggest overall tax rise since 1993—which is not a message the Tories will put on leaflets at the next general election.

Mr Sunak did offer some red meat to Conservative members. There was relief for payers of business rates, a cut to corporate-tax rates for banks and the now traditional fuel-duty freeze (as has happened without fail for the past decade). But none of these will cost more than £2bn a year by 2024-25. Mr Sunak also announced new fiscal rules: there will be no borrowing for day-to-day spending in three years’ time and debt will fall as a share of GDP. On current plans, he will meet these targets, but he has left less margin for error than his predecessors did with their rules, which all went unmet.
By the next election, Mr Sunak plans to be using most of the windfall delivered by better economic growth to lower borrowing (or, perhaps, as a slush fund for tax cuts). But now, he is spending—and in particular to ease the pressure on public services brought about by the pandemic. The health department will see the biggest increase, because hospitals must deal with both covid and an enormous backlog, but most will have at least some sort of rise. This will begin to reverse the cuts applied by Mr Osborne (see chart).

Given how much of the budget was trailed before, some wondered whether anything would be left for the main event. But the chancellor managed a few surprises. Half the planned increase in departmental spending in 2024-25 will restore foreign aid to 0.7% of GDP, a target abandoned during the pandemic. A welcome simplification to the mess of alcohol taxation was seized on by Mr Sunak, a Brexiteer, as a benefit of leaving the EU (it would not have been possible as part of the bloc). Firms running retail, hospitality and leisure properties will enjoy a temporary cut to business rates, to help their post-pandemic recovery.
The most impressive rabbit Mr Sunak pulled out of his hat was an increase in the generosity of Universal Credit, a benefit for working-age people. He faced criticism in September for allowing a pandemic-related uplift to expire, which cost recipients £1,000 a year. Rather than reverse the cut, Mr Sunak reduced the rate at which the benefit is withdrawn as people earn more. The Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, was quick to point out that together with higher minimum-wage rates, the change would still leave the poorest fifth of households £280 a year worse off.But it does at least cushion the blow.
Critics complain that the outlook for households’ disposable income is still pretty dismal. Mr Sunak’s cursory treatment of climate change smacked of complacency—and the trove of documents released alongside his speech revealed little that would fulfil Britain’s bold climate-change ambitions. Given the number of global leaders about to descend on Glasgow to discuss the matter, it was slightly odd to announce a cut on short-haul flights taxes (and not to raise fuel duty).
Before the budget, there was lots of noise about the growing distance between Mr Sunak and the prime minister, Boris Johnson. There were even rumours that Mr Johnson would move the chancellor to a different, less prominent job, so perturbed was he by his rival’s star power. But the fiscal event revealed them to be aligned, at least as far as governing the country is concerned. Both are happy to spend big if circumstances call for it. Neither is a small-state ideologue. ■",2
1856,"NO ONE COULD blame Morocco. In 2016 the kingdom was due to host an Arab League summit, an expensive undertaking. The meetings are so dull that some heads of state fall asleep. So in February, two months beforehand, Morocco said it could not be bothered to play host. “This summit will be just another occasion to approve ordinary resolutions and to pronounce speeches that give a false impression of unity,” the kingdom said. Leaders ended up gathering in a tent in Mauritania instead.
Founded in 1945, the Arab League was one of the first multilateral bodies set up after the second world war. It expanded rapidly over the next few decades, adding members and striking treaties on defence and commerce. Members proposed a common market in 1953 and signed an economic unity agreement in 1957, the year when six European countries signed the Treaty of Rome that set up what became the European Union. The aspiration, in the Middle East as in Europe, was to pull down trade barriers and link regional economies. Almost 70 years later, none of that has happened.

Consider trade: Arab countries do pitifully little business with each other. Less than 5% of the Arab world’s non-oil trade is internal, estimates Alain Bejjani, chief executive of Majid Al Futtaim, a retailer in Dubai. EU members send at least one-third of their exports inside the bloc; in ASEAN around 20% of trade is similarly internal. Within the Arab world tariffs remain high, and poor infrastructure makes trade more expensive. French-speaking countries in north Africa have lower trade costs with Europe than with each other. Despite talk of a Schengen-style free-movement zone, travel remains difficult. A citizen of America may travel to 16 of the 22 members of the Arab League without applying for a visa. A citizen of Egypt, where the Arab League is based, may visit only six. Israelis enjoy more travel privileges in Arab states than Syrians.

The league has not been much good at diplomacy, either. In 2011 it tried to mediate in Syria. Mr Assad agreed to halt attacks on protesters and free political prisoners; the league deployed observers to verify. The monitoring mission lasted barely a month, but there were few consequences. The league froze Syria’s membership and voted for sanctions on Syrian officials, yet many Arab states maintained ties with Mr Assad’s regime.
The Arab Peace Initiative, which the league endorsed in 2002, seemed to be one of its few meaningful ventures: it promised Israel normal relations if it ended the occupation of Palestinian territory. This has not happened, but last year four Arab states went ahead and normalised relations with Israel anyway. The league has been on the sidelines during the covid-19 pandemic, co-ordinating neither economic stimulus nor distribution of vaccines.
The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) had a more hopeful start. When founded in 1981, three of its six members had been independent for only a decade. Most were small states, satellites orbiting a much larger Saudi Arabia. Integration was logical. The GCC is the closest thing in the Arab world to a multilateral institution. Citizens of its six stable monarchies enjoy free movement and the right to work across the bloc. A customs union and unified standards have eased internal trade. The bloc boasts a joint military force, known as Peninsula Shield. Though it accounts for only 13% of the Arab world’s population, its oil and gas resources have made it an economic heavyweight. In 2020 the GCC accounted for 71% of the Arab world’s foreign trade, up from 61% in 2000. It drew 59% of the region’s foreign direct investment.
Yet efforts at deeper unity have gone nowhere. Talk of a common currency remains just that. Big infrastructure projects, such as a railway network connecting the six Gulf states, are behind schedule. Peninsula Shield was not strong enough to shield the peninsula when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Its main accomplishment was to smash a popular uprising in Bahrain in 2011: less a tool of defence than one for internal repression.
In 2017 three members of the GCC—Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE—imposed a travel and trade embargo on Qatar, a fellow member. The blockade was meant to compel Qatar to abandon its pro-Islamist foreign policy and tone down its media. It was not the first dispute with Qatar, long the bête noire of the Gulf. Nor was it successful: the blockade was abandoned in January having secured no substantive concessions. But it caused a schism that paralysed the GCC. Saudi Arabia and the UAE even formed a “co-ordination council”, a sort of mini-GCC, to bypass the larger body.
The largest Gulf states, in population and GDP, are natural partners. Even they cannot see eye-to-eye. In the past few years they have disagreed over the war in Yemen, which the UAE started leaving in 2019; over how to embrace Israel, which the UAE did last year; and over production caps at OPEC, from which the UAE is contemplating withdrawal. The biggest dispute is not political but economic. On July 3rd Saudi Arabia imposed tariffs on goods manufactured in free zones in the UAE, where many foreign firms are based, making a mockery of the GCC’s customs union. Lorries backed up on the border as firms tried to work out the rules.
It was a sign of further friction to come. The Saudis are desperate to diversify their oil-bound economy. Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince, has made this his priority, announcing trillions of rials in investments. The kingdom’s once-activist foreign policy has taken a back seat to building tourist resorts and fanciful robot-filled cities. “The options are already limited. You’re running a risk that your main source of wealth will become, very quickly, a stranded asset,” says Nasser Saidi, an economist in Dubai. In the short term, the easiest way to diversify is to steal business from the UAE, which is further along with post-oil plans. Officials in both countries insist this need not be a zero-sum game. But it will be a fierce competition that will test the GCC’s unity. There is precious little of that across the region, even in the country that was once the beating heart of Arabism.■

1857,"Secret plans are reportedly being drawn up which will see Covid jabs being rolled out to children as young as five in the coming months.
Leaked proposals suggest health bosses are preparing to jab children aged between five and 11 next spring. 
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said 'expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness' must be met before vaccines would be authorised for children in this age category. 
It is feared that Covid will continue to pose a threat until 2024, meaning health officials are considering new ways to protect Brits.
Speaking earlier this week, England's chief medical officer Christ Whitty said that vaccinating any children as young as five in the UK was a long way off. 
Professor Whitty pointed out that the UK's medicines watchdog hasn't even examined data on the jabs for under-11s.
And a decision on rolling out the vaccine to younger cohorts would depend on the evidence presented to the UK's top scientists, he said at a press conference.
But leaked proposals suggest that the NHS are preparing a scheme to offer immunisations to children aged between five and 11 in the Spring, in the event that regulator approval is granted, according to The Sun. 
A senior source told the publication: 'Top secret plans reveal what is at stake if we are to achieve a meaningful victory over Covid. Asking parents for permission to jab kids as young as five is in the schedule.
'It is controversial, but will help us reach our goal.'
The source added that the plans are still open to change, but that many scientists support the idea of jabbing young children. 
Commenting on the plans, an NHS spokesperson said: 'The NHS regularly plans for how it would operationalise opening vaccines to more people so it is ready to extend the jab quickly when and if any decision is recommended by the JCVI.' 
Before any rollout can be announced for children of this age, the vaccines would need to be approved for use on this age group by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
Additionally, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also needs to approve the rollout. 
At present, vaccines are not being offered to any child younger than the age of 12. 
While US health officials gave the final sign-off to the Pfizer vaccine for use in five to 11-year-olds at the beginning of November, with doses to be administered at a third of the amount given to teenagers and adults. 
And earlier this week, the JCVI recommended that children should wait at least 12 weeks after catching Covid to get their jab.
The body said there is evidence the longer gap reduces the risk of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation reported in a small number of children after vaccination.
Today's change to the guidance only applies to healthy children aged 12 to 17, who previously only had to wait a month after infection to get jabbed.
The four-week gap remains the advice for adults over the age of 18 and children extremely vulnerable to Covid.
Twelve to 15-year-olds are still being offered just one dose of Pfizer's vaccine while officials monitor myocarditis rates in other countries.
But as of this week, 16 and 17-year-olds can now come forward for the second jab after the UK's regulator decided the benefit of the jabs 'clearly' outweighed the risk. 
Speaking about the leaked plans, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'COVID-19 vaccines have not been approved by our independent medicines regulator, the MHRA, for under-12s so are not used in the UK.' 
And Professor Chris Whitty called for calm this week over suggestions that the Covid jabs could soon be offered to under-11s.
He said: 'We haven't yet even got a licence with MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency] so let's not rush our fences on this.
'It will depend entirely on the data that are presented to the independent regulator and the independent scientific advisory committee.'
The MHRA has not yet made a decision on whether to offer younger groups the vaccine, because it has not yet examined data from the US, which is already administering the Covid vaccine to five to 11-year-olds.
The agency examines all clinical trial and safety data from Covid vaccine makers that apply for a license in the UK before making a decision on whether the jab is safe and effective for a certain age group.
The JCVI then advises No10 on whether that cohort should be given the injections as part of the vaccine rollout after weighing up the benefits and risks.
The group advised ministers against jabbing 12 to 15-year-olds because children face such a tiny threat from Covid.
It also warned about the risk from a rare vaccine side effect called myocarditis, which can cause heart damage. 
Critics say children are better off catching the virus and getting protection naturally because the risk of being admitted to ICU is about one in 500,000.
But the JCVI panel — who only looked at a rigid set of criteria — recommended the UK's chief medical officers were given the final say.
Professor Chris Whitty and colleagues ultimately decided to recommend jabs to 12-15 year olds because modelling showed it would prevent thousands from having to take time off school.
Professor Jeremy Brown, a member of the JCVI, said earlier this month that it is 'far too early' to say whether it will recommend vaccinating children aged under-12.
But he said there is 'a case for using a vaccine on those children that have underlying diseases that make them more vulnerable' to the virus. 
And Professor Jonathan Van-Tam Professor, England's deputy chief medical officer, said the JCVI 'will be considering' whether to follow the US in expanding the rollout to over-fives. But the decision is 'some way down the tracks', he added.

Children should wait at least 12 weeks after catching Covid to get their jab, Britain's vaccine advisory panel recommended today.   
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said there is evidence the longer gap reduces the risk of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation reported in a small number of children after vaccination.
Today's change to the guidance only applies to healthy children aged 12 to 17, who previously only had to wait a month after infection to get jabbed.
The four-week gap remains the advice for adults over the age of 18 and children extremely vulnerable to Covid.
Twelve to 15-year-olds are still being offered just one dose of Pfizer's vaccine while officials monitor myocarditis rates in other countries.
But as of this week, 16 and 17-year-olds can now come forward for the second jab after the UK's regulator decided the benefit of the jabs 'clearly' outweighed the risk. 
So far, more than half of older teenagers have come forward for a first dose and nearly a third of 12 to 15-year-olds have had the initial jab. 
Families who have recently had a child vaccinated shortly after infection were told not to worry, and that the new approach is 'highly precautionary'.
The UK Health Security Agency, which announced the move today, admitted that it would slow down the rollout of the national vaccine programme. 
But it insisted it should not have a major impact on the epidemic because children still have high levels of natural immunity.
The UKHSA estimates half of secondary-aged pupils have already had the virus. 
Covid immunity wanes within six months of Pfizer's second vaccine no matter how old you are, a study has found as the NHS gears up to roll out annual boosters at a cost in the region of £1billion to taxpayers.
People who finished their two-dose course in January had a 51 per cent increased risk of catching the virus by July than those who were jabbed later, according to the research on more than a million Israelis.
Scientists claimed the increased risk of getting infected was visible among people of all ages, although the elderly remain face much higher odds of becoming severely ill. 
The study —  by Israeli researchers using medial data from 1.3million adults in the country — is the first to confirm that younger people also see their immunity against the virus wane within months. There was hope that protection would hold-up better in younger groups because they typically have stronger immune systems.
Israel, which has led the charge on vaccines throughout the pandemic, is already offering boosters to over-16s so long as five months have passed since their second dose. The researchers said it was too early to tell how quickly immunity wanes after a booster jab but it could last longer.
In the UK, top-up doses were approved for all over-50s, health and care home workers and severely ill patients in September and ministers expanded the programme to people in their forties this week.
Vaccine advisers in Britain have admitted that they could be given to younger adults but they are waiting on more conclusive evidence on their safety and efficacy. 
The agency, which replaced Public Health England last month, said natural infection provided good protection against re-infection for three to six months.
A major study in Israel today found that protection from two doses of Pfizer's vaccine lasts a similar length of time. Immunity from a single dose, however, wanes more quickly. 
Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at UKHSA, said: 'The Covid vaccines are very safe. 
'Based on a highly precautionary approach, we are advising a longer interval between Covid infection and vaccination for those aged under 18. 
'This increase is based on the latest reports from the UK and other countries, which may suggest that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination will further reduce the already very small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups.
'Young people and parents should be reassured that myocarditis is extremely rare, at whatever point they take up the vaccine, and this change has been made based on the utmost precaution.'
'We keep all advice under constant review and will revise it according to the latest data and evidence.'
UK Government data justifying today's update shows nine in every million under-18s in the UK will get myocarditis after a single dose of Pfizer's Covid jab, the same as around one per 110,000. 
But for every million doses of the vaccine administered to children, they will prevent around 150 hospitalisations from Covid.
The JCVI held off on recommending second doses for children because data from Israel and the US suggested the myocarditis risk is as high as one in 10,000.  
But real-world UK data in slightly older adults - who also saw above normal rates of myocarditis in other countries - was not higher after the second jab.
This is thought to be because the dosing gap between doses here is 12 weeks, whereas it's between three and four weeks in the US and Israel. 
The JCVI believes that 12-week gap might also be the sweet spot for getting a jab after natural infection in young people, which prompted today's tweak to the guidance. 
There is also evidence that rates of myocarditis in Britain are similar in 16 and 17-year-olds and 18 to 29-year-olds, after the second jab.
This is why the JCVI recommend two jabs for healthy older teens earlier this week. But it is still weighing up the evidence on younger children. 
It is unclear why the longer space between vaccination or natural infection reduces the risk of myocarditis yet. 
This gap might give the immune system time to calm down from the reaction to the first dose or infection.  
During Covid infection or immunisation, the body produces cells to fight the virus. If the disease-fighting cells enter the heart, they can inflame the muscle. ",-2
1858,"THE TERM “cake theory” has a resonance in China that goes far beyond the kitchen. A decade ago it became shorthand for a fierce debate about the country’s future. There were two opposing camps. One believed that China should focus on making China’s cake—its economy—bigger. The other said the priority should be to share the existing cake more fairly. It was a feud that permeated the febrile politics of China in the build-up to Xi Jinping’s anointment as the Communist Party’s chief in 2012. A powerful advocate of the sharing approach was later accused of plotting a coup.
The political landscape in China now looks different. There is no sign of a struggle, as there was during the cake debate, between the party’s titans. Less than a year after Mr Xi took over, the alleged coup-plotter, Bo Xilai, was sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power. Similar fates befell several others close to him, including the man once in charge of China’s domestic-security apparatus. Mr Xi looks firmly in charge. There are no provincial party chiefs waging thinly disguised battles for national power as Mr Bo was then, in his case by casting himself as a champion of the poor.

But there are striking similarities. Once again, the political atmosphere is heating up. Mr Bo’s mantra then, the need to create “common prosperity”, has become Mr Xi’s. Regulators have staged a series of dramatic strikes against some of the country’s biggest tech firms, wiping more than a trillion dollars off their share values and sowing widespread alarm among wealthy Chinese businesspeople. The government, eager to reduce dangerous levels of debt, has allowed a giant privately owned property firm, Evergrande, to teeter on the brink of collapse, sending jitters through global markets and sparking protests by angry investors and contractors in several cities. The party does not publicly justify these moves in the name of common prosperity, but there are plenty of online commentators in China who see the pursuit of that nebulous goal as well-served by anything that creates pain for the super-rich. China's underdogs are enjoying a moment of Schadenfreude.
An important link exists between recent events in China and the struggles of a decade ago. It is the approach of a crucial party congress. Such gatherings occur every five years. The next is expected to be held late in 2022. Those that take place ten years into a leader’s rule—like both next year’s and the one in 2012—are particularly important.
Normally such a congress would involve sweeping changes in the party leadership, with the election of a new Central Committee that in turn chooses a new general secretary and reshuffles the Politburo (in fact, these changes are decided in secret before the congress begins). After next year’s congress Mr Xi is expected to secure another five years in office—a break with precedent that, by the time of the 21st congress in 2027, would make him the longest-serving party chief since Mao Zedong.
As always in the build-up to such events, tension is evident as the party tries to forestall any unrest by ratcheting up security. Early this year a nationwide purge began of the police, secret police, judiciary and prison system. Its stated aims include stamping out corruption, as well as removing the “lingering poison” of Mr Bo and his alleged clique. More than 170,000 people have been punished so far, officials say. This month investigation teams moved into provincial- and central-government-level departments to begin assessing the behaviour and loyalty of high-ranking security officials.
There is no sign of concerted opposition to Mr Xi’s plans to remain in power. He has ruled with such ruthlessness that any dissenters are likely to keep their mouths shut. But even if he does not face any rival whom outsiders can identify, Mr Xi will be on guard. Not only will there be the usual jockeying among officials for seats in the party’s highest echelons, but also—as was the case a decade ago—internal debate about China’s direction. At the congress, Mr Xi will present a report summing up his decade in power and setting out his vision for his next five (or more) years of rule.
On July 1st, the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding, Mr Xi declared that China had become a “moderately prosperous society in all respects”. Inside the party, and among the public, many want to know when it will become fairer. Mr Xi’s report next year is unlikely to go into specifics about taxes and government spending. But to judge from officials’ recent emphasis on the common-prosperity theme, it will feature prominently in what is sure to be a state-of-the-party address filled with chest-thumping references to China’s “resurrection” as a global power that will be modern, rich and strong by 2049.
The pace of recent events suggests Mr Xi is in a hurry. He has clamped down not only on big business but also on the entertainment sector. Ideological education in schools has been reinforced: children as young as six are being taught about “Xi Jinping Thought”.

And as often happens when congresses approach, ideology is becoming a bone of contention. Since the launch of the country’s “reform and opening” policy in 1978, a huge gap has emerged between the party’s professed socialism and China’s reality. The country is much richer, but it practises a Dickensian kind of capitalism that offers far less protection to the poor than many capitalist societies in the West provide. The disposable income of people in the top fifth of Chinese households is ten times higher than those in the bottom fifth, official figures show. Credit Suisse, a bank, reckons the top 1% own more than 30% of household wealth, about the same as in America.
Mr Xi appears to enjoy the support of many Chinese, not least for beefing up China’s global power and fighting corruption at home. Since last year, his popularity appears to have grown as a result of his successful efforts to crush the coronavirus and his intransigence in the face of what many in China see as the West’s ganging up on their country at the instigation of President Joe Biden. Mr Xi has critics within the system, but they are scared to show their hand. It may be, in part, with them in mind that he is patching an ideological vulnerability by appealing to the less well-off. The turmoil of a decade ago suggests how grumblings of the poor can be exploited. Mr Xi still snarls about Mr Bo’s “independent kingdom” in the south-western region of Chongqing, where he was party chief and gained support by tapping in to nostalgia for the more socialist features of the Mao era and reviving memories of the late leader by promoting Mao-era songs.
Raising the red flag
Chinese critics of the country’s state-led capitalism often refer to Mao. It is a relatively safe way of poking at the party, which remains officially wedded to Maoism and Marxism even though it is highly selective in the way it applies those ideologies. Mr Bo—as much a state capitalist as other leaders—even tried to show sympathy with the downtrodden by pandering to neo-Maoists, a motley bunch whose websites often carp about China’s drift from the true socialist path. They comprise various kinds of people. Some have retired from the civil service or state-owned firms and yearn for what they recall as the simpler, fairer times of Mao. Others are younger idealists who grew up in the post-Mao era and abhor its inequalities. They are loyalists, but acerbic in their dissection of China’s social ills. Few Chinese support their extreme orthodoxy (such as calling, as Marx did, for the abolition of private ownership). But many share their analysis.
One reason for Mr Xi’s recent clampdowns may be an attempt to show ordinary people that he takes ideology seriously and is on their side. There is no sign that he plans to adopt the neo-Maoists’ proposed remedies for China’s unfairness. However, like Mr Bo, he is surely conscious that taking rich businessmen down a peg or two can win much applause (several were targeted in Mr Bo’s anti-corruption drive in Chongqing). Prominent businesspeople are frequent targets of online venom, not only from the neo-Maoists. The internet has been brimming with complaints from stressed-out white-collar workers about long hours and low pay.
Since he came to power, Mr Xi has been trying hard to convey the impression that he is faithful to Marxism and Maoism. “Do not forget the original intent” has long been one of his favourite slogans. It means the party must bear in mind why it was formed in the first place: most importantly, to create a fairer society. The slogan has long been ubiquitous on streets.
But if Mr Xi is serious about this, it will involve big economic and social reforms. He has not spelled out what these might entail, or when they will be implemented. He could, for example, levy new taxes on property or inheritance. Or he could end the hukou system of household registration that gives urban residents far better access to welfare and education than their rural counterparts have, and makes it difficult for people from the countryside to enjoy such benefits when they move to cities. However, there would be huge resistance to all these moves. Such taxes have been discussed for years, but officials have dithered because of fears of upsetting property-owning middle-class Chinese. Hukou reform has been slow, too, in part for similar reasons: middle-class urbanites do not want to share schools and hospitals with huge numbers of poor rural migrants.
Details of any reforms, it appears, can wait (the annual session of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, in March 2023 will be a forum to watch). For now, Mr Xi is scoring easy points by attacking the rich and famous. In August one of the country’s best-known film stars, Zheng Shuang, was fined more than $46m for evading taxes. She is one of several celebrities who have recently been blacklisted from the entertainment business for various reasons. These range from engaging in casual sex to rape and, in the case of one actor, circulating a photo of himself grinning in front of a shrine in Tokyo where war criminals are among those honoured. Punishing these stars has proved popular.
Mr Xi is also taking this opportunity to tighten political control. In August the state-backed China Federation of Radio and Television Associations called for “zero tolerance” of performers who “touch the ethical bottom line”. Forbidden behaviour, it said, should include having the “wrong” attitudes towards history and the country—code for anything that might upset party ideologues. That was made official in September, when the broadcasting regulator said the selection of actors should exclude anyone with an “incorrect political stance”, as well as those deemed immoral.
The end of fun?
In the 1990s, when the party began encouraging private enterprise, it also allowed people a degree of personal freedom, at least outside politics. Hitherto suppressed forms of art and entertainment, from the avant-garde to punk rock, were given freer rein. Mr Xi, however, has been signalling that his “Chinese dream” is of a conservative society: Xi Jinping Thought is suffused with references to ancient Chinese philosophies stressing conformity.
In its edict this month, the broadcasting regulator also called for a “resolute end” to shows featuring “perverse tastes”, such as for effeminate men. It banned publication of celebrity rankings: officials want to tame their boisterous fan clubs. Separately, to make sure youngsters spend more time studying and less time shooting zombies, under-18s have been barred from online gaming on weekdays and limited to a mere three hours at the weekend.
There are echoes in this of the 1980s, when the party launched brief campaigns against Western lifestyles (such as by forcing men to cut their hair short) and liberal beliefs. The question now is whether recent clampdowns represent a longer-term shift, involving ever greater party interference in a broad range of less-tightly controlled activity. The signs are not encouraging. Mr Xi is a harsh authoritarian, differing from Deng Xiaoping who, in the 1980s, veered between relaxation of cultural and economic freedoms, and tighter control. Mr Xi’s direction is far clearer.
Like Deng, Mr Xi sees a big role for the private sector in boosting economic growth and providing jobs. On September 6th Liu He, a deputy prime minister, tried to reassure private businesspeople, saying their endeavours were critical to the country’s economy. But he wants them on a shorter rein. One reason is justifiable. China’s private tech firms have long been in need of better policing to curb rampant antitrust abuses, exploitative labour practices and misuse of data. Property firms do indeed pose a threat to financial stability with their heavy borrowing and Ponzi-like business models. But Mr Xi also wants tighter political control of private firms. He has devoted great energy to establishing party committees inside them, requiring that they have a say in important decision-making. That will remain a priority.
Many people in China seem happy with this. The crumbling of Evergrande has triggered small protests by people afraid of losing their down-payments on houses, or by contractors who have not been paid. But most people appear to believe that the government will protect them from the fallout of the company’s troubles.
Mr Xi is certainly winning applause from the neo-Maoists, and appearing to relish it. On August 29th the website of one of the party’s flagship newspapers, Guangming Daily, published an article by one such ideologue, a little-known writer called Li Guangman. He had posted it a couple of days earlier on his blog. It was a paean to the clampdowns, including on effeminate men. Mr Li hailed recent developments as a “profound revolution” that would “wash away all the dust”. His blog post was a declaration of victory: “Red is back, the heroes are back, courage is back.”
It quickly became clear that Mr Li’s article enjoyed official approval. Though not published in the print edition of a big newspaper, within hours it appeared on the websites of the party’s most important news organisations. Never mind that its Mao-era language caused ripples of unease among liberals and even some establishment types. On September 2nd Hu Xijin, the editor of Global Times, a tabloid owned by the People’s Daily, used his blog to condemn the article as “inaccurate” and “exaggerated”. Mr Hu said he was afraid it would cause “terror” by reviving “certain historical memories”—an obvious reference to Mao’s Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when mobs killed and persecuted millions. But the articles remained online. Mr Xi certainly does not mind his multi-front campaign being praised as a big deal.
Nothing like the Cultural Revolution appears in the offing. That event pushed the country to the brink of civil war. Unlike Mao, Mr Xi is obsessed with preserving stability. In May a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Security said the emphasis of the police force’s efforts to “protect the state’s political security” would be on preventing a “colour revolution”. But there is no sign of an incipient one. In the months leading up to the congress, the country’s handful of active dissidents will be subjected to even tighter surveillance than usual.
Mr Xi is already remoulding society in a way that neo-Maoists endorse. Recent events have taken place against a broader backdrop of more-visible involvement by the party in people’s everyday lives. Especially since the pandemic began, it has become omnipresent in neighbourhoods in a way not seen since the 1980s. Grassroots party members are the chief enforcers of quarantines and controllers of people’s movements. In the past two years, several central-level documents have promoted the establishment of “moral review councils” in the countryside. These are made up of party worthies and, sometimes, police officers who sit in judgment on fellow villagers’ behaviour and publicly shame those who have committed offences such as littering or failing to look after an elderly parent. Some urban neighbourhoods have set up similar “moral clinics”.
Assuming Mr Xi keeps his job as China’s leader at least until 2027, if not longer, control will be his watchword, not disruption. “East, west, south, north and centre; the party leads everything,” Mr Xi keeps insisting. Without ideological discipline, he says, its grip will be dangerously weakened. But it is Xi Jinping Thought, not that of Mao or Marx, that will really count. He will interpret it as he pleases. ■",2
1859,"Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub
AMID COVID-19’s sweeping devastation, its effect on greenhouse gases has emerged as something of a bright spot. Between January and March demand for coal dropped by 8% and oil by 5%, compared with the same period in 2019. By the end of the year energy demand may be 6% down overall, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental forecaster, amounting to the largest drop it has ever seen.
Because less energy use means less burning of fossil fuels, greenhouse-gas emissions are tumbling, too. According to an analysis by the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of scientists, 2020’s emissions will be 2-7% lower than 2019’s if the world gets back to prepandemic conditions by mid-June; if restrictions stay in place all year, the estimated drop is 3-13% depending on how strict they are. The IEA’s best guess for the drop is 8%.

That is not enough to make any difference to the total warming the world can expect. Warming depends on the cumulative emissions to date; a fraction of one year’s toll makes no appreciable difference. But returning the world to the emission levels of 2010—for a 7% drop—raises the tantalising prospect of crossing a psychologically significant boundary. The peak in carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil fuels may be a lot closer than many assume. It might, just possibly, turn out to lie in the past.
That emissions from fossil fuels have to peak, and soon, is a central tenet of climate policy. Precisely when they might do so, though, is so policy-dependent that many forecasters decline to give a straight answer. The IEA makes a range of projections depending on whether governments keep on with today’s policies or enact new ones. In the scenario which assumes that current policies stay in place, fossil-fuel demand rises by nearly 30% from 2018 to 2040, with no peak in sight.
The IEA, though, has persistently underestimated the renewable-energy sector. Others are more bullish. Carbon Tracker, a financial think-tank, predicted in 2018 that with impressive but plausible growth in renewable deployment and relatively slow growth in overall demand, even under current policy fossil-fuel emissions should peak in the 2020s—perhaps as early as 2023. Michael Liebreich, who founded BloombergNEF, an energy-data outfit, has also written about a possible peak in the mid 2020s. Depending on how the pandemic pans out he now thinks that it may be in 2023—or may have been in 2019.
Previously, drops in emissions caused by economic downturns have proved only temporary setbacks to the ongoing rise in fossil-fuel use. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Asian financial crash in 1997 and the financial crisis of 2007-09 all saw emissions stumble briefly before beginning to rise again (see chart). But if a peak really was a near-term prospect before the pandemic, almost a decade’s worth of setback could mean that, though emissions will rise over the next few years, they never again reach the level they stood at last year.

The alternative, more orthodox pre-covid view was that the peak was both further off and destined to be higher. On this view, emissions will regain their pre-pandemic level within a few years and will climb right on past it. Covid’s damage to the economy probably means that the peak, when it arrives, will be lower than it might have been, says Roman Kramarchuk of S Global Platts Analytics, a data and research firm. But an economic dip is unlikely to bring it on sooner.
What, though, if covid does not merely knock demand back, but reshapes it? This shock, unlike prior ones, comes upon an energy sector already in the throes of change. The cost of renewables is dipping below that of new fossil-fuel plants in much of the world. After years of development, electric vehicles are at last poised for the mass market. In such circumstances covid-19 may spur decisions—by individuals, firms, investors and governments—that hasten fossil fuels’ decline.
So far, renewables have had a pretty good pandemic, despite some disruptions to supply chains. With no fuel costs and the preferential access to electricity grids granted by some governments, renewables demand jumped 1.5% in the first quarter, even as demand for all other forms of energy sank. America’s Energy Information Administration expects renewables to surpass coal’s share of power generation in America for the first time this year.
Coal prices have fallen, given the low demand, which may position it well post-pandemic in some places. Even before covid, China was building new coal-fired plants (see article). But the cost of borrowing is also low, and likely to stay that way, which means installing renewables should stay cheap for longer. Renewable developers such as Iberdrola and Orsted, both of which have weathered covid-19 rather well so far, are keen to replace coal on an ever larger scale.
Those who see demand for fossil fuels continuing to climb as populations and economies grow have assumed demand for oil will be much more persistent than that for coal. Coal is almost entirely a source of electricity, which makes it ripe for replacement by renewables. Oil is harder to shift. Electric vehicles are sure to eat into some of its demand; but a rising appetite for petrochemicals and jet fuel, to which lithium-ion batteries offer no competition, was thought likely to offset the loss.
Breaking bounds
Now oil’s future looks much more murky, depending as it does on a gallimaufry of newly questionable assumptions about commuting, airline routes, government intervention, capital spending and price recovery. In the future more people may work from home, and commuting accounts for about 8% of oil demand. But those who do commute may prefer to do so alone in their cars, offsetting some of those gains. Chinese demand for oil has picked up again quickly in part because of reticence about buses and trains.
As to planes, Jeff Currie of Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for oil will recover to pre-crisis levels by the middle of 2022, but that demand for jet fuel may well stay 1.7m barrels a day below what it was as business travel declines. That is equivalent to nearly 2% of oil demand.
Such uncertainty means more trouble for the oil sector, whose poor returns and climate risks have been repelling investors for a while. Companies are slashing spending on new projects. By the mid-2020s today’s underinvestment in oil may boost crude prices—making demand for electric vehicles grow all the faster.
Natural gas, the fossil fuel for which analysts have long predicted continued growth, has weathered the pandemic better than its two older siblings. But it, too, faces accelerating competition. One of gas’s niches is powering the “peaker” plants which provide quick influxes of energy when demand outstrips a grid’s supply. It looks increasingly possible for batteries to take a good chunk of that business.
Those hoping for fossil fuels’ imminent demise should not be overconfident. As lockdowns around the world end, use of dirty fuels will tick back up, as they have in China. Energy emissions no longer rise in lockstep with economic growth, but demand for fossil fuels remains tied to it. Mr Currie of Goldman Sachs, for one, is wary of declaring a permanent decoupling: “I’m not willing to say there is a structural shift in oil demand to GDP.” Even so, a peak of fossil fuels in the 2020s looks less and less farfetched—depending on what governments do next in their struggle with the pandemic. Of all the uncertainties in energy markets, none currently looms larger than that. ■",2
1860,"THE SETTING is dramatic. Visitors passing from the harsh midday sun to the dim interior are met with slogans. “We believe that every human is part of the collective conscience,” reads a message on the walls of the Syrian pavilion at the Dubai expo. Why the Syrian government has spent years dropping bombs on many of those humans is not explained.
The $7bn fair is the first “World Expo” in the Middle East. Like much else in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which wants to attract visitors to revive its economy, the expo strives to gloss over politics. Exhibitors are able to present Panglossian visions of themselves to investors and tourists.

Many of the pavilions, intentionally or not, capture something about a country’s character. America puts guests on a moving walkway for an earnest civics lesson. China greets them with a video from Xi Jinping. Visitors to the British one spend most of their time in an orderly queue.
For countries in the region, there is much to gloss over. Lebanon’s pavilion feels like a tourism ad, with large monitors showing glamour shots of the country. Such an exhibit would be impossible in Lebanon itself, where the power went out for 24 hours earlier this month. Some countries have yet to showcase anything. Libya’s is almost empty, with walls that smell of fresh paint and a television playing cartoons. Iraq missed the opening, too.
Egypt is a popular stop. There are a few nods to the past: hieroglyphs and a replica of King Tut’s coffin. Much of it, though, is given over to portraying Egypt as an economic powerhouse, an image at odds with its sluggish private firms. On a giant video screen, a woman in pharaonic garb talks about industrial zones being built along the Suez canal. If Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi is Egypt’s new pharaoh, a fish farm near Suez is apparently his Karnak temple.
No one acknowledges politics, not even occupied Palestine, which allows visitors to touch a piece of Jerusalem’s Dome of the Rock and smell soap made in Nablus. Instead, many countries want to do business. At Iran’s unfinished pavilion, where one door leads to a construction site, space is given over to a sort of bazaar, with companies hawking ceramic tiles and carpets.
Back at the Syrian stall there are booths for firms selling cables and olive oil, and one for Cham Holding, a conglomerate under American and European sanctions. Another space is lined with 1,500 wood panels that were posted to Syrians around the world with instructions to draw their hopes. Some are painted with the regime’s flag, or Bashar al-Assad’s face. Organisers insist they tried to reach a representative sample of the now-sprawling diaspora. Yet none seems to have sent wishes for a less brutal government or accountability for a war that killed hundreds of thousands of their fellow citizens. A neon sign nearby declares, “What you see isn’t all there is”—an apt slogan for the whole expo. ■",2
1861,"IN CHILE THE covid-19 pandemic has had many victims, but for a while the government was not among them. In late 2019 and early 2020 the country was rocked by protests in which 30 people died. It seemed likely that the unrest would topple the centre-right government of President Sebastián Piñera. But he held on by agreeing to draft a new constitution to replace the one introduced in 1980 by Augusto Pinochet, a military dictator who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990. Mr Piñera was helped by the pandemic, which took people off the streets and caused the protests to fizzle.
On May 15th and 16th, however, Chileans used the ballot box rather than the street to express their rage. Independent candidates (some, confusingly, affiliated to party lists) grabbed 88 of the 155 seats in the convention to draft a new constitution. With the seats reserved for indigenous people, roughly 68% of participants will be independent, more than the two-thirds majority needed to approve the wording of the new constitution. Mr Piñera’s coalition failed to win the third of seats it expected, depriving it of a veto.

Corruption scandals and anger about inequality caused the landslide. “People can’t stand it any more,” says Cristina Dorador, a biologist elected as an independent for Antofagasta region, the country’s mining heartland. “People wouldn’t talk to us about our campaign until we said we were independents.”
For decades, Chileans benefited from a strong economy and falling rates of poverty, thanks to free-market policies. But many felt left out. Pensions and health care are most generous for those with good jobs. Those in informal work, 27% of the labour force, are much worse-off. Other public services are often mediocre.
Only 2% of Chileans trust political parties, according to a recent poll by the Centre for Public Studies, a think-tank in Santiago, the capital. The members of the newly elected convention include midwives, a mechanic, teachers and students. By law, half are women—unlike Congress and the top ranks of the main political parties, which are dominated by men. “The convention is a much better reflection of Chile than Congress,” says Juan Pablo Luna, a political scientist at the Catholic University.
It is also more left-wing. Many of the independents’ manifestos called for a constitution that requires a more generous welfare state and limits the private-sector’s role in providing public services. Most Chileans seem to want more protection for the environment, too. This may lead to curbs on mining such things as copper and lithium. Chile’s private, inherited water rights are widely disliked as well. Whether the new constitution will create more entitlements than taxpayers can pay for remains to be seen.
Though the independents have a super-majority, they are not united. Those elected on party lists may toe party lines. A plebiscite to approve the new constitution is expected to be held in the second half of next year. Chileans will be obliged to vote.
Yet even if the convention founders, Chilean politics will have been shaken up. Presidential and parliamentary elections are due in November. Political parties will include more independents in their lists of candidates. Some independents may even form their own political parties in order to run. Everything is up for grabs. ■",2
1862,"IN 1966 JEFF JOHNSON, Nike’s first-ever full-time employee, created the company’s first store in Santa Monica, California. As Phil Knight, Nike’s co-founder, recounts in his memoir, “Shoe Dog”, it became a “holy of holies” for runners. Mr Johnson was a bookworm, so the shop had shelves of books that he felt runners should read. Pinned to the walls were photos of runners and of Nike’s sneakers, then called Tigers. Mr Johnson kept card files of each customer, including their shoe sizes. He sent them Christmas cards and congratulatory notes if they won a big race. Many wrote back seeking Mr Johnson’s support and advice, which he gave, especially when it came to injuries.
 When your correspondent told this story to Heidi O’Neill, now head of Nike’s consumer and marketplace division, she got “goosebumps”. It recalled a time, she said, when Mr Knight and his colleagues, struggling to get the business off the ground, put shoes on the feet of one runner at a time. For decades afterwards, she says, Nike was unable to replicate the intimacy of this one-to-one customer relationship, as it relied on rapid expansion of its wholesale business. Yet since 2017 the firm has been cutting the cord with many of its wholesalers, including Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, to focus on becoming a “direct-to-consumer” (DTC) company. DTC now accounts for 40% of Nike’s revenues. Its shoppers’ use of digital technology has enabled Nike to recreate that hallowed “one-to-one world”, says Ms O’Neill.

One-to-one is shorthand for today’s upheaval in the world of shopping. The consumer has never had so many things to buy, or ways to buy them. New forms of communication via social media, messaging services and apps have brought producers and consumers closer together. Using trillions of gigabytes of data, manufacturers know better than ever what customers want. Their products can be delivered direct to the doorstep. The traditional middleman, who for centuries piled hidden cost on hidden cost, is being squeezed out.  
This has been especially visible during the covid-19 pandemic, as e-commerce penetration has in just a few months reached levels that had been expected to take years. Amid lockdowns and social-distancing measures, bricks-and-mortar retailers went bust in droves last year in America and Europe, continuing a long trend. Yet online platforms have thrived. Amazon exceeded $100bn in quarterly revenues for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2020. The share prices of some Chinese e-commerce giants doubled and even tripled. 
DTC businesses have flourished. Early on in lockdown, Nike hit a target, which was originally set for 2023, of selling 30% of its goods online. Over the past year 70m people have become “members”, bringing the total to 250m. It connects to these loyal customers via apps offering everything from free running guidance to access to sneaker vending-machines.

Supermarkets, which had earlier hoped that a mass stampede online was still five years away, suddenly found that even grandparents were mastering the dark arts of ordering groceries and booking slots. Such was the surge in demand in the early days of lockdown that Ocado, a British online grocer, thought for a while that it was under cyber-attack. 

The e-commerce explosion does not herald the death of the physical store, however. When lockdowns have been lifted, shoppers have flocked back to high streets and shopping malls. Even a digital evangelist like Nike inaugurated a flagship “interactive” store on Paris’s Champs-Elysées last year, one of several new stores it has recently opened. After covid-19 is tamed, the pace of e-commerce growth will moderate. As Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, an investment firm, puts it, generations of shoppers’ “muscle memories” will not vanish overnight.
Yet the data-driven shopping upheaval is unstoppable. It will change the nature of stores, so that physical and digital shopping seamlessly interact. It will disrupt marketing, because online ads target shoppers more accurately than any broadcast jingle or billboard. And it will lead to new forms of production. Nike offers an example. Thanks to its apps and interactive shops, it acquires reams of real-time data from its pavement-pounding customers. When it noticed that traffic on its apps was showing more people doing yoga, it swiftly produced new yoga gear, Ms O’Neill notes. Mr Johnson would have been delighted.     
Revolutionary days
To understand the historic importance of such a shift, start in 16th-century England. As Dorothy Davis, a former Economist writer, explained in her book from the 1960s, “A History of Shopping”, the first retail revolution occurred in the Elizabethan era when craftsmen, who until then had traded one-to-one with customers, set up the first shops to peddle other people’s wares, earning mark-ups on what they sold. 
Centuries later came the Industrial Revolution, which led to the second big retail transformation. This was a new system of factory-produced goods that a growing number of working-class shoppers could afford. Supported by a blitz of advertising, these goods were distributed by shops that grew in size to benefit from economies of scale. The set-up is familiar to many today: mass production supports mass consumption.
The third retail revolution, today’s digital age, turns that model on its head, creating, in retailers’ jargon, a consumers’ “pull” system rather than a producers’ “push” one. As Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia University Graduate School of Business in New York, says: “At the turn of the 20th century, the commander-in-chief of commerce was the retailer, with the manufacturer as equal partner. Today it’s the customer who’s in charge.”
In the West, this upheaval causes trepidation. That is because the retail infrastructure was not built for the digital age. America has 24 square feet of retail space per person, according to Bernstein, three times as much as Britain and six times as much as China. In America more than 8,700 stores closed last year, says Coresight Research, a data firm. In Britain 16,000 stores shut and 183,000 retail jobs were lost, estimates the Centre for Retail Research. Pace Nike, one of the  worst-hit sectors has been clothing and footwear. Those opening stores are mostly discounters.
In parts of Asia, however, this is a time of exuberance. China’s embrace of e-commerce reflects the ubiquity of smartphones, the shortage of attractive shopping centres beyond the big cities, and high urban density, which cuts the cost of delivery. Yet China also stands out for a level of innovation, such as live-streaming by celebrity lipstick-sellers, that few saw coming. Like Nike, some Chinese tech firms are taking advantage of people’s digital trail to change the way goods are produced—and even to produce high-tech ways to improve  fruit and vegetable yields on farms.
Yet even in China, the ultimate goal is not to leapfrog the store. Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce firm, has brought the latest digital razzmatazz, such as cashier-free shops and video promotions, to its supermarkets in the biggest cities. Along with JD.com and Pinduoduo, its closest rivals, it is working with grocery shops in the farthest-flung villages to make distribution of goods cheaper and more efficient. Daniel Zipser of McKinsey, a consultancy, says 374 large malls were opened in China last year. Prices for retail property in city centres have shown no meaningful fall.  
In both East and West, such an amalgamation of the offline and online worlds is widely referred to as “omnichannel”. This is perhaps the most tangible trend affecting the future of shopping. The future will be both online and offline.
For consumers the benefits are obvious. They will gain greater convenience from being able to shop either physically or virtually, depending on their mood and circumstances. But for retailers, the challenges are immense. They have to pay not only for the costs of their stores but also for a form of digital “rent” to display their goods high up on online search channels such as Facebook. They must not only pay for delivery but also allow customers to pick goods up in their shops. And they face a growing nightmare of processing returns that now cost retailers more than $1trn globally every year, says Shopify, a big online platform. The struggle will be to find ways to make omnichannel more profitable.
It may yet become more lucrative simply because of the sheer size of the market left to conquer. According to Benedict Evans, who writes a tech newsletter, e-commerce sales globally in 2019 amounted to some $4trn. That was less than a fifth of total retail sales, and a smaller fraction of overall consumer spending, which the World Bank estimates at $65trn. There are tens of trillions of dollars of extra spending left to battle over. 
Yet concerns are already growing that a few behemoths, such as Amazon in America, Europe and parts of Asia, and Alibaba in China, will hog the bulk of that. Regulators in America, the European Union and China are keeping the industry leaders under scrutiny. To keep the future a renaissance not a digital autocracy, this report assesses how entrepreneurs can stand up to and even overcome the supremacy of the digital incumbents. 
In the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, with shops shut and doorsteps under siege from the latest Amazon delivery, the world may seem to be on the edge of a digital dystopia, with shops losing their age-old role as a place of social interaction, banter and succour for the lonely. But that is too pessimistic. Even a time traveller from Elizabethan England would find a lot to recognise in the commerce of the future. As this report will argue, the itinerant peddlers, merchants, food stalls, crafts, salespeople and shoppers will all continue to exist—albeit in new forms. The biggest difference will be the marketplace, the digital architecture dominated by the tech giants that in future will underpin our urge to splurge. ■

1863,"New York (CNN Business)The director of the United Nations' World Food Programme laid out a plan to spend $6.6 billion to combat world hunger — a direct response to a back-and-forth with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who claimed he would sell Tesla stock to fund a plan if the WFP could describe ""exactly how"" it would work. David Beasley, the UN food program director and former Republican governor of South Carolina, tweeted a link on Monday to a 1,000-word ""executive summary."" It maps out how the UN would deploy $6.6 billion worth of meals and vouchers to feed more than 40 million people across 43 countries that are ""on the brink of famine"" — thereby averting what the WFP is calling a looming ""catastrophe.""In the document Beasley posted, the WFP proposes dedicating $3.5 billion to buy and deliver food directly, $2 billion ""for cash and food vouchers (including transaction fees) in places where markets can function,"" and spending another $700 million to manage new food programs that are ""adapted to the in-country"" conditions and ensure ""the assistance reaches the most vulnerable.""Another $400 million would be used for ""operations management, administration and accountability"" and supply chain coordination. ""The world is on fire,"" Beasley wrote. ""I've been warning about the perfect storm brewing due to Covid, conflict, climate shocks & now, rising supply chain costs. IT IS HERE."" ""This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable,"" Beasley wrote in a separate tweet, tagging Musk, who is the world's wealthiest person with a net worth of approximately $288 billion. ""You asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you - and anyone else - who is serious about saving lives.""As of Wednesday afternoon, Musk had not responded.The back-and-forth between Musk and Beasley kicked off with a CNN interview last month in which Beasley asked billionaires to ""step up now, on a one-time basis"" to help combat world hunger, specifically citing the world's two richest men: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.Beasley said giving $6 billion, or 2% of Musk's net worth, could help solve world hunger. Musk responded on Twitter, writing, ""If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it."" ""But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent,"" Musk added.Beasley previously replied to Musk's tweets, assuring him that systems are in place for transparency and open source accounting.""For him to even enter into this conversation is a game-changer because simply put, we can answer his questions, we can put forth a plan that's clear,"" Beasley told CNN in a follow-up interview earlier this month. ""Any and everything he asks, we would be glad to answer. I look forward to having this discussion with him because lives are at stake.""Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the world's hunger crisis was already exacerbated by climate change and conflict. The pandemic compounded the existing issues though, leaving ""42 million people that are literally knocking on famine's door,"" Beasley said. ""This is a worst-case scenario."" It's not clear if Musk or Bezos have seen the plan and will ultimately decide to lend their support. Spokespeople for Musk's companies did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for Bezos, Angela Landers, declined to comment on the WFP's proposal but pointed to other philanthropic donations Bezos has made to combating hunger.Musk has previously made bold promises on Twitter, committing resources to charitable endeavors. In 2018, for example, he pledged to ""fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels."" Musk ended up donating about half a million dollars for installing water filters in the town's schools, according to an August article from a local news outlet. Musk has made more sizable donations to certain projects. This year, he promised to donate $30 million to Brownsville, Texas, the city nearest to a massive rocket hub run by his company SpaceX, and local schools. He also set up the Musk Foundation, which says it gives to efforts related to renewable energy expansion, human space exploration and safe uses of artificial intelligence. He's also signed The Giving Pledge, a promise to donate at least half of his wealth to charitable efforts during his lifetime, something Bezos has not done.",0
1864,"HOW SHOULD societies punish those who commit the worst crimes? As fewer countries use the death penalty, more are imposing life sentences. The number of people jailed for life worldwide rose by more than 80% between 2000 and 2014, to nearly half a million.
And a good thing, too, liberals and conservatives might agree. As a punishment for heinous crimes, life in prison strikes many as a sensible compromise between the inhumanity of the death penalty and the leniency of letting the guilty eventually walk free. The success of that argument is one reason why fewer people are now being put to death.

In fact, life sentences can also count as acts of punitive excess. They keep people penned up long after most of them have lost the capacity or inclination to be violent. They are also a poor deterrent. Potential criminals are more effectively restrained by a high likelihood of being caught than by a severe punishment.
Although, in America at least, it is cheaper to lock people up for life than to execute them (because death-row cases involve endless legal wrangling), old codgers make costly prisoners, because of their health problems. By one estimate, they are three times more expensive than younger inmates. Money spent keeping 60- and 70-year-old ex-thugs behind bars for ever would nearly always prevent more crimes if it were spent instead on better policing, or on rehabilitation.
Life sentences take many forms, of varying severity. Critics should focus on the substance, not the label. Sentences that offer no possibility of parole are far harsher than those that offer a chance of release, however distant. Some ultra-long sentences, by contrast, are no different from life. Alaska does not impose life sentences, but it does jail people for 99 years.
Those who want to limit prison terms should start with the cruellest and most egregious. These include sentences imposed on children, or for non-violent crimes, as under “three strikes” laws in some American states. Lifers should not be singled out for harsh treatment as they are in Ukraine, where some are locked in their cells for 23 hours a day. Nor should life sentences be mandatory for particular offences, which bars courts from taking into account any mitigating circumstances.
What about when crimes are shockingly depraved or cost many lives? The judge who sentenced Brenton Tarrant for murdering 51 people in 2019 at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, a country that abolished the death penalty in 1989, had no qualms about throwing away the key. “Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment,” he told Mr Tarrant.
That view is understandable. And yet even in this case life without the possibility of parole is wrong. No amount of time can expiate Mr Tarrant’s crimes. But prisons are about harm prevention, not expiation.
A better approach is that of Norway. It sets a maximum sentence of 21 years. However, if a convict is still judged to be a danger to society after that time, he can be detained until he is not. Such a rule protects potential victims while also offering the criminal a measure of hope and a reason to reform.
Keep the keys
In 2013 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that all prisoners are entitled to the prospect of eventual release. For a few who remain dangerous in their dotage, such as orchestrators of genocide, that may be too big a risk. But for most murderers, 20-25 years behind bars will prove long enough. ■",2
1865,"Editor’s note (April 29th 2021): This article has been updated to include denials that China’s population is shrinking
THE COMMUNIST PARTY has long known that, partly as the result of its brutal birth-control policies, China’s population would soon peak and start to shrink. It has been startled, however, by how rapidly that moment has drawn near. Now, it looks as if it might have arrived.
In November the country completed its ten-yearly census, and said it would announce the results in early April. As May arrives with no announcement, leaks suggest that the results have not been published because they are so shocking, and the party is in a flap about how to break the news. The Financial Times reported on April 27th that the census will show that the population has fallen below 1.4bn, still higher than the 1.34bn in the 2010 census, but lower than it was a year before.

Leaks are sometimes wrong, or reflect early estimates which are revised upwards. Global Times, a party newspaper, denied the report in the Financial Times, saying census results are “extremely unlikely” to indicate shrinkage starting last year. Oddly, it said a result showing a lower population in 2020 than in 2019 is likely to be “a statistical error”. The paper also acknowledged that a decline is likely to occur by next year. On April 29th, in a one-line statement, the National Bureau of Statistics said the population continued to grow in 2020. Either way, China’s demography is raising difficult questions for the party.
In 2015 the government relaxed the one-child policy, allowing most people to have a second child. The birth rate briefly rose, but soon fell again. In 2019 the number of new sprogs was the lowest since 1961, when a Mao-made famine killed millions and the population was half its present size.

A trickle of recent provincial data on birth numbers points in the same direction. Local figures on new birth registrations (separate from the census) offer a preview of what the census figures will probably show. For the first three quarters of 2020 the south-western city of Guiyang reported a 32% fall in births compared with the previous year. In the eastern city of Weifang births were down by 26% in the first half of the year. Hefty declines were reported elsewhere, unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.
There are also indications that China’s total fertility rate (the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime) has dropped faster and further than previously thought. Chinese planners have assumed a rate of 1.8, but some Chinese scholars (and the World Bank) say it is between 1.6 and 1.7. A working paper released in March by China’s central bank suggests the rate is no more than 1.5.

Such numbers make grim reading for the party. China’s working-age population, defined as those between 15 and 59 years old, has been falling since 2011. Meanwhile the share of people aged over 60 has risen from 10.4% in 2000 to 17.9% in 2018. The latest guess is that by 2050 one-third of Chinese will be in their 60s or older. Supporting them will put a huge burden on the young, unless the oldies can be persuaded to work longer. In a report published in 2019 the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warned that China’s main pension fund could run out of money by 2035.
A second demographic worry is the continued imbalance between men and women. Since the 1980s birth restrictions, combined with a preference for boys and easy access to prenatal scans, led to the widespread abortion of girls. In 2019 there were 30m more Chinese men than women and the disparity in the number of marriageable age will only grow. The government worries that young men who cannot find a mate may become a source of unrest.
Low birth rates will put more pressure on the party to abandon all its coercive birth-control policies. Fines still apply for having more than two babies, though enforcement varies. Lately the loudest calls for this have come from officials in the three provinces that comprise China’s north-eastern rustbelt. Birth rates in Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning are only about half the national average.
In February China’s National Health Commission said those three provinces could start allowing people to decide for themselves how many children to have. That is a right people in other countries take for granted. But it is unlikely to boost the region’s overall birth rate, or its flagging economy. A sociologist notes that local youngsters are fleeing to parts of China with better weather and more jobs.
“Most people want no baby or at most one baby, so even if you remove all the limits right now, it won’t have much effect,” says Zhang Xiaochen of Duke Kunshan University. Chinese have grown accustomed to the idea of a small family. High costs for housing, health and education further discourage fecundity.
Child-rearing out of wedlock is both socially unacceptable and officially discouraged, even as young Chinese are delaying getting married or shunning it entirely. Last year the number of nuptials fell by 12% to a little over 8m, the lowest since 2003 and well down on the peak of 13.5m in 2013. In 2005 almost half of those who got hitched did so between the age of 20 and 24; in 2019 only about one-fifth did so.
Officials are keen on policies such as cash payments to encourage parents to have a second child. But evidence from the 50 countries trying to boost birth rates suggests that this is hard. Providing cheap child care is perhaps the most effective policy. But that is much more costly and complex to deliver than handouts.
James Liang, an economist at Peking University, believes that China’s distorted demographics will limit the size of its market and talent pool and thus hinder its rise. China will never accept significant numbers of immigrants, he says, so America will have a big advantage. In the next ten or 20 years, China will continue to do well, but then America “will retake leadership and China will never catch up”.
The falling birth rate will bring forward another battle. A new five-year plan includes vague proposals to increase China’s retirement ages, which in cities is currently 60 for men and 55 or 50 for women, well below the rich-country average of 64. That will be deeply unpopular. And lengthening working lives also risks driving fertility down further, because many families rely on grandparents for child care. There are no easy ways out. ■

1866,"DISASTER STRUCK the world’s biggest social network on October 4th when Facebook and its sister apps were knocked offline for six hours. It was one of the less embarrassing moments of the company’s week. The next day a whistleblower, Frances Haugen, told Congress of all manner of wickedness at the firm, from promoting eating disorders to endangering democracy. Some wondered whether the world would be a better place if the outage were permanent.
A share of the opprobrium heaped on Facebook is incoherent. Politicians are angry but so far seem incapable of co-ordinating reform to rein it in. And investors have kept buying the stock, regardless of the bad headlines. Yet the company should take no comfort from this. The blind fury unleashed shows that its reputational problems have got out of hand.

Some of this week’s criticism was tendentious. Reports highlighted internal research showing that Instagram, Facebook’s photo-sharing app, makes one in five American teenagers feel worse about themselves. They paid less attention to the finding that Instagram makes twice as many feel better about themselves. Facebook’s critics are right that it should be more open. But the firm has half a point when it says that the hysterical reaction to unsurprising findings will lead companies to conclude that it is safer not to do such research at all.
Other complaints are really criticisms of the broader internet. The question of how to regulate viral content for children goes beyond Facebook, as any parent who has left their child with YouTube knows. Likewise, dilemmas over how the firm amplifies attention and how to draw the line between upholding free speech and minimising harm. Facebook repeated its plea that Congress should weigh in on matters such as minimum ages, rather than leaving it to firms. It has made a better stab than most at settling free-speech questions with its “oversight board”, a pompous-sounding but quietly useful body which dispenses rulings on matters from misogyny to misinformation.
The most damaging claim this week gained the least attention. Ms Haugen alleges that Facebook has concealed a decline in its young American users. She revealed internal projections that a drop in teenagers’ engagement could lead to an overall decline in American users of 45% within the next two years. Investors have long faced a lack of open disclosure. Misleading advertisers would undermine the source of nearly all the firm’s sales, and potentially break the law. (The firm denies it.)
Does any of this matter? Although Facebook’s share price has lagged behind some tech giants, it has risen by almost 30% in the past 12 months. Politicians threaten to break the company up, but the antitrust case is flawed. The Justice Department’s claim that Facebook is a monopoly rests on defining its market so as to exclude most social networks. The nonsense of this was demonstrated by the outage, when users flocked to apps like Telegram, TikTok and Twitter. The action is more an expression of frustration than a powerful argument about competition law.
But fury may matter. Facebook is nearing a reputational point of no return. Even when it set out plausible responses to Ms Haugen, people no longer wanted to hear. The firm risks joining the ranks of corporate untouchables like big tobacco. If that idea takes hold, Facebook risks losing its young, liberal staff. Even if its ageing customers stick with the social network, Facebook has bigger ambitions that could be foiled if public opinion continues to curdle. Who wants a metaverse created by Facebook? Perhaps as many people as would like their health care provided by Philip Morris.
If rational argument alone is no longer enough to get Facebook out of its hole, the company should look hard at its public face. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s all-powerful founder, made a reasoned statement after this week’s wave of anger. He was ignored or ridiculed and increasingly looks like a liability. ■",2
1867,"In an astonishing turn, AT decided to spin off Warner Media, a film and television company it battled to acquire just three years ago, combining the business with  Discovery, a broadcaster of factual programming. The combined company’s brands will include HBO, CNN and numerous Discovery channels. Together the pair spent more on content last year than their rivals and will have the biggest share of American cable viewers.  AT has now shed all its media assets, leaving it to focus back on telecoms.
A possible Bond trade

Amazon is reportedly in talks to buy  MGM, the studio behind the James Bond franchise, for $9bn. MGM is one of the few big Hollywood film-makers not to have been swallowed up by a media conglomerate.
Also joining the rush among media companies to consolidate,  TF1 and  M6, two French broadcasters, announced their intention to merge. The pair say that the deal will protect the independence of French content against the likes of Disney and Netflix. Regulators will be concerned by the 70% share of advertising on French TV that they would control.
The International Energy Agency surprised many with its “road-map” to net zero emissions by 2050. To reach that goal, the IEA’s report said that no new oil or gas projects should be approved, and that the power generated by solar and wind should increase fourfold by 2030. Underlining the challenge, for solar that would be the equivalent of installing the world’s largest solar park nearly every day.
Almost 89% of shareholders in Shell backed the management’s plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company has come under pressure from green activists who say this does not go far enough and from other investors who say Shell’s strategy lacks the focus of American giants, who remain centred on oil and gas. A separate resolution submitted by Follow This, a Dutch green investor group, was supported by 30% of shareholders, passing a threshold under British company law which means Shell must now consult with them.

Japan’s economy shrank by 1.3% in the first quarter over the previous three months. The declaration of a second state of emergency, which urged people to stay at home, was mostly to blame. In a sign that a recovery may be under way, exports in April grew by 38% year on year. That was the fastest pace in a decade, even if it is a comparison with trade in the depths of the pandemic.
Britain’s annual inflation rate leapt to 1.5% in April from 0.7% in March. The increase reflects a jump in consumer prices when shops re-opened in April and higher oil prices, which pushed up the cost of energy. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said he was carefully watching the data and if inflation persistently rose above the bank’s 2% target he would take action, “no question about that”.
China told its banks and payment companies not to conduct transactions involving cryptocurrencies and warned investors against speculating in them, because they are disrupting the “normal economic and financial order”. The price of bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies plunged in response. China’s central bank is well advanced in developing its own digital currency.
Light at the end of the tunnel
Eurostar secured a bail-out from investors, mostly in loan guarantees. The rescue package was led by SNCF, the French state railway group, which is Eurostar’s majority shareholder. The British government refused to take part; it sold its 40% stake in the company in 2015. Eurostar hopes to increase the number of trains it runs between London and the continent as travel restrictions ease.
Britain’s railways, meanwhile, are to face the biggest set of reforms since privatisation in the mid-1990s. The government published a plan that would bring rail infrastructure, timetables and ticket prices back under state control, but still contract train operations to private companies. The hope is that this will lead to clearer lines of communication between the government and the private sector.
Indonesia’s two biggest startups, Gojek and Tokopedia, said they would merge, creating a platform that spans ride-hailing, digital payments and e-commerce. The combined company, GoTo, will reportedly seek to float on stockmarkets later this year, in a dual listing which could see it valued at up to $40bn.
Working 55 hours or more a week is “a serious health hazard” according to the World Health Organisation, in a first global analysis of the effects of working long hours. Working at least 55 hours is associated with higher risks of stroke and heart disease, compared with working 35-40 hours. The disease burden is significant in men, people living in East and South-East Asia, and middle-aged or older workers.",2
1868,"IT IS NOTHING new for foreign firms to endure shakedowns by the Chinese Communist Party. As far back as revolutionary times, Chairman Mao’s victorious troops did not directly confiscate foreign-owned assets as their Bolshevik forerunners had done in Russia. Instead, they wore them down with higher taxes and fines so big that eventually companies gave away their assets for nothing. In one memorable case dug up by Aron Shai, an Israeli academic, a British industrialist in 1954 professed to be handing over everything to the Communists from “large blocks of godowns (warehouses) down to pencils and paper”. And yet, he complained, Comrade Ho, his opposite number, continued to haggle “like a pre-liberation shopkeeper”.
Though multinationals have flocked back to China since, the government’s nit-picking has continued, encompassing everything from technology transfer to how freely firms can invest. There have been big improvements, but the pettifoggery is a constant reminder, as one American puts it, that companies should not get “too big for their britches”. Western firms operate in China on sufferance and one day the country may seek to replace them.

As a result, some may have felt a sense of Schadenfreude that Chinese firms, not Western ones, have been the main victims of President Xi Jinping’s recent effort to socially engineer a new type of economy. In the past week alone the government has taken steps to reduce barriers between tech giants Alibaba and Tencent, and, according to the Financial Times, ordered the break-up of Alipay, a financial super-app owned by Alibaba’s sister company, Ant. Some go so far as to draw flattering comparisons between Mr Xi’s efforts to emasculate China’s tech “oligarchs” and the way governments in America and Europe are going after Western tech giants.
The heavy-handedness, though, is chilling to an unusual degree. So is the capriciousness. Kenneth Jarrett, a veteran China watcher in Shanghai for the Albright Stonebridge Group, a consultancy, says the question on everyone’s lips is “who might be next?” The crackdowns occur against the backdrop of rising tensions between China and the West that leave multinationals stranded in a sort of semilegal limbo. For many the lure of China remains irresistible. But the perils are catching up with the promise.
Besides banks and asset managers, some of whose investments in China have taken a big hit in recent months, several types of multinational firm are at risk. One group includes those that make most of their money in China from pandering to a gilded elite who flaunt their $3,000 handbags and sports cars. Another encompasses companies that irritate their customers for what can be construed as Western arrogance; Tesla, the electric carmaker, is an example. A third category includes European and American makers of advanced manufacturing equipment and medical devices that China feels it should be producing itself.
As usual, the threats come in the form of policy announcements that sound deceptively bland. One, “common prosperity”, is a catch-all phrase extending from a reduction in social inequality to more coddling of workers and customers to the nannying of overstressed youngsters. Its most obvious impact is on Chinese tech, tutoring and gaming firms, which have lost hundreds of billions of dollars in market value as a result of government crackdowns. Yet multinationals, too, have been caught in the fallout. In a few days in August the valuation of European luxury brands, such as Kering, purveyor of Gucci handbags, and LVMH, seller of baubles and bubbles, tumbled by $75bn after investors finally took Mr Xi’s common-prosperity agenda seriously.
Mr Xi does not intend to force Chinese consumers back into Mao suits. But his war on flamboyance, especially among the rich who may spend at least $100,000 each a year on foreign brands, threatens the most lucrative end of the market. It also imperils luxury marques that charge consumers in China more than they do in their outlets in, say, Milan. Flavio Cereda of Jefferies, an investment bank, expects the government to keep supporting a growing middle-class luxury market, since aspirational purchases reflect economic success. If China were to mess up the experiment, the shock could be huge. Its consumers account for 45% of the world’s spending on luxury, he says. “No China, no party.”
“Dual circulation” is another buzz phrase with troubling overtones. It is an attempt to promote self reliance in natural resources and technology, partly in response to fears that a dependence on Western suppliers could make China vulnerable to geopolitical and trade pressures. But it also poses a threat to Western multinationals in China by reducing imports of technology and creating a “buy Chinese” mentality. Friedolin Strack of BDI, a German industrial federation, notes that state firms in China have reportedly been given procurement guidelines that mandate domestic supply of devices such as X-ray machines and radar equipment.
Between a bloc and a hard place
It is all becoming a catch-22. On the one hand, America, Europe and allies are in a geopolitical contest with China, which they accuse of human-rights abuses in places like Xinjiang, home to the oppressed Uyghur minority. The West wants to restrict what technologies its firms sell to China and what materials, such as cotton, they source there. On the other hand, China asserts its right to retaliate against companies it thinks are wading into geopolitics.
Jörg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, says the size of China’s market makes it worth the discomfort. “The biggest risk is not to be in China,” he insists. Yet anyone with a long-term perspective might see Mr Xi’s undisputed personal authority, his gamble to reshape the Chinese economy, and the dark geopolitical backdrop as more than enough reasons to ponder an exit. It may never come to that. But as in post-revolutionary days, sometimes all it takes is one too many shakedowns to convince even the hardiest industrialist to throw in the towel. ■",2
1869,"NO SOONER HAD the Taliban marched into Kabul than politicians in Uganda, a mere 5,000km away, were readying for the arrival of evacuees from Afghanistan. “The world will look at Uganda as a reliable partner,” explained one cabinet minister. Another said that evacuees would bring business for local hotels. A third joked, grotesquely, about how Ugandan men were praying for the safe landing of beautiful Afghan women.
The first plane arrived at Entebbe airport on August 25th, carrying 51 evacuees. Up to 2,000 are expected in the coming weeks. They will stay in hotels while American officials review their applications for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere, a process which could take months. Uganda is among two dozen countries, from Kosovo to Costa Rica, that have offered to take in Afghans temporarily; Rwanda is preparing to host the staff and student body of Afghanistan’s only all-girls boarding school. The welcome they have shown puts richer countries to shame, but their motives are not entirely altruistic.

Uganda already hosts 1.5m refugees, more than any other country in Africa, with most coming from its troubled neighbours. Its openness draws on local traditions of welcome. Many Ugandans, including the president, Yoweri Museveni, know first-hand what it means to live in exile. But the country’s liberal approach, hailed by visiting dignitaries as a model for the world, also helps an authoritarian state to burnish its image and bring in money. Humanitarian aid provides rich pickings for contractors and officials. The arrival of the Afghans is a boon for hotels, emptied by the pandemic. America will foot the bill.
For Mr Museveni, whose government is busy shutting down civil-society groups, the crisis is a chance to repair his deteriorating relationship with the West. In January he was declared the winner of an election, after opposition supporters were shot, abducted and tortured. The Biden administration described the process as “neither free nor fair” and imposed visa restrictions on Ugandan securocrats. By hosting Afghans, Mr Museveni is sending a reminder that he can be useful in cleaning up America’s mess. And not for the first time: since 2007 he has sent Ugandan soldiers to Somalia, itself once a scene of inglorious American retreat. There they battle Islamists with American training and arms.
The use of African countries to process Afghan evacuees reflects “a growing pattern” of rich states shirking their responsibilities, says Achieng Akena of the International Refugee Rights Initiative, a non-profit group in Kampala. From 2013 Israel deported thousands of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum-seekers to Uganda and Rwanda, dumping them at the airport with $3,500 and no documents. The secret arrangements were long denied by the host countries. More transparently, the UN has evacuated asylum-seekers from Libyan detention centres to Rwanda and Niger. And this year Denmark passed a law that will allow it to deport asylum-seekers for processing in a third country, with Rwanda again rumoured as a possible destination.
Historians recall that during the second world war the British government sent 7,000 Polish refugees to Uganda, where they stayed for several years. The new arrivals from Afghanistan will hope they are not left in limbo for so long. ■",2
1870," (CNN)The question of who can or should get booster doses of coronavirus vaccines is much simpler now.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration have okayed boosters for every adult who got Moderna's or Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine six months ago or longer.The agencies had already said everyone who got Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine two months ago or more should get a booster. Friday's decision means everyone 18 and older who is fully vaccinated should consider getting another dose of vaccine.Previous guidance was more complicated and CDC vaccine advisers expressed relief at the idea that the advice would be more streamlined.""The current guidelines, so well intentioned and thoughtful, generate an obstacle to uptake of boosters. In pursuit of precision, they create confusion,"" Dr. Nirav Shah, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and director of Maine's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told Friday's meeting of CDC vaccine advisers before they voted to recommend broader guidelines.""Our concern is that eligible individuals are not receiving boosters right now because of this confusion.""SO WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR BOOSTERS NOW?Anyone who's at least 18 and was fully vaccinated at least six months ago. For those who got Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine, that means two doses. The CDC and FDA had already recommended that anyone who got Johnson & Johnson's Janssen one-shot vaccine two months ago or longer should get a booster dose.In most cases, people should be able to get a free booster vaccine by showing a CDC vaccination card.WHICH VACCINE SHOULD PEOPLE GET?The authorization to mix and match vaccines still applies, so it doesn't matter. People who got two doses of Pfizer vaccine may either get a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, or they may opt for a Moderna booster, which is a half-sized dose of the regular Moderna dose, or they can get a Johnson & Johnson booster. The same goes for all the vaccines. Plus, people who got a vaccine that has not been authorized in the US -- for example, an AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe or the Caribbean—may get a booster dose of Pfizer's vaccine in the US.Studies show that any of the three vaccines, given as boosters, bump people's immunity back up to levels provided after the second dose. For the J&J vaccine, a booster makes immunity stronger than it was after the first dose.Data presented to CDC's vaccine advisers Friday showed booster shots of either Moderna's or Pfizer's vaccine were safe, caused no worrying side-effects, and revved up people's immune responses regardless of age.One consistent pattern: Moderna's booster caused more immediate reactions such as sore arms, fatigue and headaches. Even at the half-sized booster dose, Moderna's product delivers more vaccine than Pfizer's full-sized dose does -- 50 micrograms versus 30 micrograms -- and doctors say it's possible that accounts for the difference. But there were no concerning safety reports from either, according to CDC vaccine safety specialists.HOW LONG UNTIL THE BOOSTER PROTECTS ME?As with the second dose of vaccine, doctors say it takes two weeks for immunity to peak. So the CDC is recommending that people get their boosters as soon as possible.People who have not received boosters yet won't be able to get one in time to achieve peak renewed immunity before Thanksgiving, but other holidays are coming and the prospect of winter travel has officials worried.WHAT ABOUT TEENS AND CHILDREN?The biggest risks from waning immunity are to older adults -- especially those 65 and older. That's why the FDA and CDC acted first for that age group, as well as for people otherwise at risk of severe disease, such as those with medical conditions, even if they are younger.The companies that make the vaccines have not reported any evidence that people 18 and under who got vaccinated are suffering from waning immunity or breakthrough infections yet. These younger age groups are less at risk of severe disease overall, and there's less of a concern about the danger to them from breakthrough infections.Pfizer's vaccine was authorized for children as young as 12 in May, which would put some children that age at the six-month mark. But the CDC and FDA are far more concerned about getting boosters to adults first -- and, most important, getting the first shots into the millions of adults and children who are authorized to be vaccinated but who haven't been yet.DOES THIS CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF WHO'S FULLY VACCINATED?Not in the United States. The CDC defines a fully vaccinated person as someone two weeks after having received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at least three weeks apart, two doses of Moderna's vaccine four weeks apart or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. That hasn't changed.At least two governors -- New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham and Connecticut's Ned Lamont, both Democrats, have said they don't consider people fully vaccinated unless they've had a booster, but so far those are opinions, not policies.IF I GET A BOOSTER, AM I DONE FOREVER?It's too soon to say. It's possible that as with vaccines like the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, once the initial few doses are out of the way, people can count on being immune for life. Doctors hope that boosting six months after the initial dose will provide much longer-lasting immunity than giving two quick doses a few weeks apart -- even as they agree that was 100% the right approach for a new vaccine being used at the start of a pandemic. It's also too soon to know whether immunity might wane after months or years. And it's too soon to know if a new variant might emerge and spread that evades the protection offered by a vaccine and, as with flu vaccines every year, the formula may have to be tweaked protect against the changed virus.",0
1871,"Bill Maher has dared House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to appear on his HBO talk show.
The Real Time host also scolded the far-left ‘Squad’ member on Friday for dismissing critics of ‘wokeness’ - which he claims is the reason Democrats suffered electoral defeats this year in Virginia and elsewhere.
Maher said he would 'love' to have Ocasio-Cortez on his show since there's 'so much to admire' about her, particularly her efforts to combat climate change.
'But that will probably never happen because Democrats don't go anywhere these days where they're not being adored,' Maher said.
'And that's my last bit of advice to them. Go where the ""amen corner"" isn't.
'Do Fox News. Be brave. Come here. Go everywhere.'
Maher added: 'Winning is about expanding the electorate.'
DailyMail.com has reached out to a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez seeking reaction to Maher's comments. 
The HBO talker also hit out at Ocasio-Cortez and the Democratic Party for turning ‘woke’ into a ‘pejorative’ that has turned off voters.
'If the word only made you think of rational, deserved causes like teaching a less whitewashed version of American history, AOC would still want to own it,' Maher said.
'But it's a joke because it makes you think of people who wake up offended and take orders from Twitter.
'And their oversensitivity has grown tiresome.'
In his monologue on Friday’s show, Maher mentioned that Ocasio-Cortez rejected criticism from political strategist James Carville that Democrats’ touting of ‘stupid wokeness’ hurt them at the polling stations.
The congresswoman from Queens and the Bronx tweeted earlier this month that the term ‘woke’ was primarily used by ‘older people.’
'Like the average audience for people seriously using the word ​""​woke""​ in a 2021 political discussion are James Carville and Fox News pundits so that should tell you all you need to know​,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted earlier this month.
She hit out at Carville, a former top adviser to Bill Clinton, tweeting: ‘​And before people disingenuously complain “woke” is denigrating to older people, it’s actually pundits like Carville using terms like “woke” to insult voters under 45 that’s denigrating.’
She added: '​Don’t wonder why youth turnout falls when Dems talk about them like this. We need everyone​.'
Ocasio-Cortez was reacting to an interview that Carville gave to PBS News House to discuss Republican Glen Youngkin's victory over Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia gubernatorial race.
Republicans also captured the state legislature in Virginia, which had previously been led by a Democrat majority.
The election in Virginia and other races nationwide this year has political observers predicting that the GOP will take back the House and the Senate next year.
'What?!' Maher said, reacting to Ocasio-Cortez's criticism of Carville.
'This is a term folks like you brought out very recently, had been proudly displaying it every march since.
'Just last year, The Guardian declared ""woke"" the ""word of our era.""
'I guess they didn't get the memo from the Mean Girls Club.'
Maher continued: 'What a great strategy, never missing an opportunity to remind voters how lame and clueless and hopelessly cool they are, especially since those are the ones who actually vote.
'But OK, fine. What word would you like us to use for the plainly insane excesses of the left that are not liberalism but something completely different?
'Because you can't have that word ""liberal"" from us and think it should cover things like canceling Lincoln.
'And teaching third-graders they're oppressors. That's all your new-think.'
Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats' so-called 'woke problem' was 'made up' to try and push the left away from fighting for racial injustice and election reform, which she claims could help them win.
'One dangerous aspect of thinking there's a 'woke problem' is that Dem chances for re-election or majorities in House, Senate , & WH rely on the racial justice issue of voting rights,' the New York representative tweeted earlier this month.
She added: 'Dems distancing from racial justice makes protection of voting rights less likely, ensuring losses.'
Republicans and establishment Democrats claimed that the party's embracing a more progressive agenda and going 'woke' contributed to the wave of defeats in this month's election.
She said that the term 'woke' is a way for the GOP to launch attacks and deflect from civil rights advancements – such as the teaching of Critical Race Theory in schools that became a central issue to the Virginia gubernatorial election.
'Woke' is a term pundits are now using as a derogatory euphemism for civil rights & justice,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
'Making up a 'woke' problem results in putting civil & voting rights on the backburner,' she continued.
'In a year state legislatures are planning out GOP majorities & voter suppression, that's dangerous.'
'People think Fox News is just about indoctrinating right-wingers, but it's also about conditioning Dems on what to run away from,' the three-part Twitter thread read.
Carville, who helped steer Bill Clinton to victory in 1992 aimed squarely at cultural clashes over race, education, and police funding as the heart of the matter, after Youngkin took down McAuliffe by winning over suburban areas that had gone for Joe Biden just a year ago.
'What went wrong is just stupid wokeness. Don't just look at Virginia and New Jersey. Look at Long Island, look at Buffalo, look at Minneapolis, even look at Seattle, Washington,' Carville said as he ticked off election results in an appearance on PBS News Hour.
'I mean, this 'defund the police' lunacy, this take Abraham Lincoln's name off of schools. I mean that — people see that,' he said.
He said Terry McAuliffe got 'caught up in something national' and blamed it for his loss (McAuliffe also has deep Clinton ties). 
Earlier this week, Maher appeared on Chris Cuomo's CNN prime time talk show and repeated his criticisms of 'wokeness.'
Maher, who describes himself as an 'old-school liberal', slammed the far left and progressive side of the Democrats which he called the 'party of no common sense'.
He added that he supported teaching the history of racism in America, but 'that's different than teaching children that racism is the essence of America.' 
'That's what people get upset about, or involving children who are not old enough or sophisticated enough to understand this very complicated history.' 
Maher also told Cuomo that he supports Dave Chappelle, who received backlash after making derogatory comments about trans people, and said he himself has received calls to be cancelled from conservatives and liberals alike. 
The late night host warned that Donald Trump would run for re-election in 2022 and further a 'slow-moving coup' take over the GOP with his supporters. 
As they discussed cancel culture and Maher's apparent diversion from liberals, Cuomo asked The Real Time talk show host if he was worried about getting cancelled. 
Maher shrugged the question off because he said 'both sides' have tried cancelling him. 
'My politics have not changed. I'm an old-school liberal. We were talking about the race issue. They changed, not me,' Maher said. 
'I was the old — we should be moving toward a color-blind society where we don't see race. That's the old way to look at it, I think that's still the good way to look at it.' 
Along with decades of criticism from conservatives, Maher has recently received backlash from fellow liberals over his opinions on topics like CRT and cancel culture.        ",-2
