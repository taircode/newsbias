0,"Two Los Angeles County stores became the latest victims of California’s “smash and grab” looting wave on Black Friday.A group of 15-to-20-year-old suspects targeted a Home Depot store in Lakewood around 8:30 p.m., making off with crowbars, mallets and sledgehammers, according to Fox 11 Los Angeles. The group, which arrived in as many as ten vehicles and ran into the store wearing ski masks, reportedly emptied out an entire section of hammers before taking off, KCBS-TV reported.The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department told the station the stolen tools could be used in more robberies at other LA-area stores.Meanwhile, in Beverly Grove, looters stole high-end merchandise and pepper sprayed those who tried to stop them, KCBS-TV reported.The robberies come after Los Angeles police chief Michel Moore told the city’s Police Commission on Tuesday that the department would be “dedicating resources to some of these higher-end locations to deter further acts of violence.” The “smash and grab” break-in comes amid a wave of similar burglaries in California.NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon.

That burglary, which resulted in three arrests, took place at The Grove shopping mall just before 11 p.m., CBS Los Angeles reported.The suspects fled the scene in four vehicles, according to the report. Police pursued one of the cars and arrested three suspects after they attempted to flee on foot.One hour before the Nordstrom incident, burglar reportedly stole $8,500 in cash from a CVS roughly ten miles away. Authorities are investigating to see if there is a possible connection between the two burglaries. One day earlier, a mob of robbers hit stores in Hayward and San Jose for the third consecutive day of looting in the San Francisco Bay area. On Sunday, a wave of 30 to 40 young people arrived at a jewelry store in Southland Mall in Hayward where they reportedly smashed glass counters and ran off. A second, smaller wave of people came shortly after to finish the job, Da Lin of KPIX-TV reported.Last weekend, a group of looters struck a Nordstrom in Walnut Creek, assaulting staff and intimidating patrons. They reportedly even pepper sprayed a few individuals.Governor Gavin Newsom (D.) said Monday that the California Highway Patrol would increase its presence around “highly trafficked” stores.“You will see substantially more, starting today, in and around areas that are highly trafficked coming into the holiday season, Black Friday, shopping malls, so the state is supplementing those efforts and we are going to be more aggressive still,” he said.",1
1,"A federal appeals court temporarily blocked a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for California prison workers on Friday.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request for a stay of a lower court order from September pending an appeal, delaying the January 12 deadline to have thousands of prison workers submit proof of vaccination or a religious or medical exemption. The deadline will be pushed back until at least March, when the appeal hearing will be scheduled, according to the Associated Press.The appeals court also moved the deadline for opening briefs up to December 13.U.S. District Judge Jon Tiga ruled in September that prison employees would either have to get the vaccine or a medical or religious exemption to do work outside the prison, including as inmate firefighters, or to have in-prison visits from family.NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon.

The CCPOA has warned that the mandate could create staff shortages if employees refuse to comply.At least 240 prisoners have died from COVID-19 and more than 50,000 prisoners — more than half of the state prison population — have contracted the virus, data from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation show.Don Specter, director of the nonprofit Prison Law Office, said the stay “puts both the prison staff and the incarcerated population at greater risk of infection.”",1
2,"New York governor Kathy Hochul (D.) on Friday declared a state of emergency to prepare for the COVID-19 Omicron variant.The emergency order, which will be in place until at least January 15, is intended to increase hospital capacity in the state in the event that the winter season and the new variant bring a surge in cases.The order will allow the state to use a “surge and flex system,” enabling the Department of Health to limit non-essential and non-urgent hospital procedures in situations where a hospital has less than 10 percent staffed bed capacity. The new policy takes effect on December 3.NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon. No charge.Get Jim Geraghty’s tour of the political news of the day.Get Kevin D.

However, we continue to see warning signs of spikes this upcoming winter, and while the new Omicron variant has yet to be detected in New York State, it’s coming.”“In preparation, I am announcing urgent steps today to expand hospital capacity and help ensure our hospital systems can tackle any challenges posed by the pandemic as we head into the winter months,” the Democratic governor added. “The vaccine remains one of our greatest weapons in fighting the pandemic, and I encourage every New Yorker to get vaccinated, and get the booster if you’re fully vaccinated.” Hochul’s announcement came on the same day that President Biden imposed a travel ban on eight African countries beginning Monday in response to the Omicron variant. The strain has been detected in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi. The ban followed an announcement by the World Health Organization that the variant has a “large number of mutation” some of which are “concerning.”",1
3,"The discovery of a new COVID variant in South Africa sent U.S. stock indexes plummeting on Friday, triggering financial-market uncertainty as well as travel and commercial restrictions in a number of nations in the continent and in Europe.At the open of the market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped nearly 835 points, or 2.3 percent, indicating a large sell-off in assets among traders responding to the development. The S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent at the start of the day, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 0.9 percent.Amid fears that the new version of the virus could be more infectious and vaccine resistant than the Delta variant, which has defied the vaccine in terms of prevention in some cases, the World Health Organization conducted an emergency scientific review of the strain Friday.At the meeting, the WHO classified the new variant as a highly transmissible virus of concern, naming it “Omicron.” The agency said that the first known confirmed case was from a sample collected on November 9.Brent crude oil also took a hit, deceasing 5 percent to under $77 a barrel, a record dip since July. Cryptocurrency tumbled as well, with Bitcoin reaching below $55,000 after hovering around $60,000 for much of the last week.Investors looking to evade risk piled into more stable securities such as Treasury bonds, the yields of which sunk in accordance with their inverse relationship with prices, as well as gold.While financial markets had calmed to the COVID storm for many months, shifting its sensitivity to inflation worries, unfettered fiscal stimulus, and the national debt, Friday’s market downslide appears to be a preemptive reaction to an impending COVID wave.Scientists seem to suggest that the new variant, called B. 1.1.529, has many mutations that could make it more transmissible and render the protective mechanism of the vaccine and natural immunity provided by previous infection less potent. The WHO will meet Friday to determine if it is a “variant of concern.”Many scientists had already anticipated a winter wave of the disease, in which confirmed cases spike during the cold weather and holiday season, but the new variant may pose a unique challenge to economies and medical systems.As the efficacy of summer vaccinations starts to wane, the United States and many other Western countries are pushing the booster shot to provide the immunocompromised and other vulnerable populations an added layer of health defense.",1
4,"The Salvation Army, the Christian charity famous for its festive collection boxes and volunteers around the holiday season, has adopted the teachings of critical race theory, urging members to actively confront their faith’s historic racism.In a guidebook titled “Let’s Talk About Racism,” the organization calls Christians to reflect on and rectify their contributions to the social inequities and prejudicial systems that have harmed minorities. Citing its “International Position Statement on Racism,” the organization writes that it “acknowledges with regret, that Salvationists have sometimes shared in the sins of racism and conformed to economic, organisational and social pressures that perpetuate racism.”An accompanying document created by the Salvation Army’s International Social Justice Commission, called the “Study Guide on Racism,” claims that white people are responsible for “unconscious bias,” an idea promulgated by critical-race-theory advocate Ibram X. Kendi. Kendi argues that white people’s legacy of racism is irredeemable, and that the only remedy is reverse discrimination as a matter of retributive justice to level the societal playing field.The study guide reads: “The subtle nature of racism is such that people who are not consciously racist easily function with the privileges, empowerment and benefits of the dominant ethnicity, thus unintentionally perpetuating injustice.”Despite their best intentions and commitment against it, the charity claims, “people can unintentionally and unwittingly perpetuate racial division.”“For instance, devout Christians who naively use racial epithets or a well-intentioned Sunday School curriculum that only uses white photography and imagery,” the Salvation Army writes.Toward the end of its guide, the organization presents a glossary of social-justice terms for members’ reference, including ” anti-racist,” “colonizer,” “domestic terrorism,” “fascism,” “inclusion,” “institutional racism,” “micro aggressions,” “systemic racism,” and “whiteness.”Taking from this extensive vocabulary, one lesson in the brochure informs that “structural racism . . . is the overarching system of racial bias across institutions and society. These systems give privileges to White people resulting in disadvantages to (blacks).”The organization also advocates against the philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr. and the concept of “colorblindness,” which long served to promote equality of opportunity and end discrimination on the basis of race.“While this might sound helpful, it actually ignores the God-given differences we all possess, as well as the beautiful cultures of our Black and Brown brothers and sisters. Instead of trying to be colorblind, try seeing the beauty in our differences, and welcome them into your homes churches and workplaces. Being colorblind also ignores the discrimination our Black and Brown brothers and sisters face and does not allow us to address racism properly,” the guide explains.The anti-racist guidebook represents a departure from the charity’s original charter, suggesting that it may have succumbed to progressive pressure. In 2019, the Salvation Army lost the financial support of the Christian company Chick-fil-A.",1
5,"With homicides peaking at 500 in November, Philadelphia has just reached — and is likely to exceed — its murder record, previously set in 1990.Amid the development that the city had reached this record, Mayor Jim Kenney lamented the rise of gun violence and declared creating a safe community a priority for his administration.“I never stop thinking about the victims and their families and the incredible loss these senseless deaths leave behind. And as we enter this holiday season, I can’t help [but] think of all the incredible potential that has been extinguished by the loss of life,” he said Wednesday.Kenney touted a recent initiative in collaboration with law enforcement, called Operation Pinpoint Strategy, to curb crime and “take record numbers of guns off the streets.”“Every one of these guns off the streets is one less that could be used to harm or kill Philadelphians,” he said. The startling surge in violence largely coincided with the COVID pandemic, which wrought economic and social distress across the country, resulting in higher unemployment.In June, Philadelphia’s city council authorized a fiscal 2022 budget that allocates over $155 million in violence-prevention programs to reduce gun violence. Out of that total, $22 million in grants is designated for organizations focused on “reducing violence through trauma-informed healing and restorative practices and safe havens and mentorship,” according to NBC Philadelphia.“Each and every homicide carries with it a profound sense of loss,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said in a statement. “However, for our City to have reached such a tragic milestone – 500 lives cut short – it carries a weight that is almost impossible to truly comprehend.”Outlaw suggested that her department is dealing with low morale because of the mixed rhetoric vacillating between demanding greater police presence and demanding their defunding or abolition. Like many police bureaus nationwide, Outlaw suggested that hers is struggling with officer recruiting and retention because of the confusing cues from the public.“How do we figure out what our roles are when our narratives are vacillating between: ‘We want more cops,’ ‘No we don’t,’ ‘Defund,’ and, ‘By the way, we want you to do these additional things but we don’t believe it’s OK to give you resources to do it,” Outlaw told Whyy.org. “It was a lot of counter-intuitive, conflicting narratives happening all at once with us caught in the middle of that.”Jamal Johnson, a local resident who participated in a hunger strike to raise awareness for gun violence in the city, finally ended the protest when the mayor agreed to meet with him to discuss the issue.“The people I talk with every day have a sense of lawlessness in their neighborhoods. They feel like the people who do get caught get off and those who don’t get caught are just doing it over and over again. They feel our government has given up,” Johnson told NBC Philadelphia.",1
6,"Amid the discovery of the new highly infectious “Omicron” variant of the coronavirus, the Biden administration has imposed a travel ban on eight African countries.The restrictions apply to South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi, a senior administrative official told Politico. While the order excludes American citizens or lawful permanent residents, they will need to present proof of a negative COVID test before re-entering the United States.The prohibition on travel to the U.S. from these nations begins Monday following the holiday weekend. The decision was prompted by the World Health Organization’s emergency meeting Friday, in which the agency classified the emerging virus as a highly transmissible strain. A statement from the meeting confirmed that the variant has many mutations that could render it potentially resistant to the current vaccine as well as natural immunity provided by prior infection.On Friday, stock indices tumbled as financial markets reacted to the shock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped over 800 points just minutes into the market’s open. Shifting from inflation fears and the supply chain crisis, investors responded to the impending economic risk of the new COVID variant by ditching equities for “safe haven” assets as fixed income and gold.",1
7,"Kyle Rittenhouse met with former President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club following his acquittal, Trump revealed in a Tuesday night interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity.“By the way, I have to say: Kyle, I got to know him a little bit. He called, he wanted to know if he could come over and say hello, because he was a fan, unlike the other guy,” Trump told Hannity. “He came over with his mother—really a nice young man, and what he went through, that was prosecutorial misconduct. He should not have had to suffer through a trial for that.”Trump says he met with Kyle Rittenhouse pic.twitter.com/RvaRaPIoax— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) November 24, 2021Fox displayed a photograph of the meeting, and Trump said Rittenhouse “just left Mar-a-Lago a little while ago.”NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon.

However, Rittenhouse claimed he acted in self-defense, and a jury exonerated him on all charges last week.The meeting with Trump comes after Rittenhouse sat for an interview aired on Monday with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. Rittenhouse slammed media coverage of the trial, rebutting claims that he was a “white supremacist.” President Biden also attached the “white supremacist” label to Rittenhouse during his campaign.“The lies that they can just get away with spreading is just sickening and it’s a disgrace to this country,” Rittenhouse said. “It shouldn’t have been a political case.”",1
