0," (CNN)Darrell E. Brooks, 39, of Milwaukee has been identified as the suspect who drove an SUV through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, leaving five people dead and 48 injured, authorities said Monday.""We are confident he acted alone,"" Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said at a news conference. ""There is no evidence this is a terrorist incident.""Brooks faces five charges of intentional homicide and more charges are possible, Thompson said.The chief said no motive is known. Brooks was involved in a domestic disturbance earlier Sunday and left that scene just prior to driving his SUV through the parade, Thompson said.Police officers tried to engage Brooks as he approached the parade in his SUV but Brooks drove through barricades. ""When the suspect was driving through and into the crowd, one officer did discharge his firearm and fire shots at the suspect to stop the threat but due to the amount of people, had to stop, stop and fire — not fire any other additional shots,"" Thompson said.Brooks was not injured in the incident.The five deceased victims range in age from 52 to 81 and include four women and one man, Thompson said.Brooks was out on bond before the crash, DA saysBrooks had been released on $1,000 bail earlier this month, according to court records and the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office, which said in a statement released Monday that the bail had been set ""inappropriately low.""Brooks posted the bail on November 11 in relation to charges including domestic abuse. The charges stemmed from a November 2 incident in which Brooks is accused of running over a woman with his car while she was walking through a gas station parking lot, according to a criminal complaint.""Officers observed tire tracks on her left pants leg,"" the criminal complaint read.Prosecutors filed five charges related to the incident including: obstructing an officer; second-degree recklessly endangering safety with domestic abuse assessments; disorderly conduct with domestic abuse assessments; and misdemeanor battery with domestic abuse assessments.Brooks was also charged with bail jumping, because he was already out on bail following a July 24, 2020, incident, according to court documents.In a statement, the Milwaukee DA's office now says that they should not have recommended such a low bail for Brooks and have launched an internal review into the decision.""The State's bail recommendation in this case was inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges and the pending charges against Mr. Brooks,"" the office's statement said. ""The bail recommendation in this case is not consistent with the approach of the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office toward matters involving violent crime, nor was it consistent with the risk assessment of the defendant prior to setting of bail.""CNN reached out to Brooks' attorney from the 2020 and earlier November 2021 incident about the DA statement, but has not yet received a response.With the 2020 incident, Brooks is accused of firing a handgun during an argument, according to a charging complaint. While arresting Brooks, authorities say they found a stolen handgun and three ""multi colored pills,"" which later tested ""presumptively positive"" for methamphetamines.Brooks was charged with two counts of second-degree reckless endangering safety while using a dangerous weapon and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon.Bail had initially been set at $10,000 in that case but because Brooks had asked for a speedy jury trial, which could not be met, bail was reduced to $500. Brooks was released on bail in that case on February 21, according to the district attorney's office.Brooks also has an outstanding arrest warrant in Nevada in an unrelated case for which he was arrested and allegedly jumped bail. CNN has reached out to a previous attorney for Brooks with no response.  Authorities in Nevada issued an active warrant on August 15, 2016, for jumping bail, according to Sara Johns, Washoe County Sheriff's Department spokesperson. Johns said detectives later determined Brooks was in Wisconsin; ""however, detectives did not have viable intelligence on Brooks' exact location.""",2
1," (CNN)Authorities in Wisconsin have identified the driver of a red SUV who they say intentionally drove his SUV through barricades and into a crowd celebrating the Waukesha Christmas parade.Darrell E. Brooks Jr., 39, is believed to have acted alone Sunday and is the only suspect, Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said Monday. Brooks faces five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, with additional charges based on the investigation, Thompson said.Brooks had been released from jail less than two weeks ago in a domestic abuse case, on a $1,000 bail that prosecutors recommended and now say was ""inappropriately low."" Brooks will have his initial court appearance at 4 p.m. CT Tuesday at which initial charges will be filed, according to a statement from the Waukesha County District Attorney's Office. The hearing will be available via livestream for the public to view.""We are working closely with the City of Waukesha Police Department to review the matter and decide what criminal charges will be issued,"" read the statement. Thompson said Brooks was involved in a domestic disturbance with another person just prior to driving his SUV through the parade Sunday afternoon. Police were not able to respond to the initial call about the domestic incident because they had to respond to the parade so quickly after receiving the call, the chief said.Police stressed there was no police pursuit leading up to the incident. Thompson said there is no information that Brooks knew anyone in the parade.  Five people were killed in the incident. They ranged from age 52 to 81 years old, Thompson said.The city identified the victims as:Virginia Sorenson, 79LeAnna Owen, 71 Tamara Durand, 52 Jane Kulich, 52 Wilhelm Hospel, 81 The police chief acknowledged the heroism of onlookers at the scene, saying first responders and residents worked together to triage the victims and get them as stable as possible.He said officers and citizens took victims to the hospital in their personal vehicles.At least 18 children were hospitalized after the parade, said Children's Wisconsin, a pediatric hospital in nearby Milwaukee.Thompson said the incident is not a terrorist event. The crash also does not appear to be connected to the recent verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with preliminary investigation findings.Suspect had been released on bail from earlier incident, DA saysBrooks was released on $1,000 bail earlier this month, according to court records and the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office, which said in a statement that the bail had been set ""inappropriately low.""Brooks posted the bail on November 11 in relation to charges including domestic abuse.

Johns said detectives later determined Brooks was in Wisconsin. ""However, detectives did not have viable intelligence on Brooks' exact location.""How the disaster unfoldedFamilies, including children in strollers, bundled up in the chilly wind and lined the parade route on Main Street. The city's live stream of the parade showed a marching band had just started playing ""Jingle Bells"" when a red SUV barreled into the parade from behind. Onlookers shrieked in horror.Another video captured by a paradegoer showed a young girl in a pink coat and hat dancing in the street as the SUV sped by, missing her by just a few feet.Another witness, Nathan Bryce, captured video of the SUV plowing through barricades.On Monday morning, the belongings of paradegoers were still strewn across the scene as authorities try to confirm what led up to the calamity.""This is still a very fluid investigation,"" the chief told reporters Sunday night. He said children are among the injured.A Waukesha police officer opened fire to try to stop the driver, and no bystanders were struck by the officer's gunfire, the chief said. Thompson added he doesn't believe any shots were fired from the vehicle.""The scene is now safe and secure,"" Thompson said.Victims include Milwaukee Dancing Grannies membersAuthorities have not released any details of the five people killed, but the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said some members of the group were among the victims.""Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages, filling them with joy and happiness,"" the dance troupe posted on Facebook.""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies,"" the group said.""Our hearts are heavy at this most difficult time, as more information and updates become available it will be posted. Please keep them their families, friends,  the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies and everyone who lives have forever changed in your thoughts and prayer.""Taylor Smith said her mother, Jane Kulich, 52, was representing her employer -- Citizens Bank -- at the parade when she was fatally struck. ""She was an amazing mom and grandma. Everyone loved her,"" Smith told CNN. Kulich is survived by her three children and three grandchildren.In a Facebook post, Smith wrote: ""My mom was killed last night. We are told she didn't suffer.""At least several of the injured were in critical conditionAurora Medical Center-Summit, a hospital in Waukesha County, said it was treating 13 patients as of Sunday night: three listed in critical condition, four in serious condition and six in fair condition.Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee -- the only Level I trauma center in southeast Wisconsin -- said it was also treating patients from the parade incident but is not providing a specific number nor conditions. Level I trauma centers typically care for the most critically ill patients.The 18 children hospitalized at Children's Wisconsin had injuries ranging from ""facial abrasions to broken bones to serious head injuries,"" said Dr. Amy Drendel, medical director of Children's Wisconsin Emergency Department and Trauma Center.The children's ages range from 3 to 16, and those hospitalized include three sets of siblings, Drendel said.'It hit at least two people right away and rolled over them'A video obtained by CNN shows the moment the vehicle struck pedestrians. A red SUV is seen hitting a person in a marching band. Then the vehicle continues forward, hitting and running over others in the band and crowd before driving away. Angela O'Boyle, who lives in an apartment on the fifth floor which overlooks the parade route, told CNN she was on the balcony watching the festivities. ""The next thing I heard were screams, and turned my head and saw the car come and plow into the band that was just past my balcony at that point,"" she said.""It hit at least two people right away and rolled over them. And then continued down the road to People's Park which is at the end of the block -- and then kept going, it didn't stop.""Boyle said she heard screaming and people yelling out their children's names, adding ""it was not something that I wanted to see ... a little freaked out.""Kaylee Staral, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel intern who witnessed the incident, said ""probably around 20 to 30 minutes into the parade, a red SUV came running down the middle of the street -- there were a lot of screams -- and we almost thought maybe it was Santa, but it was a red SUV and it hit a lot of people.""Staral went on to say ""there were multiple people on the ground.""""Right in front of me in the little spot where I was sitting, probably four people were down, so there were a lot of people that ran to go check on them,"" Staral said. ""I believe that the four people in front of me were still breathing but they were down, they were not moving."" Schools closed as a community mournsFlags are to be flown at half-staff at ""all buildings, grounds and military installations"" statewide, Gov. Tony Evers said Monday.""Today, I've ordered the U.S. and Wisconsin flags to be flown at half-staff as we continue to pray for the Waukesha community and the kids, loved ones, and neighbors whose lives were forever changed by an unthinkable tragedy last night,"" the governor tweeted.The school district of Waukesha said it canceled classes on Monday and will determine whether classes will resume Tuesday.  ""The District will have additional counselors available during the school day at all buildings for all students that may be in need of support services,"" school officials said in a statement. The White House is in touch with state and local officials, according to a White House official, and President Joe Biden has been briefed.""The White House is closely monitoring the situation in Waukesha and our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this terrible incident,"" the official said. ""We have reached out to state and local officials to offer any support and assistance as needed.""",2
2," (CNN)The tragedy in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Sunday brought the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies into a sad spotlight.Members of the group were among the five people killed when an SUV driver slammed into a Christmas parade, according to its Facebook page.The Grannies who died ""were extremely passionate,"" the post said. ""Their eyes gleamed.....joy of being a Grannie. They were the glue....held us together.""Who are the Grannies and what do they do? For one, they probably aren't your grandma's grandmas.The Milwaukee Dancing Grannies have been bringing joy to Wisconsin parade crowds from Memorial Day to Christmas, sashaying with their pompoms in costumes that fit the occasion, for decades.""They have won many trophies, but it's the enthusiasm and smiles from children and adults of all ages that warm the hearts of the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies,"" the group's website says. The only requirement to be a member is to be a grandmother, the group says. The Dancing Grannies was formed in 1984 from what was originally a jazzercise group, one of the members told CNN affiliate WDJT earlier this year.The group practices once a week, and it's clear that it brings them almost as much joy as they bring to parade crowds. ""Who doesn't like to hear wolf whistles at this age?,"" one member told WDJT.When the group passes the veterans stand, they do kicks and ""some kind of sexy hip thing,"" another said.The time together builds camaraderie and even family. They go out to dinners together and carpool to a parade in Minnesota once a year, a member told WDJT. ""It's a good time,"" she said. ""We all truly love each other, I think,"" one said. ""We are like sisters,"" she said in the WDJT interview that included a clip of the group dancing to ""We are family,"" by Sister Sledge. And they are dedicated. They practice at home to make sure they have their routine down, one member told WDJT. It's all ""wonderful aerobic exercise,"" a member said in a 2016 interview with CNN affiliate WTMJ. ""The crowds love us, it's amazing,"" one member told WTMJ. ""And what's amazing is what that does to us. That adrenaline starts going, and you just want to do your very, very best.""The group was devastated by Sunday's tragedy, the group said in Facebook.""Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages, filling them with joy and happiness.""",2

""She was so proud to be part of this group and lit up when she talked about it."" The Milwaukee Dancing Grannies did not mention how many members of the group were affected or injured in the incident.The group goes on to say they ""are devasted (sic) by this terrible tradegy (sic) with of loss of life and injuries in the Waukesha Christmas parade.""""Our group  was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages, filling them with joy and happiness.""

We would like to acknowledge the work of the men and women in law enforcement who have done a tremendous job to save lives and protect our community,"" the statement said. ",2
4," (CNN)Joe Biden is less than a year into his presidency and already his party is fractured over the question of whether he will -- or should -- run again in 2024.""Biden and aides tell allies he is running in 2024 amid growing Democratic fears,"" reads the headline of a Washington Post story detailing the machinations over whether the 79-year-old President is, in fact, planning to run again.(My favorite part of the Post story is that after assurance after assurance that Biden is in fact running, they drop this quote: ""One Democrat involved in campaigns said they couldn't think of a single person they had spoken to in the last month who considers the possibility of Biden running again to be a real one."")On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki doubled down on Biden's plans to run telling reporters on Monday, ""Yes, that's his intention.""The is-he-or-isn't-he news cycle comes hard on the heels of a series of stories -- led by this one on CNN -- detailing growing concerns over how Vice President Kamala Harris is handling the job of vice president and whether she really will be the frontrunner many expected her to be whenever Biden does step aside.Add it up and you get a whole lot of nerves and confusion -- all for an election that is almost three years away.And, at root, these stories raise two questions. There's the obvious one: Is Biden, who will be almost 82 by Election Day 2024, going to run again?And the less obvious one: Is a Biden 2024 candidacy the best thing for the Democratic Party's chances at holding the White House?The first question is utterly unknowable. I assume Biden hasn't even considered making a decision about it yet.The second question is more interesting to me -- since it speaks to where Democrats think they are and what they need.On the one hand, Biden would be running in 2024 as an incumbent -- almost always a good thing -- and a known commodity to the public. That, plus Harris' struggles to adapt to the VP role, suggest Biden may well be the party's best choice.On the other, Biden's approval rating is stuck in the low 40s. He has struggled to bridge the divide between the liberal and moderate wings of the party. And again, he will be in his early 80s when his first term ends.It's clear from the Post story -- as well as all the handwringing around Harris -- that Democrats are divided on whether Biden runs again, and whether that is a good thing for the party.The Point: While Democrats have some time to figure it all out, having this debate in public is not a great look.",2
5," (CNN)An arbitrator has ordered Kevin Spacey to pay almost $31 million to Media Rights Capital, the production company behind ""House of Cards,"" the Netflix series in which the actor starred for five seasons until he was fired in 2017.The revelation came in a petition filed Monday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, in which MRC is asking the court ""to confirm the award in its favor and enter judgment against Spacey and his loan-out and producing companies.""Spacey and MRC have been battling in the years since the actor was dismissed from the production over allegations of misconduct on and off the set.In its filing, MRC states that in October of 2020, an arbitrator found Spacey ""repeatedly breached his contractual obligations"" while starring as Frank Underwood on the Emmy-winning show and that his behavior ""rendered him (and his affiliated entities) liable"" for the millions of dollars lost by MRC.  MRC says the company suspended Spacey following CNN's report in 2017, in which several current and former members of the ""House of Cards"" production staff came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. One person also accused Spacey, who was an executive producer on the series, of sexual assault. ""MRC had no knowledge whatsoever of any such conduct by Spacey with any cast or crew associated with the Show,"" the filing states. Shortly before CNN's report, actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed News that the actor made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986 when he was 14 years old. MRC says it halted the production ""to address any concerns of the show's cast and crew"" in wake of the allegations, according to the filing. Following Rapp's claims, Spacey issued a statement claiming he did not recall the incident and apologized for what he said would have been ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""After Spacey was terminated, the petition says that MRC had to ""rewrite the entire season to omit Spacey's character, and to shorten Season 6 from 13 to 8 episodes to meet delivery deadlines"" and suffered monetary losses as a result.Following the arbitrator's decision, MRC released a statement on the ruling, ""The safety of our employees, sets and work environments is of paramount importance to MRC and why we set out to push for accountability."" CNN has reached out to Spacey's attorneys for comment. ",2
6," (CNN)Arrest warrants were issued Monday for five Georgia police officers indicted on murder charges for the 2019 killing of a 24-year-old man. Fernando Rodriguez died of asphyxiation after being placed in a prone position while he was handcuffed and held down, allegedly in violation of state law.  The indictment accuses Henry County Police Department officers Robert Butera and Quinton Phillips and former Hampton Police Department officers Mason Lewis, Marcus Stroud and Gregory Bowlden in Rodriguez's death on September 20, 2019, following contact with police outside a concert at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.  The indictment, handed down by a Henry County grand jury Friday night, charges all five officers with one count of malice murder, two counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault, and violation of oath of office.  A spokeswoman for the Henry County District Attorney's office said arrest warrants for the five officers were issued Monday morning. Each officer will be held on $100,000 bond and must turn himself in by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the spokeswoman said.   The five-page indictment says that Rodriguez died of asphyxiation. Body-camera footage shows him walking down a street fully naked, away from the officers when they tased him more than a dozen times.   The indictment accuses the officers of contributing to Rodriguez's death by stretching him out ""on the ground in a prone position, while he was handcuffed and shackled, holding him down and applying pressure to his body, contrary"" to state laws.  ""Rodriguez, who lived in the Atlanta area, was leaving the Imagine Music Festival at the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton when officers encountered him,"" the district attorney's office said in a press release. ""In addition to holding his naked body down on the ground, the officers struck Rodriguez more than a dozen times with their Tasers."" In an interview with CNN on Monday, the Rodriguez family attorney called video of the incident ""revolting.""""This is a clear civil rights violation, and apparently the DA agrees,"" family attorney Page Pate said. The City of Hampton has already settled a multimillion-dollar civil lawsuit, according to Pate. The city did not respond to requests for comment. ""They paid the family $3 million as soon as they saw the complaint,"" Pate said, adding that he anticipates Henry County to settle a similar suit.  Two lawyers representing the officers in their civil lawsuits did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Criminal defense attorneys for the five officers could not immediately be reached comment.  ""The family is very pleased [with the indictment]"" Page told CNN. ""They've been waiting patiently for justice. We know this is long process, but this is a good start.""  The Georgia Bureau of Investigation conducted the probe into Rodriguez's death, according to the DA office's press release. ",2
7," (CNN)Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James on Monday was suspended for a game without pay for the first time for making contact with Detroit Pistons star Isaiah Stewart in the face.James had been ejected during a game against the Pistons on Sunday.The ejection was only the second in James' career -- the first coming in 2017 for comments made to a referee. Sunday's altercation occurred with 9:18 remaining in the third quarter and the Lakers trailing 78-66 in Detroit. As a free throw was being attempted, James swung his arm backward while boxing out for a rebound, hitting Stewart. The foul led to a prolonged game stoppage while Stewart, with blood coming down his face, had to be held back by Detroit coaches and players as he tried to confront James on several occasions. Stewart was also ejected from the game.The Lakers went on to win 121-116.The NBA issued a release Monday saying that Stewart will be suspended for two games without pay for ""escalating"" the confrontation and ""repeatedly and aggressively"" pursuing James. James and Stewart did not speak to the media after the game. CNN has reached out to the Lakers for comment.Lakers teammate Anthony Davis came to the defense of James after the game, saying that James isn't a ""dirty guy"" and that he wasn't sure why Stewart reacted the way he did.""I've never, in 10 years, seen a player try to do that as long as I've been playing, at least in basketball. It's uncalled for. You got a cut above your eye, accidental -- like, it wasn't on purpose. And we weren't going to allow him to keep charging our brother like that,"" Davis said.Lakers head coach Frank Vogel said he spoke to James in the locker room after the game.""Yeah, that's really something that should stay in the locker room,"" Vogel said. ""I mean, I talked to him, yup, but I'm not going to disclose what his message was.""Stewart was ""upset,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said after the game. ""I told him, 'Don't let this define who you are. It doesn't define your game whatsoever.' I felt for the young man because he's such a competitor and he plays so hard. He's a great kid but he felt like he got cheap-shotted across his brow and on the street, it would be a different story,"" Casey said.",2
8," (CNN)Federal and state officials are investigating an attempted breach of an Ohio county government office, in one of multiple instances this year in which data from a local government office was circulated at a conference promoting false claims of election fraud. The incident at the office of John Hamercheck, who is president of Ohio's Lake County Board of Commissioners, involved someone plugging a private laptop into the computer network in Hamercheck's office, according to two people briefed on the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A third source briefed on the investigation, a US official, confirmed that the investigation centered around a private laptop being used at the Lake County Board of Commissioners.While no sensitive information was taken from Hamercheck's office, routine internet traffic unrelated to the election captured by the laptop was later distributed at an August conference hosted by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell that promoted false claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen, according to the people briefed on the investigation. Robert Graham, a cybersecurity expert who attended the Lindell-hosted conference, told CNN that digital copies of computer files that were labeled as coming from Lake County were distributed at the event.Ohio officials said there were layers of security in place to prevent any election-related data from being compromised, and that the Lake County computer network that contains Hamercheck's office is not connected to the Board of Elections computer network.Numerous experts and audits have verified that there was no widespread fraud in the election, and that the vote was secure. But the din of disinformation and conspiracy theories from supporters of former President Donald Trump has continued. Some election officials have faced death threats in what experts warn is a worrying trend for American democracy.  The FBI and Ohio officials are investigating the Lake County incident, two of the people briefed on the investigation said. The office of the Ohio Attorney General is also investigating, one of those people said. The Washington Post first reported the May incident at Hamercheck's office.  Hamercheck did not respond to a CNN interview request. The FBI declined to comment.Hamercheck told The Washington Post that he had been advised not to discuss the investigation, and that he was ""aware of no criminal activity."" In 2019, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive requiring counties to bolster their cybersecurity through training and assessments, among other measures. ""The cybersecurity protocols put in place in 2019 by the secretary worked and no election data was ever in danger of being compromised,"" Rob Nichols, a spokesperson for LaRose, told CNN.  The public disclosure of the Lake County episode comes after Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, earlier this year accused a Republican Mesa County, Colorado, election official of facilitating a security breach in May. The breach resulted in confidential voting machine login credentials, and forensic images of their hard drives, being published in early August on a Telegram channel affiliated with a leading figure of the QAnon movement.Images from Mesa County also were projected onscreen at the ""cyber symposium"" convened in South Dakota by Lindell.The Mesa County incident now is the subject of a criminal probe. The election official, Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters, last week said her home was raided by the FBI. Peters, a Republican, has not been charged with any crime in connection with the Colorado investigation, and, in court documents, she has denied authorizing any leaks.Election security experts told CNN they were worried that promoters of false election fraud narratives would be emboldened by these incidents unless there were repercussions. ""If law enforcement doesn't start charging people, prosecuting and holding them accountable, we are in trouble,"" said Amber McReynolds, the former Denver director of elections. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal agency that supports election security efforts, has doubled down on trying to combat election-related disinformation. The Biden administration has tapped Kim Wyman, a Republican former secretary of state of Washington, to lead those efforts, CNN first reported in October. Matthew Masterson, Wyman's predecessor at the CISA and a former official in the Ohio secretary of state's office, praised the state's election security measures. ""Ohio had the proper protections in place and responded quickly,"" Masterson told CNN. ""Other states should follow their lead as unfortunately this will continue to happen as the grift grows and there remains no accountability for those pushing misinformation about the 2020 election.""",2
9,"Washington (CNN)The Republican National Committee is paying some of former President Donald Trump's legal bills, using donor funds to help him pay an attorney representing him in a New York investigation into his company's business practices, according to campaign finance filings and a party spokeswoman.The RNC made two payments totaling $121,670 to Fischetti and Malgieri LLP in October, the committee's recently filed report with the Federal Election Commission shows. Ronald Fischetti, a partner in the firm and a criminal defense attorney, is representing Trump in a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's business practices. Fischetti did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Trump aides also did not immediately respond.The Washington Post first reported the payments.A spokeswoman for the RNC said in a statement that its ""Executive Committee approved paying for certain legal expenses that relate to politically motivated legal proceedings waged against President Trump."" ""As a leader of our party, defending President Trump and his record of achievement is critical to the GOP,"" she added.

10,"Washington (CNN)Brendan Hunt -- whose father is a retired judge and who allegedly threatened the lives of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, now-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- was sentenced Monday to 19 months in prison after being found guilty of one count of threatening to assault or murder US officials. ""We will not tolerate threats to members of the United States Congress or calls to overthrow our democratically elected government,"" US Attorney of the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace said in a statement. ""Not only will we investigate and vigorously prosecute these crimes, but today's sentence sends a clear message that those who seek to harm our representatives and bring chaos to our democracy will be punished,"" he said.Hunt, the son of retired New York City family court judge John Hunt, had been convicted by a jury in Brooklyn federal court in April.Prosecutors argued at the time that Hunt had posted videos of himself at his Queens home in January discussing the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, threatening to kill senators and encouraging others to go back to the Capitol on Inauguration Day and take their guns.Hunt took the stand in his own defense during the trial, telling the court that he didn't really mean what he said in videos and messaging apps about killing elected officials. Hunt testified that he didn't think his rhetoric about killing elected officials could bear real penal consequences because he'd seen the prevalence of ""kill Trump"" rhetoric, especially from celebrities.In a Facebook account registered to HuntBrendan, prosecutors said, Hunt posted his praise in December for people who have fought back against Covid-19 mitigation protocols -- and praised violence against police but also said people should instead ""go after a high value target"" like Pelosi, Schumer or Ocasio-Cortez.Prosecutors also showed the jury text messages that Hunt allegedly sent to his father around the time of the presidential election. In the string of messages, Hunt allegedly mentioned Adolf Hitler and said the American people would support then-President Donald Trump if he overrode the democratic process like Hitler did to remain president despite the election looking like it was leaning in now-President Joe Biden's favor.When asked about discriminatory rants to his father in private text messages, Hunt testified that he purposely said extreme statements to anger his dad but doesn't actually hold racist beliefs.",2
11," (CNN)Octopuses, crabs and lobsters are capable of experiencing pain or suffering, according to a review commissioned by the UK government, which has added the creatures to a list of sentient beings to be given protection under new animal welfare laws.Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.The report by experts at the London School of Economics looked at 300 scientific studies to evaluate evidence of sentience, and they concluded that cephalopods (such as octopuses, squid and cuttlefish) and decapods (such as crabs, lobsters and crayfish) should be treated as sentient beings. Vertebrates, animals with a backbone, are already classified as sentient in new animal welfare legislation currently under debate in the United Kingdom. ""The Animal Welfare Sentience Bill provides a crucial assurance that animal wellbeing is rightly considered when developing new laws. The science is now clear that decapods and cephalopods can feel pain and therefore it is only right they are covered by this vital piece of legislation,"" said Animal Welfare Minister Lord Zac Goldsmith in a statement.The Bill, which isn't yet law, will establish an Animal Sentience Committee, which will issue reports on how well government decisions have taken into account the welfare of sentient animals. It is part of a wider government Action Plan for Animal Welfare.The report said lobsters and crabs shouldn't be boiled alive and included best practices for the transport, stunning and slaughter of decapods and cephalopods.Learning more about cephalopods and decapodsThe report used eight different ways to measure sentience including learning ability, possession of pain receptors, connections between pain receptors and certain brain regions, response to anesthetics or analgesics, and behaviors including balancing threat against opportunity for reward and protection against injury or threat. It found ""very strong"" evidence of sentience in octopods and ""strong"" evidence in most crabs. For other animals in these two groups, such as squid, cuttlefish and lobsters they found the evidence was substantial but not strong. However, the report said these varying degrees of evidence reflected disparities in the amount of attention different animals have received from scientists. ""Scientific attention has gravitated towards some (animals) rather than others for reasons of practical convenience (e.g. which animals can be kept well in labs) and geography (e.g. which species are available where a lab is located). Because of this situation, we think it would be inappropriate to limit protection to specific orders of cephalopod, or to specific infraorders of decapod,"" the report said. The recent Netflix documentary ""My Octopus Teacher"" showcased the unique abilities of octopuses. The brain structure of octopuses is very different from that of humans, but it has some of the same functions as mammal brains, such as learning abilities, including being able to solve problems, and possibly the ability to dream.

12," (CNN)Sean Parnell, the Republican endorsed by former President Donald Trump for Pennsylvania's open US Senate seat, announced on Monday he is suspending his campaign. The decision comes after a judge awarded Laurie Snell, Parnell's estranged wife, primary physical custody and sole legal custody of the couple's three children, according to an order that was made public Monday. The judge also determined that Parnell committed some abusive acts toward his wife in the past.""There is nothing more important to me than my children, and while I plan to ask the court to reconsider, I can't continue with a Senate campaign,"" Parnell said in a statement.Parnell spoke with Trump on Monday to inform him of his plans, according to Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich. The former President had backed Parnell, an Army veteran and former congressional candidate, in September in the competitive Republican primary. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection, and Democrats see the seat as one of their top pickup opportunities heading into the 2022 midterms. But allegations against Parnell from his estranged wife had raised concerns among some Republicans about his viability as a candidate. Snell has accused Parnell of being physically abusive toward her and injuring their children on two occasions, claims that Parnell has denied.The judge wrote that he found Snell to be a credible witness when it came to her allegations of abuse -- although those allegations were not the most significant factors in the judge's custody decision.""I strongly disagree with the ruling today and I'm devastated by the decision. I plan on asking the court to reconsider this decision. In the order, two of the leading factors that weighed heavily in the judge's decision revolved around me being a leading U.S. Senate candidate,"" Parnell said in his statement. ""My focus right now is 100% on my children, and I want them to know I do not have any other priorities and will never stop fighting for them.""Parnell will still have partial physical custody of the children various weekends each month.""Ms. Snell is grateful that justice prevailed,"" according to a statement from the Gilliland Vanasdale Sinatra Law Office, which represented Snell. ""She has been awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of their children. She will continue, as always, to focus on their best interests."" 'A tumultuous relationship'   Court proceedings revealed a volatile relationship between Snell and Parnell, which ultimately hobbled Parnell's political aspirations.Snell has accused Parnell of throwing chairs at her; dropping her off on an interstate when she was six months pregnant and telling her to get an abortion; and choking and strangling her, according to court documents.""Upon consideration of the credible evidence, I find that Sean Parnell did commit some acts of abuse in the past,"" Judge James G. Arner wrote about the allegations of abuse regarding Snell. ""However, since the incidents involving Laurie Snell occurred so many years ago and did not involve the children, they are not relevant to this custody determination. I am not making a finding on specifically what did or did not happen.""As to the allegations that Parnell injured their children on two occasions, the judge concluded that the incidents occurred ""as described by Laurie Snell, but I am not placing weight on that evidence because a period of three and one half years has gone by without further incident.""The judge concluded that the incidents involving the children did not amount to child abuse and he noted that the children did not express concerns for their safety.""The fact that Laurie Snell has agreed that Sean Parnell can have substantial periods of unsupervised custody indicates she does not view him as a threat of harm to the children. The children have not expressed any concerns for their safety.""In evaluating the credibility of Snell and Parnell -- who often provided conflicting accounts in their custody trial testimony, particularly surrounding the abuse allegations -- the judge found Snell more credible.""She testified in a convincing manner. Her testimony was not uncertain, confused, self-contradictory, or evasive. Her testimony squares with Sean Parnell's testimony that they had a tumultuous relationship and fought a lot,"" the judge wrote.In contrast, the judge took issue with Parnell's demeanor in court, noting that Parnell dressed casually in jeans and untucked shirts. He also noted that Parnell looked at his attorneys and the news media during his testimony, rather than at the judge.""In evaluating Sean Parnell's testimony, I find it less credible. He simply denied that all of the incidents ever happened,"" the judge wrote. ""He was somewhat evasive. When weighing his position against Laurie Snell's statements of detailed facts about many incidents, Sean Parnell's position is less believable.""Senate campaign worked against Parnell In the judge's opinion, which followed a three-day custody trial, he concluded that both ""parents love their children and provide proper parental care for them,"" but he said the parents' failure to communicate and compromise prevented them from effectively sharing custody.The judge, who is required to consider 16 separate factors when determining custody, assigned the most weight to the children's need for stability and continuity, the parents' availability to care for the children and the level of conflict between the parents and their willingness to cooperate.Parnell's Senate campaign worked against him in the custody fight. The judge noted that Parnell would have been traveling frequently for a campaign and, if he had won, would have spent part of his time in Washington, DC.""These circumstances certainly restrict his ability to have primary physical custody of the children,"" the judge wrote.While Parnell had enjoyed Trump's endorsement in his Senate bid, the allegations from his estranged wife were taking a toll on his campaign, as CNN previously reported.Parnell had canceled fundraising events and ramped down his appearances in conservative media. Multiple Republican operatives in and out of Pennsylvania had told CNN they didn't see how Parnell's campaign -- which has leaned heavily on his children, including a large photo of him with them on his website's homepage -- could continue following the ruling.Earlier this month, Parnell staffers informed Trump's team that Parnell planned to suspend his campaign if he did not receive custody of his children.Budowich, the Trump spokesman, tweeted that the seat ""remains a top priority"" for Trump.This story has been updated with additional information.

13,"New York (CNN Business)Trendy soaps brand Lush Cosmetics is quitting Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat on Friday in a radical move to draw attention to how those platforms are damaging people's mental health.The company said Monday that its accounts will be deactivated on Nov. 26, the day after Thanksgiving, when most other brands and retailers kick their social media activity into high gear to win over holiday gift shoppers.Lush, which has more than 900 stores worldwide, including 240 across the United States and Canada, said it will remain off those social media channels globally until the platforms ensure a safer environment for their users. As much as Lush is known for its cruelty-free and organic bath bombs, shampoos and soaps, the brand also actively champions social and environmental causes such as Black Lives Matter, fights against deforestation and promotes sustainability to its 659,000 Instagram followers, 275,000 Twitter fans and more than 1 million Facebook followers.This isn't the first time Lush, a Millennials and Gen Z -favored brand, has tried quitting social media. The company made a similar attempt with its UK accounts in 2019 saying ""It was tired of fighting with algorithms"" and wanted to talk directly with its customers.The latest effort, however, is happening at a time when social media companies are under even more intense scrutiny over how their platforms may be contributing to mental and physical health issues, especially among younger individuals.Facebook is currently in the middle of possibly the biggest crisis in its 17-year history over issues about hate speech and misinformation, which have been amplified on the platform.""As an inventor of bath bombs, I pour all my efforts into creating products that help people switch off, relax and pay attention to their wellbeing,"" Jack Constantine, chief digital officer and product inventor at Lush, said in a release. ""Social media platforms have become the antithesis of this aim, with algorithms designed to keep people scrolling and stop them from switching off and relaxing.""The company said it hopes social media companies will ultimately enact stronger best practice guidelines. Lush said it will continue to be active on Twitter and YouTube. ",2
14,"New York (CNN Business)Say goodbye to Target runs on Thanksgiving.Target (TGT) said Monday that it will close all of its stores on Thanksgiving every year from 2021 on. Target closed stores last year on Thanksgiving due to the pandemic and had previously announced it will close this Thanksgiving too.""What started as a temporary measure driven by the pandemic is now our new standard,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a note to employees. Cornell said he decided to make the policy permanent after visiting Target stores last week in New York and New Jersey, where workers told him they were glad they could stay home on Thanksgiving.The pandemic pushed many other chains last year to close their doors on Thanksgiving last year, including Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). These companies will again close on the holiday this year, although none have made permanent changes to their Thanksgiving policies going forward.Target's announcement Monday was another sign of how the holiday shopping stretch in the United States has changed. While the holiday period used to be marked by a few big days, retailers in recent years have started their deals and events earlier and spread them out across the season— helping them avoid a crush of demand, which can strain their stores and delivery networks. This year, retailers moved up their deals earlier than ever to get in front of supply chain woes and limit empty shelves.Thanksgiving closures have been a source of tension between retailers and labor advocates in the past, especially as many retailers in recent years have opened their doors on the holiday to get a jump on Black Friday.Critics have argued that workers should be at home with their families on Thanksgiving instead.Over the last several years, public pressure on retailers to close on Thanksgiving has faded. Workers' rights groups have instead focused on broader issues such as the minimum wage, benefits and schedules.Some states, including Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island, have prohibited big-box stores from opening on Thanksgiving. A California legislator proposed a law in 2016 that would have required some companies to pay employees double for working on Thanksgiving, but it did not pass.Not all major retailers will close on Thanksgiving, however. Whole Foods, Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG), among others, will stay open.",2
15," (CNN)The House select committee investigating the January 6 riot issued a new round of subpoenas on Monday to five of former President Donald Trump's allies directly involved in planning ""Stop the Steal"" rallies, including longtime Republican operative Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The latest batch of subpoenas indicates the committee continues to focus, in part, on organizers and funding of the ""Stop the Steal"" rallies that took place on January 5 and 6, as well as earlier rallies in the months leading up to the US Capitol attack. Also subpoenaed by the committee Monday: Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, key players in the ""Stop the Steal"" movement after the election, who the committee noted are engaged to each other. Stockton was one of the administrators of a ""Stop the Steal"" Facebook group that amassed hundreds of thousands of followers before it was shut down by the social media company on November 5 -- the day after it was launched. According to the committee's subpoena letter, Stockton helped organize a series of rallies after the November 2020 election up to the rally held at the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on January 6, aimed at supporting then-President Trump and his claims of election fraud.Taylor Budowich, who is currently the primary political spokesperson for the former President and serves as communications director for the Save America PAC, was the final individual subpoenaed Monday. ""The Select Committee is seeking information about the rallies and subsequent march to the Capitol that escalated into a violent mob attacking the Capitol and threatening our democracy. We need to know who organized, planned, paid for, and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organizers had with officials in the White House and Congress,"" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, said in a statement.""We believe the witnesses we subpoenaed today have relevant information and we expect them to cooperate fully with our effort to get answers for the American people about the violence of January 6th,"" he added.The committee is asking the five individuals to produce documents on December 6 and has scheduled deposition dates for them throughout mid-December.Alex Jones In its letter to Jones, the committee cites press reports and his own statements to claim that Jones worked with January 6 rally organizers Cindy Chafian and Caroline Wren, both of whom have been subpoenaed by the select committee, in ""facilitating a donor, now known to be Julie Fancelli, to provide what [he] characterized as 'eighty percent' of the funding"" for the rally held on the Ellipse on January 6. The committee states that Jones was denied a speaking spot at the January 6 rally but that his previous comments indicate he was designated to ""lead a march to the Capitol, where President Trump would meet the group."" The committee acknowledged specifically that once at the Capitol, Jones told people ""not to be violent"" and to gather and wait for Trump to speak. Even though Trump never came to the Capitol, the committee said the location where Jones told people to wait ""coincided"" with the same place that ""Stop the Steal"" rally organizer Ali Alexander obtained a permit for that day. In March, CNN reported that police in Washington, DC, were investigating an allegation that Jones threatened to push another pro-Trump political organizer off of an event stage in December, according to people familiar with the incident.The allegation was filed with DC police by Kylie Jane Kremer, executive director of the organization Women for America First, a group that helped organize a series of post-election rallies, including one in a park south of the White House that preceded the Capitol riot on January 6.Kremer was previously subpoenaed by the select committee. The alleged threat occurred outside the Willard InterContinental hotel, located about two blocks from the White House, according to the police report. The Willard served as an election-related ""command center"" for Trump allies around January 6, and the committee has expressed significant interest in learning more about what was happening there at that time.   Taylor Budowich In its subpoena letter, the committee said Budowich ""reportedly solicited a 501c(4) organization to conduct a social media and radio advertising campaign encouraging attendance at the January 6th Ellipse rally and advancing unsupported claims about the result of the election."" The committee cited information on file with the panel to claim that Budowich directed approximately $200,000 from a source or sources to the 501(c)(4) that was ""not disclosed to the organization to pay for the advertising campaign.""Budowich was a senior adviser for the Trump 2020 campaign, specifically working with Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle. He is a longtime right-wing political operative, working as senior communications adviser for Ron DeSantis during his successful campaign for governor of Florida in 2018 and once served as executive director of the Tea Party Express.The committee might have particular interest in Budowich's connection to Guilfoyle. The former Fox News personality played a big role in the planning and preparation of the January 6 rallies. The committee also cited Wren as potentially being ""involved in facilitating the transfer of some or all of those funds"" that the committee claims Budowich is connected to.CNN has reached out to Budowich for comment. Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence In its subpoena letter to Stockton, the committee cited press reports to claim that he was among the group of rally organizers who communicated with Trump and other White House officials, including Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has been in an emerging standoff with the committee over his subpoena. The committee claimed that Stockton was among those who warned the White House of the possible danger from an unpermitted march that would reach the Capitol while Congress was certifying election results, and that Stockton specifically expressed his concerns to Katrina Pierson, a former Trump campaign official reportedly involved in the organization of the January 5 and January 6 rallies who served as a liaison between rally organizers and the White House. The committee said Pierson, who has also been subpoenaed, told Stockton and fellow rally organizer Amy Kremer, who has also been subpoenaed, that she would relay that information to Meadows.Stone, Jones, Stockton and Lawrence also have longstanding ties to Trump ally Steve Bannon, who is awaiting trial on contempt of Congress charges stemming from his refusal to cooperate with a subpoena from the committee. Both Stockton and Lawrence were involved in Bannon's ""We Build the Wall"" crowdfunding group, and in August 2020, federal agents raided their recreational vehicle in Mesquite, Nevada, hours before prosecutors unsealed charges accusing others involved in the group, including Bannon.Stockton and Lawrence released a statement Monday evening saying they had expected the subpoenas, but added, ""We are concerned that the timing during the week of Thanksgiving, while most normal business is closed, is further demonstration that this committee is not acting in good faith.""""In the many months since January 6th we have granted many reporters and outlets extensive on-the-record interviews because we are committed to getting to the truth about what happened. We remain committed to that transparency and pray for the opportunity to share our experiences to the public without the taint of misinformation that has become customary,"" Stockton and Lawrence continued. Roger Stone Meanwhile, the origins of the ""Stop the Steal"" slogan can be traced to Stone, a self-described ""dirty trickster"" whose 40-month prison sentence for seven felonies was cut short by Trump's commutation last July. A combination of documents provided to the select committee, press reports and Stone's statements demonstrate how he not only promoted his appearance at a January 6 ""Stop the Steal"" event, but solicited donations for it and stated his purpose at the rally was to ""lead a march to the Capitol,"" according to the panel's subpoena letter to him. The committee added that, according to media reports, Stone used members of the Oath Keepers as personal security guards, several of whom stormed the Capitol and at least one who has been indicted, while he was in Washington.Stone told CNN affiliate KOKI Monday night, ""I would probably assert my 5th Amendment right, decline to be interviewed.""In a statement earlier Monday responding to the subpoena, Stone called the allegations ""categorically false."" ""I have said time and time again that I had no advance knowledge of the events that took place at the Capitol on that day. Any statement, claim, insinuation, or report alleging, or even implying, that I had any involvement in or knowledge, whether advance or contemporaneous, about the commission of any unlawful acts by any person or group in or around the U.S. Capitol or anywhere in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021, is categorically false,"" he said.Stone was involved in the ""Stop the Steal"" movement's rise to prominence around the 2020 election. Along with Bannon and Jones, he was among the most notable voices pushing conspiracy theories in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election.At the time, Stone appeared on Jones' far-right radio show to trumpet groundless claims that Joe Biden was trying to steal the election, and Bannon echoed similar conspiracy theories on his podcast, calling the election ""a mass fraud.""Following the last major House inquiry into election integrity, after the 2016 election, Stone was convicted in federal court of obstructing Congress and telling five lies, about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks on behalf of the Trump campaign. He had sat for a more than a three-hour interview in 2017 with a Republican-led House committee. At his criminal trial, which occurred before the end of the Trump administration, the Justice Department successfully argued Stone lied to Congress to protect Trump. Trump later pardoned him.This story has been updated with additional reporting. ",2

17,"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN)Travis McMichael's attorney painted Satilla Shores, where McMichael killed Ahmaud Arbery last year, as stricken with crime, its residents as living in fear and his client as a well-trained former Coast Guardsman who was only protecting himself and his neighborhood.In Monday's closing arguments, defense teams added there was no evidence Arbery jogged through Satilla Shores and said many in the neighborhood were on alert after Arbery had visited an under-construction structure previously. Defense attorney Jason Sheffield's case stood in contrast to prosecutor Linda Dunikoski's closing argument that McMichael, along with his father, Gregory McMichael, and neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan Jr., had no legitimate reason to chase Arbery aside from ""assumptions and driveway decisions.""Live updates: Ahmaud Arbery killing trialThe men, who are White, targeted Arbery based on his race, Dunikoski alleged, but they want the jury to believe they were conducting a citizen's arrest and that Travis McMichael acted in self-defense in shooting Arbery. In actuality, she said, the men acted on gossip and rumors and had no immediate knowledge Arbery had committed a crime, which is required to claim a citizen's arrest. Challenged over inconsistencies in his accounts -- including when and where he told Arbery to stop, why he failed to mention citizen's arrest to police and why he told investigators he wasn't sure whether Arbery grabbed his gun -- Travis McMichael replied he was ""scattered"" and ""mixed up"" in the hours after what he described as ""the most traumatic event I've ever been through in my life."" McMichael also acknowledged several times that he never saw Arbery armed, never heard Arbery threaten him and that Arbery showed no interest in conversing with McMichael.""The state's position is all three of these defendants made assumptions,"" Dunikowski said, ""made assumptions about what was going on that day and they made their decision to attack Ahmaud Arbery (while they were) in their driveway because he was a Black man running down the street."" The arguments follow 10 days of proceedings and testimony from 23 witnesses.The McMichaels and Bryan face charges including malice and felony murder in the killing of Arbery, a Black man who was chased by the trio February 23, 2020. They have pleaded not guilty.Attorneys for the three defendants concluded their closing arguments late in the afternoon. Court was adjourned until Tuesday morning, when Dunikoski will give her rebuttal.Travis McMichael just wanted to talk, lawyer saysTravis McMichael had every right to stop and question Arbery, Sheffield said, because of a string of previous crimes in Satilla Shores. The defense attorney conceded many crimes were not reported and reminded jurors that some of the McMichaels' neighbors testified they didn't call 911 because the crimes were already over and the perpetrators gone.Because of delays in police response, they chose to take care of matters as a neighborhood, creating a Facebook page, purchasing cameras and establishing a watch program, Sheffield said. Compounding the McMichaels' worries was that a few weeks before the Arbery shooting, Travis McMichael encountered a man in the neighborhood who ducked into the shadows behind a house, and when Travis McMichael splashed his headlights on the man, the man pulled up his shirt and reached into his pants. ""That totally freaks out Travis,"" Sheffield said.Travis McMichael ""received extensive training on how to make decisions that would ultimately impact his beliefs as a petty officer and a boarding officer in the Coast Guard. He ventured into some of the most treacherous waters 200 miles off the coast of the United States. He trained relentlessly about his duty and his responsibility,"" Sheffield said. ""Even after active service and working in the Coast Guard, he trained weekly on what the law provided that he do, what his responsibilities were, how he would make decisions in critical moments of policing and critical moments of rescue,"" Sheffield added.McMichael testified he received Coast Guard training on use of force and de-escalation. Gregory McMichael is a former police officer and a ex-prosecutorial investigator. Because of his training, Travis McMichael pulled up alongside Arbery and tried to talk to him, Sheffield said, but Arbery ""takes off running down the street."" McMichael continued his pursuit and tried to de-escalate the situation -- ""we want to know what's going on,"" the lawyer says -- but Arbery ""bolts,"" which raised Travis McMichael's suspicions. By the time Travis McMichael got out of his truck seconds before the shooting, he was fearing for his life, as well as the life of his father, who had suffered a hip injury, stroke and heart attack in the past, Sheffield said. If Travis McMichael's intention had been to kill Arbery, he would've done it earlier in the chase, the lawyer said, and no one's life was threatened until Arbery ""ran across the front of the truck."" Prosecution: There can be no citizen's arrestDunikoski was emphatic that the McMichaels and Bryan were not law enforcement but rather the ""initial, unjustified aggressors"" in the incident, and none of them mentioned a citizen's arrest to police because they had no first-hand knowledge of a crime being committed. That much is evident by the questions they ask as they pursue Arbery, she said. ""'Hey, where are you coming from?' They don't know where he's coming from. 'What are you doing?' They don't know what he's doing. Remember Mr. Bryan heard, 'What did you steal?' They don't know what he's done. They don't know why he's out there running. They don't have immediate knowledge. They have no knowledge. They have speculation,"" she said.In order to claim citizen's arrest, Dunikoski said, defendants cannot be the initial aggressor or commit a felony. ""Wanting to question Ahmaud demonstrates uncertainty,"" Dunikoski said, and Arbery was simply being a ""looky loo,"" inspecting an under-construction home and nothing more, she said. A defense lawyer stopped Dunikoski during her closings and took issue with her summary of the citizen's arrest law. The defendants committed multiple felonies, Dunikoski said, pointing out that Arbery tried to evade the men for five minutes before Travis McMichael confronted and killed him. She also cast doubt on the notion Arbery was the aggressor when he was unarmed on foot and being chased by three men, two of them armed, in two trucks. In addition to murder charges, the defendants face counts of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony.""The bottom line is but for their actions, but for their decisions, but for their choices, Ahmaud Arbery would be alive,"" Dunikoski said. Laura Hogue, one of Gregory McMichael's lawyers, argued, however, that the McMichaels wanted only to contain him, not imprison him, and needed to hold him at gunpoint, not assault him. She cast their actions as a ""reasonable and measured amount of force to make (Arbery) stay where he did not want to stay.""The defense teams have repeatedly tried to present Arbery as a criminal and insisted that, even if he didn't steal anything, Arbery was committing burglary because he entered the under-construction home illegally. The property's owner, Larry English Jr., testified in September he probably told the McMichaels about incidents on his property, but he never authorized the McMichaels to confront anyone. Several people besides Arbery also entered the property, too, he said. ""Turning Ahmaud Arbery into a victim after the choices that he made does not reflect the reality of what brought Ahmaud Arbery to Satilla Shores in his khaki shorts with no socks to cover his long, dirty toenails,"" Hogue told jurors.Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, almost tripped trying to leave the courtroom after the toenails remarks, saying, ""I gotta get out of here."" She returned a few minutes later.The men's lawyers outline suspicionsArbery's family has said he was out for a jog -- a common pastime for the 25-year-old, many say -- when he was killed.Defense attorneys say the McMichaels, suspecting Arbery of burglary, tried to conduct a citizen's arrest. Bryan, the defense says, saw the McMichaels chasing Arbery, joined the pursuit and attempted to cut Arbery off, before recording video of the younger McMichael shooting Arbery. The McMichaels, according to their attorneys, and several neighbors were concerned about people entering an under-construction home -- and Travis McMichael had encountered a strange man in the neighborhood nearly two weeks before the shooting.According to testimony, a neighbor called police February 23 to say a man -- later identified as Arbery -- was at the construction site. Arbery ran off as the man called police, the neighbor testified.Hogue called Arbery a ""recurring nighttime intruder,"" alleging he had been to the house at least four times before. ""Ahmaud Arbery was not an innocent victim plundering through Larry English's house on February 23"" or the other occasions he visited the home, Hogue said. Gregory McMichael, investigators testified, said he saw Arbery run by the McMichaels' home and decided to give chase, believing Arbery matched the description of someone who had been at the site. The prosecution acknowledged surveillance videos show Arbery there multiple times, including the day he was killed, but says he never broke in or took anything. Witnesses also testified the McMichaels did not know at the time that Arbery had been at the site that day.Travis McMichael testified he twice tried to talk to Arbery. Arbery did not respond, Travis McMichael said.Bryan, prosecutors allege, saw the chase and -- not knowing what was happening -- got in his truck and joined the pursuit, at one point striking Arbery with his vehicle.Travis McMichael eventually drove ahead of Arbery, he testified, parked his vehicle, exited and pointed his shotgun at Arbery, telling him to stop. He testified Arbery darted to him, grabbed the rifle and struck McMichael before he then shot Arbery. ""(Arbery) died because for whatever inexplicable, illogical reason -- instead of staying where he was -- whatever overwhelming reason he had to avoid being captured that day and arrested by the police, he chose to fight,"" Hogue said. Bryan's presence was 'irrelevant,' attorney saysIn his closing argument, Bryan's attorney Kevin Gough suggested that even if his client had not been at the scene, the outcome would have been the same. ""I would respectfully submit to you that Roddie Bryan's presence is absolutely superfluous and irrelevant to the tragic death of Ahmaud Arbery,"" Gough said.If the prosecution is correct that the McMichaels ""were vigilantes and harbored some ill will towards Mr. Arbery, then what difference does it make whether Roddie Bryan is there or not?"" he asked.Bryan was ""armed only with a cell phone,"" and didn't realize that Travis McMichael had a gun until seconds before the shooting, Gough said. ""By that time sadly, there was nothing that Roddie Bryan could do to prevent this tragedy.""Bryan made the video of the chase and the shooting, and ""without Roddie Bryan, there is no case,"" Gough said. ""The reason that you can have this trial is because of Roddie Bryan.""Neither Bryan nor Gregory McMichael took the stand, and Sheffield suggested health concerns may have played a role in the latter's decision not to testify. In a county that is 69% White residents and 27% Black, 11 of the 12 jurors are White. Judge Timothy Walmsley said before opening statements the court has ""found that there appears to be intentional discrimination"" in the jury selection, but he allowed the case to move forward. If convicted on one of the murder charges, each man could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. All have pleaded not guilty.All three men have also been indicted on federal hate crime and attempted kidnapping charges.  ",2
18," (CNN)I was 11 years old when I left Los Angeles for the first time. My mother, wanting to celebrate my recovery from a mild case of polio, drove us to Yosemite National Park.It's been more than seven decades, but I still remember our car emerging from the nearly mile-long Wawona Tunnel and seeing the famous landscape of Yosemite from Inspiration Point. I knew immediately that I was somewhere special. Since then, I've been fortunate to travel to national parks across the country. I've even created films about many of them. In doing so, I've come to learn that our national parks not only protect our country's most spectacular natural wonders but also its stories and its history.Once I had a family of my own, I drove my children around the US to experience these places themselves. One of our favorite spots was Chaco, a remote canyon in the American Southwest. Within Chaco, we could explore the remains of what was once the center of a bustling and sophisticated Puebloan civilization that existed hundreds of years before Europeans first set foot on this continent. We were drawn to the history of the area, where we'd learn how Chaco's famous ancient structures spread across the remote desert landscape, a place to which many tribal nations and communities maintain active connections today.We explored the remains of structures built at least a millennium earlier, designs that would have stood taller and larger than anything built for hundreds of years afterward. Moving across the sun-weathered terrain, we would take in a place so remarkable it was made a World Heritage site by UNESCO.Being up close to this ancient history can make you feel small. And you feel your connection to the land while treading the same paths that others walked more than a thousand years ago to reach what was, to them, the center of their world.Today, we look back in awe at their monumental achievements. Sometimes, I wonder what they would think if they could look forward in time and see how we've treated the natural world.Chaco Culture National Historical Park protects around 33,000 acres in the area, but the magic of Chaco is spread out beyond that. The National Parks Conservation Association estimates that as many as 5,000 sacred Chacoan cultural and historical sites lay outside of the protective shield of the park.Unfortunately, these sacred and unprotected landscapes around Chaco have long been targeted for oil and gas drilling that desecrates what was once the center of an ancient civilization, and a part of the history of our continent and our species.I have feared for Chaco many times over the last few decades as proposals to drill for oil on the landscape were continuously granted. Temporary reprieves won by tribes and conservation groups averted some proposals. But despite those efforts, sacred lands and important archeological places still became drilling sites, bringing with them access roads and heavy-goods vehicles that cut through even more of the landscape.This is why this month's announcement that the Biden administration is finally taking an important step toward protecting one of the world's most culturally influential landscapes is so significant. The proposal for a 20-year ban of new oil and gas drilling on federal lands within a 10-mile radius around Chaco Culture National Historical Park is necessary.This landscape -- and others like it -- tells a story about the history of our country and humankind itself. Ancient people would travel for hundreds of miles to reach this cultural center, which has left behind archeological mysteries that continue to perplex us more than a thousand years later. These places remain sacred to the Pueblo and Navajo communities, and they should be incredibly important to all of us.There are many places with such rich histories around our nation. And while I am thankful that Chaco Canyon will now get the protection it deserves, we must do better in protecting the sacred lands of those who were here long before us.The Badger-Two Medicine area south of Glacier National Park has been the spiritual home and cultural center for the Blackfeet Nation for thousands of years, but tribal members and many others are still fighting to permanently heal and protect the lands that were targeted more than 30 years ago for oil drilling.Avi Kwa Ame in the Nevada desert is a sacred landscape for 10 Yuman-speaking tribes, as well as the Hopi and Chemehuevi Paiute. For many in the area, it is where all life was created. It has petroglyphs that date back centuries, and yet it is routinely threatened by reckless proposals for new energy development.Not even the Grand Canyon -- America's most famous natural attraction -- is safe. The Havasupai tribe, who live within the Canyon on their traditional lands, are still bravely fighting an epic battle to permanently protect their land from uranium mining on lands surrounding the park that threatens their only source of water.The United States is not even 250 years old. Meanwhile, these places collectively hold thousands of years' worth of history, culture and stories. We must preserve these lands.Even as an 11-year-old at Yosemite, I knew immediately I was somewhere awe-inspiring, and I still get that feeling to this day every time I visit Chaco Canyon. Some places are too special.",2
19," (CNN)Eddie Redmayne has addressed the controversy surrounding his Oscar-nominated role in ""The Danish Girl,"" calling his decision to play transgender pioneer Lili Elbe in the 2015 drama a ""mistake.""  The ""Fantastic Beasts"" star, who is preparing for a new West End production of ""Cabaret,"" was speaking to UK publication the Sunday Times. ""The Danish Girl,"" directed by Tom Hooper, is inspired by the story of Elbe, one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Although Redmayne was nominated for a string of awards for his performance, his casting as Elbe  prompted complaints, with many critics arguing that the role should have gone to a trans actor.At the time, trans writer Carol Grant described his casting as ""regressive, reductive, and contributes to harmful stereotypes."" She said: ""What should've been a celebration of a very complex, compelling transgender figure is instead transmisogynist, and just plain-old misogynist in general."" In his interview with the Sunday Times, Redmayne said the criticism was justified, admitting that while he had the best intentions, taking the role was a ""mistake"" and he wouldn't accept it if it were offered today. ""No, I wouldn't take it on now,"" the 39-year-old star said, adding: ""The bigger discussion about the frustrations around casting is because many people don't have a chair at the table. There must be a levelling, otherwise we are going to carry on having these debates."" Redmayne can next be seen playing the Emcee in ""Cabaret,"" opposite ""Chernobyl"" actress Jessie Buckley as Sally Bowles. Liza Minelli famously played Bowles and Joel Grey was cast as the sexually ambiguous Emcee in the 1972 film adaptation Redmayne asked those who might criticize his decision to take on a role often played by LGBT actors to suspend judgment. ""Of all the characters I've ever read, this one defies pigeonholing. I would ask people to come and see it before casting judgment,"" he said. ""Cabaret"" opens opens at London's Playhouse Theatre on December 12.",2
20," (CNN)Jeffery Lynn Johnson, 58, who appeared in ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,"" died by an apparent suicide during an argument with his wife, the Oklahoma City Police Department told CNN on Monday.  Johnson -- a former reptile dealer -- was one of several people interviewed in episode 4 of the enormously popular 2020 docuseries on Netflix. According to a police incident report, officers were dispatched to the Johnson family home shortly after 10 p.m. on September 8 for a reported attempted suicide.Johnson's wife, Charity, told police her husband killed himself in front of her during an argument in their garage. Their 4- and 5-year-old children were inside the house at the time, the report says.  Johnson still had a pulse on the scene and was taken to a hospital but was later pronounced dead, according to the report.  An attorney for Joseph Maldonado, the show's central figure known as Joe Exotic, confirmed he had spoken to Johnson's widow about the incident.According to the report, Johnson had ""no mental health history.""   ""Tiger King 2"" is currently streaming on Netflix. ",2
21," (CNN)Talking about mental health is good for you, according to pop star, actor and producer Selena Gomez, and she's determined to be the catalyst for positive change. Change your relationship with stress. Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter, a six-part guide that will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.The ""Ice Cream"" singer announced the launch of her latest venture, Wondermind, a mental health platform focused on connecting people with educational resources and ending the stigma around mental illnesses.She teamed up with her mother, Mandy Teefey, and The Newsette founder and CEO Daniella Pierson to create the media company, which is set to launch in February 2022.Gomez hasn't been shy when it comes to discussing her mental health publicly. She previously wrote for CNN about how she's a ""big advocate for social media detoxes"" and therapy.And she announced on Miley Cyrus' Instagram show ""Bright Minded"" in April that she has bipolar disorder. ""I went to one of the best mental hospitals in America, McLean Hospital, and I discussed that after years of going through a lot of different things, I realized that I was bipolar,"" Gomez said. ""And so when I got to know more information, it actually helps me. It doesn't scare me once I know it.""Her mother revealed being misdiagnosed for over 20 years with bipolar disorder that later turned out to be attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, with trauma, according to the Wondermind website's welcome video. Pierson opened up in the video as well, saying she has dealt with obsessive compulsive disorder since she was a child. The three said they struggled to find a safe space online where they could engage with uplifting content about mental health on a daily basis. Enter Wondermind.Daily commitment to mental healthThe platform's strategy centers around mental fitness, providing daily exercises people can do to strengthen their mental health. They will be launching physical products as a part of that plan, beginning with a physical journal that will feature creative prompts, according to Wondermind spokesperson Meredith Sidman. ""Your mind is truly like a muscle, and to work on it every single day, it does require content and tools, and we're so happy to deliver that to you all,"" Pierson said in the video.The site also hinted at the launch of a podcast that would be a platform for others to share their mental health challenges. Teefey will host the podcast and interview notable psychiatrists, athletes and celebrities, Sidman said.  ""I'm so excited about Wondermind because I want there to be a place of people coming together and understanding that they're not alone,"" Gomez said in the video. A slew of mental health advocates will share their expertise on the website, beginning with Minaa B., a licensed therapist in New York City, and John Kim, a licensed therapist and host of ""The Angry Therapist"" podcast. Long-term support for educationAside from Wondermind, Gomez's cosmetics company, Rare Beauty, launched the Rare Impact Fund in July 2020 with a goal to raise $100 million over 10 years to fund mental health education. ""With the Rare Impact Fund, we want to reduce the stigma associated with mental health, address the epidemic of chronic loneliness, and help give people access to the resources and services they need to support their mental well-being,"" Gomez wrote for CNN.

22," (CNN)New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not happy with her party.She made that abundantly clear in an interview with The New York Times over the weekend, suggesting that the passage of the infrastructure bill and the House approval of President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" measure are simply not enough to deliver on the expectations voters have for her party. And she also aptly diagnosed much of her party's current political problems.""Democrats have a trifecta and have been unable to pass voting-rights protections,"" said Ocasio-Cortez. ""And so people can wring their hands and say 'but Manchin' all they want, or 'but the filibuster' all they want, but at the end of the day, what people see are the results of their actions and the results of investing their time.""I think that's exactly right.The average voter likely knows one thing about our current politics: Democrats are in control of the White House, the Senate and the House. They are far less familiar with the narrowness of the Democratic majorities in those two chambers. Or with the filibuster rules that prevent any legislation from moving forward without 60 votes.That's not for a lack of trying by Biden, of course. He explicitly made the point about the narrowness of Democrats' margin in the Senate during a CNN townhall late last month. ""When you're in the United States Senate and you're President of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, every one is a president,"" Biden said to laughter. ""Every single one.""The reality, however, is closer to AOC's view. In voters' minds, they handed Democrats the keys to the kingdom, and they haven't been terribly happy with the results.Almost 6 in 10 Americans said that Biden wasn't focused enough on the nation's biggest problems, according to a CNN poll released earlier this month. That same poll showed that among those who believe the economy is the most important issue facing the country, almost 3 in 4 are not happy with the amount of attention that Biden has paid to it.While there is some broad agreement on the problem facing Democrats, the party diverges broadly on the solution.The view of most establishment Democrats -- including Biden and his White House -- is that they need to focus more on selling all that they have done to voters. ""I think the White House should do 25 presidential events in the next couple months just on infrastructure,"" said Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of House Democrats' campaign arm, earlier this month. ""And we should do 1,000 congressional events alongside those presidential events.""That is not the view of Ocasio-Cortez, however. Her belief is not that Democrats haven't sold their accomplishments well enough but rather that the party has been too timid to push the envelope legislatively in ways that get the party's base excited and engaged.""I think that if we pass the Build Back Better Act as the House passed it, that we have a shot to go back to our communities and say we delivered,"" said AOC. ""But that's not to say that this process has not been demoralizing for a lot of folks, because there were enormous promises made. Not just at the beginning, and not just during the election, but that continued to be made. And this is where I have sounded the alarm, because what really dampens turnout is when Democrats make promises that they don't keep.""If Ocasio-Cortez is right, the next few weeks/months hold little good for Democrats. The ""Build Back Better"" legislation is certain to be pared down in the Senate by the demands of moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona (among others). And then it will be sent back to the House for, effectively, a rubber stamp of approval -- a move that seems certain to further alienate AOC and her liberal colleagues from the process.Add it up and you get nothing good for Democrats as they try to find their footing ahead of the midterm battle for control of Congress.",2
23,"New York (CNN Business)Shares of upstart electric truck maker Rivian plunged as much as 17% on Monday after the company said that it is no longer working with Ford to jointly develop vehicles.Both Ford and Rivian had already signaled they were moving away from earlier plans to work together on EVs. But the news, first reported late Friday by Automotive News, sent Rivian shares down 3% in the last hour of trading Friday, and wider reports sent shares sharply lower Monday. By midday, Rivian shares were off their lows of the day. The stock rallied slightly in the last 15 minutes of trading but still closed down 8%.Rivian and Ford both issued statements saying that their plans and needs had changed since the original collaboration was announced, and pointed out that Ford remains a major investor in Rivian, holding roughly 12% of its shares outstanding. Ford had announced a $500 million investment in Rivian in April 2019 that included plans for joint EV development. But a year later it dropped plans to develop a Lincoln-branded EV pickup with Rivian, and no new plans had been announced.""As Ford has scaled its own EV strategy and demand for Rivian vehicles has grown, we've mutually decided to focus on our own projects and deliveries,"" said a statement from Rivian. ""Our relationship with Ford is an important part of our journey, and Ford remains an investor and ally on our shared path to an electrified future.""Rivian shares have soared in value since its initial public offering earlier this month, despite the fact that it has yet to report any revenue from sales of its electric trucks. Even with the plunge in price Monday, the company's market value of $96 billion is still about 20% more than the value of Ford's (F) shares. Amazon (AMZN), which has a contract to buy electric delivery vans from Rivian, holds an 18% stake in the company. Production of Rivian's pickup started in September, although it is still in ramp-up mode. The company is planning to use at least some of the proceeds from its stock sales to increase its own capacity.Meanwhile Ford recently announced a $7 billion investment — the largest single investment in its history — in a new assembly factory and three new battery plants it will jointly own with Korean supplier SK Innovations. The factory, which will build electric pickups, will be in Tennessee, and the battery plants will be in Tennessee and Kentucky. It is part of Ford's plan to invest $30 billion in electric vehicles in the next five years, with the goal of 40% of its total sales being of electric vehicles by 2030.Ford expects to begin deliveries of its own electric pickup, the F-150 Lightning, which is being built at a new plant in Detroit, sometime next year. Ford said that its battery electric vehicle plans are in ""a much different place than we were even a year ago."" ""While Rivian is doing lots of interesting things and we've got great respect for R.J. [Scaringe, the Rivian CEO] and his team, we like very much where we're at, and Ford and Rivian have both agreed we'll not pursue any kind of joint vehicle development or platform sharing,"" said Ford's statement. Shares of Ford (F) were up in midday trading.",2
24,"New York (CNN Business)The Chinese economy presents some unique challenges for investors. On one hand, China is home to several of the most dynamic and rapidly growing companies on the planet, such as electric car makers Xpeng and Nio (NIO) as well as privately held TikTok owner ByteDance.But China's recent crackdown on the tech sector has slowed earnings momentum at big brand name firms including Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA) and WeChat owner Tencent (TCEHY). Continued human rights concerns, brought to the forefront once more following questions about the safety of tennis star Peng Shuai, are also a problem for some investors. So can (and should) you avoid the world's second largest economy? Some experts think that's exactly what investors should be doing.""Investors have underestimated autocracy risk,"" said Perth Tolle, sponsor of the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets (FRDM) ETF, a fund that has no exposure to Chinese stocks. ""You can't always factor in the risk of a government coming in overnight and saying to a company 'you can't really make a profit,'"" she said. Tolle told CNN Business that investors should be more concerned about capital flowing out of the country due to worries about Beijing exerting more control over companies in mainland China.That's why her fund has more exposure to other markets such as Taiwan and South Korea instead of China. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) are two top holdings in the FRDM ETF.Emerging markets funds doing better without China exposureTolle isn't the only one screening out China from emerging markets funds. Big fund companies such as iShares and Columbia Threadneedle also have emerging market ETFs that leave Chinese companies out of their holdings. The funds have outperformed broader emerging markets funds this year, too, showing that investing for social good can be profitable. The FRDM ETF, as well as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (EMXC) and Columbia EM Core ex-China ETF (XCEM), are each up between 6% and 8% in 2021. That's compared to a 2% drop for the broader iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which owns Tencent, Alibaba and Chinese food delivery service Meituan as top holdings. Other investing experts argue that Chinese president Xi Jinping's recent push to crack down on big tech firms is not a good sign for earnings in the short-term.""We like the longer-term view, but in the near- term, we're more cautious,"" said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. ""Some other emerging markets have better growth potential.""""The move from promoting more entrepreneurship to an equal growth sharing of the pie changes the equation,"" he added. ""We took some money off the table and reduced our exposure to China.""Another portfolio manager argued that trying to predict which companies or sectors will come under the ""Xi Jinping thought sphere of influence"" makes investing there a challenge. Major Chinese education stocks have taken a hit this year as well due to regulatory concerns. ""The investor perception of risk has risen in China, and it has risen with cause,"" said Paul Espinosa, portfolio manager with Seafarer Capital Partners.   Espinosa also said China isn't as attractive as other emerging markets simply because stocks outside of the country are better bargains. Companies in Brazil and others parts of Latin America are more compelling values than Chinese-based firms, Espinosa said. He's also looking at investment opportunities in the Middle East.""Everyone is so focused on China, and it is dominated by growth investors,"" he said. ""But there are more opportunities outside of China."" ",2
25,"New York (CNN Business)Gas prices are skyrocketing, and Americans want to save at the pump. That plays right into the hands of Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club.The national gas price average jumped to $3.41 a gallon Friday, according to AAA, 61% higher than the average at the same time last year. The Biden administration has called for an investigation into whether oil and gas companies acted illegally to push up prices. The spike has pushed more shoppers to rely on these chains to fill up their tanks, say the companies, retail analysts, and fuel experts. Gas prices at warehouse clubs can be as much as 30 cents lower than traditional gas stations, and the chains offer members coupons to use in their stores when they fill up. Gasoline sales at the warehouse clubs are an important part of their business and draw customers inside.""People are seeking out the clubs because of the gas,"" said Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""It's US consumers' nature to go out of their way for lower gas prices.""Costco, for example, is typically 20 cents a gallon below the market average, according to Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at IHS Markit's Oil Price Information Service. BJ's says it's 10 cents below average.These companies are ""winners when gasoline prices go skyward,"" said Kloza.Costco (COST), Sam's Club and BJ's (BJ) want you to fill up your tank in their parking lots and then go stock up on giant jugs of ketchup, boxes of snacks and clothing. (And why not buy a flat-screen TV or a new couch while you're at it?) Their gas stations give these warehouse stores an advantage that many retail competitors can't match.  Gas makes up around 10%, $20 billion annually, of Costco's overall sales and 9% of BJ's. Walmart (WMT), which owns Sam's Club, does not disclose what portion of its sales come from gas.Gas is a notoriously low-margin business, but retailers can make money from selling huge volumes of gas -- even while charging much less than independent gas stations, said Kloza, adding that it's not unusual for sales at a Costco location to reach up to 1 million gallons a month compared to an average of 80,000 gallons a month at typical gas stations.Despite their big-brand names, the vast majority of Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell gas statons are independently owned, so they aren't able to make a volume play like wholesalers do. Although wholesalers are able to make a profit on gas, they're not making much: Costco, for example, reported that gasoline has a lower profit margin than the rest of its business. Rising gas prices typically help Costco's sales, but hurt its profits. ""When there are inflationary pressures and prices are going up, people look to save on gas,"" said Richard Galanti, Costco's chief financial officer. For every 100 people who come to Costco to fill up on gas, more than half go shop inside afterwards, he said.Gas sales at BJ's Wholesale Club jumped 20% during its most recent quarter ending October 30 compared with the same time a year ago. BJ's is growing market share in gasoline ""in leaps and bounds,"" CEO Robert Eddy said on a call with analysts Thursday. When gas prices hit over $3 a gallon, ""members love us"" and shift their gas spending to the club.Gas discounts are a tool Walmart uses to encourage customers to sign up for Walmart+ memberships, which also offer free shipping and discounts on prescriptions.Walmart said on Tuesday that it's actively trying to keep gas prices down to attract customers worried about how much they're paying at the pump, especially as federal stimulus benefits wane.""Gas prices are a concern....They're up dramatically versus a year ago,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on an earnings call. ""The customers had money [then]. And at some point, that's going to come to an end."" ",2
26,"New York (CNN Business)CVS' announcement Thursday that it will close 900 stores over the next three years — around 10% of its pharmacies — may have caught some shoppers off guard.Isn't CVS doing really well right now? Haven't lots of people gone to drug stores during the pandemic to stock up on hand sanitizer, cleaning wipes and toilet paper? What about all those Covid-19 vaccine shots CVS gives out?Actually, CVS' closures shouldn't come as a surprise. They are the latest moves in the long-running contraction of the US retail pharmacy sector. CVS (CVS), Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have been shuttering stores for years, while independent pharmacies have come under pressure from chains. Drug store closures can hurt local communities, creating access gaps for medications and essentials.CVS, the largest drug store chain in the United States, pointed to ""changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs"" as factors in its decision to close stores. Here's why CVS will close 900 stores.Pivot to health careThe future of CVS is not selling snacks, candy, shampoo and greeting cards. It's in health care.To that end, in 2018 CVS completed a $69 billion acquisition of Aetna, the largest health care deal in history, to create a gigantic customer base of about 40 million Americans. CVS bet that the deal will increase its profits from those patients' health plans while helping to lower its costs. CVS also has been revamping its retail strategy and said Thursday that its stores will have three distinct models: locations that offer primary care services; ""HealthHub"" stores that have on-site dieticians, nurse practitioners and lab services, and on-site treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma; and traditional stores.CVS is ""really pivoting and leaning into the health care aspects of the business,"" said George Hill, an analyst who covers the company and the health care industry at Deutsche Bank. ""You'd much rather be selling health care services that are high-dollar value, high-margin versus greeting cards.""Too many storesWhen you walk down the street or drive around the suburbs you'll typically pass a CVS. And then hit a Walgreens right next door. Rite Aid is probably pretty close, too. ""There's too many pharmacies in the country and there's too much pharmacy capacity. That gives CVS a reason to go,"" said Hill.CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020, yet it still has more than 9,900 stores. That's more than Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST) — combined.Its latest closings will ""reduce store density in certain locations,"" CVS said Thursday, which translates into the fact that CVS has too many stores too close to each other in some places.Competition from Amazon and Dollar GeneralAlso, fewer people are heading to CVS and other drug stores to fill their prescriptions and shop for household staples these days. (And they're not going into CVS to buy tobacco, either, which the company stopped selling in 2014.)Some shoppers have replaced their trips to stores like CVS by buying their supplies online from Amazon (AMZN), or from brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart and Target. The chains have built their own strong e-commerce businesses in recent years.Dollar General (DG) has also grabbed market share from drug stores, undercutting the sector with lower prices on similar items. And now Dollar General is launching its own health care initiative as it continues to take business from pharmacies.Online pharmacies and telemedicine have gained traction, too. Amazon bought PillPack in 2018 for more than $700 million and started shipping prescriptions to Prime members last year. Capsule and other digital pharmacies that deliver directly to customers' homes are also growing. Although brick-and-mortar pharmacies are still an important stop for many elderly people,or those who don't use the web or have access to it, they are increasingly becoming a thing of the past to the growing ranks of online shoppers.Rising costsClosing stores also reduces CVS' costs while still keeping most of its sales. Its labor and store operations costs increased during the pandemic because of safety protections like plexiglass, floor decals and masks. The company said in August it planned to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 in a bid to retain and attract workers.""There are cost pressures in all directions,"" said Hill, the Deutsche Bank analyst.Seventy-five percent of CVS' sales comes from filling prescriptions, but its profits from that segment have declined in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates.But when CVS closes a store, it can hold onto most of those sales by shifting the prescriptions to its nearest pharmacies, Hill said.Covid-19 vaccines weren't a huge boostCVS got a lift from people coming into its stores for their Covid-19 vaccines and tests. The company has administered 43 million vaccines and around 38 million tests, CEO Karen Lynch said on an earnings call earlier this month.But the vaccines were only a short-term gain for the company, which said they will generate only $3 billion in revenue in 2021. That will decline by up to 40% next year, along with whatever sales CVS racked up as shoppers browsed aisles while they waited to get vaccinated, Lynch said.People also visited their doctors less frequently last year and into 2021, and elective procedures were suspended early in the pandemic, which meant that CVS filled fewer regular and chronic care prescriptions than in the years before the pandemic. And fewer people have also been coming into stores to pick up cough and fever medicines — big business for CVS — because they're still wearing masks and spending more time at home than they once did.",2
27," (CNN)As we gather this Thanksgiving, many families will have an empty chair at the table. Covid-19 took so many of our loved ones, and we will be grieving these losses. Others may be absent because they are quarantining, taking extra precautions or choosing not to travel.  For many families, there may be another reason for those empty places at the table: disagreements too strong to permit physical togetherness. Some people have entered so far into a world fueled by disinformation that they can no longer converse with those who don't share their views on issues like public health or politics. A February 2021 CBS/YouGov poll revealed that 57% of Republicans consider Democrats not just political opponents but enemies. The poll showed that 41% of Democrats see Republicans the same way.  With the holidays approaching, the deepening polarization can play out in painful ways, and add another layer of tension to social and family gatherings. Almost everyone I know worries about ruptured or strained relationships with friends or family members who are caught up in a vortex of disinformation and immersed in alternate versions of reality, including the popular conspiracy theory QAnon.  I know what it's like to see a loved one drift away until they are unreachable through logic, reason or evidence. During the pandemic, a family member previously known for her common sense became radicalized. She lives in England and strict lockdowns there meant that coffees and lunches with friends of all political persuasions turned into extra hours in front of the television watching her new favorite source of information, Russia Today (RT). The Kremlin-backed broadcaster, which has a broad reach with nearly two dozen bureaus around the world, is key to Russian information warfare that aims to get non-Russians to see the world in ways that benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies. It worked like a charm on her. As her frustration with the pandemic's disruptions of life increased, so did her need to find someone, or something, to blame. Our phone conversations turned one-sided as she scapegoated immigrants for the spread of Covid-19 and, starting in January 2021, ranted about how Joe Biden was ruining America, her country of residence for many years.   By summer 2021, she no longer asked for news of me and other family members. Months of RT had left her deep in a world of disinformation, and she grew increasingly angry. In June, after the Biden-Putin summit, she complained that Biden wasn't helping Putin expand in Eastern Europe (it's notable that she had never once mentioned Putin before becoming an avid consumer of RT).  When I asked her to watch a clip of my live commentary on NBC, in which I talked about Putin's imperialist policies, she became incensed and yelled, ""You're a liar!"" before she hung up the phone. Feeling frustrated, I stopped communicating with her. As it turns out, this was a counter-productive move.   Like radicalization, disengagement is a process. There is no quick and easy way to lead someone back into reality, or to defuse their trigger points on issues they care about, even if evidence becomes overwhelming that their positions have no foundation.  In fact, followers of cults and authoritarian dogma who begin to doubt the truth of their convictions may initially dig their heels in. The more an individual has invested in the alternate reality, the more they are reluctant to admit to others, and to themselves, that they have misjudged the situation. Many prefer to live in denial rather than experience the shame or humiliation that they were wrong. For some, this urge to save face can be a powerful force even in life and death situations, as sociologist Brooke Harrington writes of pandemic and vaccine deniers who have fallen sick with Covid-19 and continue to uphold their views while in the ICU.                 This is why, as we get together this holiday season, we might heed the advice of experts like Steven Hassan, who encourages people not to cast judgment or reprimand their loved ones who are immersed in disinformation. We might also resist the temptation to present individuals with evidence of the falsity of their beliefs; I know from my own experience that such evidence often comes from sources that these loved ones consider to be ""fake news,"" and will be immediately dismissed - even if, in my case, that news is written by a family member. What we can do is keep them close and find common ground on other issues, as hard as that might be. This does not mean we accept or validate their racist or anti-science beliefs, but rather aim to be strategic. After all, if we cut them off or yell at them, we simply magnify the chances that they will remain siloed among like-minded people. ",2
28," (CNN)This past summer's Covid-19 surge, which burned through large swaths of the country, peaked in early September after reaching about 160,000 cases per day. The subsequent decline in cases was steep, but after two months, infections in the United States are rising again.  We have tools to blunt the escalation of new cases, but we must act now with a sense of urgency -- and that means intensifying efforts to increase vaccination rates in all age groups, using a range of strategies including broad vaccine mandates such as the Biden Administration's requirement for businesses employing more than 100 workers to have employees get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. Unfortunately, last week the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed a previous stay of Biden's new vaccine mandate. In response, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has temporarily suspended enforcement of the rule which was set to fully take effect on January 4. The court's decision was ill-conceived and risks needlessly prolonging the pandemic in the United States. Although almost 196 million Americans are now fully vaccinated, this number amounts to only 59% of the US population. Despite easy vaccine availability in the country for more than six months, 30% of adults are not fully vaccinated. It's not clear what proportion of the population must be inoculated to attain community immunity, but Belgium currently has one of the world's highest Covid-19 case rates despite having completely vaccinated 74% of its population. Germany has vaccinated 10% more of its population than the United States but its seven-day incidence rate hit a record of 336.9 cases per 100,000 people this week, up from 249.1 cases reported last week.As countries in Europe see a surge in cases, the World Health Organization said to be ""very worried"" and flagged that, at the current pace, over 500,000 more deaths could be recorded by March. A winter spike in Covid-19 cases has been expected because the virus spreads more easily as people spend more time indoors, but the magnitude of this latest surge will be dictated by the level of vaccination in the community and we must do better.  In just 11 months, the US has managed to administer more than 437 million doses of vaccines, a remarkable achievement, but with well over 100 million people still unvaccinated, the level of immunity is not nearly high enough to ward off a new surge. Over the past 14 days, cases in the US have risen 17%, now averaging more than 85,000 cases per day. Hospitalizations and deaths are still declining, but the rate of decline is slowing, and will likely soon start to rise again.  To prevent a large winter Covid-19 spike, we must first and foremost vaccinate millions of people and do so quickly. The latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows that 20% of American adults say they will definitely not get the vaccine or will do so only if required. For many in this hard-core resistant minority, only a mandate linked to their job is likely to sway their decision.  Vaccine mandates are not new to the United States. All 50 states, the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia mandate vaccines for children attending schools. The US Department of Defense requires 17 different vaccines for military personnel. Many health care facilities require an annual influenza vaccination for all employees.  The Supreme Court of the United States has previously ruled in favor of a vaccine mandate. Writing for the majority in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, which upheld the state's smallpox vaccine requirement, Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, ""But, the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint."" Harlan continues, ""Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others."" Earlier this month a federal judge in Texas upheld United Airlines' Covid-19 vaccine mandate, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said that federal anti-discrimination laws don't prohibit employers from requiring the vaccines for employees.  The early experience with Covid-19 vaccine mandates shows that when faced with a choice between vaccine compliance and losing a job, nearly all employees choose to get vaccinated. After United Airlines required all employees to receive a vaccine, 99.5% of its US-based employees complied with the policy. As of November 1, 93% to 99% of members of the military services had been vaccinated. The percentage of New York City firefighters who received at least a first dose of vaccine jumped six points in the past week, and 27 percentage points since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the mandate on Oct. 19. Nonetheless, speaking about the decision by the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans to affirm the stay on Biden's mandate, Judge Kurt Engelhardt wrote, ""The mandate is a one-size-fits-all sledgehammer that makes hardly any attempt to account for differences in workplaces."" Using politically charged language, the judge continued, ""The public interest is also served by maintaining our constitutional structure and maintaining the liberty of individuals to make intensely personal decisions according to their own convictions -- even or perhaps particularly when those decisions frustrate government officials."" There are several other pending legal actions that also seek to block the national vaccine mandate, some focusing on whether OSHA, which was created by Congress to assure ""safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources"" has overstepped its charter. It seems likely that the fate of the administration's vaccine mandate will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. As we continue to face a highly contagious and lethal pathogen, time is of the essence. While the Court's decision is uncertain, it is abundantly clear that if we are to prevail against this pandemic, many more people must be vaccinated. Vaccine mandates are a crucial public health tool that have been shown to significantly increase vaccine compliance. On Thursday, the American Medical Association and more than 60 other groups urged the nation's employers to voluntarily implement the Biden Administration's vaccine mandate plan. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will quickly decide if a broad vaccine mandate is constitutional, and ultimately if we are a country that is one for all, not all for one.",2
29," (CNN)Kyle Rittenhouse, on trial this month for killing two unarmed men and injuring another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last summer, was acquitted Friday on all counts -- including first-degree intentional homicide and four other felony charges -- after the jury deliberated for more than 25 hours. The trial came down to two dueling narratives. To the prosecutors, Rittenhouse was a vigilante with an AR-15-style weapon who went looking for trouble. To the defense, Rittenhouse was the sobbing teenager who testified that he found himself under attack and in those lightning-fast moments made a reasonable decision to protect himself. The jury clearly believed the latter, which, given the facts, the law and other circumstances of the trial, is no surprise. This case was always going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors. The key issue was whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, which means that he reasonably feared for his life when he pulled the trigger and shot Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz that night. Trying to weigh Rittenhouse's self-defense claim amid the two dueling narratives was not an easy job for the jury. One could reasonably argue that Rittenhouse provoked the attacks on him by openly carrying his weapon in a threatening manner, and that he had the option to retreat or otherwise avoid using deadly force, even if defending himself. If the jury had found either of these things to be true, it would have defeated the self-defense claim. But there was also evidence -- including the critical videos of the events in question and the testimony of Rittenhouse himself -- that in the key moments right before he pulled the trigger, Rittenhouse acted in response to imminent threats to his personal safety because he believed he was in danger. The laws and applicable legal standards also created a tough road for prosecutors trying to win a conviction here. Our criminal justice system generally favors the defendant, because of our core belief that it is better to see a guilty man go free than to convict an innocent one. Thus in criminal cases, prosecutors carry the highest burden of proof known to our legal system: proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Like in many other states, Wisconsin law is sympathetic to homicide defendants claiming self-defense. Once a defendant raises self-defense as an issue, it requires prosecutors to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Finally, Judge Bruce Schroeder, who presided over the case with a mercurial demeanor and frequent tongue-lashings, didn't make things easy for the prosecutors. The judge's behavior seemed to some to betray a pro-Rittenhouse bias -- for example, when he ruled that prosecutors would not be allowed to refer to Rittenhouse's victims as ""victims"" and encouraged a round of applause for a defense witness on the stand because he was a veteran. We don't know exactly what the jury's reasoning was in rendering its verdict -- jury deliberations happen in secret, so unless jurors choose to discuss the experience afterward, we will not get a view into how they made their decisions or what pieces of evidence were most compelling to them. But it appears that with evidence supporting both narratives, the jurors concluded that the prosecution failed to meet its burden -- and based on this record, it's impossible to find fault with that. This issue -- whether a defendant acted reasonably in a stressful moment -- is a quintessential jury question. This is exactly why we have a jury system where 12 members of the community come together to judge their fellow man. We, as a democracy, prefer the law to be administered by a group of ordinary individuals who rely on common sense and everyday experiences to reach a collective decision.  Without question, Rittenhouse did not have to be in Kenosha with his weapon strapped across his body as he ran around the streets in what was clearly an unpredictable and ultimately dangerous situation. If he had exercised better judgment and decided not to go that night, Rosenbaum and Huber would almost certainly still be alive. But in Wisconsin, that initial decision, as poor a decision as it was, does not constitute a crime, and the jury found his later actions justified.Those of us who don't want to have to worry about whether people like Kyle Rittenhouse will continue to brandish guns at public gatherings, thereby greatly increasing the danger of violence, should direct our energy toward changing the open carry laws in Wisconsin. Public sentiment after an episode that is viewed as unfair -- and there are plenty of people who are incensed that Rittenhouse went free because of a self-defense claim when he placed himself in the situation in the first place -- can spark change. For example, in Georgia, after the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, the legislature repealed the citizen's arrest law that Arbery's alleged killer and his co-defendants are relying on for their defense (although the defendants in the Arbery killing are still able to assert it). If public concern about Rittenhouse's conduct and its results leads to a re-examination of Wisconsin's gun laws, that will be one positive thing to come out of this tragic episode. ",2
30," (CNN)Legendary Black radio host Joe Madison is two weeks into a hunger strike that could become a risk to his health. Madison, 72, is doing it for one reason: To pressure President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress to pass voting rights legislation as the GOP actively works to restrict ballot access.As Madison told CNN's Don Lemon on Friday, ""Just as food is essential for the existence of life, voting is essential for the existence of democracy.""Madison, a civil rights activist turned SiriusXM radio host who was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2019, is so committed to the cause he is willing to put his life on the line. When I spoke to Madison on my own radio show a few days into his hunger strike, he shared that his wife asked him, ""Are you telling me that you are willing to die for this cause?"" He said he looked at her and responded with one word: ""Yes."" Madison then added passionately, ""This is the new civil rights movement.""More than 50 years after the Voting Rights Act, no one should have to risk their life to ensure all Americans can exercise a constitutionally protected right to vote. But that's where we are in 2021 America thanks to the GOP. It was not Donald Trump's ""Big Lie"" about non-existent election fraud but his ""Big Loss"" in the 2020 election that has animated Republicans to pass 33 laws in 19 states since January to make it more difficult to vote. Today's GOP won't allow the democratic will of the people to stand in their way of acquiring and retaining political power.The GOP's effort to ""cancel"" voting rights is a threat to all Americans who believe in democracy, regardless of race. But it is a particular threat to Black Americans, who have been targeted in Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, and who have been historically disenfranchised with Jim Crow era laws designed to make it almost impossible for them to vote without the danger of deadly violence.Just one example is World War II veteran Maceo Snipes, who stood up to that threat when he became the only Black person to vote in the 1946 primary in Taylor County, Georgia. A few days after the election, a group of White men showed up at Snipes' door, where they asked him to step outside. When Snipes did, they shot him. Snipes later died from the shooting, and charges were never brought against his killers. Mr. Snipes, though, was far from the only Black person or allies of other races who was killed in the pursuit of access to the ballot for African Americans. The GOP's voter suppression campaign is not only a threat to our democracy today but it's also an insult to the memory of Snipes and all others who have toiled, bled and died simply for the right to cast a ballot. In his first speech after defeating Trump in the 2020 election, President Biden credited Black voters for being a large part of his win. ""The African American community stood up again for me,"" he said of the community that voted nearly 90 percent in his favor in last year's election. He then pledged, ""You've always had my back, and I'll have yours.""Countless callers to my radio show who are Black have cited that line to express their disappointment in Biden's failing to have their backs on voting rights. Instead, Biden has been laser-focused for months on his infrastructure and social safety net legislation. But what's the use of shining bridges if you don't have a functioning democracy? With Biden's success last week in both signing the bipartisan infrastructure bill into law and his broader Build Back Better bill passing the House, he must now make voting rights reform his public priority.To be fair, the Democrats in the House already passed two different voting rights bills this year, the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. But Republicans in the Senate have blocked progress on both.There has also been a glimmer of hope in recent months with the Senate Democrats drafting the Freedom to Vote Act, which would provide a national standard for federal elections as well as end partisan gerrymandering. All 50 Democratic Senators supported the bill, meaning this could pass if brought to a vote with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. But due to the filibuster requiring 10 GOP Senators to consent to even allow a vote, this measure has been blocked with not one Republican senator in support. You can see why former President Barack Obama last year called the filibuster a ""Jim Crow relic,"" as the GOP is now using it to block legislation that would protect against voter suppression.The Democrats' failure to make voting rights a top priority may also explain why, in the recent Virginia gubernatorial race, Black voters were a smaller percentage of the electorate (16%) than in 2020 (18%), and only 86% voted for the Democratic candidate compared to 89% who went for Biden in 2020. In a close election, this kind of drop-off can decide the winner.In 2021, who would have thought -- as Joe Madison put it -- that we'd be engaged in a ""new civil rights movement""? But this is where our nation finds itself as the GOP rejects a robust democracy in the pursuit of electoral autocracy. It's time President Biden and the Democrats make voting rights the top issue in 2022. Biden should travel the country selling it, in addition to publicly -- and very doggedly -- pressuring Senate Democrats to end the filibuster. Biden owes that to the Black community who supported him, and to all Americans who believe that their vote and their voice matters.",2
31," (CNN)President Joe Biden is getting closer to another major victory in what could be a legislative hat trick to round out his first year in office. After House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy delayed a vote in the lower chamber with an eight-hour speech last night, Democrats passed the Build Back Better Act, which is now expected to undergo major revisions in the Senate. Democrats, who have a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber, will have to see if they can get Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema on board. Although the Congressional Budget Office issued a better-than-expected score which should help ease any reservations the two moderate senators might have about the overall cost, it is still far from clear whether Democrats can seal the deal. Passing the legislation would count as a landmark achievement. The $1.9 trillion bill would drastically expand the social safety net and help fight climate change by providing subsidies for health care and childcare, free and universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with new tax credits for clean energy, investments in electric vehicles, and funding for environmental conservation. The bill will would also allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for older Americans on Medicare, provide new and improved affordable housing, include subsidies to make high-speed internet more accessible -- and more.If the legislation passes, Biden will be able to tout the Build Back Better Act, the American Rescue Plan and the $1 trillion infrastructure bill to join the ranks of the few Democrats since FDR who have been able to expand the role of the federal government in American life. In a sharp rebuke of Reaganism, Biden is building on the liberal legacy that stipulates government is essential to a healthy and equitable marketplace.  There are many reasons why President Biden has struggled politically in recent months. When it comes to the administration's problems with messaging, its reticence may be an overcorrection after the Trump era. Given that so many Americans grew tired of the onslaught of tweets, announcements and reports covering the turbulence in the White House under Trump, Biden may have initially chosen to step back from the limelight, working behind closed doors to try to focus on the challenges of governing. This strategy proved to be effective at the start of Biden's presidency, since it created the perception that the federal government was operating smoothly. But when pushing for big legislative initiatives, telling stories is part of what presidents do. Whenever the great Democratic presidents have successfully expanded the role of our government, they sold these laws to the American people as a way to address the major concerns of the day. Franklin Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" was an effort to address one of the worst economic crises in US history, offering workers and farmers a new social safety net that would ensure the bottom would not again fall out for average Americans. Lyndon B. Johnson's ""Great Society"" was an effort to use the growing wealth of this country to make the nation better than it had ever been by grappling with perennial challenges of poverty, racism, and inadequate education.It wasn't just that Roosevelt or Johnson had pithy catchphrases—those alone, as Harry Truman learned with the ""Fair Deal"" are not enough to guarantee success. It was the ability of these presidents to connect the dots between their proposals and the most pertinent concerns of the era in order to make a compelling case to the American people that these legislative packages were critical to the country's future.For Americans in 2021, nothing comes close to the pandemic and the problems it exposed and exacerbated. The nation and the world, lived through one of the most traumatic and unsettling crises of recent decades. Covid-19 ravaged the world and inflicted an enormous death toll while upending our way of life, widening racial and economic disparities, and inflicting a psychological toll that could have a lasting impact on people for years to come. While we are all focused on returning to some semblance of normality as soon as possible, the notion that we can simply move on or that the damage of the pandemic can easily be undone is shortsighted.Joe Biden won the 2020 election over Donald Trump for many reasons, one of which was a desperate desire for efficient and coherent leadership that could help us all climb out of the desperate state the pandemic put us in. As Biden tries to push his capstone legislation toward final passage by Christmas, he has to come back to this basic concern. Too often, Biden has not done enough to explain how his legislative push is as integral to our country's recovery as the vaccine rollout.In the last few days, the administration has finally started to push back against inflation hawks by explaining how the infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better package would actually reduce basic costs for American families. But he needs to do more by laying out what's in these bills and how they'll make a positive impact on millions of Americans. Lowering the cost of health care and child care while providing support for caregiving jobs, for example, addresses longstanding problems that came to the forefront during the pandemic. More aggressive efforts to deal with climate change is also part of how we avoid another global crisis from unfolding.   The more Biden can do to explain how his agenda addresses the Covid-19 pandemic and how his policies will make us more resilient going forward, the more pressure he can exert on Senators Manchin and Sinema to finally join the rest of their party in moving forward with this historic legislation.",2

Different versions of that saying have been attributed to physicist Niels Bohr, movie producer Samuel Goldwyn and baseball great Yogi Berra, among others. Whoever first said it captured the plight we currently face.As Covid-19 has rampaged around the world for the past two years, the disease has defied simple forecasting. The latest mysteries: Why is it surging in highly vaccinated nations like Germany? Is the US in for another, and perhaps final, ""winter wave"" -- or will vaccinations and immunity from past infections limit a significant rise in cases?""It's not clear what proportion of the population must be inoculated to attain community immunity,"" wrote Dr. Jonathan Reiner, ""but Belgium currently has one of the world's highest Covid-19 case rates despite having completely vaccinated 74% of its population."" Germany, which ""has vaccinated 10% more of its population than the United States,"" is seeing its disease rate hit record levels. But the vaccines are working. ""To prevent a large winter Covid-19 spike, we must first and foremost vaccinate millions of people and do so quickly,"" Reiner observed. ""The latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows that 20% of American adults say they will definitely not get the vaccine or will do so only if required. For many in this hard-core resistant minority, only a mandate linked to their job is likely to sway their decision."" The US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit temporarily blocked President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate, which was set to fully take effect in January.Vaccines are widely available in the US, with children ages 5 to 11 now eligible and with boosters on offer for adults.  ""When you become a parent,"" wrote first lady Jill Biden, ""you look at your baby and feel a mix of overwhelming love deep in your bones, and absolute terror, knowing that this fragile life is depending on you. From that moment on, you see the world differently. Every step, every street corner, every bite of food is a danger that you never even noticed before. So, we buy baby gates and cover our electrical outlets."" To fend off the danger of Covid-19, ""we can help take care of at least one of those worries"" by vaccinating young children. It's ""not just another way to protect your kids against Covid-19, but the best way. It's been thoroughly reviewed and rigorously tested. It's safe. It's free and it's available for every eligible child in the country."" In the Atlantic, Sarah Zhang summed up the mystery: ""The U.S. has fully vaccinated 59% of the country and recorded enough cases to account for 14% of the population. (Though, given limited testing, those case numbers almost certainly underestimate true infections.) What we don't know is how to put these two numbers together, says Elizabeth Halloran, an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Paul Gosar for sharing an anime video altered to depict him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking Joe Biden. ""It signaled that violence and misogyny have no place in our politics -- and neither do politicians like Gosar who promote them,"" wrote Kara Alaimo. ""Gosar's video was straight out of former President Donald Trump's playbook, which we've learned had a toxic effect. In his book 'Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It,' Helio Fred Garcia found that after Trump verbally attacked groups -- including Hispanics and Muslims -- hate crimes against them increased.""The day after the House censure, Trump endorsed Gosar, calling him ""a loyal supporter of our America First agenda."" Meanwhile, the Wyoming Republican party voted last weekend to no longer recognize Rep. Liz Cheney, who has denounced Trump for setting the stage for the January 6 Capitol riot. As Frida Ghitis wrote, ""There's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.""Rupert Murdoch, whose media empire includes hosts who have promoted the false narrative about the 2020 election, and Chris Christie, a former Trump ally, urged the party to move on and focus on the future. ""They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party -- and the rest of the country -- that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.""Steve Bannon and 'podcaster privilege'The Justice Department charged former Trump strategist Steve Bannon with criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the committee investigating the events of January 6. Bannon's lawyer said he told his client not to cooperate because Trump was claiming executive privilege as a shield against the committee's inquiries. ""Trump's attempt at invoking the privilege is especially weak here because he wasn't acting as chief executive when he planned and implemented his effort to overturn the election,"" wrote Norman Eisen, Joanna Lydgate and Joshua Perry.""He was acting as a defeated candidate, and there is no candidate privilege. Second, there's no such thing as podcaster privilege. Even if Trump could invoke the privilege, it wouldn't protect Bannon -- he was a podcast host, not a White House advisor, on January 6.

The likely impact of this verdict will be to turn the American political landscape into even more of a 'wild, wild west' scenario..."" ""No Black person could show up anywhere in the United States armed with an AR-15 and shoot down three people -- and then get acquitted and hailed as a national hero.

""But the law requires something entirely different: a strict analysis of the facts and law by 12 ordinary citizens insulated from outside pressure."" BBB and the DemocratsIn legislative terms, last week was a sparkling triumph for Democrats. On Monday, Biden signed a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that attracted bipartisan support and fulfilled a self-proclaimed goal of Trump, who never could make it happen in his four-year term. On Friday, the House passed an ambitious $1.9 trillion social spending bill, sending it to the Senate. And despite the challenge of inflation, the economy appears to be growing strongly.But at the same time, Democrats are in deep despair over Biden's falling approval rating and the prospect that their lease on power could be cancelled by voters a year from now in the midterm elections. In the Guardian, Robert Reich asked, ""What explains the wide gap now between how well the country is doing and how badly Biden and the Democrats are doing politically?"" ""In two words: dashed hopes. After four years of Trump and a year and a half of deathly pandemic, most of the country was eager to put all the horror behind -- to start over, wipe the slate clean, heal the wounds, reboot America. Biden in his own calm way seemed just the person to do it."" But he couldn't do it all quickly, and Covid's Delta variant set the country back. ""Hopefully, a year from now the fruits of Biden's initiatives will be felt, Covid will be behind us, bottlenecks behind the current inflation will be overcome, and the horrors of the Trump years will become more visible through Congress's investigations and the midterm campaigns of Trumpers."" It really is all about Covid, wrote Julian Zelizer. ""Covid-19 ravaged the world and inflicted an enormous death toll while upending our way of life, widening racial and economic disparities, and inflicting a psychological toll that could have a lasting impact on people for years to come."" That's why Biden won, but, Zelizer observed, ""Too often, Biden has not done enough to explain how his legislative push is as integral to our country's recovery as the vaccine rollout."" Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a Republican, offered a different explanation for the President's troubles. ""Biden presented himself successfully to Democratic primary voters in 2020 as a moderate alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who advocated for expansive and transformative government. Sanders and his message lost. And since Biden wasn't elected by his party to go big, why is he pandering to Sanders and the left wing, which has resulted in a bloated Build Back Better bill?"" One wild card in the run-up to the 2022 midterms lies with a case before the US Supreme Court that could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that made abortion legal nationwide. A new poll found that ""fewer than a third of Americans want Roe to be overturned,"" wrote Jill Filipovic. ""If the Supreme Court overturns Roe either formally or functionally -- by allowing states vast leeway to curtail abortion rights -- the Court and the Republican Party may see just how much of a minority abortion opponents actually are, how crucial abortion and contraception are for American women to be free and how angry women (and those who love them) will get when our rights to our own bodies are taken away by five or six conservative judges who are unaccountable to the voting public. The GOP faces a guaranteed backlash if the anti-abortion movement gets what it wants...""

The struggle for Black dignity and citizenship to which Malcolm devoted his whole life continues.""Are the courts capable of rectifying historic injustices, particularly when it comes to issues around extremism? That was the question Nicole Hemmer took on in a piece that led with the civil suit seeking to hold the organizers of a far right rally accountable for the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, confrontation that resulted in the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer. ""Courts are currently clogged with cases that chart much of the right-wing extremism and misinformation campaigns of the last decade. The cases also reveal the makeshift nature of legal responses to those campaigns, an array of tools that might be able to act as deterrents — though not able to deliver real justice."" ""It is at once both dispiriting and hopeful,"" Hemmer observed. ""Dispiriting, because it is a sign of how rapidly the far-right has grown and how deeply it has penetrated US politics. Hopeful, because it shows how robustly the legal system is responding to the twin dangers of extremism and disinformation.""Don't miss:Fareed Zakaria: Where Xi's China is headingAmy Bass: What Peng Shuai's disappearance means for upcoming Beijing OlympicsJohn D.

33," (CNN)The Biden administration is weighing sending military advisers and new equipment including weaponry to Ukraine as Russia builds up forces near the border and US officials prepare allies for the possibility of another Russian invasion, multiple sources familiar with the deliberations tell CNN.  The discussions about the proposed lethal aid package are happening as Ukraine has begun to warn publicly that an invasion could happen as soon as January. The package could include new Javelin anti-tank and anti-armor missiles as well as mortars, the sources said.  Air defense systems, such as stinger missiles, are also under consideration, and the Defense Department has been pressing for some equipment that would have gone to Afghanistan -- like Mi-17 helicopters -- to instead be sent to Ukraine. The Mi-17 is a Russian helicopter that the US originally purchased to give to the Afghans. The Pentagon is now weighing what to do with them after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August.  But others in the administration are concerned that sending stingers and helicopters could be seen by Russia as a major escalation. And while they are prepared to send some military advisers into the region, it is unclear whether any would go into Ukraine itself, the people said.  Retired Lt. Col. Cedric Leighton told CNN that Javelin antitank missiles ""are quite effective against the T-80 tanks which the Russians are actually employing in these efforts against Ukraine right now."" But he noted that any additional assistance to Ukraine undoubtedly risks ""further heightening tensions"" with Moscow.  Sanctions discussionsMeanwhile, US officials have been holding discussions with European allies about putting together a new sanctions package that would go into effect if Russia invaded Ukraine, the sources said. And lawmakers are also jockeying over new sanctions language to include in the National Defense Authorization Act.  Asked about the Russian military activity, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday that the administration is concerned and has ""had extensive interactions with our European allies and partners in recent weeks, including with Ukraine."" She added that the US has ""also had held discussions with Russian officials about Ukraine and US-Russian relations in general."" The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, also spoke by phone with the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny on Monday.The discussions reflect how seriously the Biden administration and Congress is taking the possibility that Russia could move to invade Ukraine, a strategic US ally, for the second time in under a decade. And US officials are determined not to be caught by surprise by a Russian military operation, as the Obama administration was in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea and powered an insurgency in parts of eastern Ukraine. ""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, pushed back on the US' warnings about a potential invasion, calling them ""absolutely false"" in a statement on Monday.  ""The US State Department through diplomatic channels brings to its allies and partners absolutely false information about the concentration of forces on the territory of our country for a military invasion of Ukraine,"" said Sergei Ivanov, head of the SVR's press bureau. For weeks, the US has been sharing intelligence with NATO partners and European allies on unusual Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border that US military and intelligence officials believe could be a precursor to a military operation on the country's eastern flank. The briefings have gone much further than in the past in terms of the level of alarm and specificity, US, European, and Ukrainian sources familiar with the discussions said.  Ukraine's tone has also changed significantly since being briefed by the US. At the beginning of the month, Ukrainian officials downplayed reports that Russia was massing forces near the border. Now, following extensive meetings between US and Ukrainian officials, Ukraine's defense intelligence chief Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov is publicly warning that Russia is building a capacity to attack as soon as January -- a timeline in line with the US' assessments. 'No smoking gun'Still, officials say Russia's ultimate plan remains unclear. ""There is no smoking gun or decisive indicator of Putin's intentions,"" said one defense official. And it is possible that the maneuvers are an effort to sow confusion or to coerce the west into making concessions, rather than a precursor to an invasion.   But the US is still warning of the possibility of the worst-case scenario that Moscow attempts regime change in Kiev, spurred largely by Putin's determination to keep Ukraine from growing closer to the West and potentially joining NATO.  ""You don't achieve that goal by carving out another chunk of the eastern Donetsk region,"" said one person familiar with the intelligence. ""It's got to be something more than that. If that's [Putin's] goal, then you don't do that by doing something small."" US officials have also shared with senior Ukrainian officials evidence that Russia, through the FSB -- Russia's successor to the KGB -- is engaging in destabilizing activities inside Ukraine to foment dissent against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration. They have also pointed to the presence of Spetsnaz special forces and GRU and SVR intelligence operatives near Ukraine's borders.  Ukrainian defense officials have projected that Russia could use the dozens of battalion tactical groups currently stationed near Ukraine's borders to launch an attack from multiple sides, including from annexed Crimea, according to Ukrainian military assessments provided to The Military Times.  US officials are closely watching the Russian activity in Crimea, where Russia sent troops and military units in the spring as part of what it claimed were exercises. Although Russia's defense ministry ordered at least some of the troops to withdraw in April, some elements remained, according to the Ukrainian assessments and sources familiar with the matter.  Moves in CongressDemocratic and Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have added proposed amendments to the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that would address Russia's latest provocations, but they have yet to sign off on a final version. An amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez, reviewed by CNN, says that ""substantial new sanctions should be imposed"" by President Joe Biden against senior Kremlin officials -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin -- in the event of a Russian military escalation against Ukraine. The amendment also calls for additional sanctions on the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, which Ukraine has been pushing for.  The committee's Republicans see the Nord Stream sanctions language as a positive step, sources said, but want the amendment to trigger sanctions automatically in the event of a Russian incursion rather than leave the determination in the hands of the administration.  Germany, which has been engaged in the pipeline project with Russia, recently announced that it is temporarily pausing the pipeline's certification process. But Ukraine also wants to see the US do more to stymie the pipeline, which it says Russia is weaponizing to weaken Ukraine by cutting it off from energy supplies and revenue heading into winter, an adviser to Zelensky told CNN.  ""While the Biden administration is warning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, its most senior officials are on Capitol Hill trying to protect Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline by lobbying against the inclusion of sanctions against it in the annual defense bill,"" the adviser said.

34," (CNN)Portugal shut down its last remaining coal plant over the weekend, ending the use of the polluting material for electricity generation and becoming the fourth country in the European Union to do so.Environmental group Zero said in a statement the Pego plant in central Portugal had been the country's second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, adding that ""freeing ourselves from the biggest source of greenhouse gases was a momentous day for Portugal"".The move comes nine years before Portugal's targeted end of the use of the fossil fuel by 2030.Belgium, Austria and Sweden are the other three European countries to have already stopped using coal for power generation.Although a hefty 60%-70% of its electricity comes from renewable sources, Portugal still relies heavily on imported fossil fuels to meet overall energy needs.There are concerns the Pego plant, run by the privately held group Tejo Energia, might now be converted to burn wood pellets.""The challenge now is to ensure utilities do not make the mistake of replacing coal with fossil gas, or unsustainable biomass,"" said Kathrin Gutmann, campaign director at Europe Beyond Coal.""Ditching coal only to switch to the next worst fuel is clearly not an answer,"" said Zero's president Francisco Ferreira. ""Instead, the focus should be on rapidly upscaling our renewable energy capacity in wind and solar.""A draft document seen by Reuters in June showed the EU was considering tightening rules on whether wood-burning energy could be classified as renewable.

35,"Washington (CNN)The US imposed new sanctions related to the contested Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Monday. The State Department reported to Congress that it has designated a vessel and a ""Russian-linked entity"" called Transadria Ltd. that is linked to the controversial pipeline that was built to ferry natural gas from Russia to Germany and has raised concerns about Moscow's ability to use energy supplies as leverage over Europe.Blinken said the report to Congress and the sanctions are in keeping with the requirements of the Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act of 2019.""Today's report is in line with the United States' continuing opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the U.S. Government's continued compliance with PEESA,"" Blinken said in his statement. ""With today's action, the Administration has now sanctioned 8 persons and identified 17 of their vessels as blocked property pursuant to PEESA in connection with Nord Stream 2.""  Opposition""Even as the Administration continues to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, including via our sanctions, we continue to work with Germany and other allies and partners to reduce the risks posed by the pipeline to Ukraine and frontline NATO and EU countries and to push back against harmful Russian activities, including in the energy sphere,"" Blinken said.  Monday's sanctions come as reports of Russian troops massing near the border with Ukraine have led to fears that Moscow may be planning some sort of military action. Biden administration officials say that since the pipeline was essentially complete by the time they came into office, President Joe Biden waived sanctions against the German companies behind the pipeline's construction in order to repair the relationship with Berlin. Instead, administration officials said they planned to take other measures.  That has not been enough to assuage Democrats and Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who has held up dozens of unrelated diplomatic nominations to protest the Biden administration's policies on Nord Stream 2. Other lawmakers have raised concerns that Russia could use energy supplies to pressure Europe and are working to include language in the Defense Authorization Act to increase sanctions on the project. ""Today's designations will do absolutely nothing to stop Nord Stream 2,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the leading Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I urge the Senate to adopt my bipartisan NDAA amendment with Representative Marcy Kaptur that expands Nord Stream 2 sanctions. We must act now to ensure gas never flows through this Russian malign influence project.""Nord Stream 2 is one of several pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea to replace pipelines that that run through eastern Europe. Analysts and lawmakers have raised concerns because the new system allows Russia to create different gas flows for eastern Europe and western Europe and could allow Moscow to selectively target countries such as Ukraine with energy cutoffs. Bypassing eastern European countries also means those nations would be deprived of transit fees Russia would otherwise pay for the pipeline to cross their territories.A State Department spokesman said that the administration is working with Germany, Ukraine, and other allies and partners to implement a July agreement to help Ukraine diversify its energy supplies with an emphasis on clean and sustainable energy.   ""The package of measures detailed in the joint statement provides at least $245 million in new funding to help Ukraine diversify its energy resources,"" the spokesman said. ""It also commits Germany to utilize all available leverage to facilitate an extension of Ukraine's gas transit agreement with Russia, which would help to preserve billions of dollars in transit revenues for Ukraine and buy time for Ukraine to eliminate its dependence on Russian gas and transit fees, including with US support."" Monday's US sanctions follow last week's move by Berlin to suspend the certification process for Nord Stream 2 because the Swiss-based group behind the project needed to form a German subsidiary in order to secure an operating license. News of the delay sent European gas prices soaring. ",2
36,"The United Nations on Monday pushed for urgent action to prop up Afghanistan's banks, warning that a spike in people who are unable to repay loans as well as lower deposits and a cash liquidity crunch could cause the financial system to collapse within months.In a three-page report on Afghanistan's banking and financial system seen by Reuters, the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said the economic cost of a banking system collapse - and consequent negative social impact - ""would be colossal.""An abrupt withdrawal of most foreign development support after the Taliban seized power on Aug. 15 from Afghanistan's Western-backed government has sent the economy into freefall, putting a severe strain on the banking system which set weekly withdrawal limits to stop a run on deposits.""Afghanistan's financial and bank payment systems are in disarray. The bank-run problem must be resolved quickly to improve Afghanistan's limited production capacity and prevent the banking system from collapsing,"" the UNDP report said.Finding a way to avert a collapse is complicated by international and unilateral sanctions on Taliban leaders.""We need to find a way to make sure that if we support the banking sector, we are not supporting Taliban,"" Abdallah al Dardari, head of UNDP in Afghanistan, told Reuters.""We are in such a dire situation that we need to think of all possible options and we have to think outside the box,"" he said. ""What used to be three months ago unthinkable has to become thinkable now.""Afghanistan's banking system was already vulnerable before the Taliban came to power. But since then development aid has dried up, billions of dollars in Afghan assets have been frozen abroad, and the United Nations and aid groups are now struggling to get enough cash into the country.'Under the mattress'The UNDP's proposals to save the banking system include a deposit insurance scheme, measures to ensure adequate liquidity for short- and medium-term needs, as well as credit guarantees and loan repayment delay options.""Coordination with the International Financial Institutions, with their extensive experience of the Afghan financial system, would be critical to this process,"" UNDP said in its report, referring to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.The United Nations has repeatedly warned since the Taliban took over that Afghanistan's economy is on the brink of a collapse that would likely further fuel a refugee crisis. UNDP said that if the banking system fails, it could take decades to rebuild.The UNDP report said that with current trends and withdrawal restrictions, about 40% of Afghanistan's deposit base will be lost by the end of the year. It said banks have stopped extending new credit, and that non-performing loans had almost doubled to 57% in September from the end of 2020.""If this rate continues of non-performing loans, the banks may not have a chance to survive in the next six months. And I am being optimistic,"" al Dardari said.Liquidity has also been a problem. Afghan banks heavily relied on physical shipments of U.S. dollars, which have stopped. When it comes to the local afghani currency, al Dardari said that while there is about $4 billion worth of afghanis in the economy, only about $500 million worth is in circulation.""The rest is sitting under the mattress or under the pillow because people are afraid,"" he said.As the United Nations seeks to avert famine in Afghanistan, al Dardari also warned about the consequences of a banking collapse for trade finance.""Afghanistan last year imported about $7 billion worth of goods and products and services, mostly foodstuff ... If there is no trade finance the interruption is huge,"" he said. ""Without the banking system, none of this can happen."" ",2

In 2018, a team of the kingdom's government agents murdered the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was going to pick up documents for his upcoming wedding to Cengiz.

38,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)A Chinese central official has warned that stagflation could weigh on an already struggling economy next year. It's the latest sign that the government may be thinking about taking some aggressive steps to address slowing growth, including its first lending rate cut since early 2020.Liu Shijin, a member of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy committee, told an online forum on Sunday that the world's second largest economy may have to deal with ""quasi-stagflation"" the rest of this year and into 2022, if demand continues to struggle and the cost of goods leaving Chinese factories stays high.""We need to pay attention to it, because if this happens, it will not only affect the fourth quarter, but also affect next year,"" Liu said.Stagflation — when inflation is high but economic growth slows — can be problematic since policies that are intended to curb inflation, such as higher interest rates, risk suppressing growth even further. Policies intended to boost growth, meanwhile, risk causing prices to keep rising.Even with his warning, Liu still expects the economy to hit China's growth target of more than 6% for the year.Risks to the Chinese economy have been piling up in recent months. Along with surging producer price inflation in the world's factory, the country is also grappling with a severe energy crunch and a big slowdown in real estate. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang recently acknowledged those concerns, saying at a seminar in Beijing last week that the economy was facing ""new downward pressures."" He called out recent Covid-19 outbreaks, severe flooding, rising commodity prices and energy shortages as key concerns. Li also said that policymakers should focus on helping ""market players,"" including manufacturing companies and small businesses, by offering tax cuts or administrative fee reductions.""The concern for growth slowdown is clearly rising among technocrats at different government agencies,"" wrote Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Group, in a Sunday report.Analysts also suspect that China's policymakers may consider cutting interest rates or taking other steps to ease monetary policy. A quarterly report released Friday by the central bank omitted phrases that have appeared previously to signal tighter policies. The removal of those phrases suggests a shift on the horizon, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, Nomura, and Citi.""In our view, these deletions represent an official change to the PBoC's policy stance and sets the stage for more decisive monetary and credit easing,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a Sunday report. Those changes aren't happening just yet. On Monday, the central bank kept the Loan Prime Rate — a benchmark rate which banks charge corporate clients for new loans — unchanged for November, the 19th month in a row.But analysts from Capital Economics think it won't be long before the central bank starts to cut policy rates. ""As economic strains continue to grow, there will be more pressure to relieve the financing strains of indebted borrowers,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for the firm, in a Monday report. He added that Capital Economists thinks the central bank will start lowering rates before the end of 2021, ""followed by more reductions in 2022.""Others expect the central bank to explore other options. Rather than changing interest rates, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expected more targeted support for green development and small or medium-sized companies.",2
39,"El Salvador plans to build the world's first ""Bitcoin City"", funded initially by bitcoin-backed bonds, President Nayib Bukele said on Saturday, doubling down on his bet to harness the crypto currency to fuel investment in the Central American country.Speaking at an event closing a week-long promotion of bitcoin in El Salvador, Bukele said the city planned in the eastern region of La Union would get geothermal power from a volcano and not levy any taxes except for a value added tax (VAT).""Invest here and make all the money you want,"" Bukele said in English, dressed all in white and wearing a reversed baseball cap, in the beach resort of Mizata. ""This is a fully ecological city that works and is energized by a volcano.""Half of the VAT levied would be used to fund the bonds issued to build the city, and the other half would pay for services such as garbage collection, Bukele said, estimating the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 bitcoins.El Salvador in September became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.Although Bukele is a popular president, opinion polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about his love of bitcoin, and its bumpy introduction has fueled protests against the government.Likening his plan to cities founded by Alexander the Great, Bukele said Bitcoin City would be circular, with an airport, residential and commercial areas, and feature a central plaza designed to look like a bitcoin symbol from the air.""If you want bitcoin to spread over the world, we should build some Alexandrias,"" said Bukele, a tech savvy 40-year-old who in September proclaimed himself ""dictator"" of El Salvador on Twitter in an apparent joke.El Salvador plans to issue the initial bonds in 2022, Bukele said, suggesting it would be in 60 days time.Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain technology provider Blockstream, told the gathering the first 10-year issue, known as the ""volcano bond"", would be worth $1 billion, backed by bitcoin and carrying a coupon of 6.5%. Half of the sum would go to buying bitcoin on the market, he said. Other bonds would follow.After a five year lock-up, El Salvador would start selling some of the bitcoin used to fund the bond to give investors an ""additional coupon"", Mow said, positing that the value of the cryptocurrency would continue to rise robustly.""This is going to make El Salvador the financial center of the world,"" he said.The bond would be issued on the ""liquid network"", a bitcoin sidechain network. To facilitate the process, El Salvador's government is working on a securities law, and the first license to operate an exchange would go to Bitfinex, Mow said.Crypto exchange Bitfinex was listed as the book runner for the bond on a presentation behind Mow.Once 10 such bonds were issued, $5 billion in bitcoin would be taken off the market for several years, Mow said. ""And if you get 10 more countries to do these bonds, that's half of bitcoin's market cap right there.""The ""game theory"" on the bonds gave first issuer El Salvador an advantage, Mow argued, saying: ""If bitcoin at the five-year mark reaches $1 million, which I think it will, they will sell bitcoin in two quarters and recoup that $500 million.""

40," (CNN)Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Jenifer Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door.It wasn't until after college, when she moved to India for a job in information technology, that she appreciated the vast social inequalities people endure.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said, which is why she changed her career path. She returned to Colombia, settled in Cartagena and volunteered with community organizations that helped people living in poverty. ""I felt very saddened to see that people were living without the most basic things,"" she said. ""People don't have clean drinking water, indoor plumbing, electricity.""She wanted to do more to help bring these essentials to communities most in need. In 2015, with the help of friends, Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata. Today, the non-profit provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. ""We didn't know anything at first, but we had all the determination,"" Colpas said.Colpas, now 31, and her team of other young like-minded counterparts currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people. CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Colpas about her efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversationCNN: Who does your organization help?Jenifer Colpas: The communities where we are working, they are very diverse. You can find indigenous people, farmers, and most of the places where we are working now, they are a displaced population.Over 50 years of war have made Colombia the country with the highest internal-displaced population in the world.  These rural communities were taken over by the FARC and other paramilitary groups. Because of all the years that those communities were in a conflict zone, they were totally forgotten. They have been invisible to the government and for a lot of Colombians. They are the hardest to reach and less likely to have access to any basic service. These areas are so remote that there are no roads to get there. Nobody goes there. But we are going there to provide access to basic services. CNN: Why was it especially important for you and your team to put local women in leadership positions to assist with the projects? Colpas: We are working with women because, for us, it's very important to empower them and to re-signify their role inside the community. So they will be not just social leaders, but also problem-solvers.The leaders have different roles. One is that they are our main partners within the community. They are the first contact in case there is something we need to fix. If something happens with any of the families, they are our main contact. They are the ones that are working on the solutions in the long term. They help us to organize logistics before any installation. They help us understand how to reach the community, which is the best way we can organize the team to go there and to do the installation process. So, we train them and share our knowledge.CNN: What are you providing these communities on a deeper level?Colpas: We're covering their basic needs so they can start dreaming. My biggest dream for them is that they can wake up not just to survive, but they can make a step further and start fulfilling their dreams. Their stories, their inner power to go ahead even in a really bad situation, through all they are suffering, is what inspires me. They are very resilient. Every time I talk with them, they really motivate me, inspire me to go further. Because despite all the problems they face, they never give up. Want to get involved?

Here's a look at this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes:Jenifer Colpas: Bringing clean water and power to rural villages in her countryHer cause: Jenifer Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata in 2015, a non-profit that provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. Colpas and her team currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people.What inspired her: Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door. After college, she moved to India for a job in information technology. There, she became aware of vast social inequalities.""Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'"" Colpas said. She decided to change her career path and return home, where she co-founded Tierra Grata, which means ""gratitude to the earth"" in Spanish.Read more about Jenifer Colpas and her workLynda Doughty: The seal rescuerHer cause:  For the past decade, Lynda Doughty's nonprofit, Marine Mammals of Maine, has provided response efforts, assistance and medical care for more than 3,000 marine animals.The group monitors 2,500 miles of coastline and operates a 24-hour hotline, responding to calls about distressed or deceased marine mammals, and it has federal authorization to provide temporary care for critically ill and injured seals. Data gathered on these animals allows Doughty and her team to monitor trends in diseases and human impact on marine mammal health.What inspired her:  Growing up in coastal Maine, Doughty developed a passion for the marine wildlife living along the coast and knew from an early age that she wanted to dedicate her life to protecting them.""I just remember being so amazed (by them) and wondering what's happening in their life,"" Doughty said.She also became aware that their livelihood was jeopardized by pollution, habitat destruction and other human-related activity.""I knew that I wanted to do something to help these animals,"" Doughty said.She became a marine biologist and worked for several years with organizations that provided emergency response and rehabilitation for sick and injured marine mammals. But as nonprofits and state agencies lost funding or closed their doors, Doughty decided to step in and fill the gap.Read more about Lynda Doughty and her workDavid Flink: Creating a new way to learnHis cause:  David Flink's Eye to Eye program pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference. Eye to Eye's 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school.What inspired him: Growing up, Flink had a hard time focusing in school, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. With the support of his parents and the right school, Flink graduated high school and went to Brown University.When he got to college, he found a community of students who also had learning differences. Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability.Read more about David Flink and his workDr. Patricia Gordon: Saving women from a preventable diseaseHer cause: Dr. Patricia Gordon operates CureCervicalCancer, which delivers screening, training and supplies to clinics around the world. The organization has since worked in 10 countries, including China, Haiti, Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Vietnam.The non-profit has screened more than 150,000 women and treated more than 8,600 to date. It has also established 106 sustainable clinics to screen and treat women in remote and underserved areas.""That there are 8,000 women who are alive and well and able to provide for their families is honestly the most rewarding thing that I could have ever imagined in my life,"" Gordon said. ""I think I'm the luckiest doctor that ever lived.""What inspired her: Gordon, a radiation oncologist, traveled with a group of doctors in 2012 to bring a new radiation device to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. While there, she saw how many women were needlessly being killed by a preventable, treatable disease: cervical cancer.""There are 350,000 women dying a painful, undignified death globally. And it's almost 100% preventable,"" she said.The team arranged to provide cervical cancer screenings for women in a remote and hard-hit area of Senegal. Using a method Gordon and others call ""See & Treat,"" screening can be done without needing electricity and with a few transportable supplies.It was a far cry from the way things operated in her Beverly Hills office, but the experience stayed with Gordon, whose own family history of breast cancer is a driving force in her work.After 27 years, Gordon left her private practice in 2014 to devote all her time to CureCervicalCancer. She takes no salary.Read more about Dr. Patricia Gordon and her workHector Guadalupe: Giving former prisoners a second chanceHis cause: Hector Guadalupe's non-profit, A Second U Foundation, helps formerly incarcerated men and women get certified as personal trainers and build careers in the fitness industry so they can support their families. Guadalupe and his team of volunteers offer a free eight-week program for 10-15 students every quarter to prepare for the national certification exam.In addition to study materials and exam fees, the program now also provides each student a free tablet with keyboard, transportation, new clothing, software classes and a $1,300 stipend. Coaches also mentor students, helping with far more than classwork.Once students have passed the exam, Guadalupe helps them get jobs. More than 200 people have graduated from the program since 2016 and only two have reoffended -- a recidivism rate of less than 1%.  What inspired him: By the time he was a teenager, Guadalupe had lost both parents and ended up spending 10 years in prison for drug trafficking. There he became obsessed with fitness and got certified as a personal trainer. When he came home, he was determined to work at one of Manhattan's elite gyms.""Six days out of the week, I'm literally at every corporate health club ... filling out applications,"" Guadalupe said. ""Nobody was calling me back ... and I knew why: because of my past ... But I didn't give up.""After nine months, he landed an opportunity and worked without a day off for four years to establish himself in New York's fitness scene. Now, he devotes much of his week to helping others do the same.Read more about Hector Guadalupe and his workMichele Neff Hernandez: Finding a way through grief togetherHer cause: Michele Neff Hernandez created Soaring Spirits in 2008, three years after her husband's death. Her nonprofit connects widows and widowers, allowing them to heal in a community that understands the pain of losing a partner. It has grown to include 70 regional chapters all over the US, as well as pen pals and programs specifically for the LGBTQ community.To date, the organization has reached more than 4 million people worldwide.""It's about helping widowed people live life in community with each other, so that someone who has borne witness to their pain also bears witness to their life as they continue making their way forward,"" Neff Hernandez said.What inspired her: Hernandez and her husband, Phillip, were enjoying the active life they built as a couple. But everything changed in August 2005 when Phillip went for a bike ride and was hit by a car and killed.""I didn't even know what to do with myself,"" Neff Hernandez said. ""Every single thing about my life changed.""While she had a great support system, none of their friends and family knew how to handle her grief.Hernandez realized she wanted to connect with other widows to learn how they dealt with their new reality.""I thought if I could bring these widows together, what a difference that would make,"" she said.Read more about Michelle Neff Hernandez and her workZannah Mustapha: Building a strong and peaceful future generation His cause: For more than a decade, Zannah Mustapha has devoted his life to providing hope and peace for children in northern Nigeria caught in the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. He and his staff educate more than 2,000 students from both sides of the conflict at the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School.The school offers psychological and social support to help children with trauma. Students, who all live nearby with relatives or family members, are also provided uniforms, books, meals and health services.Mustapha said 1,023 students have graduated, and many have gone on to college or careers.""These are children (who are) ravaged by the disturbances that Boko Haram has brought in,"" he said. ""Children ... are not even having this war.""What inspired him: Mustapha said he believes the way to achieve true and lasting peace in the devastated region is through education, and he has defied all odds to keep the doors to his three schools open.He started the program in 2007 with 36 orphans and expanded, even as others fled the region. As Mustapha continued to expand to meet the needs of children, he saw more and more women struggling when their husbands were killed in the conflict. So, he developed a program in which women could learn a trade to help support their families.A peace leader, Mustapha envisions a Nigeria where there is no more violence, where education and acceptance are encouraged for all.""(When I) see the faces of these children and how these children are dreaming, it gives me the hope that still there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""Read more about Zannah Mustapha and his workShirley Raines: Beauty 2 the StreetzHer cause:  For the past six years, Raines and her organization, Beauty 2 the Streetz, have been a mainstay on Los Angeles' Skid Row, providing food, clothing, hair and makeup services -- and most recently health and hygiene items -- to thousands of people.Rain or shine, she sets up ""shop"" weekly at the corner of 5th and Townes to serve those she calls ""Kings"" and ""Queens."" Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to downtown LA to feed and bring supplies to people.What inspired her: Raines' 2-year-old son Demetrius was staying with her grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized.He died on Sept. 6, 1990, just shy of his third birthday.""I blamed myself for not having stability. If only I'd had my own backyard. If only I'd had my stuff together,"" Raines said.  Soon after, Raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son's biological father to cancer.""I just fell apart. I lived a very unhappy life. I couldn't keep anything together,"" she said.After struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades, Raines' twin sister stepped in, urging her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.""I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,'"" she said. ""I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees.""Read more about Shirley Raines and her workDr. Ala Stanford: Bringing Covid-19 testing and vaccines to Philly's minority neighborhoodsHer cause: Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods.Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing.In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour ""Vax-A-Thon"" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people.The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers.What inspired her:  Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, Stanford's family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep her from dreaming big.""I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it,"" she said. ""That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what.""She became a pediatric surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.She was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia as a result of Covid-19. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent White areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.So, she gathered up protective supplies from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.""The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started,"" she said.Read more about Dr. Ala Stanford and her workMade Janur Yasa: A plastic clean-up program that's feeding familiesHis cause: Made Janur Yasa's non-profit, Plastic Exchange, allows local villagers in Bali, Indonesia, to exchange plastic trash for rice, a main food staple. This barter system benefits the environment and empowers the local people.  In May 2020, he hosted the first exchange in the village where he was born and raised. It was a success, and the concept quickly spread to other villages across Bali.Villages hold community exchange events once a month in which residents can bring in plastic to trade in for rice. Yasa says the organization has so far helped feed thousands of families and collected nearly 300 tons of plastic for recycling.What inspired him: Yasa owns a vegan restaurant on Indonesia's island of Bali, where tourism is the driving economic force. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many residents lost their jobs.""I saw people in my village start worrying about how they were going to put food on the table,"" he said. ""This concerned me.""Yasa said he wanted to find a way to help people in his community during the pandemic while also addressing the ongoing problem of plastic pollution on Bali's beaches.""I got to thinking, inside the challenge there is an opportunity,"" he said.Read more about Made Janur Yasa and his work",2
42," (CNN)Criminal charges against a St. Louis County police officer who shot a Black woman were dropped Monday after the victim requested a restorative justice mediation that focuses on repairing the harm caused by an offense. The St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office said Ashley Fountain Hall asked that assault charges be dropped against former Ladue, Missouri, police officer Julia Crews, 39. The charges stemmed from a dispute that took place on April 23, 2019, outside a Schnucks grocery store.   Crews mistakenly drew her firearm instead of using her Taser to restrain Hall and shot her in the torso, leading to critical injuries, the office said. Hall lost part of her spleen and suffers with post-traumatic stress disorder, prosecutors said.   The prosecutor's office said Crews immediately realized she drew her gun when she intended to use her Taser, then administered aid and apologized ""profusely."" Crews, who was captured crying in her booking photo, immediately resigned, and her response to the shooting ""all played a part in the push for mediation,"" the office said.  Hall, who has since recovered, received a $2 million settlement and pushed for a restorative justice program.  The prosecutor's office said Hall and Crews voluntarily participated in a ""successful"" face-to-face meeting with a mediator, Seema Gajwani, the chief of the Restorative Justice Program for Karl Racine, Attorney General for the District of Columbia.  St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell and Lisa Jones, the office's manager of Victim Services, also participated in the process. The method allows an offender to find rehabilitation through reconciliation with the victim.  ""This was a unique opportunity where the defendant immediately realized she had made a terrible mistake in shooting the victim, and both the defendant and victim reached places where they could see a resolution for this incident outside of the criminal justice process,"" said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell. ""In this instance, justice is served by Restorative Justice, and this doesn't happen without Ashley being 100% onboard.""  According to a 2002 United Nations resolution, restorative justice is a ""process in which the victim and the offender, and, where appropriate, any other individuals or community members affected by a crime, participate together actively in the resolution of matters arising from the crime, generally with the help of a facilitator.""   ""Too often, the criminal justice system gets in the way of resolution and healing, even though that is what these two women wanted and needed. Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell made it possible by offering Restorative Justice,"" said Gajwani. ""Ashley and Julia have the biggest hearts of anyone I have ever met. It was an honor to be a part of that conversation.""  ",2
43," (CNN)More than a dozen families for the victims of the Parkland, Florida, high school massacre have reached a settlement with the Justice Department in connection with a lawsuit they filed after the FBI failed to act on tips warning about the shooter, according to a court filing on Monday. After three years of litigation, ""the parties hereby advise the Court that they have reached an agreement to settle all of the claims at issue,"" according to the joint notice of agreement to settle the federal lawsuit filed on Monday. The Justice Department will pay $127.5 million to the families, according to a source familiar with the case. On Valentine's Day 2018, Nikolas Cruz entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and murdered 17 students and faculty members and injured 17 others. According to the lawsuit, the FBI received tips about Cruz's violent behavior, mental instability, and a large purchase of firearms, yet failed to intervene. Cruz pleaded guilty to the shooting in October and faces the death penalty in an upcoming sentencing hearing. Kristina Infante, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that while the financial details are currently confidential, it is an ""historic"" settlement and ""the culmination of the Parkland families' long and arduous efforts toward truth and accountability.""""It has been an honor to represent the Parkland families who, through their immeasurable grief, have devoted themselves to making the world a safer place,"" Infante said. ""Although no resolution could ever restore what the Parkland families lost, this settlement marks an important step toward justice.""The Justice Department declined to comment beyond the filing.In a motion filed in October, the Justice Department said that the families' ""causation theory is based on pure speculation that special agents in the Miami Field Office would have been able to prevent Cruz from committing his heinous act. Not only is such a theory speculative, but it necessarily relies on an impermissible stacking of inferences regarding how an investigation would have led to the prevention of the crime.""In a separate lawsuit, more than two dozen survivors of the massacre and families of the victims reached a $25 million settlement in October against the Broward County School Board. The agreement will not include any admission of wrongdoing by the school board, David Brill, an attorney in that lawsuit, told CNN.This story has been updated with additional reporting Monday.",2
44," (CNN)The families of the ""Groveland Four"" got some closure Monday after Florida   officially cleared four young Black men wrongly accused of raping a 17-year-old White girl in 1949.Circuit Court Judge Heidi Davis in Lake County, Florida, granted the State's motion to posthumously dismiss the indictments of Ernest Thomas and Samuel Shepherd and vacated the convictions of Charles Greenlee and Walter Irvin, in the case known as the ""Groveland Four.""""I would not hate, but I will love and embrace all of those who did not know at the time that my father was a caring and loving and compassionate person that did not rape anybody.  I stand here today to say thank you,"" said an emotional Carol Greenlee, daughter of Charles Greenlee, in front of cameras at a press conference Monday morning following the court hearing. In 1949, Greenlee, Irvin, Shepherd and Thomas were accused of sexually assaulting Norma Padgett in Groveland, Florida, about 30 miles west of Orlando. The group came to be called the ""Groveland Four."" The case was considered one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in Jim Crow-era Florida. There were doubts about Padgett's testimony from the onset, but in the era of Jim Crow, a jury convicted the men without evidence of a crime. ""For 72 years the families have been living with this and traveling with this journey waiting for today,"" said Bill Gladson, the state attorney, after Monday's hearing. Gladson, a Republican, moved last month to have the men officially exonerated. None of the men are still alive.Gladson said the state sought justice once they realized there was new evidence.""Once we found that evidence, and it revealed what it revealed, that resulted in the motion that you saw today,"" he said.State Sen. Randolph Bracy, a Democrat, said while the exoneration does not ""fix the racial injustice that is so pervasive in our criminal justice system,"" the motion gave the family some closure and offers some hope.""I believe reckoning with the past and correcting gross injustice does put us on a path to creating a fairer more equal court system,"" he said.In 2019, Gov. Ron DeSantis issued full posthumous pardons to the men.""For seventy years, these four men have had their history wrongly written for crimes they did not commit. As I have said before, while that is a long time to wait, it is never too late to do the right thing,"" DeSantis said in the statement at the time. ""I believe the rule of law is society's sacred bond. When it is trampled, we all suffer. For the Groveland Four, the truth was buried. The Perpetrators celebrated. But justice has cried out from that day until this.""The Florida House issued a posthumous apology to the Groveland Four in April 2017.  ""As a state, we're truly sorry,"" Rep. Chris Sprowls said to the men's families, after lawmakers unanimously voted to exonerate them.  ""The memories can't be erased, the pain they've endured can't be fixed but today we have an opportunity to provide closure to these families in the form of an apology,"" Rep. Bobby DuBose, who sponsored the bill that called for their pardon.A decades long chapter of injustice finally closedPadgett claimed that on the night of July 16, 1949, her car broke down in Groveland. She said the four men stopped and raped her.  The men were arrested. Three of them were tortured until police were able to elicit a confession from two of them.  Thomas, who managed to escape custody, was killed after a manhunt. Greenlee was sentenced to life in prison. Shepherd and Irvin received the death penalty.  While being transported from county jail for a retrial, the sheriff shot them both and claimed self-defense.  Shepherd died at the scene and Irvin survived by playing dead. His sentence was later commuted to life in prison.Gilbert King wrote about the case in his Pulitzer-Prize winning book, ""Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America.""""We need courage,"" Aaron Newson, Ernst Thomas' nephew, said fighting off tears in front of cameras today following the court hearing. ""A lot of families did not get this opportunity, maybe they will.  Maybe this is the start of something good.  I hope so.  This country needs to come together.""",2
45," (CNN)Holiday travelers should be thankful as Thanksgiving week kicks off on a tranquil note across much of the Lower 48, says the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).  Later in the week, when the weather isn't so tranquil, do what my colleagues at CNN do; #BlameJudson. As a meteorologist, I am used to taking the blame for something we ultimately have no control over. So, blame me and spend your extra time being thankful you are getting the chance to travel once again. AAA is predicting travel this holiday week will be back to near pre-pandemic levels.With higher travel numbers combined with the weather, it could add up to some delays on the roadways and in the air this week. This week, thankfully, the early storm system does not seem significant. However, regardless of the weather this week, due to the busy holiday travel, any normal or even weak storm could significantly impact what millions of you do in the US this week, which is why I bother telling you this.  ""As the holiday week gets off and running, much of the continental US will be devoid of hazards the first half of the week,"" the WPC says. The latter half looks more ominous.  Jennifer Gray and I (Judson Jones) drop these dispatches into your inbox when we think a storm warrants it. You can sign up to receive them in your inbox here. Here is what we expect ahead of Thanksgiving Many in the East -- including yours truly -- woke up to the pitter-patter of light rain falling on their roofs. A cold front is pushing through the region and although the rain and low clouds could bring some slight delays to the roadways and air traffic, I don't expect much to mount Monday morning. You can always get the latest airport delays and weather forecast here. Monday afternoon winds will really begin to kick up behind the storm front. Wind gusts could top out at 30 mph.  The two most common airport delays are low ceilings -- low clouds -- and wind during winter. ""The combination of airport surface winds and low ceiling and visibility conditions account for about 75 percent of delays,"" the Federal Aviation Administration explained. Although not incredibly strong, the wind direction could be problematic this afternoon for the way runways are configured in the New York metro area. So, expect delays.These winds will be persistent through Tuesday and possibly even into Wednesday across the Northeast.  Chicago is another major airport hub that could see delays from wind Monday and other points during the week. Especially on Wednesday, when winds will reach gusts of up to 40 mph. If you want more information, you can also check out the FAA's official delay page, or Flight Aware's misery map.Cold Canadian air dips south Cold Canadian air will infiltrate the eastern third of the US behind the cold front.  ""It certainly feels like the Holiday Season is upon us in the East where below normal temperatures look to set up shop through Wednesday morning,"" the WPC says. Temperatures will struggle to get out of the 30s in much of the Great Lakes region.  ""The Upper Great Lakes will receive several inches of snow today as cold air rushing over the warm Great Lakes activates the lake effect snow machine downwind of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Erie, and Ontario,"" the WPC says.  With temperatures dropping to near the freezing mark in some locations, air travel delays due to deicing are also possible, especially during the overnight and early-morning hours.  Temperatures are running about 10-20 degrees below normal and will push farther east into the major Northeast cities by Tuesday.  ""There is a chance that temperatures reach the freezing mark for the first time this season at Central Park,"" Monday night into Tuesday, the New York National Weather Service office says. ""Even in the Southeast, daily temperature anomalies of 10 to 15 degrees below normal are anticipated into Wednesday,"" the WPC says. The heaviest snow is in the Northwest Early in the week, the snowiest and most unsettled weather will be confined to the Northwest, from the Pacific coast and as far inland as the Northern Rockies.  ""By Wednesday morning, the heaviest snowfall totals likely occur in the Cascades where over a foot of snow in the highest of elevations is expected. Parts of the Bitterroots and Lewis Range can also expect 6 to 12 inches of snowfall,"" the WPC says. Thankfully, the lower elevations will not see the heavy rainfall they have experienced the past few weeks. Instead, it will be the lighter variety people in Seattle are more used to seeing.  The rain will take a break a little on Wednesday in this region, but rain will vary from light to moderate most of the week.  Thanksgiving liquid sunshine Temperatures are likely to moderate back near normal across the East Coast and the winds will have died down. Which is excellent news for anyone venturing down early to the historic parade route in Manhattan to see the new Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons. As family traditions carry on, the storm system meteorologists are all keeping our eyes on continues building across the central US. Texas will get the most rainfall on Thanksgiving Day.  Or, as my dad would positively say, ""liquid sunshine.""  Moderate rainfall, possibly heavy at times, is expected over parts of eastern Texas into Thanksgiving Day, the WPC says.   Return travel looks more dicey Rainfall is forecast to spread across the eastern US into the weekend.  It may even set the stage for a more massive disruption at airports Friday and Saturday in the Northeast.  On Friday, another front associated with this system will push through the Northeast. Rain will again fall in the major metros. Behind the front, winds will pick up and are forecast to be stronger than the winds earlier in the week. With this system, once again comes the colder air and lake effect snow.  If this storm system does prove to be stronger than what we will have experienced early in the week, don't blame others, just #BlameJudson; it may make it easier to be thankful for the travel that way.   In the meantime, we will keep an eye on the forecast. You can continue to track the storms here.The latest weather stories are always available along with your local forecast here.  Jennifer and I are both thankful for all of you who have stuck with us through this hurricane season. We are also grateful the end of the season ended far more quietly than anyone expected.  We aren't going anywhere now that the season is coming to an end. Many of you have asked that we keep this going through the winter season to be here for any major winter storms that pop up this winter. So, we expect we will drop into your inboxes once or twice over the coming months.  And if you are wondering, I plan on enjoying the weather on Thursday morning with my family next to our fire pit, smoking our turkey using this recipe, while drinking this morning cocktail. You're welcome in advance.  Happy Thanksgiving!",2
46," (CNN)Women in Texas who have been blocked from exercising their constitutional right to obtain an abortion for almost three months had reason to expect Monday that the Supreme Court was poised to rule on challenges to the state restrictions. That's because, last week, the court announced that it would release the term's first set of opinions Monday. Abortion providers, lawyers, journalists and anyone following the abortion wars, believed that because the case had been fast-tracked due to confusion on the ground in the country's second-largest state, the opinion was imminent.   Court watchers gathered virtually at 10 a.m. ET, preparing to download an opinion about Texas' six-week abortion ban. Instead, all they got was unanimous ruling on a water rights dispute between Mississippi and Tennessee.  As a result, uncertainty will continue to reign in Texas where doctors are afraid to perform abortions after around six weeks into a pregnancy for fear of the law's draconian penalties, clinics in nearby states are overwhelmed with Texas patients. Women without the means to travel -- including victims of rape and incest who are not exempted from the law -- are left with few options. Roe v. Wade, the near 50-year-old decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy, continues to be a dead letter in Texas. After oral arguments on November 1, supporters of abortion rights were given reason to hope, but they are stunned that the court has yet to act. A majority of justices, including conservatives Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, expressed skepticism during oral arguments. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan appeared incandescent at times, referring to the architects of the law derisively as ""some geniuses"" who sought to find a way around the premise that ""states are not to nullify federal constitutional rights."" There was a note of urgency in the air in the august chamber, an unspoken suggestion that there would soon be resolution to a case that has captured the nation's attention, placed the justices under the glare of public spotlight and reignited the decades old furor about a woman's right to an abortion. To be sure, the process to craft an opinion is arduous and ordinarily takes months. The justices are writing to resolve the case at hand, but also to educate the lower courts for future, similar challenges. In most instances, draft opinions ricochet through chambers. Sometimes justices add their own notes or suggest language that could garner their vote. A cast of law clerks examine each portion of the opinion to ensure it is watertight. Every once in a while -- even late in the game -- a justice changes his or her mind. The Texas law, which a 5-4 court allowed to go into effect on September 1 while the appeals process plays out, bars abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat at around six weeks -- often before a woman knows she is pregnant -- and is in stark contrast to Roe v. Wade. The justices are considering the law's novel structure which bars state officials from enforcing it.  Private citizens from anywhere in the country can bring civil suits against anyone who assists a pregnant person seeking an abortion in violation of the law. Critics say it was crafted to shield it from challenges in federal courts and stymie attempts by abortion providers and the government to sue the state and block implementation. Now, supporters of abortion rights wonder if the conventional wisdom after oral arguments was wrong or if the justices are looking for a novel or unexpected way to handle the dispute. ""Every day without a ruling from the Court is another day a blatantly unconstitutional law prevents people in Texas from fully accessing their right to abortion—and it's way past time to put an end to this attack on equality,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. ""The wheels of justice often turn slowly, but we need the Justices to step on the gas here."" ""The cruelty and heartache that our staff and patients have endured will continue,"" Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, which is behind the challenge, said in a statement.""  Hagstrom Miller said that patients ""deserve better than the constant attacks on their reproductive autonomy"" and clinic staff who ""show up day after day in a situation that none of us ever thought we would find ourselves in"" are suffering.  Hagstrom Miller knows that even if her side wins before the Supreme Court and providers are allowed their day in court to challenge the law, another, potentially more consequential case looms. On December 1, the justices will hear a case in which Mississippi is directly asking the court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many believed that the Texas case would be resolved long before that dispute. Kimberlyn Schwartz, spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, suggested in a statement that the court might be poised to rule in her group's favor given the delays thus far. ""If the Supreme Court believed the Texas Heartbeat Act was as outrageous and unconstitutional as the abortion industry claims, they would likely want to act quickly, at least entering a temporary stay on the law,"" Schwartz said. ""Meanwhile, every day the Texas Heartbeat Act is in effect is a victory because the law saves an estimated 75-100 babies from abortion per day,"" she said. Sean M. Marotta, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, tweeted about the Supreme Court's inaction after the announcement of the water case on Monday. ""Scotus once again proving the ancient truism: Except on the last day of the Term, anyone who says they know when a particular opinion is coming out is guessing or lying,"" he said. ",2
47," (CNN)Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath announced Monday that she would run for a new district in the Atlanta suburbs against fellow Democrat Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux after the Republican controlled-state legislature redrew McBath's district to make it a safely red seat.Georgia Republican legislators created a map that would drastically change the lines of the two competitive seats north of Atlanta held by the two Democrats. If Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signs it into law and the map survives potential challenges in court, it would essentially give the GOP a 9-5 advantage in the state, rather than the current 8-6 advantage.In a statement, McBath claimed that Republicans were trying ""to draw me out of Congress.""Following the 2012 murder of her son Jordan Davis, McBath quit her job as a Delta flight attendant to work as an activist with Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action. In 2018, McBath ran for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's old seat and beat Republican Rep. Karen Handel by a point and beat her again in a 2020 rematch by over nine points. ""It is no mystery why Republicans and the NRA have decided I'm their top target,"" McBath said. ""As a Black woman, activist, and mother on a mission—they would like nothing more than to stop me from speaking truth to power about the gun lobby and Republican Party in Congress.""In 2018, Bordeaux, a former Georgia State University professor, won a close Democratic primary before losing to Republican Rep. Rob Woodall by fewer than 500 votes. After Woodall retired, Bordeaux won her 2020 race against Republican Dr. Rich McCormick by about three points.Bordeaux said she has strong ties to the Gwinnett county-based district, and worked to ""expand Medicaid, lower healthcare costs, create universal pre-K and address our unique transit needs,"" while securing loans for small businesses.""Georgia's 7th district deserves a representative that understands their issues,"" Bordeaux said. ""I've run five elections here, and I have deep connections with the diverse communities in our district.""",2
48," (CNN)Legendary Black radio host Joe Madison is two weeks into a hunger strike that could become a risk to his health. Madison, 72, is doing it for one reason: To pressure President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress to pass voting rights legislation as the GOP actively works to restrict ballot access.As Madison told CNN's Don Lemon on Friday, ""Just as food is essential for the existence of life, voting is essential for the existence of democracy.""Madison, a civil rights activist turned SiriusXM radio host who was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2019, is so committed to the cause he is willing to put his life on the line. When I spoke to Madison on my own radio show a few days into his hunger strike, he shared that his wife asked him, ""Are you telling me that you are willing to die for this cause?"" He said he looked at her and responded with one word: ""Yes."" Madison then added passionately, ""This is the new civil rights movement.""More than 50 years after the Voting Rights Act, no one should have to risk their life to ensure all Americans can exercise a constitutionally protected right to vote. But that's where we are in 2021 America thanks to the GOP. It was not Donald Trump's ""Big Lie"" about non-existent election fraud but his ""Big Loss"" in the 2020 election that has animated Republicans to pass 33 laws in 19 states since January to make it more difficult to vote. Today's GOP won't allow the democratic will of the people to stand in their way of acquiring and retaining political power.The GOP's effort to ""cancel"" voting rights is a threat to all Americans who believe in democracy, regardless of race. But it is a particular threat to Black Americans, who have been targeted in Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, and who have been historically disenfranchised with Jim Crow era laws designed to make it almost impossible for them to vote without the danger of deadly violence.Just one example is World War II veteran Maceo Snipes, who stood up to that threat when he became the only Black person to vote in the 1946 primary in Taylor County, Georgia. A few days after the election, a group of White men showed up at Snipes' door, where they asked him to step outside. When Snipes did, they shot him. Snipes later died from the shooting, and charges were never brought against his killers. Mr. Snipes, though, was far from the only Black person or allies of other races who was killed in the pursuit of access to the ballot for African Americans. The GOP's voter suppression campaign is not only a threat to our democracy today but it's also an insult to the memory of Snipes and all others who have toiled, bled and died simply for the right to cast a ballot. In his first speech after defeating Trump in the 2020 election, President Biden credited Black voters for being a large part of his win. ""The African American community stood up again for me,"" he said of the community that voted nearly 90 percent in his favor in last year's election. He then pledged, ""You've always had my back, and I'll have yours.""Countless callers to my radio show who are Black have cited that line to express their disappointment in Biden's failing to have their backs on voting rights. Instead, Biden has been laser-focused for months on his infrastructure and social safety net legislation. But what's the use of shining bridges if you don't have a functioning democracy? With Biden's success last week in both signing the bipartisan infrastructure bill into law and his broader Build Back Better bill passing the House, he must now make voting rights reform his public priority.To be fair, the Democrats in the House already passed two different voting rights bills this year, the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. But Republicans in the Senate have blocked progress on both.There has also been a glimmer of hope in recent months with the Senate Democrats drafting the Freedom to Vote Act, which would provide a national standard for federal elections as well as end partisan gerrymandering. All 50 Democratic Senators supported the bill, meaning this could pass if brought to a vote with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. But due to the filibuster requiring 10 GOP Senators to consent to even allow a vote, this measure has been blocked with not one Republican senator in support. You can see why former President Barack Obama last year called the filibuster a ""Jim Crow relic,"" as the GOP is now using it to block legislation that would protect against voter suppression.The Democrats' failure to make voting rights a top priority may also explain why, in the recent Virginia gubernatorial race, Black voters were a smaller percentage of the electorate (16%) than in 2020 (18%), and only 86% voted for the Democratic candidate compared to 89% who went for Biden in 2020. In a close election, this kind of drop-off can decide the winner.In 2021, who would have thought -- as Joe Madison put it -- that we'd be engaged in a ""new civil rights movement""? But this is where our nation finds itself as the GOP rejects a robust democracy in the pursuit of electoral autocracy. It's time President Biden and the Democrats make voting rights the top issue in 2022. Biden should travel the country selling it, in addition to publicly -- and very doggedly -- pressuring Senate Democrats to end the filibuster. Biden owes that to the Black community who supported him, and to all Americans who believe that their vote and their voice matters.",2
49,"New York (CNN)Michael Cohen is a free man.On Monday morning Donald Trump's former personal attorney and self-described fixer was officially released from his three-year prison sentence -- the past year-plus of it served from his posh Park Avenue apartment.Speaking outside of the federal courthouse in New York, Cohen said he received three years supervised release and planned to continue to work with law enforcement to ""ensure that others are held responsible for their dirty deeds and that no one is ever believed to be above the law.""""My release today in no way negates the actions I took at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump,"" Cohen said. ""But it also does not negate the behavior of the Justice Department, Bill Barr, the Southern District of New York Prosecutors, Judge William H. Pauley the third, or Donald himself, in my initial incarceration and prosecution.""He added he will continue to cooperate. ""I will continue to provide information testimony documents and my full cooperation on all ongoing investigations to ensure that others are held responsible for their dirty deeds and that no one is ever believed to be above the law,"" Cohen said.Cohen had been counting down the days, literally, on his Twitter feed with a chalk board and dwindling numbers.""Three and FREE! Come Monday morning, I head to 500 Pearl Street, sign my release papers and then we celebrate together on @instagram,"" he tweeted Thursday to his 500,000-plus followers.Cohen's release after pleading guilty to nine federal crimes marks a rebirth for a man who once berated and bullied anyone he perceived as critical of Trump.He remained loyal during the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, staying true to the idea that he would take a bullet for Trump. But that all changed after the April 2018 FBI raid on his home, office and hotel room at the Regency in New York.Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal crimes including tax fraud, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations for helping pay off two women who threatened to go public with past alleged affairs with Trump just before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the affairs.During his guilty plea in a courtroom in lower Manhattan, Cohen pointed the finger directly at Trump, solidifying their split, saying he facilitated the payoffs ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. He then pleaded guilty a second time, several months later, for lying to House committees investigating interference in the election, which he also said he did at the direction of Trump.Cohen sought to remake his image as a new man, one who had finally broken free from the spell Trump held over him. Setting a course to exact his rebirth and revenge, he testified before Congress, alleging Trump and the Trump Organization manipulated the value of his assets to get better loans and insurance and to minimize their taxes. In the wake of his testimony, civil and criminal investigations were launched in Manhattan. Cohen has met with New York district attorney prosecutors multiple times. In July, the Trump Organization was indicted on state charges alleging a 15-year tax fraud scheme. Trump Organization has pleaded not guilty and the investigation is continuing.Cohen, who always courted the media, was met by a throng of reporters ahead of reporting to serve his sentence at the Otisville prison camp, which had been named one of ""America's 10 cushiest prisons."" In a parting shot, he promised Trump that he would not stay silent.At Otisville, Cohen worked on the prison's heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and built a rapport with fellow inmates, including Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino of MTV's ""Jersey Shore.""After several attempts, Cohen was released from prison in May 2020 due to the pandemic only to have that reversed when Cohen reported to the courthouse to finalize his transition to home confinement. When he objected to many of the conditions, he was taken into custody.Cohen sued, alleging the Justice Department, under attorney general Barr, had retaliated against him because he was planning to write a tell-all book about Trump. A federal judge agreed and Cohen was released to home confinement in July 2020.Since then, Cohen has released his book, launched a podcast and frequently appears on cable TV from his apartment to bash the former president. As he plots his next moves the tabloids will likely follow suit. Twice last month, the New York Post's Page Six spotted him having coffee with Kanye West at the Regency Hotel. Cohen did not elaborate on his conversations with West during an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota Monday afternoon, only offering that ""a lot of it is business related.""This story has been updated with additional information Monday.",2
50,"New York (CNN Business)The Chinese economy presents some unique challenges for investors. On one hand, China is home to several of the most dynamic and rapidly growing companies on the planet, such as electric car makers Xpeng and Nio (NIO) as well as privately held TikTok owner ByteDance.But China's recent crackdown on the tech sector has slowed earnings momentum at big brand name firms including Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA) and WeChat owner Tencent (TCEHY). Continued human rights concerns, brought to the forefront once more following questions about the safety of tennis star Peng Shuai, are also a problem for some investors. So can (and should) you avoid the world's second largest economy? Some experts think that's exactly what investors should be doing.""Investors have underestimated autocracy risk,"" said Perth Tolle, sponsor of the Freedom 100 Emerging Markets (FRDM) ETF, a fund that has no exposure to Chinese stocks. ""You can't always factor in the risk of a government coming in overnight and saying to a company 'you can't really make a profit,'"" she said. Tolle told CNN Business that investors should be more concerned about capital flowing out of the country due to worries about Beijing exerting more control over companies in mainland China.That's why her fund has more exposure to other markets such as Taiwan and South Korea instead of China. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) are two top holdings in the FRDM ETF.Emerging markets funds doing better without China exposureTolle isn't the only one screening out China from emerging markets funds. Big fund companies such as iShares and Columbia Threadneedle also have emerging market ETFs that leave Chinese companies out of their holdings. The funds have outperformed broader emerging markets funds this year, too, showing that investing for social good can be profitable. The FRDM ETF, as well as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF (EMXC) and Columbia EM Core ex-China ETF (XCEM), are each up between 6% and 8% in 2021. That's compared to a 2% drop for the broader iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which owns Tencent, Alibaba and Chinese food delivery service Meituan as top holdings. Other investing experts argue that Chinese president Xi Jinping's recent push to crack down on big tech firms is not a good sign for earnings in the short-term.""We like the longer-term view, but in the near- term, we're more cautious,"" said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. ""Some other emerging markets have better growth potential.""""The move from promoting more entrepreneurship to an equal growth sharing of the pie changes the equation,"" he added. ""We took some money off the table and reduced our exposure to China.""Another portfolio manager argued that trying to predict which companies or sectors will come under the ""Xi Jinping thought sphere of influence"" makes investing there a challenge. Major Chinese education stocks have taken a hit this year as well due to regulatory concerns. ""The investor perception of risk has risen in China, and it has risen with cause,"" said Paul Espinosa, portfolio manager with Seafarer Capital Partners.   Espinosa also said China isn't as attractive as other emerging markets simply because stocks outside of the country are better bargains. Companies in Brazil and others parts of Latin America are more compelling values than Chinese-based firms, Espinosa said. He's also looking at investment opportunities in the Middle East.""Everyone is so focused on China, and it is dominated by growth investors,"" he said. ""But there are more opportunities outside of China."" ",2
51,"New York (CNN Business)Gas prices are skyrocketing, and Americans want to save at the pump. That plays right into the hands of Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club.The national gas price average jumped to $3.41 a gallon Friday, according to AAA, 61% higher than the average at the same time last year. The Biden administration has called for an investigation into whether oil and gas companies acted illegally to push up prices. The spike has pushed more shoppers to rely on these chains to fill up their tanks, say the companies, retail analysts, and fuel experts. Gas prices at warehouse clubs can be as much as 30 cents lower than traditional gas stations, and the chains offer members coupons to use in their stores when they fill up. Gasoline sales at the warehouse clubs are an important part of their business and draw customers inside.""People are seeking out the clubs because of the gas,"" said Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""It's US consumers' nature to go out of their way for lower gas prices.""Costco, for example, is typically 20 cents a gallon below the market average, according to Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at IHS Markit's Oil Price Information Service. BJ's says it's 10 cents below average.These companies are ""winners when gasoline prices go skyward,"" said Kloza.Costco (COST), Sam's Club and BJ's (BJ) want you to fill up your tank in their parking lots and then go stock up on giant jugs of ketchup, boxes of snacks and clothing. (And why not buy a flat-screen TV or a new couch while you're at it?) Their gas stations give these warehouse stores an advantage that many retail competitors can't match.  Gas makes up around 10%, $20 billion annually, of Costco's overall sales and 9% of BJ's. Walmart (WMT), which owns Sam's Club, does not disclose what portion of its sales come from gas.Gas is a notoriously low-margin business, but retailers can make money from selling huge volumes of gas -- even while charging much less than independent gas stations, said Kloza, adding that it's not unusual for sales at a Costco location to reach up to 1 million gallons a month compared to an average of 80,000 gallons a month at typical gas stations.Despite their big-brand names, the vast majority of Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell gas statons are independently owned, so they aren't able to make a volume play like wholesalers do. Although wholesalers are able to make a profit on gas, they're not making much: Costco, for example, reported that gasoline has a lower profit margin than the rest of its business. Rising gas prices typically help Costco's sales, but hurt its profits. ""When there are inflationary pressures and prices are going up, people look to save on gas,"" said Richard Galanti, Costco's chief financial officer. For every 100 people who come to Costco to fill up on gas, more than half go shop inside afterwards, he said.Gas sales at BJ's Wholesale Club jumped 20% during its most recent quarter ending October 30 compared with the same time a year ago. BJ's is growing market share in gasoline ""in leaps and bounds,"" CEO Robert Eddy said on a call with analysts Thursday. When gas prices hit over $3 a gallon, ""members love us"" and shift their gas spending to the club.Gas discounts are a tool Walmart uses to encourage customers to sign up for Walmart+ memberships, which also offer free shipping and discounts on prescriptions.Walmart said on Tuesday that it's actively trying to keep gas prices down to attract customers worried about how much they're paying at the pump, especially as federal stimulus benefits wane.""Gas prices are a concern....They're up dramatically versus a year ago,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on an earnings call. ""The customers had money [then]. And at some point, that's going to come to an end."" ",2
52,"New York (CNN Business)CVS' announcement Thursday that it will close 900 stores over the next three years — around 10% of its pharmacies — may have caught some shoppers off guard.Isn't CVS doing really well right now? Haven't lots of people gone to drug stores during the pandemic to stock up on hand sanitizer, cleaning wipes and toilet paper? What about all those Covid-19 vaccine shots CVS gives out?Actually, CVS' closures shouldn't come as a surprise. They are the latest moves in the long-running contraction of the US retail pharmacy sector. CVS (CVS), Walgreens (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) have been shuttering stores for years, while independent pharmacies have come under pressure from chains. Drug store closures can hurt local communities, creating access gaps for medications and essentials.CVS, the largest drug store chain in the United States, pointed to ""changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs"" as factors in its decision to close stores. Here's why CVS will close 900 stores.Pivot to health careThe future of CVS is not selling snacks, candy, shampoo and greeting cards. It's in health care.To that end, in 2018 CVS completed a $69 billion acquisition of Aetna, the largest health care deal in history, to create a gigantic customer base of about 40 million Americans. CVS bet that the deal will increase its profits from those patients' health plans while helping to lower its costs. CVS also has been revamping its retail strategy and said Thursday that its stores will have three distinct models: locations that offer primary care services; ""HealthHub"" stores that have on-site dieticians, nurse practitioners and lab services, and on-site treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma; and traditional stores.CVS is ""really pivoting and leaning into the health care aspects of the business,"" said George Hill, an analyst who covers the company and the health care industry at Deutsche Bank. ""You'd much rather be selling health care services that are high-dollar value, high-margin versus greeting cards.""Too many storesWhen you walk down the street or drive around the suburbs you'll typically pass a CVS. And then hit a Walgreens right next door. Rite Aid is probably pretty close, too. ""There's too many pharmacies in the country and there's too much pharmacy capacity. That gives CVS a reason to go,"" said Hill.CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020, yet it still has more than 9,900 stores. That's more than Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST) — combined.Its latest closings will ""reduce store density in certain locations,"" CVS said Thursday, which translates into the fact that CVS has too many stores too close to each other in some places.Competition from Amazon and Dollar GeneralAlso, fewer people are heading to CVS and other drug stores to fill their prescriptions and shop for household staples these days. (And they're not going into CVS to buy tobacco, either, which the company stopped selling in 2014.)Some shoppers have replaced their trips to stores like CVS by buying their supplies online from Amazon (AMZN), or from brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart and Target. The chains have built their own strong e-commerce businesses in recent years.Dollar General (DG) has also grabbed market share from drug stores, undercutting the sector with lower prices on similar items. And now Dollar General is launching its own health care initiative as it continues to take business from pharmacies.Online pharmacies and telemedicine have gained traction, too. Amazon bought PillPack in 2018 for more than $700 million and started shipping prescriptions to Prime members last year. Capsule and other digital pharmacies that deliver directly to customers' homes are also growing. Although brick-and-mortar pharmacies are still an important stop for many elderly people,or those who don't use the web or have access to it, they are increasingly becoming a thing of the past to the growing ranks of online shoppers.Rising costsClosing stores also reduces CVS' costs while still keeping most of its sales. Its labor and store operations costs increased during the pandemic because of safety protections like plexiglass, floor decals and masks. The company said in August it planned to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 in a bid to retain and attract workers.""There are cost pressures in all directions,"" said Hill, the Deutsche Bank analyst.Seventy-five percent of CVS' sales comes from filling prescriptions, but its profits from that segment have declined in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates.But when CVS closes a store, it can hold onto most of those sales by shifting the prescriptions to its nearest pharmacies, Hill said.Covid-19 vaccines weren't a huge boostCVS got a lift from people coming into its stores for their Covid-19 vaccines and tests. The company has administered 43 million vaccines and around 38 million tests, CEO Karen Lynch said on an earnings call earlier this month.But the vaccines were only a short-term gain for the company, which said they will generate only $3 billion in revenue in 2021. That will decline by up to 40% next year, along with whatever sales CVS racked up as shoppers browsed aisles while they waited to get vaccinated, Lynch said.People also visited their doctors less frequently last year and into 2021, and elective procedures were suspended early in the pandemic, which meant that CVS filled fewer regular and chronic care prescriptions than in the years before the pandemic. And fewer people have also been coming into stores to pick up cough and fever medicines — big business for CVS — because they're still wearing masks and spending more time at home than they once did.",2
53," (CNN)Women in Texas who have been blocked from exercising their constitutional right to obtain an abortion for almost three months had reason to expect Monday that the Supreme Court was poised to rule on challenges to the state restrictions. That's because, last week, the court announced that it would release the term's first set of opinions Monday. Abortion providers, lawyers, journalists and anyone following the abortion wars, believed that because the case had been fast-tracked due to confusion on the ground in the country's second-largest state, the opinion was imminent.   Court watchers gathered virtually at 10 a.m. ET, preparing to download an opinion about Texas' six-week abortion ban. Instead, all they got was unanimous ruling on a water rights dispute between Mississippi and Tennessee.  As a result, uncertainty will continue to reign in Texas where doctors are afraid to perform abortions after around six weeks into a pregnancy for fear of the law's draconian penalties, clinics in nearby states are overwhelmed with Texas patients. Women without the means to travel -- including victims of rape and incest who are not exempted from the law -- are left with few options. Roe v. Wade, the near 50-year-old decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy, continues to be a dead letter in Texas. After oral arguments on November 1, supporters of abortion rights were given reason to hope, but they are stunned that the court has yet to act. A majority of justices, including conservatives Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, expressed skepticism during oral arguments. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan appeared incandescent at times, referring to the architects of the law derisively as ""some geniuses"" who sought to find a way around the premise that ""states are not to nullify federal constitutional rights."" There was a note of urgency in the air in the august chamber, an unspoken suggestion that there would soon be resolution to a case that has captured the nation's attention, placed the justices under the glare of public spotlight and reignited the decades old furor about a woman's right to an abortion. To be sure, the process to craft an opinion is arduous and ordinarily takes months. The justices are writing to resolve the case at hand, but also to educate the lower courts for future, similar challenges. In most instances, draft opinions ricochet through chambers. Sometimes justices add their own notes or suggest language that could garner their vote. A cast of law clerks examine each portion of the opinion to ensure it is watertight. Every once in a while -- even late in the game -- a justice changes his or her mind. The Texas law, which a 5-4 court allowed to go into effect on September 1 while the appeals process plays out, bars abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat at around six weeks -- often before a woman knows she is pregnant -- and is in stark contrast to Roe v. Wade. The justices are considering the law's novel structure which bars state officials from enforcing it.  Private citizens from anywhere in the country can bring civil suits against anyone who assists a pregnant person seeking an abortion in violation of the law. Critics say it was crafted to shield it from challenges in federal courts and stymie attempts by abortion providers and the government to sue the state and block implementation. Now, supporters of abortion rights wonder if the conventional wisdom after oral arguments was wrong or if the justices are looking for a novel or unexpected way to handle the dispute. ""Every day without a ruling from the Court is another day a blatantly unconstitutional law prevents people in Texas from fully accessing their right to abortion—and it's way past time to put an end to this attack on equality,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. ""The wheels of justice often turn slowly, but we need the Justices to step on the gas here."" ""The cruelty and heartache that our staff and patients have endured will continue,"" Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman's Health, which is behind the challenge, said in a statement.""  Hagstrom Miller said that patients ""deserve better than the constant attacks on their reproductive autonomy"" and clinic staff who ""show up day after day in a situation that none of us ever thought we would find ourselves in"" are suffering.  Hagstrom Miller knows that even if her side wins before the Supreme Court and providers are allowed their day in court to challenge the law, another, potentially more consequential case looms. On December 1, the justices will hear a case in which Mississippi is directly asking the court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many believed that the Texas case would be resolved long before that dispute. Kimberlyn Schwartz, spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, suggested in a statement that the court might be poised to rule in her group's favor given the delays thus far. ""If the Supreme Court believed the Texas Heartbeat Act was as outrageous and unconstitutional as the abortion industry claims, they would likely want to act quickly, at least entering a temporary stay on the law,"" Schwartz said. ""Meanwhile, every day the Texas Heartbeat Act is in effect is a victory because the law saves an estimated 75-100 babies from abortion per day,"" she said. Sean M.

54,"New York (CNN Business)President Joe Biden on Monday formally announced his intent to nominate Jerome Powell to serve as the chairman of the Federal Reserve for a second term and nominate Lael Brainard to serve as the Fed's vice chair.Powell's four-year term is up in February, and the President faced a key decision of whether to keep Powell, who was put in the job by a Republican, in the government's most important economic policy job. At a time when rising consumer prices, inflation and shortages caused by the supply chain crisis are urgent concerns of the White House, there has been heightened focus on who the President was going to pick to lead the nation's central banking system. The White House cited Powell's ""steady leadership"" amid the economic turbulence of the pandemic as a reason for the decision. The Powell-led Fed took a series of unprecedented steps in March and April 2020 that helped ensure the Covid recession did not morph into a full-blown depression.Economic recovery, the White House said in a statement, ""is a testament to the success of the President's economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America's economy back on track.""Biden expressed his ""full confidence"" in Brainard and Powell in a statement.""I'm confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard's focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before. Together, they also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system,"" Biden said.Tough road aheadAssuming he gets confirmed by the Senate, Powell faces a very challenging situation in his second term at the helm of the Fed. The United States is grappling with its first inflation scare in decades, parts of the economy remain scarred by the worst pandemic in a century and the Fed's credibility has been called into question by a trading scandal. Although Powell seemed to put out the fire over the insider trading scandal with tough new ethics rules, inflation looks like the trickiest obstacle facing the Fed over the coming months. Up until very recently, the Fed has kept its foot firmly on the pedal, with rock-bottom interest rates and a massive bond buying program stimulating the US economy and financial markets. That's despite the fact that inflation is surging, hiring is booming and the housing market is arguably hotter than ever before. Although managing inflation is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, sticker shock is coming at a political cost to Biden, whose poll numbers have taken a hit in recent months as voters get more worried about the economy.""All Americans are feeling inflation,"" Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Minneapolis Fed, told CNN. ""Biden is saying, 'I am trusting my political future in this Fed leadership. I trust them to get inflation under control.'"" By keeping Powell in charge, the White House is signaling support for the central bank's view that inflation is a temporary phenomenon, albeit one that has lasted longer than the Fed anticipated.But there was little evidence Biden was seriously considering a Fed chair who would be much more aggressive on inflation. Brainard, who ultimately did not get the top job, has monetary policy views more or less in line with Powell's.""It's not like Brainard is a stealth hawk,"" said Kocherlakota.Indeed, Goldman Sachs said Monday after the Powell news that it continues to expect the Fed to only gradually lift interest rates, beginning in July. Why Biden picked PowellBy sticking with Powell, the Fed is opting for continuity and confirmability. Not only has Powell garnered the support of Republicans and moderate Democrats, he is well respected on Wall Street and investors are very comfortable with his communication strategy. Switching to a new face risked adding uncertainty to the confirmation process that could have rattled markets. And it would have added complexity to the already difficult task of reassuring investors nervous about the Fed unwinding its emergency policies. ""After an atypically lengthy deliberation phase, the White House ultimately went with the safest choice,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG,. ""The Powell pick provides leadership continuity that the market always appreciates and should give the White House a victory via a quick and relatively painless confirmation process. ""By choosing Powell, Biden is also sending a strong signal about the importance of an independent Fed, a norm that came under attack during the Trump era. Powell vs. BrainardBiden recently met with Powell and Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, separately at the White House as he weighed his decision, CNN previously reported. Brainard had been viewed as the leading contender if the President decided against Powell for a second term. ""This is a good decision,"" former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher told CNN. ""While Lael Brainard is a most capable economist, appointing her under pressure from progressive Senators like Elizabeth Warren would have sent a signal that the Fed has been overtly politicized, irreparably damaging its reputation for independence.""Powell has faced significant opposition from some progressive Democrats, who criticize his track record on financial regulation. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said at a recent Senate hearing that Powell was a ""dangerous man to head up the Fed"" and that he has ""regularly voted to deregulate Wall Street."" She said a Republican majority at the Fed under Powell's leadership could ""drive this economy over a financial cliff again.""""It's no secret I oppose Chair Jerome Powell's renomination, and I will vote against him,"" Warren said in a statement Monday. ""I will support the President's nomination of Lael Brainard as Vice Chair. Powell's failures on regulation, climate, and ethics make the still-vacant position of Vice Chair of Supervision critically important. This position must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement - and it needs to be done quickly.""Former Minneapolis Fed president Kocherlakota agrees that in recent years the Fed has undone a lot of the protections put in place to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. ""I feel strongly that we need a correction on that course,"" Kocherlakota said.Brainard has been much tougher on Wall Street, voting against some of the deregulatory steps the Fed has taken in recent years. Yet Biden ultimately decided against nominating Brainard to fill the open vice chair for supervision role, which would have put her in charge of overseeing Wall Street.But some key Democratic constituencies, such as organized labor, have signaled their support for him. Powell won Senate confirmation overwhelmingly for the position in 2018. Some progressives have also accused Powell of failing to do enough to address the climate crisis.Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said in a statement that he's ""disappointed"" in Biden's choice to keep Powell in charge of the Fed. ""I sincerely hope that, if confirmed, Powell will reassess his past opposition to utilizing the Fed's regulatory tools to minimize climate-related risks to the financial sector.""Trading scandalThe chair's renomination comes at a time of tumult on the Board of Governors and a trading scandal that had threatened to block Powell from being picked for a second term. The Fed recently unveiled sweeping changes to its ethics practices in response to the scandal about personal stock trading by then-regional Fed Presidents Robert Kaplan and Eric Rosengren, who led the Dallas and Boston Feds, respectively. Both Kaplan and Rosengren announced early retirements amid criticism about their trades. Powell, a Republican, was nominated to the Fed's Board of Governors by then-President Barack Obama. He was elevated to chair by then-President Donald Trump in November 2017 to succeed Janet Yellen, who is now Biden's treasury secretary. His term as a member of the Board of Governors doesn't expire until January 2028. He has been leading a widespread emergency market rescue in response to the economic crisis that followed the coronavirus pandemic. Though the US has made considerable gains -- its economy beat expectations and added 531,000 jobs in October -- there are still millions of people sitting on the sidelines of a tight labor market.

55," (CNN)President Joe Biden has offered multiple responses to spiking inflation: investigating gas prices, smoothing supply chains, touting benefit programs. None offers Americans much immediate relief.At the same time, Biden has resisted one step that would: Lifting tariffs on Chinese imports would save the average household hundreds of dollars a year. Just as tempting, it would reverse the failed trade war policy of his discredited predecessor, Donald Trump.But strategic and political considerations outweigh the allure. Whatever the benefit to rattled consumers, the implications at home and abroad for America's diciest international relationship raise the stakes higher than that.""The reason to do this or not to do this should not be inflation,"" said Richard Haass, a top State Department aide under President George W. Bush who now heads the Council on Foreign Relations. ""The impact on US-China relations, and the domestic politics of US-China relations, would be larger than any impact on inflation.""Those powerful crosscurrents swirled last week when Biden met virtually with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Before the meeting, an array of business groups issued a public letter seeking relief from China tariffs that they said cost American importers $110 billion and the average American household $1,300 in 2020.""These costs, compounded by other inflationary pressure, impose a significant burden on American businesses, farmers, families trying to recover from the effects of the pandemic,"" wrote the business groups, which ranged from the American Soybean Association to the Information Technology Industry Council.But White House officials said tariffs were not on the US agenda. After Biden and Xi talked for more than three hours, and with the White House battered politically by the highest inflation in decades, no policy shift was announced.Taking office after the violent, Trump-incited January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Biden has framed his presidency as an opportunity for the US to prove that democracies can out-compete authoritarian regimes such as China in the 21st century. On issues from human rights to Taiwan to the coronavirus, interactions between the world's two most powerful nations have grown so pointed that Biden cast the summit as an attempt to ensure that competition ""does not veer into conflict.""Yet he still faces Republican accusations of weakness on China policy, a staple of Trump's 2020 campaign. Though Haass called those attacks ""absurd,"" lifting tariffs unilaterally would only encourage Republicans to amplify them.Trump placed tariffs at the center of his ""America First"" political message, which tapped the grievances of blue-collar workers who blame global trade expansion for destroying American manufacturing jobs and diminishing their standard of living. The American Action Forum, which advocates the views of market-oriented Republicans, has estimated that Trump tariffs and corresponding retaliation by trading partners currently hit more than $400 billion in imports and exports.And the tariffs did not achieve Trump's objective of reviving American manufacturing. In 2019, before the pandemic turned the economy upside down, the Federal Reserve said the manufacturing sector had actually slipped into recession.But Biden has eased tariffs only on European steel and aluminum so far. The more consequential China levies, on imported consumer goods and intermediate goods that businesses use to make finished products, remain in place.Trade experts credit Trump with taking a tougher line after years in which China had thwarted global rules by stealing intellectual property, subsidizing domestic industries and restricting imports to the detriment of American business and workers alike. He succeeded in prodding Beijing to loosen curbs on American agricultural imports and the activities of American financial firms in China.Yet the modest effect of Trump's policy on Chinese exporters failed to leverage the fundamental economic reforms he had sought.  ""It really hasn't done much to the Chinese,"" noted Scott Lincicome, an analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.""By and large, these tariffs are falling almost 100% on American consumers,"" added Jennifer Hillman, a former trade official under President Bill Clinton who now teaches law at Georgetown University. ""The only question for Biden is: Can you get something for removing these tariffs?""In a speech last month, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said only that ""we will start a targeted tariff exclusion process"" that could lift selected levies in a process that ""optimally serves our economic interests."" But she noted that China has failed to fulfill past promises to purchase US goods and maintains ""unfair policies"" that subsidize domestic production of steel, semiconductors and solar power products at America's expense.""I am committed to working through the many challenges ahead in this bilateral process in order to deliver meaningful results,"" Tai pledged at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""But above all else, we must defend -- to the hilt - our economic interests.""That doesn't mean Biden can't find a politically acceptable path to the price-cutting benefits of lifting more Trump tariffs in the coming months. But doing so will require deft negotiations for concessions from America's most formidable competitor.   ""Like sanctions or war, (tariffs) are easier to initiate than they are to remove,"" Haass concluded. ""That's why God invented diplomats.""",2
56,"New York (CNN)Michael Cohen is a free man.On Monday morning Donald Trump's former personal attorney and self-described fixer was officially released from his three-year prison sentence -- the past year-plus of it served from his posh Park Avenue apartment.Speaking outside of the federal courthouse in New York, Cohen said he received three years supervised release and planned to continue to work with law enforcement to ""ensure that others are held responsible for their dirty deeds and that no one is ever believed to be above the law.""""My release today in no way negates the actions I took at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump,"" Cohen said. ""But it also does not negate the behavior of the Justice Department, Bill Barr, the Southern District of New York Prosecutors, Judge William H. Pauley the third, or Donald himself, in my initial incarceration and prosecution.""He added he will continue to cooperate. ""I will continue to provide information testimony documents and my full cooperation on all ongoing investigations to ensure that others are held responsible for their dirty deeds and that no one is ever believed to be above the law,"" Cohen said.Cohen had been counting down the days, literally, on his Twitter feed with a chalk board and dwindling numbers.""Three and FREE! Come Monday morning, I head to 500 Pearl Street, sign my release papers and then we celebrate together on @instagram,"" he tweeted Thursday to his 500,000-plus followers.Cohen's release after pleading guilty to nine federal crimes marks a rebirth for a man who once berated and bullied anyone he perceived as critical of Trump.He remained loyal during the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, staying true to the idea that he would take a bullet for Trump. But that all changed after the April 2018 FBI raid on his home, office and hotel room at the Regency in New York.Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal crimes including tax fraud, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations for helping pay off two women who threatened to go public with past alleged affairs with Trump just before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the affairs.During his guilty plea in a courtroom in lower Manhattan, Cohen pointed the finger directly at Trump, solidifying their split, saying he facilitated the payoffs ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. He then pleaded guilty a second time, several months later, for lying to House committees investigating interference in the election, which he also said he did at the direction of Trump.Cohen sought to remake his image as a new man, one who had finally broken free from the spell Trump held over him. Setting a course to exact his rebirth and revenge, he testified before Congress, alleging Trump and the Trump Organization manipulated the value of his assets to get better loans and insurance and to minimize their taxes. In the wake of his testimony, civil and criminal investigations were launched in Manhattan. Cohen has met with New York district attorney prosecutors multiple times. In July, the Trump Organization was indicted on state charges alleging a 15-year tax fraud scheme. Trump Organization has pleaded not guilty and the investigation is continuing.Cohen, who always courted the media, was met by a throng of reporters ahead of reporting to serve his sentence at the Otisville prison camp, which had been named one of ""America's 10 cushiest prisons."" In a parting shot, he promised Trump that he would not stay silent.At Otisville, Cohen worked on the prison's heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and built a rapport with fellow inmates, including Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino of MTV's ""Jersey Shore.""After several attempts, Cohen was released from prison in May 2020 due to the pandemic only to have that reversed when Cohen reported to the courthouse to finalize his transition to home confinement. When he objected to many of the conditions, he was taken into custody.Cohen sued, alleging the Justice Department, under attorney general Barr, had retaliated against him because he was planning to write a tell-all book about Trump. A federal judge agreed and Cohen was released to home confinement in July 2020.Since then, Cohen has released his book, launched a podcast and frequently appears on cable TV from his apartment to bash the former president. As he plots his next moves the tabloids will likely follow suit. Twice last month, the New York Post's Page Six spotted him having coffee with Kanye West at the Regency Hotel. Cohen did not elaborate on his conversations with West during an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota Monday afternoon, only offering that ""a lot of it is business related.""This story has been updated with additional information Monday.",2
57," (CNN)Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed at least a dozen women, ""was not fully transparent"" about the number of nursing home residents who died as a result of Covid-19 and, in new independent findings, used taxpayer resources to help write and promote his 2020 book on leadership during early weeks of the pandemic, according to an investigation released Monday by the New York State Assembly.The report was commissioned in March to dig into a series of claims against Cuomo and might have been the basis for the former governor's impeachment had he not resigned in August, following a separate probe that also found Cuomo had sexually harassed multiple women.""We conclude that there is overwhelming evidence that the former Governor engaged in sexual harassment,"" the assembly report, which was conducted by attorneys from Davis Polk & Wardwell, states in its executive summary. The 45-page report largely mirrors the findings of state Attorney General Letitia James' investigation into the sexual harassment accusations against the former governor.Cuomo has denied the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, said he did not intentionally misstate the nursing home death count and insisted the deal for, writing, and promotion of the book adhered to ethical standards.Rita Glavin, Cuomo's lawyer, criticized investigators for not providing the former governor with a ""meaningful ability to respond"" to the allegations against him and again sought to cast doubt on James' report.""The Assembly's report simply parrots the Attorney General's flawed report, failing to engage with the many errors and omissions in the AG's report and her one-sided, biased investigation,"" Glavin said.The newly released investigation widens the scope of alleged wrongdoing against Cuomo, who spent a decade running the state and ruling over its Democratic Party, and was widely applauded for his initial handling of the first Covid-19 surge in New York. But the spell was broken early this year as evidence emerged that he and his top aides undercounted deaths in nursing homes. At the same time, Cuomo became the subject of a barrage of sexual harassment allegations, which have now been found credible in two high-profile reports.""The former governor's conduct -- as shown in this report -- is extremely disturbing and is indicative of someone who is not fit for office,"" Assembly Judiciary Chairman Charles Lavine said in a statement. ""I hope this report helps New Yorkers further understand the seriousness of the allegations that have been made and serves to guide us to a more ethical and responsible government.""The assembly report marks the first public and official accounting of Cuomo's alleged misuse of state resources in connection with a $5 million book deal he agreed to in 2020 for what became ""American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic."" According to investigators, senior state officials were involved in almost every facet of the book's development, from ""meetings with agents and publishers,"" to transcriptions, writing, and other efforts to coordinate its completion, publication and promotion.""This work was done as part of the regular course of work in the Executive Chamber, including during normal work hours,"" the report states. ""One senior state official explained that Book-related assignments were given by superiors and expected to be completed, and the work was not voluntary.""One senior official sent or received over 1,000 emails regarding the book, from July to December 2020, and junior staffers described their work on the project as ""not voluntary,"" the report says.  In a statement, Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi dismissed as ""hype"" the new details about Cuomo's use of state resources on the book.""To be clear, the people who volunteered to work on the book were people mentioned in the book and therefore they were involved to make sure the representations concerning them were accurate,"" Azzopardi said. ""Staff who volunteered took time off, evidencing that they were volunteering and not on state time.""Cuomo also played a role in obscuring the total number of Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents, investigators concluded in the report.  ""The evidence obtained in our investigation demonstrates that former Governor Cuomo directed officials from the Executive Chamber, Task Force and DOH to prepare a report from DOH in order to combat criticism of the March 25 Directive,"" investigators wrote, referencing an order by the New York Department of Health mandating that nursing homes not deny admission or re-admission to people ""solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.""The Department of Health report, investigators write, ""was initiated by the then-Governor and influenced by members of the Executive Chamber and Task Force, then released under the auspices of DOH."" Cuomo ""reviewed and edited the draft DOH Report on multiple occasions,"" they added, in an attempt to ""strengthen the defense of the March 25 Directive.""The controversial order was reversed six weeks after it was initially given. Cuomo and a senior executive chamber official met with publishing representatives about his book on the same day the Department of Health report was released, investigators noted.Though few lawmakers have spoken publicly about the report, Phil Steck, a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN last week that its findings suggested a connection between the release of misleading statistics about the number of New Yorkers who died in nursing homes and Cuomo's book deal.""I think you can certainly infer the political motive,"" Steck said. ""In the governor's book, there's a chapter on the nursing home, so they were trying to preserve the validity of their claims in the book by distorting the facts regarding nursing home deaths.""Additionally, Steck indicated that his reading of the assembly report ""strongly corroborated"" the conclusions from James' investigation into the numerous accusations of sexual harassment by Cuomo.  Cuomo referred that probe to James, but almost immediately thereafter began efforts to publicly undermine her and the attorneys she hired to conduct the investigation. More recently, Cuomo and his team have accused James of submitting a biased report in an effort to boost her own gubernatorial bid.",2

Biden -- who has been briefed multiple times on the incident and is closely monitoring the response -- said he and his family are praying for the community.""Last night, the people of Waukesha were gathered to celebrate the start of a season of hope, togetherness and thanksgiving,"" Biden said at the White House. ""This morning, Jill and I -- and the entire Biden family and I'm sure all of us -- pray that that same spirit is going to embrace and lift up all the victims of this tragedy, bringing comfort to those recovering from the injuries and wrapping the families of those that die in the support of their community.""The city's live stream of the parade showed a marching band had just started playing ""Jingle Bells"" when a red SUV barreled into the parade from behind. At least 18 children were hospitalized after the incident, said Children's Wisconsin, a pediatric hospital in nearby Milwaukee. There are indications the driver was fleeing another incident when he drove into the parade route, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with preliminary investigation findings.So far, there is no known connection to international or domestic terrorism, and it does not appear to be connected to the recent verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the sources said.Authorities have not released any details of the five people killed, but the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said some members of the group were among the victims.Biden thanked first responders for their ""extraordinary work"" and the ""emergency room doctors who are working around the clock to deal with the terrible consequences of what happened last night.""""While we don't have all the facts and details yet, we know this morning that five families in Waukesha are facing fresh grief of a life without a loved one,"" Biden said at the start of an event announcing that he has picked Jerome Powell for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.

60," (CNN)The White House on Monday announced that 95% of the federal workforce is in compliance with the Biden administration's vaccine mandate.""Ahead of tonight's deadline, the federal government has achieved 95% compliance, and 90% of the 3.5 million federal workers are already vaccinated,"" White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said during a press briefing, confirming previous CNN reporting. ""We are successfully implementing vaccination requirements for the largest work force in the United States with federal employees in every part of the nation and around the world.""CNN reported earlier Monday that over 90% of workers have received at least one shot and the other 5% have submitted exemption applications that were already approved or are pending, according to a senior administration official. More than 90% of those employees have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with the ""vast majority"" of that figure having received two shots, the official said.The announcement comes as the vaccine mandate for federal workers is set to go into effect by the end of Monday. Reuters was first to report on the vaccination rate.""The goal of vaccination requirements is to protect workers, not to punish them, so tonight's deadline is not an end point or a cliff,"" Zients said on Monday. ""We continue to see more and more federal employees getting their shot. And for the small percentage of employees who have not yet complied, agencies are beginning the education and counseling process.""Ninty-eight percent of employees at the Internal Revenue Service have complied with the rules, with around 25% of those employees getting their shots after the mandate was announced, Zients said. At the FBI, 99% of employees have had their shots, 98% of Customs and Border Protection employees are vaccinated, and 99% of employees at the Federal Aviation Administration are complying with the rules. Ninty-three percent of Transportation Security Administration employees have gotten their shots ahead of the holiday travel season.One source familiar with the data told CNN earlier Monday that the compliance figures have exceeded the administration's expectations.With more compliance submissions expected to come on Monday, federal departments and agencies will further process and review information and documentation regarding vaccinations in the coming days, the official said, and agencies will provide an ""education and counseling process"" for those who have not complied or those who do not have a ""pending or approved exception or (extension request)."" Additional enforcement steps could be taken over time if needed.The Office of Management and Budget will release a summary chart of agency data regarding compliance on Wednesday morning, the official said.Earlier this year, Biden imposed stringent new vaccine rules on federal workers, large employers and health care staff in an attempt to contain the latest surge of Covid-19, particularly after the emergency of the highly transmissible Delta variant. Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. Eighty-four million workers would be covered by the rules, which are scheduled to fully take effect on January 4.Immediately after being announced, the mandate came under challenge from Republican-led states and some private employers, who say the administration overstepped its authority in issuing such a rule. A federal appeals court put the mandate on hold. It is now before the conservative-leaning Ohio-based 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which could soon decide its fate.But many employers continue to implement vaccine mandates, regardless of whether the courts uphold or strike down Biden's requirements. Court decisions against mandates apply only to the government's rules, not to individual companies that have instituted their own vaccine requirements.Biden has also signed an executive order requiring all government employees be vaccinated against Covid-19, with no option of being regularly tested to opt out. The President signed an accompanying order directing the same standard be applied to employees of contractors who do business with the federal government.This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.",2
61," (CNN)President Joe Biden hopes to announce his decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Tuesday during a speech at the White House, officials tell CNN, but the timing of such a move is still contingent on other nations finalizing their agreements. The United States has asked China, India, Japan and South Korea to join in a coordinated effort to release reserves of crude oil. The Biden administration hopes such a move would help combat soaring gasoline prices and fears of inflation -- or at least show the President is focusing on addressing what has become one of his steepest political challenges.If successful, such an agreement could help keep a lid on gasoline prices heading into the holiday travel season and relieve some of the political pressure, at least in the short term, that the White House has been feeling over the energy crunch, which officials believe is directly linked to inflation. Two officials say a final US decision hasn't been made -- simply because it is intended to be coordinated with other nations in what would be a unique effort -- but they hope it will be finalized by late Monday evening. When asked about a possible decision, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she didn't want to ""get ahead of any process.""""I don't have anything to preview for you on this,"" Psaki said. ""But I will say that of course, we're going to continue regardless to press OPEC to ensure that the supply out there meets the demand.""The President is scheduled to deliver remarks Tuesday afternoon ""on the economy and lowering prices for the American people,"" according to the White House schedule, just hours before he is set to leave for a Thanksgiving break on Nantucket off the coast of Massachusetts. In recent weeks, Biden had been privately advised that tapping into the reserve wouldn't do much to alleviate the current problems, though some Democratic lawmakers argued it could provide temporary relief at the pump. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has been among the Democrats leading the charge.But the option remained on the table, given Biden had few others, as officials believed coordinating with other countries could potentially have more of an impact. One step he took last week was to ask the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether illegal activity by oil and gas companies is contributing to higher gasoline prices. The top oil industry group, the American Petroleum Institute, slammed the move as a ""distraction"" from Biden's own policies they believe are exacerbating the crisis. The administration has been facing reluctance from OPEC+ to ramp up oil production to meet rising demand. Coordinating with the other nations would be an attempt to undermine the cartel's control of the market.""The thinking has been, we can do this alone, or we can do it internationally—and the latter would be much more effective, especially when it comes to sending a message to the Saudis,"" said one senior official involved in the discussions. Biden and his aides have been pushing Beijing, in particular, to release its reserves, arguing that it is in their interests as much as the United States' to try to stabilize oil prices, officials familiar with the matter said. China has signaled in recent days that it is moving toward such a release, which one Biden official characterized as a ""major victory"" for the administration.  ""China is in a tough spot,"" said Bob McNally, president of the energy consulting firm Rapidan Energy. ""It's a balancing act. China sees its future as linked to the Persian Gulf. They want investment. They want ties. They don't want to piss off the authorities there. But they also want to make Biden happy. The real threat to Xi Jinping's hold on power would come from an economic collapse from an escalation in tensions with the United States."" A coordinated release would also show Saudi Arabia and OPEC that the US was serious when it warned that it would act if OPEC didn't, the officials said. Biden officials have warned the Saudis for weeks that the US would find alternative solutions if the price of crude oil topped $85 a barrel, officials said, which it did late last month. But Saudi Arabia has stood firm in refusing to increase output and has priced in -- wrongly, in the view of US officials -- the possibility that the US reaches a nuclear deal with Iran, two US officials said. The Saudis' concern is that sanctions on Iran would then be rolled back, allowing the country to ramp up its oil production and compete with OPEC+.The political ramifications of the high costs spurred the White House to make the energy issue a top priority in recent weeks, sources said. The soaring costs of gasoline across the country so alarmed White House chief of staff Ron Klain at one point that he suggested taking the dramatic step of halting US oil exports to drive costs down, one official said. That's despite the fact that Wall Street banks and industry experts have warned that banning oil exports would backfire, causing gasoline prices to go higher, not lower.But the White House has viewed the energy crisis as a national security issue as much as an economic and political issue, as reflected in the makeup of the group that has been working on it extensively in recent weeks. A small group of top Biden advisers, led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, have been meeting regularly to try to determine how best to combat the rising prices. Sullivan and his deputy, Jon Finer, have been overseeing the meetings with Deese, senior energy adviser Amos Hochstein and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and her deputy, David Turk.Senior National Security Council officials Brett McGurk and Kurt Campbell have also played key supporting roles, engaging their counterparts in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific to try to encourage more cooperation with the US on the issue, officials said. Domestic oil producers have signaled to Biden that they would be willing to ramp up production if asked. But the White House has been wary of the optics of the President and his aides pushing for more domestic oil production on the heels of the major UN climate summit COP26, where Biden promised that the US would ""lead by example"" on clean energy initiatives. Administration officials now believe that, at least in the short term, they could secure a significant arrangement with China, Japan, India and South Korea that won't require halting US exports or asking domestic oil producers to boost supply. Still, releasing barrels from emergency reserves is not a long-term solution because it doesn't solve the underlying supply-demand mismatch, experts say. Emergency reserves hold a finite amount of oil -- and those barrels are typically reserved for supply shocks like natural disasters or wars, not surging demand from an economic recovery.Goldman Sachs told clients late last week that a coordinated release would only ""provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit"" in the oil market. And the Wall Street bank argued a coordinated release is now ""fully priced in,"" meaning the market impact has already occurred.But even the threat of tapping the SPR, and having other countries do the same, has already successfully helped to lower oil prices, administration officials said.

62," (CNN)More than a dozen families for the victims of the Parkland, Florida, high school massacre have reached a settlement with the Justice Department in connection with a lawsuit they filed after the FBI failed to act on tips warning about the shooter, according to a court filing on Monday. After three years of litigation, ""the parties hereby advise the Court that they have reached an agreement to settle all of the claims at issue,"" according to the joint notice of agreement to settle the federal lawsuit filed on Monday. The Justice Department will pay $127.5 million to the families, according to a source familiar with the case. On Valentine's Day 2018, Nikolas Cruz entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and murdered 17 students and faculty members and injured 17 others. According to the lawsuit, the FBI received tips about Cruz's violent behavior, mental instability, and a large purchase of firearms, yet failed to intervene. Cruz pleaded guilty to the shooting in October and faces the death penalty in an upcoming sentencing hearing. Kristina Infante, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that while the financial details are currently confidential, it is an ""historic"" settlement and ""the culmination of the Parkland families' long and arduous efforts toward truth and accountability.""""It has been an honor to represent the Parkland families who, through their immeasurable grief, have devoted themselves to making the world a safer place,"" Infante said. ""Although no resolution could ever restore what the Parkland families lost, this settlement marks an important step toward justice.""The Justice Department declined to comment beyond the filing.In a motion filed in October, the Justice Department said that the families' ""causation theory is based on pure speculation that special agents in the Miami Field Office would have been able to prevent Cruz from committing his heinous act. Not only is such a theory speculative, but it necessarily relies on an impermissible stacking of inferences regarding how an investigation would have led to the prevention of the crime.""In a separate lawsuit, more than two dozen survivors of the massacre and families of the victims reached a $25 million settlement in October against the Broward County School Board. The agreement will not include any admission of wrongdoing by the school board, David Brill, an attorney in that lawsuit, told CNN.This story has been updated with additional reporting Monday.",2
63," (CNN)A federal judge said this weekend that she would not block the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for health care workers while a Florida lawsuit challenging the mandate moves forward.In her decision declining Florida's request for preliminary order blocking the health care worker mandate, US District Judge Casey Rodgers said that Florida had not shown ""that irreparable injury will occur "" if the court did not block the mandate before it starts to take effect next month.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has been a prominent opponent of President Joe Biden's efforts to mandate vaccines. The state is involved in other lawsuits challenging the Biden administration's mandate for federal contractors, as well as the vaccine rules issued by Occupational Safety and Health Administration. At DeSantis' urging, Florida's GOP-controlled legislature also passed last week bills that would impose fines on companies that require vaccines as a condition of employment.""The affidavits in support of the motion include assertions of how the various agencies and institutions anticipate they may be adversely impacted by the mandate,"" the judge, a George W. Bush-appointee, wrote in an order issued Saturday. ""In particular, the affidavits express opinions of agency heads who 'estimate' that they 'may' lose a certain percentage or a number of employees, or speculate as to the consequences they will suffer 'if widespread resignations were to occur,'"" Rodgers wrote. ""However, such opinions, absent supporting factual evidence, remain speculative and may be disregarded as conclusory.""The Biden administration health care worker policy, which is being implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services, requires that health care workers at certain providers that participate in Medicaid and Medicare be vaccinated against Covid-19, with the deadline for the first shot set for December 6. Florida filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of Florida challenging the policy earlier this month and had asked the court to block the HHS rule while the lawsuit proceeded. In its filings, the state claimed that Florida health care facilities were at risk for either losing federal funding or see staffing shortfalls due to employees' refusal to get vaccinated.In at least two other cases brought by other states, courts are considering whether to issue preliminary orders blocking the mandate.",2
64,"Washington (CNN)Cases are going up. Hospitalizations are too. Depending on where you live, mask mandates are either being dropped or enacted. Vaccines are more available than ever, but hesitancy remains a real problem. Experimental drugs are showing promise as well, yet regulatory approval takes time. It's a confusing time in the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike the overwhelming anxiety that defined the spring of 2020 or the hope that came with the start of the US' vaccination campaign late last year, fall 2021 has been more muddled: Some Americans are back at work or in the classroom, while other office returns were postponed to the new year. Underlying it all has been questions about boosters -- who should get one and when? But Friday went a long way toward providing some clarity: The booster era of the pandemic is here. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky endorsed the use of Covid-19 vaccine boosters Friday for all adults.Walensky made her recommendation just hours after CDC vaccine advisers voted unanimously to recommend booster doses of Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's Covid-19 vaccines for all US adults six months after they finish their first two doses. The US Food and Drug Administration authorized boosters for everyone 18 and older earlier Friday.""Just go out and get boosted,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We know they're safe and we know they're highly effective in bringing very, very high up the optimization of your protection. So just go ahead and get boosted. Now's the time to do it as we get into the holiday season.""It's all about simplicity. Chances are, if you're reading this, you're eligible for a booster shot. Previously, boosters had been authorized for anyone 65 and older who was vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines at least six months ago and for certain adults at high risk of infection or of severe disease.Friday's vote streamlined this, making clear every adult should or may get a booster six months after finishing the first two doses.What drove the decision? Data! Recent real-world studies suggested that immunity from Covid-19 vaccines begins to wane and protection against milder and asymptomatic disease, in particular, may drop. Studies have shown that booster doses restore that immunity.Members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices heard safety data from the CDC, from Pfizer and from Moderna that showed the boosters have not caused worrying adverse events. The most common reactions are pain at the injection site, headache and fatigue.Did we wait too long? With cases already on the rise and colder months ahead, news of the booster approval was welcomed by public health experts who still made clear it could've come sooner. A sample:""I've said since January that Pfizer/Moderna are 3 dose vaccines,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, tweeted. ""This took way too long,"" CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner tweeted.""Our rules about boosters are far too complicated. The winter is coming. Every adult (6 months out) should go get that third shot,"" Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, said before approval came on Friday. Three shots and done? It's too soon to say. Some context from CNN's Maggie Fox: It's possible that as with vaccines like the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, once the initial few doses are out of the way, people can count on being immune for life.Doctors hope that boosting six months after the initial dose will provide much longer-lasting immunity than giving two quick doses a few weeks apart -- even as they agree that was 100% the right approach for a new vaccine being used at the start of a pandemic.It's also too soon to know whether immunity might wane after months or years. And it's too soon to know if a new variant might emerge and spread that evades the protection offered by a vaccine and, as with flu vaccines every year, the formula may have to be tweaked protect against the changed virus.""We're going to take a look right now at what the durability is of the booster. We're going to follow people who get boosted,"" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Bash Sunday. ""It will be guided by the science -- and people should not be put off by the fact that as time goes by and we learn more and more about the protection that we might modify the guidelines.""What comes next? If we are actually living through what will be looked back on as the ""booster era"" of the pandemic, it's natural to wonder what might be next. At the moment, pills from both Pfizer and Merck are making a strong case for being the next big thing, and Biden administration officials are bullish about antivirals playing a big role in reining in deaths from the pandemic.Pfizer says its pill, which it proposes to sell under the brand name Paxlovid if it gets authorized, reduced the risk of death or hospitalization by 89% in people who got it within three days of symptoms starting, according to its interim analysis. Merck says its capsule, molnupiravir, reduced the risk by about 50%.""I see them as a one-two punch. Vaccines are prevention. These antivirals are early treatment. Both have utility,"" Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told CNN this month. ""Neither one is a substitute for the other.""Traveling this week?You're not alone! The number of people flying for Thanksgiving will ""without a doubt"" break pandemic-era air travel records, TSA Administrator David Pekoske told CNN. ""The pandemic record right now stands at about 2.2 million people (on a single day) and I would expect that we will definitely exceed that,"" Pekoske said. Already, the TSA has announced it screened more than 2.2 million people on Friday.If that sounds overwhelming, the CNN Travel team put together a few ways to travel safely.Try to fly off-hours and on less busy days. If you can travel to and from your destination on less busy travel days, you and your family will encounter fewer people and may be more successful at social distancing, said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, who is a leading expert in aerosol transmission of viruses.Book window seats. Experts suggest booking window seats for children (or adults) who are not vaccinated, partly due to the air vents along the inside panels of most planes. ""We think that the seat with the lowest risk is the window seat, as air circulation patterns may be better for the window seat,"" Marr said.Wear well-fitting, high quality filtration masks. Invest in a high quality mask for travel, one that will trap around 95% of virus-size particles when fitted to the face properly, experts say. Fit is critical, Marr said, as is comfort. Look for a mask that fits each unique face and is comfortable enough that you or your child can wear it for hours.Stay in your seat if you can. Getting up and moving around puts you closer to others on the plane, who may or may not be vaccinated or following mask guidance. While the risk of Covid-19 from such exposures may be small, there are other concerns.",2
65," (CNN)A federal judge took aim at former President Donald Trump on Monday for lying about voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election, saying that former Vice President Al Gore had a better standing to challenge the 2000 election results but that he was ""a man"" and walked away.""Al Gore had a better case to argue than Mr. Trump, but he was a man about what happened to him,"" Senior District Judge Reggie Walton said of Gore's decision to end his presidential bid following weeks of legal battles. ""He accepted it and walked away.""The comments from Walton came during a plea hearing for Capitol riot defendant Adam Johnson, who was photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern through the Capitol building. He pleaded guilty on Monday to a low-level charge of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds.""What concerns me, sir, is that you were gullible enough to come to Washington, DC, from Florida based on a lie,"" Walton said, ""and the person who inspired you to do what you do is still making those statements, and my concern is that you are gullible enough to do it again.""Walton, who was appointed by the man who defeated Gore, former President George W. Bush, is the most recent to add his voice to a chorus of judges criticizing Trump for lying to his supporters. Last week, a federal judge also suggested Trump had some responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and called the rioters ""pawns"" who were provoked into action. Johnson, 36, told Walton that he accepted responsibility for getting ""caught up in the moment,"" and said that a ""hard couple of years"" led him to spend a lot of time ""listening to a lot of information and reading things"" online.Investigators identified Johnson days after he was photographed smiling and waving as he carried the lectern through the Capitol building on January 6. According to prosecutors, Johnson started running to the Capitol building from the ""Stop the Steal"" rally at the Ellipse after someone in the crowd shouted ""Pence didn't do it!"" Johnson admitted that he brought a knife with him to Washington, but discarded it in the bushes on his way to the Capitol.Once inside the building Johnson wandered around until he came across Pelosi's office suite. He jiggled a door handle, prosecutors say, but it was locked. He then grabbed the lectern and carried it to the Capitol rotunda, posing for several pictures along the way. After he had discarded of the lectern, Johnson joined a crowd attempting to breach the House chamber. At one point, according to the plea agreement, Johnson said that a nearby bust of George Washington would be a ""great battering ram"" to get through the doors to the chamber. During the hearing, Johnson revealed that he may write a book about his involvement in the riot. He agreed that the government can seize any money he makes publicizing the event for the next five years as part of his plea deal.Johnson was originally charged with three federal crimes including theft of government property, but those charges will be dropped as part of his plea deal. He could face a sentence of up to six months in prison, according to his agreement with prosecutors read at his plea hearing on Monday. He will also pay $500 in restitution for damage done to the Capitol during the riot.More than 130 defendants have pleaded guilty so far to charges connected to the Capitol riot, with most to date admitting to misdemeanor charges.Man who organized bus travel sentenced to 60 days in jailFrank Scavo, who told local news outlets and the FBI he organized several buses to bring people from eastern Pennsylvania to Washington for the January 6 rally, was sentenced to 60 days in jail on Monday and received the maximum fine of $5,000.The sentence, handed down by Senior DC District Judge Royce Lamberth, was much heavier than the 14 days of incarceration that the Justice Department had asked for. Scavo pleaded guilty to illegally demonstrating in the Capitol, a misdemeanor offense, in September.Before issuing the sentence, Lamberth told Scavo he gave him ""credit for the fact that you did not put anyone at risk"" or engaged in violence but said that ""without you and other people"" the attack on the Capitol ""would not have happened.""Scavo told the judge he had a ""deep sense of regret"" for his actions on January 6, adding later that ""it was a crime.""""From the point the jig was up, you've done everything you could,"" Lamberth told Scavo in a brief comment following the sentence. ""Good luck to you.""According to the Justice Department, Scavo had captured assaults on Capitol Police officers while filming on his phone and bragged about ""storm(ing)"" the Capitol. On his Facebook page that day, Scavo posted that ""PENCE IS OUT OF CAPITOL"" and ""No certification Today!!!""""He had more or less a front-row seat"" to the Capitol siege, Assistant US Attorney Seth Meinero said during the hearing, adding that Scavo saw the crowd push into the east front of the Capitol after the Trump rally.",2
66," (CNN)The Biden administration is weighing sending military advisers and new equipment including weaponry to Ukraine as Russia builds up forces near the border and US officials prepare allies for the possibility of another Russian invasion, multiple sources familiar with the deliberations tell CNN.  The discussions about the proposed lethal aid package are happening as Ukraine has begun to warn publicly that an invasion could happen as soon as January. The package could include new Javelin anti-tank and anti-armor missiles as well as mortars, the sources said.  Air defense systems, such as stinger missiles, are also under consideration, and the Defense Department has been pressing for some equipment that would have gone to Afghanistan -- like Mi-17 helicopters -- to instead be sent to Ukraine. The Mi-17 is a Russian helicopter that the US originally purchased to give to the Afghans. The Pentagon is now weighing what to do with them after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August.  But others in the administration are concerned that sending stingers and helicopters could be seen by Russia as a major escalation. And while they are prepared to send some military advisers into the region, it is unclear whether any would go into Ukraine itself, the people said.  Retired Lt. Col. Cedric Leighton told CNN that Javelin antitank missiles ""are quite effective against the T-80 tanks which the Russians are actually employing in these efforts against Ukraine right now."" But he noted that any additional assistance to Ukraine undoubtedly risks ""further heightening tensions"" with Moscow.  Sanctions discussionsMeanwhile, US officials have been holding discussions with European allies about putting together a new sanctions package that would go into effect if Russia invaded Ukraine, the sources said. And lawmakers are also jockeying over new sanctions language to include in the National Defense Authorization Act.  Asked about the Russian military activity, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday that the administration is concerned and has ""had extensive interactions with our European allies and partners in recent weeks, including with Ukraine."" She added that the US has ""also had held discussions with Russian officials about Ukraine and US-Russian relations in general."" The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, also spoke by phone with the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny on Monday.The discussions reflect how seriously the Biden administration and Congress is taking the possibility that Russia could move to invade Ukraine, a strategic US ally, for the second time in under a decade. And US officials are determined not to be caught by surprise by a Russian military operation, as the Obama administration was in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea and powered an insurgency in parts of eastern Ukraine. ""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, pushed back on the US' warnings about a potential invasion, calling them ""absolutely false"" in a statement on Monday.  ""The US State Department through diplomatic channels brings to its allies and partners absolutely false information about the concentration of forces on the territory of our country for a military invasion of Ukraine,"" said Sergei Ivanov, head of the SVR's press bureau. For weeks, the US has been sharing intelligence with NATO partners and European allies on unusual Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border that US military and intelligence officials believe could be a precursor to a military operation on the country's eastern flank. The briefings have gone much further than in the past in terms of the level of alarm and specificity, US, European, and Ukrainian sources familiar with the discussions said.  Ukraine's tone has also changed significantly since being briefed by the US. At the beginning of the month, Ukrainian officials downplayed reports that Russia was massing forces near the border. Now, following extensive meetings between US and Ukrainian officials, Ukraine's defense intelligence chief Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov is publicly warning that Russia is building a capacity to attack as soon as January -- a timeline in line with the US' assessments. 'No smoking gun'Still, officials say Russia's ultimate plan remains unclear. ""There is no smoking gun or decisive indicator of Putin's intentions,"" said one defense official. And it is possible that the maneuvers are an effort to sow confusion or to coerce the west into making concessions, rather than a precursor to an invasion.   But the US is still warning of the possibility of the worst-case scenario that Moscow attempts regime change in Kiev, spurred largely by Putin's determination to keep Ukraine from growing closer to the West and potentially joining NATO.  ""You don't achieve that goal by carving out another chunk of the eastern Donetsk region,"" said one person familiar with the intelligence. ""It's got to be something more than that. If that's [Putin's] goal, then you don't do that by doing something small."" US officials have also shared with senior Ukrainian officials evidence that Russia, through the FSB -- Russia's successor to the KGB -- is engaging in destabilizing activities inside Ukraine to foment dissent against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration. They have also pointed to the presence of Spetsnaz special forces and GRU and SVR intelligence operatives near Ukraine's borders.  Ukrainian defense officials have projected that Russia could use the dozens of battalion tactical groups currently stationed near Ukraine's borders to launch an attack from multiple sides, including from annexed Crimea, according to Ukrainian military assessments provided to The Military Times.  US officials are closely watching the Russian activity in Crimea, where Russia sent troops and military units in the spring as part of what it claimed were exercises. Although Russia's defense ministry ordered at least some of the troops to withdraw in April, some elements remained, according to the Ukrainian assessments and sources familiar with the matter.  Moves in CongressDemocratic and Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have added proposed amendments to the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that would address Russia's latest provocations, but they have yet to sign off on a final version. An amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez, reviewed by CNN, says that ""substantial new sanctions should be imposed"" by President Joe Biden against senior Kremlin officials -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin -- in the event of a Russian military escalation against Ukraine. The amendment also calls for additional sanctions on the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, which Ukraine has been pushing for.  The committee's Republicans see the Nord Stream sanctions language as a positive step, sources said, but want the amendment to trigger sanctions automatically in the event of a Russian incursion rather than leave the determination in the hands of the administration.  Germany, which has been engaged in the pipeline project with Russia, recently announced that it is temporarily pausing the pipeline's certification process. But Ukraine also wants to see the US do more to stymie the pipeline, which it says Russia is weaponizing to weaken Ukraine by cutting it off from energy supplies and revenue heading into winter, an adviser to Zelensky told CNN.  ""While the Biden administration is warning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, its most senior officials are on Capitol Hill trying to protect Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline by lobbying against the inclusion of sanctions against it in the annual defense bill,"" the adviser said.

67," (CNN)Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath announced Monday that she would run for a new district in the Atlanta suburbs against fellow Democrat Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux after the Republican controlled-state legislature redrew McBath's district to make it a safely red seat.Georgia Republican legislators created a map that would drastically change the lines of the two competitive seats north of Atlanta held by the two Democrats. If Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signs it into law and the map survives potential challenges in court, it would essentially give the GOP a 9-5 advantage in the state, rather than the current 8-6 advantage.In a statement, McBath claimed that Republicans were trying ""to draw me out of Congress.""Following the 2012 murder of her son Jordan Davis, McBath quit her job as a Delta flight attendant to work as an activist with Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action. In 2018, McBath ran for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's old seat and beat Republican Rep. Karen Handel by a point and beat her again in a 2020 rematch by over nine points. ""It is no mystery why Republicans and the NRA have decided I'm their top target,"" McBath said. ""As a Black woman, activist, and mother on a mission—they would like nothing more than to stop me from speaking truth to power about the gun lobby and Republican Party in Congress.""In 2018, Bordeaux, a former Georgia State University professor, won a close Democratic primary before losing to Republican Rep. Rob Woodall by fewer than 500 votes. After Woodall retired, Bordeaux won her 2020 race against Republican Dr. Rich McCormick by about three points.Bordeaux said she has strong ties to the Gwinnett county-based district, and worked to ""expand Medicaid, lower healthcare costs, create universal pre-K and address our unique transit needs,"" while securing loans for small businesses.""Georgia's 7th district deserves a representative that understands their issues,"" Bordeaux said. ""I've run five elections here, and I have deep connections with the diverse communities in our district.""",2
68," (CNN)Three days after his acquittal in a polarizing case in Wisconsin, Kyle Rittenhouse is now a teenaged avatar for a nation divided over the nature of justice, the societal role of guns and violence in political discourse.The sight of Rittenhouse, 18, walking free on Friday after shooting dead two men and wounding another last year in unrest sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, also opened a fresh debate over state laws on self-defense and the concept of vigilantism. The case's political reverberations are already rocking a tense political environment ahead of 2022 elections and even the 2024 presidential race. Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, for instance, thaat the incident in the city of Kenosha shows Americans must not be allowed ""weapons designed for battlefield use."" Meanwhile, ex-President Donald Trump, who appears to be preparing another run for the White House, has been praising Rittenhouse, who inserted himself into a volatile situation, as the ""poster boy"" for the right to self-defense. The debate on Sunday talk shows and elsewhere about Rittenhouse came hours before an SUV plowed into a holiday parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, striking more than 20 people. Officials said multiple people were killed but gave no exact figures as relatives of those lost are notified. Police gave no details on the motives of the attack but said they had a person of interest in custody. After the tragedy, politicians from both sides of the aisle expressed condolences and offered prayers for the dead and first responders.The extreme politicization of the Rittenhouse case has only increased since he was found not guilty of first-degree intentional homicide and four other felony charges on Friday. The jury was bound to make its evaluation not on political considerations but on the narrower questions of Wisconsin's law and video evidence and testimony presented at trial. It appears to have accepted Rittenhouse's testimony that he fired after he felt that his own life was threatened during standoffs with two White men who died and one who was wounded and that he was acting in line with his right to self-defense. If the jury system is to survive, verdicts must be respected by those who disagree with them -- something President Joe Biden affirmed on Friday saying, ""I stand by what the jury has concluded."" That, however, has not stopped an explosion of political reactions since Rittenhouse walked free from court that look certain to become even more controversial as he is made into a hero by conservative media, with Fox News' Tucker Carlson securing exclusive access to him and members of his defense team during the trial for an upcoming documentary. Democratic politicians, including Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and members of Congress, have registered various levels of disappointment with the verdict, though some refrained from criticizing the jury outright. Others have been much more outspoken. New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called for a federal review of the verdict, tweeting: ""Justice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest."" Rittenhouse, however, did not cross state lines with the weapon, according to testimony in the trial. Gun control groups and civil rights activists have warned that the outcome of the case could trigger an outburst of vigilantism -- of Americans deciding to take their vision of justice into their own hands and to enforce their will with firearms in a way that could let loose anarchy and threaten the First Amendment right to protest. And some prominent African American leaders have questioned whether a Black defendant in Rittenhouse's shoes would have received similar treatment or would have lived to even have their day in court after a history of police shootings of Black men.Case provides immediate test for O'Rourke on guns The new campaign from O'Rourke, who came within three points of defeating GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, was always going to cause a new kerfuffle over gun control. In a Democratic debate in September 2019, the former congressman said, ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" calling for a government buy-back scheme for such weapons following a mass shooting in West Texas that killed seven people and wounded 22 others. ""Yes, I still hold this view,"" O'Rourke told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday, trying to turn the conversation to his claim that permit-less carry laws signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott would make the lives of the state's police officers more dangerous. O'Rourke's position draws him into a direct confrontation with the GOP incumbent, who has presided over a loosening of restrictions on firearms in an already heavily pro-gun state. The Rittenhouse verdict, however, effectively fast-tracked scrutiny of O'Rourke's position only a few days after he announced his run for the governor's mansion. ""This entire tragedy makes the case that we should not allow our fellow Americans to own and use weapons that were originally designed for battlefield use,"" he said. ""That AR-15, that AK-47 has one, single solitary purpose, and that is killing people as effectively, as efficiently, in as great a number, in as little time as possible. We saw that in Kenosha. We saw that in El Paso, Texas, where 23 people were murdered by someone with an AK-47 just in a matter of minutes. This is crazy.""Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who is increasingly criticizing Trump's election lies and could run for president in 2024, made a contrary case, choosing not to comment on the matter of guns but on what he views as the politicization of the case from the left. ""Justice was done ... and the jury system works,"" Christie said on Fox News Sunday. ""I think those people on the left are just attempting to continue to tear our country apart for political gain. Anybody who looked at the videos of this could tell that this was an act of self-defense. Anyone who knows the law would know that,"" Christie said. The former New Jersey governor said he hoped Rittenhouse would be able to go on and live his life and ""not become a political symbol for anybody."" Given Rittenhouse's cooperation with the behind-the-scenes Fox News documentary, even while the trial was going on, and the way he is being made a hero figure on the right, that possibility already seems to have disappeared only three days after his acquittal.",2
69,"Washington (CNN)New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Sunday criticized members of his party who are looking to retaliate against 13 GOP House members who voted to pass President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, saying they ""have their priorities screwed up."" ""When we talk about kicking people off of committees because they don't like one vote or the other -- again, I just think they have their priorities screwed up,"" Sununu told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" The comments from the Republican governor underscore the mixed views members of the party have on the infrastructure package, which was passed with Republican support in both the House and Senate, prompting some hard-liners to discuss booting their GOP colleagues from committee spots, even though the effort faces little chance of succeeding. Pressed by Bash on what the retaliation efforts say about his party, Sununu said: ""Again, I think it says that we have our priorities wrong. Republicans have had huge successes with cutting taxes, limiting government, creating opportunities in schools, supporting parents, making sure kids -- those are our wins, and those are American wins."" Sununu also weighed in on an intraparty fight being waged over the party's response to Rep. Paul Gosar after the Arizona Republican posted an edited anime video to social media that showed him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. ""When a congressman says those things and puts -- of course they have to be censured for that. Of course they have to be held to bear for that,"" he said, referring to House Democrats and two Republican House members voting last week to censure Gosar, a move that infuriated other GOP members. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer also called out Gosar on Sunday, telling NBC that the congressman sharing the anime video ""probably wasn't right."" But the North Dakota senator was less clear on where he stood on his party's handling of Gosar, saying he didn't know whether a majority of House Republicans declining to condemn their colleague is a bad look for the GOP. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the two Republicans who voted to censure Gosar, has been siding with Democrats more and more as her party grapples with its more extreme factions, an individualism Sununu appeared to support on Sunday. ""Do you think there's room for Liz Cheney in the Republican Party?"" Bash asked in part. ""Well, I think there's room for everybody in the Republican Party. I really do,"" Sununu replied. ""Whether you're independent or Democrat, we've got room for everybody to come on board."" He continued: ""It can't be about one particular issue.

70," (CNN)Sean Parnell, the Republican endorsed by former President Donald Trump for Pennsylvania's open US Senate seat, announced on Monday he is suspending his campaign. The decision comes after a judge awarded Laurie Snell, Parnell's estranged wife, primary physical custody and sole legal custody of the couple's three children, according to an order that was made public Monday. The judge also determined that Parnell committed some abusive acts toward his wife in the past.""There is nothing more important to me than my children, and while I plan to ask the court to reconsider, I can't continue with a Senate campaign,"" Parnell said in a statement.Parnell spoke with Trump on Monday to inform him of his plans, according to Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich. The former President had backed Parnell, an Army veteran and former congressional candidate, in September in the competitive Republican primary. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection, and Democrats see the seat as one of their top pickup opportunities heading into the 2022 midterms. But allegations against Parnell from his estranged wife had raised concerns among some Republicans about his viability as a candidate. Snell has accused Parnell of being physically abusive toward her and injuring their children on two occasions, claims that Parnell has denied.The judge wrote that he found Snell to be a credible witness when it came to her allegations of abuse -- although those allegations were not the most significant factors in the judge's custody decision.""I strongly disagree with the ruling today and I'm devastated by the decision. I plan on asking the court to reconsider this decision. In the order, two of the leading factors that weighed heavily in the judge's decision revolved around me being a leading U.S. Senate candidate,"" Parnell said in his statement. ""My focus right now is 100% on my children, and I want them to know I do not have any other priorities and will never stop fighting for them.""Parnell will still have partial physical custody of the children various weekends each month.""Ms. Snell is grateful that justice prevailed,"" according to a statement from the Gilliland Vanasdale Sinatra Law Office, which represented Snell. ""She has been awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of their children. She will continue, as always, to focus on their best interests."" 'A tumultuous relationship'   Court proceedings revealed a volatile relationship between Snell and Parnell, which ultimately hobbled Parnell's political aspirations.Snell has accused Parnell of throwing chairs at her; dropping her off on an interstate when she was six months pregnant and telling her to get an abortion; and choking and strangling her, according to court documents.""Upon consideration of the credible evidence, I find that Sean Parnell did commit some acts of abuse in the past,"" Judge James G. Arner wrote about the allegations of abuse regarding Snell. ""However, since the incidents involving Laurie Snell occurred so many years ago and did not involve the children, they are not relevant to this custody determination. I am not making a finding on specifically what did or did not happen.""As to the allegations that Parnell injured their children on two occasions, the judge concluded that the incidents occurred ""as described by Laurie Snell, but I am not placing weight on that evidence because a period of three and one half years has gone by without further incident.""The judge concluded that the incidents involving the children did not amount to child abuse and he noted that the children did not express concerns for their safety.""The fact that Laurie Snell has agreed that Sean Parnell can have substantial periods of unsupervised custody indicates she does not view him as a threat of harm to the children. The children have not expressed any concerns for their safety.""In evaluating the credibility of Snell and Parnell -- who often provided conflicting accounts in their custody trial testimony, particularly surrounding the abuse allegations -- the judge found Snell more credible.""She testified in a convincing manner. Her testimony was not uncertain, confused, self-contradictory, or evasive. Her testimony squares with Sean Parnell's testimony that they had a tumultuous relationship and fought a lot,"" the judge wrote.In contrast, the judge took issue with Parnell's demeanor in court, noting that Parnell dressed casually in jeans and untucked shirts. He also noted that Parnell looked at his attorneys and the news media during his testimony, rather than at the judge.""In evaluating Sean Parnell's testimony, I find it less credible. He simply denied that all of the incidents ever happened,"" the judge wrote. ""He was somewhat evasive. When weighing his position against Laurie Snell's statements of detailed facts about many incidents, Sean Parnell's position is less believable.""Senate campaign worked against Parnell In the judge's opinion, which followed a three-day custody trial, he concluded that both ""parents love their children and provide proper parental care for them,"" but he said the parents' failure to communicate and compromise prevented them from effectively sharing custody.The judge, who is required to consider 16 separate factors when determining custody, assigned the most weight to the children's need for stability and continuity, the parents' availability to care for the children and the level of conflict between the parents and their willingness to cooperate.Parnell's Senate campaign worked against him in the custody fight. The judge noted that Parnell would have been traveling frequently for a campaign and, if he had won, would have spent part of his time in Washington, DC.""These circumstances certainly restrict his ability to have primary physical custody of the children,"" the judge wrote.While Parnell had enjoyed Trump's endorsement in his Senate bid, the allegations from his estranged wife were taking a toll on his campaign, as CNN previously reported.Parnell had canceled fundraising events and ramped down his appearances in conservative media. Multiple Republican operatives in and out of Pennsylvania had told CNN they didn't see how Parnell's campaign -- which has leaned heavily on his children, including a large photo of him with them on his website's homepage -- could continue following the ruling.Earlier this month, Parnell staffers informed Trump's team that Parnell planned to suspend his campaign if he did not receive custody of his children.Budowich, the Trump spokesman, tweeted that the seat ""remains a top priority"" for Trump.This story has been updated with additional information.

71,"Washington (CNN)US officials are telling American businesses and government organizations to take extra precautions against hackers this Thanksgiving following multiple ransomware attacks during previous holiday periods.An advisory Monday from the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) told organizations to identify key IT security employees who can be on call in the event of a ransomware attack. The advisory underscores how preparing for disruptive hacks has become a daily task for US companies and agencies after a series of high-profile ransomware attacks on critical American infrastructure this year.""While we are not currently aware of a specific threat, we know that threat actors don't take holidays,"" CISA Director Jen Easterly said in a statement. ""We urge all organizations to remain vigilant and report any cyber incidents to CISA or FBI.""Ransomware gangs like to strike on the weekend or during holidays, when organizations are short-staffed and potentially off-guard.  In one incident over the Fourth of July weekend, a criminal hacker breached Kaseya, a major US IT supplier, in a ransomware attack that affected up to 1,500 businesses around the world.""[R]ecent 2021 trends show malicious cyber actors launching serious and impactful ransomware attacks during holidays and weekends, including Independence Day and Mother's Day weekend,"" CISA and the FBI said. A study by security firm Cybereason of more than 1,200 security professionals working at organizations that have suffered a ransomware attack found that nearly a quarter of those surveyed still do not have specific contingency plans for dealing with ransomware attacks over holiday periods. Ransomware isn't the only consideration when it comes to holiday scams. CISA's counterpart in the United Kingdom, the National Cyber Security Centre, issued its own warning Monday that cybercriminals had compromised customer payment information on 4,000 small businesses websites.Other types of hacks have rattled US businesses during Thanksgivings past. Sony Pictures Entertainment discovered the week of Thanksgiving, in 2014, that hackers had stolen reams of data from the film studio and destroyed some company computers in the process. US officials later blamed North Korean hackers for the cyberattack.  ",2
72," (CNN)Here's how politicians game the system: The same group of people can vote on the same Election Day with very different results. A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The gaming happens by drawing congressional and state legislative maps to politicians' advantage. Republicans have benefited more in recent elections, and they're off to a solid start this year as states draw new congressional district boundaries to account for the 2020 Census. Some estimates suggest Republicans at large will pick up the five seats needed for a House majority in 2022 simply by redrawing state congressional maps.I'm going to spend more time looking at this issue in the newsletter since gerrymandering, along with restricting access to the ballot box, have emerged as the major challenges to the US form of democracy.I went to Sam Wang, a professor at Princeton University and director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, for more on what's happening right now and what it will mean for US politics in the coming years. Our conversation, conducted by email and edited for length, is below.How exactly does gerrymandering work?WHAT MATTERS: Help people understand. If states like Texas and North Carolina have seen growth predominantly in urban areas and with minority communities, how can the maps be drawn to help Republicans?WANG: More and more in recent years, neighboring voters have similar opinions. Voters have also become more consistent in their political loyalty, independent of the candidate. That reliability makes it easy to predict how they will vote in the next election. To disempower Democratic-leaning voters in urban and minority areas, Republican legislators can split them down the middle so they can't win a race -- or pack them into districts so they win very few races. Either way, it's possible to use Census and voting data to predetermine the partisan outcome. A Republican-favoring statewide map can be drawn by building lots of efficient Republican wins with 55%-60% of the vote. Then give Democrats very few wins with 65% or more of the vote -- or split them up to stick them with Republican majorities. Using Texas as an example, the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth areas have been cracked to split up Democratic voters as well as Black, Hispanic and Asian communities. Odd-shaped districts radiating out of the metro areas pair urban voters with rural majorities.This year, gerrymandering offenses are quickly exposed to the light of day, thanks to software, citizen engagement and expert organizations like the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. Casting a harsh light on the process can moderate some of the worst acts and document the offenses in real time.The resulting trail of evidence can help courts undo some of the most extreme maps.Are Democrats just as bad?WHAT MATTERS: What's the inverse? How do Democrats draw their own friendly maps in places like Illinois?WANG: Note that even without gerrymandering, there is a basic cause of low competition in US politics: geographic clustering of voters, which makes it hard to draw competitive districts in most places. Redistricting could repair this, but legislators don't prioritize competition. Instead, they draw the lines to take away the ability of voters of either party to influence election outcomes. Relying on dependable voter habits and armed with mapping technology, both Republicans in Texas and Democrats in Illinois were able to eliminate competition in their new maps, both Congressional and legislative. Democrats have a slightly harder time gerrymandering, because rural and white voters are slightly less lopsided in their voting habits. But rural voters still can be put into districts that snake out from city centers. Or, they can be packed together in an artfully spread-out district. Such Democratic gerrymanders can have lots of county splits and unnatural boundaries. Who are the worst offenders?WHAT MATTERS: You give letter grades to states for their maps. Which states have the worst grades and why?WANG: We've given out a number of F grades so far, including Congressional maps in Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Texas. A fifth gerrymander may occur in New York. That might be it for big-state extreme gerrymanders, since Florida's legislative and Congressional drafts look better than expected and a Virginia state court appears to be focused on meeting fair-districting criteria. The ""F"" states' legislatures -- and it was always a legislature that got an F -- put partisan control ahead of other aims such as competition, minority representation and keeping counties whole and districts compact. In all cases, the common factor was that one political party controlled both the legislature and the governorship. The exception was North Carolina, where the state constitution excluded the governor from the process.Can Republicans guarantee a House majority before the 2022 election occurs?WHAT MATTERS: Republicans control more state legislatures and so they have more control over this process nationwide. Do you think they'll get the five seats they need for a House majority simply through redistricting?WANG: We may not find out in 2022, since midterm elections are usually bad for the President's party, and Congressional control is so closely divided.Even without gerrymandering, the effect may be dozens of seats. It may take until 2024 to get clarity where redistricting is the key deciding factor.In the meantime, here is what we do know: in 2021, combining the large states that have gotten F grades with single-seat shifts in Utah, Oregon, and Arkansas, we estimate a net shift of five seats to Republicans so far. We still have to see what will happen in Tennessee, Maryland, Missouri and New York, as well as other states. Is it enough by itself to matter in 2022? It's right on the edge.But don't forget the big picture: partisan gerrymandering was far worse in 2011, when Republicans got an immediate advantage of at least 15 seats.Since that time, commissions have taken the redistricting power away from legislatures in Michigan, Colorado and Virginia. Divided control in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania should make redistricting more fair. In most of these states, the law requires public input and consideration of communities of interest. One consolation is that even where legislators are in control, state legislative maps are sometimes gerrymandered a little less than congressional maps, perhaps because some state laws require counties and other structures to be preserved. These are mostly under the radar of national reporters, but they are very important for local governance.Is there a solution?WHAT MATTERS: Numerous states have enacted changes to end gerrymandering. Do these nonpartisan commissions work? Is there a better way to solve the problem of gerrymandering?WANG: Redistricting outcomes tend to be better if the process is decided by independent commissions and courts, or on a bipartisan basis. Overall, there's been a lot of progress: commissions in Michigan, California, Colorado and Virginia, and divided government in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. These add to reforms already in place in California, Arizona and other states.Finally, public pushback may have prevented worse outcomes in Arizona, where the commission received public suspicion beforehand but ended up doing fine. Continued pressure in Georgia and Florida will be important.A second way to address gerrymandering is to sue in court. Lawsuits will challenge maps on racial grounds in Texas and other states, and on partisan grounds in North Carolina and Ohio. North Carolina and Ohio state supreme courts may each have a slim majority to strike down excessively partisan maps, because of specific conservative-leaning justices who appear likely to adhere to nonpartisan ideals. However, lawsuits can take years to resolve.All of these solutions rely on state-by-state solutions, which are available in some but not all states. Addressing these problems on a national level requires passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Congressional action on these bills is currently blocked by the current version of the filibuster rule in the Senate.",2
73," (CNN)Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election results were a ""red line"" for him, and that he has not spoken with the former President in nearly a year.""The red line was Election Night, David,"" Christie, a Republican and former Trump ally, told David Axelrod on CNN's ""The Axe Files"" podcast released on Monday. ""Standing behind the seal of the president and saying the election was stolen, and then offering not one piece of evidence to support that.""Christie said that he spoke with one of Trump's sons that night and pressed them for evidence, recalling that he said, ""If you have evidence that the election was stolen that's convincing, I'll fight with you."" He did not mention the name of the son he spoke to but writes in his new book, ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden,"" that he told Eric Trump in a text Election Night to lay out evidence of election fraud. Christie also told Axelrod he pressed Trump multiple times after the election for evidence of fraud.""I'm a prosecutor. Where's the evidence? He'd say these things that weren't evidence,"" Christie recalled to Axelrod. ""So that's a red line for me, David. Like, I don't -- you can't undercut our democracy with no facts and that's why we haven't spoken since a couple of days before Christmas last year.""Christie, who served as an adviser to Trump and helped him prepare for the presidential debates ahead of the 2020 election, has been outspoken against his claims that last year's election was stolen. He also blamed Trump's lies about the election results for the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, telling CNN's Dana Bash that it ""incited people to that level of anger.""Asked about Trump's endorsement of Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican who was censured by the US House and stripped of his committee assignments last week, Christie also told Axelrod the former President is engaged in ""vendetta politics"" that is bad for the GOP and the country.""It's bad for him, and he shouldn't be doing it. As his friend, I would tell him he shouldn't be doing it,"" he said. ""Because whatever legacy he has as president, Operation Warp Speed, the economic performance, the conservative judges, the things that we, as Republicans would say, were good things. Every time he does stuff like this, it diminishes that, in my view."" ",2
74,"Washington (CNN)The mysterious case of Rosemarie Hartle's vote in the last presidential election, three years after her death, was trumpeted in November 2020 by the Nevada Republican Party and various prominent conservatives. From then-President Donald Trump on down, Republicans used stories about phony votes cast under the names of dead people as key evidence for their claim that Joe Biden's victory was marred by major fraud. The Hartle mystery is now solved. And it turns out that the fraud was committed by a Republican.Hartle was married to Las Vegas businessman Donald Kirk Hartle, a registered Republican. In November 2020, Hartle told Las Vegas television station 8 News Now (KLAS-TV) that he felt ""disbelief"" when he found out that a mail-in ballot was submitted in his late wife's name. It was ""pretty sickening,"" he said at the time, adding that he didn't know how it could've happened.  But Hartle had actually cast the phony ballot himself. On Tuesday, Hartle pleaded guilty to the crime of voting more than once in the same election. The judge, 8 News Now reported, said Hartle had pulled what seemed like a ""cheap political stunt that kind of backfired and shows that our voting system actually works because you were ultimately caught."" Indeed. And it isn't the first time something like this has happened. In November 2020, the Trump campaign highlighted a case in which a ballot was cast in the name of a long-dead Pennsylvania woman. Her son later pleaded guilty to casting that ballot for Trump, saying, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, he had ""listened to too much propaganda and made a stupid mistake.""False or overstated claimsSo there is a smattering of confirmed cases in which ballots were indeed illegally cast in the names of dead people, and we might perhaps learn of some more cases over time. Early this year, Nevada's secretary of state referred 10 ""questionable"" cases to law enforcement for investigation. But Trump's vague assertions that thousands of ballots were cast in the names of dead people in various key states were entirely baseless; his massive numbers were plain fictional. Some specific ballots the Trump campaign claimed were fraudulent, meanwhile, were quickly proven to be legitimate ballots cast by living people with the same or similar names as dead people. And Republican voters were responsible for some of the small number of known crimes. A Republican local official was the perpetrator of one Ohio case, admitting to forging a signature to cast a ballot under the name of his recently deceased father; he told NBC News it was an ""honest error"" and also that he had simply been ""trying to execute a dying man's wishes."" In Colorado, a man who was charged in 2021 with murdering his wife, who had disappeared in May 2020, was also charged with illegally casting her ballot, for Trump, in the November election. He allegedly told FBI agents that he submitted the ballot because he thought ""all these other guys are cheating"" and his wife would have voted for Trump anyway. In some of the confirmed cases, including Hartle's, it is not publicly known which presidential candidate the illegal vote was cast for. Regardless, there is no sign that the crime of voting under the name of a dead person happened even close to frequently enough to have swung any state to Biden, that this crime was committed overwhelmingly by Biden voters, or that the crime is generally going unnoticed by the authorities.""No one claims that voter fraud never occurs. Multiple studies have examined the frequency of voting fraud, and it is extremely rare,"" said Paul Gronke, a political science professor and director of the Elections & Voting Information Center at Reed College. ""Voter impersonation fraud particular, which is what Mr. Hartle did when he forged his wife's name, is even rarer."" Gronke said that, while fraudulent voters can occasionally slip through verification systems if they are willing to commit a felony like Hartle did, ""nothing in this case is evidence that voting fraud is happening at a level that changes election outcomes.""The Nevada Republican Party did not respond to a CNN request for comment about how it had drawn attention to the Hartle case in 2020.Which is unsurprising. When it comes to voter fraud, some Trump allies have taken a distinctly Trumpian approach: throw sensational claims into the public realm before the actual facts are known -- and if inconvenient actual facts eventually emerge, just quietly move on to the next sensational claim, confident that the truth will never reach a good chunk of the Republican base.

75,"Washington (CNN)When it came to light in January 2017, just days before Donald Trump took office, the so-called Steele dossier landed like a bombshell and sent shockwaves around the world with its salacious allegations about Trump and his supposed ties to Russia.The central allegations, that Trump conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election and that Russia had compromising information on him, were given a veneer of credibility because they originated from a retired British spy, Christopher Steele, who had a solid reputation.But five years later, the credibility of the dossier has significantly diminished.A series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of its central allegations and exposed the unreliability of Steele's sources. They also raise serious questions about the political underpinnings of some key explosive claims about Trump by shedding new light on the involvement of some well-connected Democrats in the dossier, and separate efforts to prod the FBI to investigate ties between Trump's campaign and Russia.These revelations have triggered a reckoning around the Steele dossier, particularly in the wake of two recent indictments secured by John Durham, the special counsel appointed during the Trump administration to investigate the FBI's Russia probe. Durham alleges that Steele's primary source, a US-based foreign policy analyst, repeatedly lied to the FBI about where he got his information.To be clear, multiple US government inquiries uncovered dozens of contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russians, which have since been acknowledged. The candidate himself and his closest advisers even welcomed the Kremlin's interference in the election. Still, none of it added up to the collusion suggested in Steele's memos.Legitimate questions are now being raised about the dossier -- how it was used by Democrats as a political weapon against Trump, how it was handled by the FBI and US intelligence agencies, and how it was portrayed in the mainstream media.Democrats' hidden hand revealed  Trump swiftly rejected Steele's claims and said a ""group of opponents ... put that crap together."" Nearly five years later, it's clearer than ever that he wasn't too far off about the origins of the dossier.Two special counsel investigations, multiple congressional inquiries, civil lawsuits in the US and the United Kingdom, and an internal Justice Department review have now fully unspooled the behind-the-scenes role that some Democrats played in this saga. They paid for the research, funneled information to Steele's sources, and then urged the FBI to investigate Trump's connections to Russia.Mother Jones first revealed the existence of the dossier a few days before the 2016 election, and said the memos were part of an ""opposition research project"" underwritten by Democrats. Nearly a year passed before the full truth came out about the financing: The money flowed from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign to law firm Perkins Coie, to the research company Fusion GPS, and then ultimately to Steele, who got $168,000.(Anti-Trump Republicans initially funded Fusion GPS' research during the 2016 GOP primaries, but the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee picked up the tab before Steele got involved.)But Democratic involvement in Steele's work was much deeper than previously known. Court filings from the Durham inquiry recently revealed that some information in the dossier originated from Charles Dolan, 71, a public relations executive with expertise in Russian affairs who had a decades-long political relationship with the Clinton family. He has not been accused of any crimes.Federal prosecutors said Dolan was in regular contact in 2016 with Steele's primary source Igor Danchenko, 49, a Russian citizen and foreign policy analyst who lives in Virginia. Danchenko was indicted on November 4 for allegedly lying to the FBI about his dealings with Dolan and a fellow Soviet-born expat that he claimed was one of his sources.Danchenko pleaded not guilty last week. In a statement to CNN, his defense attorney Mark Schamel said Durham is pushing a ""false narrative designed to humiliate and slander a renowned expert in business intelligence for political gain."" Schamel also accused Durham of including legally unnecessary information in the 39-page indictment to smear Danchenko.""For the past five years, those with an agenda have sought to expose Mr. Danchenko's identity and tarnish his reputation while undermining U.S. National Security,"" Schamel said. ""...This latest injustice will not stand. We will expose how Mr. Danchenko has been unfairly maligned by these false allegations.""The indictment indirectly connected Dolan to the infamous claim that Russia possessed a compromising tape of Trump with prostitutes in Moscow, which became known as the ""pee tape."" (Trump and Russia both denied the allegations.) According to the Danchenko indictment, in June 2016, Dolan toured the Ritz-Carlton suite where the alleged liaison occurred, and discussed Trump's 2013 visit with hotel staff, but wasn't told about any sexual escapades. It's still unclear where those salacious details that ended up in the dossier came from.Dolan was also indirectly linked in the indictment to still-unverified claims about Russian officials who were allegedly part of the election meddling. The indictment also suggested that Steele's memos exaggerated what Dolan had passed along to Danchenko.The indictment also says the dossier contained a relatively mundane item about Trump campaign infighting that Dolan later told the FBI he actually gleaned from news articles. Prosecutors say Dolan even lied to Danchenko about where he got the gossip, by attributing it to a ""GOP friend"" who was ""a close associate of Trump.""An attorney representing Dolan, Ralph Martin, declined to comment for this story because his client ""is a witness in an ongoing case.""Durham explicitly stated in the Danchenko indictment that the Clinton campaign didn't direct, and wasn't aware of, Dolan's activities regarding the dossier. Clinton has said she only learned about the dossier when it was posted online, two months after the 2016 election. Senior Clinton campaign aides also said they found out about Steele's work from press reports.Clinton's allies prod the FBI  The Danchenko indictment raises new concerns about the circular nature of portions of Steele's work, and how it fit into a larger effort by Democrats to dirty up Trump. Clinton's campaign funded the project, and we now know that much of the material in Steele's memos ended up being mere political gossip. Steele then sent his explosive but unverified findings to the FBI and State Department.While Steele was passing his tips onto the FBI in fall 2016, a Clinton campaign lawyer separately met with a senior FBI official and gave him information about strange cyberactivity between servers at the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia.The lawyer, Michael Sussmann, has since been charged with lying to the FBI during that meeting, for allegedly saying he wasn't providing the dirt on behalf of any client, even though he ultimately billed that time to the Clinton campaign, and also billed them for other work he did on the server issue. Durham says Sussmann repeated this lie during a meeting with CIA officials in February 2017, where he told them about the server theory. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.The indictment says Sussman peddled the same material to a Slate reporter, who published a story right before the election. The story said reputable computer scientists uncovered unusual activity between servers belonging to the Trump Organization and the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, suggesting a secret backchannel.The Trump Organization and Alfa Bank both denied there was a backchannel. The FBI investigated the underlying data and ruled out any improper cyber links by February 2017.But after the Slate article came out, Clinton's campaign went on a PR blitz, tying Trump to Russia. Clinton had already slammed Trump for months, for embracing Russia's interference in the election, which included releasing hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee.Sussmann was a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie, which indirectly hired Steele. Both men separately went to the FBI in 2016 with dirt about Trump, though there's no indication Sussmann knew about the dossier. (A 2019 Justice Department watchdog report pointed out that the FBI routinely accepts information from biased or dubious sources, and then investigators try to independently vet the material.)After he was charged, Sussmann resigned from Perkins Coie. He declined to comment for this story.Rumors, hearsay and fabrications   When the dossier burst into public view, much of the conversation revolved around Steele's résumé: He worked undercover in Moscow, ran the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters, and maintained a network of sources in the country. This lent credibility to his findings, even though nobody, including CNN, was able to confirm the explosive allegations of collusion or the salacious ""pee tape"" claims.In January 2017, CNN broke the story that senior US intelligence officials had briefed Trump and then-President Barack Obama about the dossier. CNN never published the dossier itself, but hours later, BuzzFeed posted the full 35 pages of Steele's memos online for all to see. CNN said the author was ""a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.""That was true. The FBI formalized Steele's role as a confidential informant in 2013. He aided the FBI's groundbreaking corruption case against dozens of FIFA soccer officials in 2015, and he also provided the FBI with reliable information about Russian oligarchs.But the once well-connected British spy had been out of the intelligence services for a while.For starters, we now know that Steele's primary source, Danchenko, wasn't some deep-cover Kremlin insider. He was a DC-based think tank analyst with a Rolodex of Russians.The FBI tracked down Danchenko and interviewed him a few times in 2017 while they scrambled to verify the dossier. Danchenko said the information he gave to Steele was mostly ""hearsay,"" ""just talk,"" ""word of mouth,"" and came from ""conversations he had with friends over beers."" Danchenko also said Steele puffed up the memos and leaned too hard into the raw information he received, according to a bombshell 2019 report from Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz about the Russia probe.Some of Steele's sourcing disintegrates  The Danchenko indictment alleges that he lied to the FBI, and possibly Steele too, about another detail that became central to the dossier: where he heard there was a ""well-developed conspiracy of cooperation"" between Trump and the Kremlin.In interviews with the FBI, Danchenko attributed the information to Sergei Millian, a Belarusian-American businessman who did some real estate work with the Trump Organization. The indictment also says Danchenko sourced the ""pee tape"" story, in part, to Millian. But Millian wasn't the source, Durham says, contradicting press reports from 2017. (Some outlets recently corrected or clarified those reports.)Millian has since said he was ""framed"" by Danchenko and has publicly denied that they ever spoke, though there is no indication in the indictment that Millian ever denied it to the FBI or under oath.""This fraud destroyed my health, life, businesses and turned my American dream into (a) nightmare,"" Millian told CNN in a statement, declining further comment.A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released last year said Millian's behavior during the 2016 election ""resembles activities by a Russian intelligence officer or cooptee."" He has vehemently denied working for the Russian government.Another Russian who Danchenko told the FBI was one of his sources said in a sworn affidavit in a civil case that she wasn't the source for at least one claim that was attributed to her. The woman, publicist Olga Galkina, said she believes Danchenko told the FBI she was his source ""to create more authoritativeness for his work,"" according to court filings.The indictment against Danchenko quotes emails where Galkina told Dolan she is a ""big Hillary fan,"" and hoped to land a job at the State Department after Clinton became president.Taken together, these revelations about Dolan, Millian and Galkina raise grave questions about where Danchenko got his information, or if he perhaps made some of it up.Attorneys for Danchenko didn't respond to CNN's request for an interview.The Durham investigation is ongoing. He continues to use a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, signaling that he might be interested in bringing charges against additional defendants.'Underpinned by poor judgment'   It took five years of criminal investigations, civil cases and congressional reports to pull back the curtain on the flimsiness of the dossier. The big picture really came into focus in 2019 with the release of a Justice Department watchdog report.That report described for the first time Danchenko's many walk-backs in his FBI interviews. It also said FBI agents gave Steele mixed reviews, with some seeing him as a ""person of integrity,"" while others said he had a ""lack of self-awareness"" and was ""underpinned by poor judgment,"" even if he was acting in good faith.The report also said the CIA viewed Steele's material as an ""Internet rumor.""Last year's bipartisan Senate report said ""the tradecraft reflected in the dossier is generally poor relative to (US intelligence community) standards."" The blockbuster 966-page report also raised concerns that some of the material Steele put in his memos was Russian disinformation.These revelations undermined Steele's credibility -- and led to renewed scrutiny and right-wing criticism of how many news outlets, including CNN, covered the dossier story.Efforts to corroborate fall flat   Everyone but Steele talked about his work for nearly five years, but he finally broke his silence in an ABC News interview last month, shortly before Danchenko was arrested. (Steele and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence, declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview.)Steele defended his work and said he was right about three big takeaways from his memos: Russian spy agencies interfered in the 2016 election; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the operation; and the goal was to help Trump and hurt Clinton.He pointed to the US intelligence community's landmark 2017 report that said Russia meddled in the election at Putin's orders to help Trump. US intelligence agencies had examined the dossier but didn't rely on his findings for their report.But Steele's findings on Russian election-meddling, which were ahead of the curve at the time, now seem more like prescient geopolitical observations rather than insider information. Plus, his final and most consequential takeaway -- that Trump's campaign worked hand-in-hand with the Kremlin -- was essentially debunked by special counsel Robert Mueller's sweeping investigation.CNN reported in February 2017 that US investigators had corroborated some of the communications detailed in the dossier, citing multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials.The CNN report said US investigators were able to confirm the time, place and people involved in some of the conversations between foreign nationals mentioned by Steele. The story said CNN couldn't confirm if those conversations were about Trump, and the sources told CNN that the corroborated information had nothing to do with the salacious claims in the dossier.The sources also told CNN that the corroboration gave investigators ""greater confidence"" in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier, which the FBI was still actively investigating at the time.Two years later, the Justice Department watchdog said only limited information was corroborated from the dossier relating to ""time, location, and title information, much of which was publicly available.""Horowitz's watchdog report, released in December 2019, also said much of the material in the dossier about Trump and his campaign ""could not be corroborated"" and that ""certain allegations were inaccurate or inconsistent"" with subsequent FBI findings.But Horowitz said the FBI determined that Steele's big-picture conclusions about Russian meddling were ""consistent with known efforts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections.""What's right? What's wrong?   Looking at the big picture, Steele was right that Russia used ""trusted agents of influence"" to target Trump's inner circle. And he was correct to suspect there were secret contacts between Trump aides and Russian officials, even though Trump denied any Russian ties. But Steele was wrong about so many of the key details.Despite a worldwide hunt for the Trump ""kompromat,"" no tapes ever emerged, and the Danchenko indictment puts the source of that underlying claim into doubt.There is no proof of something in the dossier that would've been a smoking gun for collusion -- that Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen went to Prague in 2016 to coordinate with Russian officials about their anti-Clinton hacking efforts. The watchdog report said the FBI concluded that these claims ""were not true."" Even after Cohen turned on Trump and started helping Mueller, and implicated his former boss in an illegal campaign finance scheme, Cohen always denied the Prague allegations.The dossier said Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and foreign policy adviser Carter Page led the collusion efforts. But this was never verified by any government investigations. Mueller found that both men had extensive contacts with Russian agents, but he couldn't verify that Page met with the specific Kremlin officials as alleged in the dossier.The Mueller report said there wasn't evidence of a criminal conspiracy to collude.Five years on, Steele continues to defend his work. He told ABC News that ""the evidence suggests"" there was collusion, that he believes Cohen traveled to Prague after all, and that the compromising tape of Trump with Russian prostitutes ""probably"" exists.""I stand by the work we did, the sources that we had, and the professionalism which we applied to it,"" Steele said in the interview with ABC News.Origins of the Russia probe  Democratic officials, the media and Internet conspiracy theorists initially hyped Steele's work. But as his credibility waned, Trump started exaggerating Steele's influence, and pushed the lie that the dossier triggered ""the entire Russia probe.""In truth, the dossier played a remarkably limited role in the Russia investigation.Four US government reports concluded that the probe began in July 2016, two months before the FBI team handling the inquiry even learned about the dossier.(After a lengthy review, Horowitz said there was a legal basis to open the Russia probe, and that the process was free of political bias. However, Durham publicly rebuked Horowitz and said he disagreed with some of Horowitz's conclusions, leading to criticism that his own work is politically motivated.)Mueller's team interviewed Steele, but largely ignored the dossier as they found dozens of links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller's report didn't say all that much about the dossier, and he didn't attribute any findings to Steele.And there's no indication that the dossier influenced Mueller's successful criminal prosecutions against six Trump campaign associates: Manafort, Cohen, Roger Stone, Rick Gates, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos.But the dossier did play a major role in the investigation into Page, the lower-level Trump foreign policy adviser, and helped the FBI secure a warrant to wiretap him after he left the campaign in September 2016.Tainted FBI wiretaps  The fallout from the dossier was largely contained to the Page surveillance. But when internal investigators looked under the hood, they found catastrophic issues.Before the dossier, investigators already considered applying for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to wiretap Page's communications, but they weren't sure if they could establish probable cause. The dossier's explosive claims about Page's alleged meetings during his recent trip to Moscow ""pushed it over"" the line, a lawyer involved in the case told the Justice Department watchdog.The FBI included snippets of Steele's reporting in the FISA application, along with other information, like details of Page's previous interactions with Russian spies, and the fact that he suggested to an FBI informant that he had an ""open checkbook"" from the Kremlin. The secretive FISA court approved the warrant in October 2016, as well as three subsequent renewal requests, meaning Page was wiretapped for about one year.In April 2017, CNN was first to report that the FBI included some material from the dossier in the FISA applications. The article said prosecutors would only have done this ""after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation,"" according to officials familiar with the process.It's now clear that this level of verification never materialized. The watchdog report said Steele's claims about Page ""remained uncorroborated"" when the wiretaps ended in 2017.Page was never charged with any crimes, and Mueller said his investigation ""did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government"" to meddle in the election, which was a far cry from the FBI's initial assertions in FISA applications that Page ""is an agent of a foreign power"" who was ""collaborating and conspiring with the Russian Government.""The inspector general examined the FBI's handling of the FISA applications and found that there were widespread mistakes, omissions and errors that deeply undermined the integrity of the process. In response, the Justice Department declared that the final two FISA warrants against Page were legally invalid.But even Durham, who has been accused of cherry-picking an unfair narrative to undermine the Russia probe, hasn't said in his recent indictments, spanning 66 pages, that the FBI or Mueller ever relied on Steele for anything beyond the Page surveillance.Partial vindication for Trump    Critics of the Russia probe -- conservative pundits, Republican lawmakers and Trump himself -- took a victory lap after the inspector general blasted the Page FISA applications.That's because the inspector general's report confirmed what many of them had argued all along, including in a highly disputed memo from GOP Rep. Devin Nunes: That there were systemic problems with the FBI surveillance of someone tied to the Trump, and the Steele dossier was improperly used to influence part of the Russia probe.But the report refuted the more outlandish conspiracy theories that Trump, Nunes and other Republicans pushed about the Russia probe. The report said the FISA process, while flawed, wasn't intentionally abused and wasn't politically biased. And the report debunked Trump's lie that the FBI planted spies in his campaign.The latest Durham indictments also injected new life into Russia probe skeptics.After wall-to-wall coverage of the Steele dossier, public opinion was quickly locked in on the question of collusion. Many Democrats clung to hope that the dossier was true. Most Republicans denounced it as a deep state hoax. Post-Mueller polling found that about half of Americans believed Trump was guilty of collusion.Mueller and a bipartisan Senate inquiry concluded that Trump's team welcomed Russian help, and tried to coordinate on a few fronts, but it didn't come to fruition.But so much suspicion was fueled by Trump's massive cover-up about Russia.Trump and his team systematically lied about almost every aspect of the Russia probe. (At the start, they falsely denied any contacts with Russians.) After so many of their denials were disproved, they repeatedly shifted their story. Trump repeatedly undermined and obstructed Mueller's investigation.All the while, Trump heaped praise on Putin. He infamously took Putin's side at the 2018 Helsinki summit by agreeing with Putin's lie that Russia didn't try to help Trump win in 2016, leading many to wonder if Trump was compromised after all.",2
76," (CNN)The White House will keep its mask mandate in place on its grounds even as Washington, DC, lifts its indoor mask requirement starting Monday, a contrast that highlights the uneven messaging many Americans are receiving on Covid-19.The nation's capital remains an area with ""substantial"" community transmission, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is currently at a rate of about 90 new weekly cases per 100,000 residents. That's led the White House to keep its strict masking rules in place even as the district around it starts to relax its own rules.""The White House follows CDC guidance, which recommends masking in areas of high or substantial transmission,"" Kevin Munoz, White House assistant press secretary, told CNN. But DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is bucking the CDC recommendations and announced last week the district would be relaxing its requirements, pointing to low hospitalization rates as a result of vaccinations. The reaction to this announcement was mixed, and some voiced concern about what it meant for the city's most vulnerable residents. The differing guidelines within the nation's capital reflect just how much mask requirements vary from place to place, and how many Americans are currently navigating a patchwork of mitigation efforts. It's a messaging problem the Biden administration has been fighting ever since the spring, when public health officials began to relax their recommendations to stop the spread of Covid-19 as cases dropped and vaccinations increased.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said this week that more than 85% of counties in the US have substantial or high transmission. She noted the CDC recommends jurisdictions have moderate or low community transmission for several weeks before rolling back mask requirements. Currently six states have statewide mask mandates: Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington, according to Hemi Tewarson, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. At one point earlier on in the pandemic, 30 states had similar mandates. Beyond the White House, an administration official tells CNN the mask policy in a federal building outside of Washington will be dependent on the level of transmission in the area where that building is situated.The President has long promised his administration will follow the lead of health and medical experts, making it no surprise the White House and the rest of the federal government are sticking with the CDC guidance. Biden came into office vowing to restore the CDC's independence, and has stressed there would be no interference on such issues by the White House. But the messaging from the CDC has sometimes caused confusion among Americans looking for answers on how to get through the pandemic. Most recently, there has been deep frustration inside the administration over the complicated messaging surrounding Covid-19 vaccination booster shots, with several officials telling CNN the restrictions on who should get one and when have only spurred confusion when it was clear immunity wanes for all age groups.The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines for all adults, which offers the Biden administration a fresh chance at simplifying that particular messaging. The CDC quickly followed suit, recommending that people 18 and older get boosters.Back in May, the country appeared to reach a turning point when the CDC said people who were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 didn't need to wear masks or practice social distancing indoors or outdoors, except under certain circumstances. Shortly after the guidance came out, the White House emailed staffers and said they did not need to wear a mask on the grounds if they are vaccinated. Biden said at the time it was a ""great day for America"" and a ""great milestone"" in the country's response to the pandemic. He credited the national Covid-19 vaccination program for that development.But as Delta variant cases spiked across the country in areas with low vaccination rates, the CDC changed its recommendations in July and urged people in certain areas of the country to resume wearing masks indoors in public areas. The White House and other federal buildings followed suit. After initially resisting imposing any kind of vaccine requirements and instead simply encouraging all Americans to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the White House has now taken a tougher stance. Biden has imposed stringent new vaccine rules on federal workers, large employers and health care staff. The new requirements could apply to as many as 100 million Americans, or close to two-thirds of the American workforce. As the pandemic dragged on and tens of millions of Americans still refused to get vaccinated, which fueled the spread of the virus and the Delta variant, the President hardened his tone towards unvaccinated Americans. ""We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,"" Biden said in September while announcing the new vaccine requirements. ",2
77," (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff achieved another first in their historic roles when they affixed a white mezuzah to the right-hand side of the doorway of the vice presidential residence.The moment the sacred object was affixed to the Naval Observatory's wooden entryway marked the first time an executive home has carried the abiding sign of sanctity of a Jewish home, according to Rabbi Peter Berg of Hebrew Benevolent Congregation (The Temple) in Atlanta, which loaned the mezuzah. Berg led the private ceremony at the Naval Observatory in October.Emhoff is the first Jewish spouse of a president or a vice president, and Harris is the first woman and first woman of color to hold her title.""It's an extraordinary moment in United States history,"" Berg told CNN in an interview. ""And it was one of the great honors of my lifetime to be able to stand there with the second family as they placed that mezuzah on their home for the very first time.""A mezuzah houses a small scroll that includes text of the Shema prayer, and fulfills the biblical commandment to affix the object on the doorpost of the home, a White House official told CNN. It signifies protection for the home, marking it as a sacred and holy space, and a reminder for those inside ""to devote themselves to lives of meaning, value, kindness and love for all beings.""In attendance were Emhoff's parents, who had not seen their son or Harris in person since before the inauguration because of the Covid-19 pandemic.""Both the second gentleman and the vice president spoke off the cuff about what it meant to them to be standing here. Remember, this was not a public event. There were no cameras and no staffers there. There weren't Jewish elected officials. It was just a private family moment. And that to me is what made it so beautiful,"" Berg said. ""When I started talking, we all teared up because of the significance and the history,"" Berg said.Berg said October's ceremony, which he wrote, included two traditional blessings: one to sanctify the space and another to hang the mezuzah. A Shehecheyanu prayer was also recited, a ritual blessing said to sanctify ""something precious and new,"" per the official. The second family also participated in the reading to make the ceremony more personal.Emhoff eventually shared those personal moments publicly ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, posting photos of himself on Twitter in the process of hammering the sacred tube to the wall. One White House official said it sits roughly one-third of the way up.""One of my favorite memories was when our family visited and together, we hung a mezuzah on the front door of the Vice President's Residence,"" Emhoff wrote.This ceremony marks the latest way Emhoff and Harris have celebrated the second gentleman's Jewish faith during the first year in their new roles in the Biden administration. In March, Emhoff led the White House's first Passover event, live streamed for the masses days before the actual holiday. ""He obviously recognizes the significance of being the first in this space and I think he's very honored to have the opportunity to help lead some of these really important and significant traditions,"" a White House official told CNN in March.Harris herself has been a vocal advocate for the Jewish faith. Recently, she headlined the Anti-Defamation League's ""Never Is Now"" conference, offering a robust rebuke of antisemitism. And she met Israeli Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid in October.History made The Temple holds specific social justice significance, with long ties to the civil rights movement and the fight against antsemitism. Former Rabbi Jacob Rothschild's relationship with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led to Rothschild honoring the civil rights leader in Atlanta after he won the Nobel Peace Prize. The Temple was also home to Leo Frank, a Jewish man who was lynched in 1915. In more modern times, the Temple now works to reduce homelessness in the community with multiple shelters started by former Rabbi Sugarman.That work is what drew the second family to choose a mezuzah from the Temple, Berg said, as they wanted to be reminded of the virtues of the Temple upon returning home.The process started months ago when he received a call from an unknown number, with the caller saying they were looking to obtain a religious object for a ""high-profile couple"" who recently moved to Washington, DC.Berg first thought it was a prank call, before realizing the caller was referring to the vice president. After taking photos of the mezuzah and summarizing the Temple's lengthy history, Berg said he didn't hear back until months later -- in June when he was invited to attend a vaccination tour launch with Harris in Atlanta. Berg then spoke to Harris backstage.""They started to whisk me away because my 15 minutes were up and I said, 'By the way, don't forget about the mezuzah.' She looked up and said, 'If I told my husband once, I told him 100 times, we've got to get the mezuzah picked,'"" Berg said, recalling a moment of levity.He was told months later that the Temple had been chosen and was invited to DC for the ceremony.""The world is so filled with divisive politics, and this was just a beautiful ritual moment. Devoid of anything political, just pure beauty,"" Berg said.'Family is everything'The second family will affix a second mezuzah in the residence, from The Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life at the University of California Berkeley, according to the official.It's a sterling silver mezuzah, made after a design by Jewish American Sculptor Ludwig Yehuda Wolpert.""This mezuzah case has inscribed the Hebrew phrase, 'Blessed shall you be in your comings and blessed shall you be in your goings' (Deuteronomy 28:6), a traditional blessing for visitors and travelers,"" the official noted.Joel Goldstein, a vice presidential historian, summarized the significance of the historic moment to CNN as ""keeping with the ideal of pluralism and inclusivity that has been a hallmark of the Biden administration, as reflected initially by the selection of then-Sen. Harris to be his running mate and now in her service as vice president.""Tradition dictates that residents kiss the mezuzah as they walk into the home. During the ceremony, the question arose of whether to attach the cylinder either vertically or horizontally. Berg informed the family it's meant to be attached diagonally.""The reason why is because it reminds us of compromise and peace that should exist in the home. I explained that tradition to the second family and they felt it was just very deeply meaningful,"" Berg said.  ""And I remember the vice president even saying, 'Family means everything.'""",2
78,"Washington (CNN)Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday tried to tamp down the idea that he and Vice President Kamala Harris are starting to quietly compete to be the future standard-bearer of the Democratic Party, saying their focuses are on their roles in the nearly year-old Biden administration. The comments from Buttigieg, who competed against Harris -- and Joe Biden -- for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination come after CNN and other outlets detailed how allies of the vice president saw Buttigieg as unfairly boosted by the West Wing as she was repeatedly sidelined.Buttigieg, pressed by NBC on whether a rivalry was emerging between himself and Harris, said: ""No, because she and I are part of a team that is disciplined and doesn't focus on what's obsessing the commentators.""""We're too busy with a job to do -- she as a leader in this administration, with her leadership role, and I, and the President, and everybody else in the Cabinet and across the administration, are laser focused on getting the job done,"" he added.As the two administration members who also vied for the Democratic nomination, many have speculated that, if President Joe Biden decides not to run for a second term, Buttigieg and Harris may be poised for a rematch in a 2024 Democratic primary or the 2028 contest. Buttigieg and Harris weren't always at odds prior to the presidential election, with the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, helping Harris, then the vice presidential nominee, prepare for her 2020 debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, a fellow Hoosier. ""There's no room to get caught up in the parlor games, and I'm proud to be part of the Biden-Harris team,"" Buttigieg told NBC, saying his focus as Transportation secretary remained on the job at hand. CNN reported last week that Harris loyalists are growing increasingly frustrated by how the West Wing has handled right-wing attacks on Buttigieg as compared to the amount of help she's gotten during various episodes.  ""It's hard to miss the specific energy that the White House brings to defend a White man, knowing that Kamala Harris has spent almost a year taking a lot of the hits that the West Wing didn't want to take themselves,"" said a former Harris aide, reflecting conversations last month among several former aides and current allies.",2
79," (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris said Thursday she does not feel misused or underused in her role as vice president, following CNN reporting that many in the vice president's circle believe she is being sidelined and that key West Wing aides are exasperated by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus from Harris and her staff. ""We're getting things done, and we're doing it together,"" Harris told ABC in an interview that aired on ""Good Morning America.""Harris pointed to the President signing one of his biggest legislative victories -- the bipartisan infrastructure package -- into law on Monday, saying: ""This was a good week.""""I am very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished. But I am also absolutely, absolutely clear-eyed that there is a lot more to do and we're going to get it done,"" Harris said. Earlier this week, several top White House officials defended Harris, including press secretary Jen Psaki, who described the vice president as a ""key partner"" to the President. CNN reported on Sunday that key West Wing aides have largely thrown up their hands at Harris and her staff -- deciding there simply isn't time to deal with them right now as Biden faces urgent legislative and political concerns. At the same time, many in the vice president's circle are fuming that Harris is not being adequately prepared or positioned in her role, and the vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically.Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a longtime friend of Harris, told CNN: ""It is natural that those of us who know her know how much more helpful she can be than she is currently being asked to be. That's where the frustration is coming from.""In the ABC interview on Thursday, Harris did not say whether Biden had told her if he was planning on running for reelection, and said she and the President were ""absolutely not"" discussing 2024 yet. Harris also dismissed the President's low approval ratings, saying: ""Polls, they go up, they go down. But I think what is most important is that we remain consistent with what we need to do to deal with the issues that we're presented with.""Harris also called dealing with record inflation ""one of the highest priorities"" for herself and Biden.""It's real and it's rough,"" she said, citing rising prices for groceries and gas. She highlighted actions the administration has been taking to try to ease supply chain issues and lower costs for American families. Biden announced last month the Port of Los Angeles would move to 24/7 service, bringing it into line with operations at the Port of Long Beach, which was already working on a 24/7 schedule. Those two ports handle 40% of container traffic in the US. The administration has also taken other actions to attempt to alleviate issues at the nation's ports, waterways and freight networks.""We're seeing great results,"" Harris said.In addition to the short-term actions, Harris said in the long term, the administration is working to bring down the cost of living. She said the new bipartisan infrastructure law as well as the second part of Biden's economic agenda -- a sweeping package to expand the nation's social safety net -- would help achieve that goal.",2
80," (CNN)President Joe Biden marked Transgender Day of Remembrance in a statement Saturday, paying tribute to ""those we lost in the deadliest year on record for transgender Americans.""In a statement shared with CNN, Biden also remembered ""the countless other transgender people -- disproportionately Black and brown transgender women and girls -- who face brutal violence, discrimination, and harassment.""On Friday, the White House marked the day with a vigil in the Diplomatic Room of the White House hosted by second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Transgender Day of Remembrance caps off Transgender Awareness Week, and memorializes victims of anti-transgender violence across the country. Earlier this month, the Human Rights Campaign declared 2021 the deadliest year on record for transgender and nonbinary people, with at least 45 transgender or gender-nonconforming people killed.In a tweet marking that solemn milestone, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the news ""unacceptable,"" writing: ""Our hearts are with all who knew and loved the 45 people who have been killed this year. The march to end this epidemic of violence continues.""In his statement, Biden called on the Senate to pass the Equality Act, which amends the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect people from being discriminated against based on sexual orientation and gender identity, ""so that all people are able to live free from fear and discrimination."" The bill passed the House in March but has stalled in the Senate.""In spite of our progress strengthening civil rights for LGBTQI+ Americans, too many transgender people still live in fear and face systemic barriers to freedom and equality,"" Biden wrote. The administration also released a report Saturday from the first Interagency Working Group on Safety, Opportunity, and Inclusion for Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals, which is made up of representatives from the US Agency for International Development, the Departments of State, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Education, Homeland Security, Labor, Interior and Veterans Affairs, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the US Interagency Council on Homelessness.Per the report, shared Friday with CNN, violence against transgender Americans is the direct result of ""systemic anti-transgender stigma and hate, pervasive discrimination, disproportionate criminalization, and marginalization and exclusion of gender minorities,"" with violence against transgender communities ""heightened today due to a historic spike in legislation targeting transgender people for discriminatory and unjust treatment.""President Barack Obama's White House regularly acknowledged Transgender Day of Remembrance and met with activists to discuss violence against the community. That practice did not continue under President Donald Trump.Biden's statement is the latest in a series of moves by the administration to show support for LGBTQ+ Americans, including reversing his predecessor's ban on transgender Americans in the military, reinstating a special envoy for LGBTQ rights after the position lapsed under Trump and issuing the first presidential proclamation marking Transgender Day of Visibility in March. The President drew praise from LGBTQ advocates for his remarks pledging support for transgender Americans during his first address to a joint session of Congress in April, while first lady Jill Biden invited Stella Keating, a teenage transgender advocate who testified before Congress in support of the Equality Act, as her virtual guest for the address.While violence against transgender Americans is at an all-time high, 2021 has also marked a record year for anti-transgender legislation, with state legislatures introducing 100 bills across 33 states aimed at curbing the rights of transgender people.The majority of bills would affect transgender youth, a group that researchers and medical professionals warn is already susceptible to high rates of suicide and depression.  ""To ensure that our government protects the civil rights of transgender Americans, I charged my team with coordinating across the federal government to address the epidemic of violence and advance equality for transgender people. I continue to call on state leaders and lawmakers to combat the disturbing proliferation of discriminatory state legislation targeting transgender people, especially transgender children,"" Biden wrote in Saturday's statement.  ""Today, we remember. Tomorrow -- and every day -- we must continue to act.""",2
81," (CNN)President Joe Biden underwent his annual physical Friday morning at Walter Reed Medical Center, his first such appointment since he was inaugurated as the oldest first-term president in US history.Afterward, his physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor wrote in a memo Biden ""remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.""The doctor, who has been with the President since he served as vice president, singled out two areas of ""observation"" he set aside for detailed investigation: an ""increasing frequency and severity of 'throat clearing' and coughing during speaking engagements"" and the President's ambulatory gait, or walking abnormality, which O'Connor said was ""perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago."" Both have been noticeable elements of Biden's public appearances since taking office. In a detailed, six-page summary of Biden's health, O'Connor said X-rays showed Biden has arthritis of his spine and normal wear and tear damage for someone of his age. The doctor characterized that damage as moderate to severe, but said it was not severe enough to warrant any specific treatment. He wrote it would help account for some of Biden's recent stiffness and clumsy gait. An ""extremely detailed neurologic exam"" was ""reassuring,"" O'Connor wrote, and showed no evidence of a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's.Biden also has a condition known as hiatal hernia, which causes him to have reflux -- something O'Connor said could account for his more frequent throat clearing.The document contained a detailed accounting of the physical exam, including his height of 5 feet 11.65 inches; his weight of 184 pounds; and his blood pressure of 120/70. Biden does not drink or use tobacco and works out five times a week, according to the report. ""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the president, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,"" O'Connor wrote in his summary.Biden received a routine colonoscopy Friday while at Walter Reed. The process, which required anesthesia, meant that he temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman to assume presidential power for 85 minutes Friday morning.As he left Walter Reed, Biden said he ""had a great physical and a great House of Representatives vote,"" alluding to the House passing his Build Back Better bill on Friday morning.The last extensive update on Biden's medical state came in December 2019, when the doctor he eventually recruited to serve as White House physician described him as ""a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, hasn't released a full report on his health since.Biden is not behind in releasing medical information compared to his recent predecessors, who waited a full year before undergoing a physical and authorizing details to be released publicly.The latest update on Biden's health came after he, then-president-elect, fractured his foot in November while playing with his dog. In February, Biden's physician said the foot fractures ""are completely healed.""Presidents are not required to publicly disclose results of their annual check-ups but have done so to be transparent and assure the American people in the face of questions about their state of health. Presidents, however, have also hidden their illnesses, the severity of their illness, or medical treatments.Dr. Kevin O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009 and the White House physician, wrote the three-page medical summary Biden's presidential campaign released nearly two years ago. The 2019 summary showed Biden was being treated for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, or AFib -- an irregular heartbeat that O'Connor said Biden experiences no symptoms of. He was taking Crestor to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as Eliquis to prevent blood clots, Nexium for acid reflux, and Allegra and a nasal spray for seasonal allergies.The most significant medical event in Biden's history, O'Connor wrote, was when Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988. He was serving in the Senate at the time. During surgery, doctors found a second aneurysm that had not bled, which they also treated. While in the hospital after that surgery, Biden suffered deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. Doctors at the time inserted an ""inferior vena cava filter,"" which would prevent future blood clots from reaching the heart and lungs and treated him with an oral anti-coagulant for several months.Biden also had his gallbladder removed in 2003, and according to O'Connor he has had multiple surgeries and physical treatments for orthopedic injuries and sports medicine. Biden also has had several non-melanoma skin cancer lesions surgically removed. This story has been updated with additional information. ",2
82,"Washington (CNN)President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday that he is mulling a US diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing.""It's something we're considering,"" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office following a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.A senior administration official told CNN on Wednesday that Biden is not expected to attend the upcoming Olympics in China this February and that his administration is on the verge of implementing a diplomatic boycott of the games. The President has not signed off on having no government officials attend, the senior administration official cautioned on Wednesday, but discussions regarding the matter have all leaned in that direction. The topic of the Olympics and Biden's attendance did not come up during his three-and-a-half hour meeting Monday night with Chinese President Xi Jinping.However, the two leaders engaged in a ""healthy debate"" on a number of issues, according to a senior Biden administration official present for the discussions. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon that the decision to consider a boycott of the Olympics ""doesn't say anything"" about the Biden-Xi meeting. ""(W)e've said from ... the beginning of this administration, as it relates to how we engage with China, that we see it through the prism of competition, not conflict,"" Psaki added.Psaki repeated the administration's serious concerns about China's human rights abuses, adding that ""certainly, there are a range of factors as we look at what our presence would be.""When pressed for more information about what a potential diplomatic boycott would entail, and what that would mean for athletes, Psaki said she didn't have an update about what the US presence would be.Democratic and Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have advocated for a diplomatic boycott in protest of China's human rights abuses. Some Republicans have even suggested no American athletes attend either, but the official said a full boycott is unlikely right now.When asked whether Biden had been in touch with congressional lawmakers about the prospective boycott, Psaki said the White House is ""in regular touch at a range of levels with members of Congress about a range of issues, including the relationship with China and including an issue like this."" Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US and allies are in ""active conversations"" about how to approach the upcoming Winter Olympics in China.Blinken, appearing virtually at the New York Times DealBook Summit, was asked whether he thinks American athletes should participate since he has said in the past that China is involved in genocide, given its policies toward Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province.""We are talking to -- to allies, to partners, to countries around the world about how they're thinking about the games, how they're thinking about participation,"" Blinken said. ""It's an active conversation. We're coming -- we're coming up on the games, but let me leave it at that for today.""",2
83,"Washington, DC (CNN)The indoor cycling craze has come for America's kids, and child development experts aren't happy. Little Tikes, the children's toymaker, watched sales of Peloton's stationary bikes soar last year when the pandemic hit. It saw a chance to create something for children to enjoy alongside their parents, according to Little Tikes vice president of product development Kevin Bloomfield.  So this summer Little Tikes released the Pelican, a stationary bike for children ages 3-7, with a screen attached for viewing videos. Pelotons, the popular stationary bikes for adults, come with screens that can display exercise classes and add a social touch to exercising alone. (The bike costs $1,495 and there's a monthly membership fee of $39 to view video classes.) ""We didn't want the parents to be the only ones having all the fun,"" Bloomfield said in an email to CNN Business. ""Our commitment to inspiring an active and imaginative lifestyle among kids sparked the idea."" Stationary bikes have existed for kids before, but have not lasted. Toymaker Fisher-Price launched a $150 stationary bike for kids in 2007 and updated it in 2017. Fisher-Price then cut its price to cut its price to under $100 and now no longer sells the bike. It declined to explain why. The bike was sold exclusively on Amazon, which also declined to comment. But child development experts aren't having it. They say a stationary bicycle, especially one with a screen attached, is a step backward for what a bicycle can mean to child development. Kids riding a stationary bike lose the learning experiences that come from roaming their neighborhood on foot or on bike. ""It just feels so bogus to me. And it doesn't feel like something that kids will use a lot,"" Roberta Golinkoff, a University of Delaware professor who studies child development, told CNN Business. ""Kids want to be part of the real world,"" said Lenore Skenazy, the president of Let Grow, a nonprofit promoting childhood independence. ""A stationary bike doesn't prepare them for anything but moving their legs in a circular motion.""  Child development experts say that active play like tag or bicycling prepares them to succeed in life because they interact with people and build problem solving skills. Outdoor play helps kids create categories, like the different types of houses or dogs in their neighborhood. ""You can burn calories on this [stationary bike], but you can't get to know your neighbors,"" Skenazy said. But Bloomfield said that Little Tikes doesn't feel the Pelican should or will replace a regular bicycle. Little Tikes ""created a product that would make kids happy and stay active regardless of the state of the world,"" Bloomfield said. He added that their research found children wanted to emulate their parents on stationary bikes. ""We wanted to give the option for a safe and engaging experience alongside mom and dad's stationary bike,"" Bloomfield said. The Pelican incorporates fun exercise into kids' daily activities, he said, and is an alternative to flopping on the couch after school. Most kids don't get enough physical activity, he said.  But Jason Boye, a pediatric psychologist in the Healthy Weight and Wellness Clinic at Nemours Children's Hospital in Delaware, cautioned CNN Business that using exercise equipment can create negative associations with physical activity.  ""Kids can develop an association of being forced to do an activity and make it something they're not interested in doing,"" Boye said. He's concerned about the bike being used solely as a means of physical activity, but he said placing the bike alongside a parent's Peloton's to ride together would encourage quality time. Family bonding is one of the Pelican's benefits, Little Tikes' Bloomfield said. CJ Rich, a Florida father who owns a kids' stationary bike said he bought it for exactly that reason.  ""I thought it would be awesome for him to have something to copy me,"" Rich said of his son, who is now 6 and mostly rides a bike with training wheels outside. Rich thinks the stationary bike helped make his son more confident on his outdoor bike with training wheels. The stationary bike isn't used as much recently, in part because Rich sold his Peloton. (Peloton declined to comment for this story.) He was tired of Peloton's monthly fees and bought a mountain bike to ride outside instead. But he expects his younger son, age 2, will ride the stationary bike once he's big enough. ",2
84,"New York (CNN Business)Trendy soaps brand Lush Cosmetics is quitting Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat on Friday in a radical move to draw attention to how those platforms are damaging people's mental health.The company said Monday that its accounts will be deactivated on Nov. 26, the day after Thanksgiving, when most other brands and retailers kick their social media activity into high gear to win over holiday gift shoppers.Lush, which has more than 900 stores worldwide, including 240 across the United States and Canada, said it will remain off those social media channels globally until the platforms ensure a safer environment for their users. As much as Lush is known for its cruelty-free and organic bath bombs, shampoos and soaps, the brand also actively champions social and environmental causes such as Black Lives Matter, fights against deforestation and promotes sustainability to its 659,000 Instagram followers, 275,000 Twitter fans and more than 1 million Facebook followers.This isn't the first time Lush, a Millennials and Gen Z -favored brand, has tried quitting social media. The company made a similar attempt with its UK accounts in 2019 saying ""It was tired of fighting with algorithms"" and wanted to talk directly with its customers.The latest effort, however, is happening at a time when social media companies are under even more intense scrutiny over how their platforms may be contributing to mental and physical health issues, especially among younger individuals.Facebook is currently in the middle of possibly the biggest crisis in its 17-year history over issues about hate speech and misinformation, which have been amplified on the platform.""As an inventor of bath bombs, I pour all my efforts into creating products that help people switch off, relax and pay attention to their wellbeing,"" Jack Constantine, chief digital officer and product inventor at Lush, said in a release. ""Social media platforms have become the antithesis of this aim, with algorithms designed to keep people scrolling and stop them from switching off and relaxing.""The company said it hopes social media companies will ultimately enact stronger best practice guidelines. Lush said it will continue to be active on Twitter and YouTube. ",2
85,"New York (CNN Business)Astra, a startup building small rockets that launch out of rural Alaska, notched its first successful test flight on Friday night, putting a dummy satellite into orbit. The flight sent the company's stock price on a tear — soaring more than 30% at one point after trading hours opened Monday morning. Astra is one of dozens of companies that plan to use lightweight rockets to make frequent trips to space to drop off satellites. Astra, Rocket Lab and California-based Virgin Orbit are among the only startups that have now proven their rockets can get the job done.While SpaceX's Falcon rockets — which are used to haul large satellites, batches of satellites or NASA astronauts into orbit — stand at more than 200 feet tall, or roughly the height of four of Astra's rockets stacked on top of each other, Astra is looking to compete elsewhere. The idea behind companies such as Astra is to create smaller rockets that haul less mass into space, but can be built quickly and cheaply and launched agilely.Footage of Friday's launch, captured at the company's launch site in Kodiak, Alaska, shows the rocket roaring to life and making a clean swoop up into the night sky. It was the fourth attempt by the company to fire a rocket into orbit, and the success put Astra within the ranks of a small handful of private space exploration companies that have managed to safely put a rocket into orbit. When asked in a company Q&A posted online how Astra plans to stand out in such a crowded industry, Adam London, Astra's founder and chief technology officer, said that ""rockets are typically artisanal, crafted objects. You make one at a time, and they're very complicated. But when you really get into it, they don't need to be that complicated, particularly when you're not flying people or critical national assets, and they don't absolutely, positively have to work 100% of the time.""In other words, Astra plans to mass produce rockets to make them cheaper, but it doesn't put too much emphasis on having a pristine success rate.""I just want to say how incredibly appreciative I am of our shareholders, our customers, for their patience with us,"" CEO Chris Kemp told reporters Monday morning. ""And, of course, for the entire team here who's just worked so hard over the past couple of years, launch after launch, just continuing to put energy and passion into this.""The rocket company is one of numerous space companies that chose to make its stock market debut via SPAC — or special purpose acquisition company — in recent months. Many of those companies, including Astra (ASTR), took that leap despite not having proven their technological chops at the time of their stock market listing. But Friday's long-awaited successful test launch appeared to rally investors.Its market value shot up to more than $3 billion, a significant markup over the $2.1 billion valuation the company was given when it announced its SPAC plans in February. It also marked a recovery for the stock after it took a significant hit in the wake of Astra's last launch attempt in August. Rather than climbing skyward, the company's 43-foot-tall rocket hovered sideways off its launch pad before attempting to right itself, at which point it climbed about 30 miles into the air only to cut its engine power and plunge back into the ocean. Kemp told reporters that Friday's success was not without its challenges, not least of which was combating freezing temperatures in Kodiak.The satellite that launched Friday isn't designed to do anything useful, rather it was simply designed to simulate the weight of a real satellite. But Kemp said the company is now ready to focus on fine-tuning its rocket design, scaling up production and offering its services to paying customers. ",2
86,"New York (CNN Business)When Jeff Bezos decided to give up his role as Amazon's chief executive earlier this year, it prompted the company to name not one but two new CEOs. The first, Andy Jassy, replaced Bezos as CEO of Amazon's sprawling business. The second, Adam Selipsky, was hired in March to fill Jassy's old role as CEO of Amazon's single biggest moneymaker: Amazon Web Services (AWS).Selipsky was no stranger to AWS. He first joined the Amazon cloud computing division in 2005, before its services were even publicly available. But in 2016, after 11 years with the company, he left. In the five years he was away running data visualization firm Tableau, the business and the industry changed considerably, bringing Selipsky a new set of challenges.Annual revenue from AWS nearly quadrupled in that time, and the pandemic caused a huge surge in demand for cloud computing and cloud-based services. But the competitive landscape also intensified. While AWS pioneered cloud technology and is the longtime industry leader, rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOGL GOOGLE) Cloud have stolen some of its market share.  One of the first major hurdles for Selipsky is the battle, especially with Microsoft, for lucrative government cloud services contracts.  In 2019, Microsoft won a contract to modernize the Pentagon's IT infrastructure in a deal worth as much as $10 billion over 10 years, a major blow to AWS, which previously held a deal with the department. The contract was ultimately canceled after Amazon protested that former President Donald Trump had unfairly influenced the deal, but it signaled that AWS may no longer be the obvious choice for such major projects.Now, both companies are expected to bid — potentially along with others such as Google Cloud and Oracle — for the Defense Department's new Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract to replace the 2019 deal.   But in one of his first interviews since taking over as AWS CEO, Selipsky sounded confident about his company's prospects. The new AWS chief said he believes his company still has an edge over Microsoft in clinching government work. ""We really were the first in the cloud to have big, significant government contracts in every area of government and years before any of the competitors,"" he told CNN Business in an exclusive interview last week, which took place inside the new AWS Skills Center at the company's headquarters. ""We learned a lot about how to do cloud implementations and work very closely with federal government customers,"" he said.He added: ""I think you'll find, particularly given our leadership position, that our competitors spend a lot more time talking and worrying about AWS than we do about them — we choose to focus on our customers.""  (While such contracts are good for business, some employees have previously taken issue with the company's work for certain government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement — a dynamic that may only add to Selipsky's challenges in the role.)Selipsky said Amazon never anticipated being the only winner in the cloud. And the industry has certainly gotten large enough to accommodate more than one major player — public cloud spending is expected to reach more than $300 billion this year, according to Gartner estimates from April. ""In any fast growing, interesting market segment, there's going to be competition,"" he said. ""We've always thought there would be not a lot of winners, but a small handful of winners that emerge and have vigorous competition, and that's what we see. But we still are the significant leader.""We 'really encourage' employees speaking upShortly after Selipsky took charge of AWS, the business faced a different challenge from within. A group of employees circulated a petition alleging discrimination and harassment of women and minorities in one of the AWS business units, after which the company hired an outside firm to investigate. Similar employee activism has cropped up recently at Apple, Google and video game company Activision Blizzard.  While some companies have appeared to chafe at employee organizing (AWS parent company Amazon has faced criticism for what some see as anti-union efforts), Selipsky said he thinks workers speaking up may ultimately be good for the business.  ""I really like the fact that people are bringing their whole selves to work and that they're speaking out — we really encourage that,"" he said. ""I've found that if you have a really good process and really genuinely listen and show people that you're taking the time to listen, even when they disagree with you at the end of the day, we all can lock arms and move forward together.""He continued: ""I really welcome the fact that a lot of topics are being discussed today that maybe were discussed less in the workplace five, 10, 20 years ago."" Another growing concern with the cloud industry is that the data centers it relies on are energy intensive. Much of that computing is still reliant on fossil fuels, but Selipsky said AWS is working to change that in keeping with Amazon's larger promise to be net carbon zero across the company by 2040. Amazon's climate pledge was announced in 2019 just ahead of a planned walkout by employees over perceived inaction by the company on climate change.  ""Amazon intends to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025 ... and we're already about two-thirds of the way there, so we're making significant progress,"" he said. ""Just given our size and our scale and the things like the data centers we operate, we really have to drive them with renewable energy in order to hit that [2040] goal. We're doing a lot of innovating ourselves, we're doing a lot of partnering with a lot of companies, a lot of governments, a lot of nonprofits to reach those goals."" Selipsky will have his first chance to address customers at AWS's annual cloud conference, Re:Invent, in Las Vegas later this month. He said customers should expect announcements in some of ""our oldest and most basic services, things like compute and databases and storage,"" as well as ""exciting announcements about higher level services and industry specific solutions."" ""It's absolutely imperative that we continue to understand [customers'] evolving needs, which are changing very quickly, and we're going to evolve right along with them,"" he said.  ",2
87,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)For months, Elizabeth Holmes sat silently, masked, in a San Jose federal courtroom as the government mounted its case to jurors that she knowingly lied about the capabilities of her blood-testing company, Theranos, in order to get money. Now, Holmes wants jurors to hear her story in her own words: The famously charismatic former CEO took the witness stand Friday in her own criminal trial, taking off her mask to testify for roughly one hour before court recessed for the weekend and shortly after the prosecution rested its case after 11 weeks. She is expected to resume her testimony Monday, when court is in session from 9am PT to 1pm PT.  Court will also be in session Tuesday, before breaking for the holiday.For a time, Holmes was hailed as a visionary. A Stanford University dropout, she founded what would become Theranos in 2003 at age 19. The company claimed to have developed revolutionary blood testing technology that could accurately, reliably and efficiently conduct a range of tests using just a few drops of blood. Holmes raised $945 million from investors, struck key retail partnerships, and attracted a who's who list of board members and investors who'd bought into her claims. She was lauded on magazine covers as the richest self-made woman and ""the next Steve Jobs,"" an image she helped cultivate by dressing the part in her signature black turtleneck. At its peak, her startup was valued at $9 billion. Then, it all began to unravel when a Wall Street Journal reporter started poking holes in the company's claims. In her testimony, she said she believed Theranos had developed technology capable of running any blood test. She also testified that its proprietary blood analyzer machine was only ever used to perform 12 small sample tests, confirming what jurors heard during the government's case.First indicted more than three years ago, the start of Holmes' highly anticipated trial faced numerous delays due to the ongoing pandemic and the birth of her first child this summer. Holmes, now 37, is fighting nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The accusations are that she engaged in a scheme to defraud investors from 2010 to 2015, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients who paid for its blood testing services from 2013 to 2016.  She faces up to 20 years in prison, as well as a fine of $250,000, plus restitution, for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count. She has pleaded not guilty.A jury of eight men and four women will decide whether Holmes intended to deceive or, as the defense has argued, she was simply a young, ambitious yet inexperienced entrepreneur who acted in good faith and relied upon the wrong people. The government called 29 witnesses, including scientists, doctors, retail executives, former employees and even a former Defense Secretary, to make its case, which it rested Friday morning. The defense first called a paralegal for the law firm representing Holmes who introduced a number of documents into evidence, followed by a former Theranos board member who joined after the startup's downward spiral had begun. Then, at approximately 3pm PT, the defense called Holmes herself.""For the defense, this is an opportunity for the jury to meet the 'real' Elizabeth Holmes,"" said Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, who noted that the defense did not have to put on a case at all, and that the burden of proof is on the prosecution.""If Holmes paints herself as a 'big ideas' innovator who happened to be unaware of the company's failures or misstatements, she can help her case -- or at least sow doubt among several jurors,"" said Baer. ""And she can also help her case marginally if she appears more sympathetic or likeable than the person portrayed by the government's witnesses.""Her testimony so far has focused on the earliest days of the company, well before the time of the alleged fraud. Holmes, who was frequently smiling on the stand, testified about her original idea of developing a pill that could be swallowed and used for testing purposes and how that evolved into Theranos. She spoke to the caliber of individuals she attracted to help her build the company, beginning with her chemical engineering professor Channing Robertson, who would become its first board member. She testified about early fundraising efforts and being introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas, who would invest and become chairman of the board. She also spoke about signing contracts with two major pharmaceutical companies, and the first demonstration of its technology in Switzerland for Novartis in 2006.""We ran our technology in Switzerland at one of their offices and processed samples on cartridges that we brought there, and then had data wirelessly transmitted back to our site in California,"" Holmes said, testifying that the demonstration was successful.""We nailed this one,"" Holmes wrote in an email to her team.The testimony contradicts what reporter John Carreyrou -- the journalist who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Journal -- detailed in ""Bad Blood,"" his definitive book on the rise and fall of the company. ""One of the two readers Elizabeth took to Switzerland had malfunctioned when they got there. The employees she brought with her had stayed up all night trying to get it to work,"" the book reads, noting that ""to mask the problem"" a team in California ""beamed over a fake result.""Cross examination expected to be ""really, really rigorous""While the prosecution had indicated in court filings that Holmes was likely to take the stand in her own defense, legal experts such as Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg have said that determining whether or not to do so is ""a very complicated calculation."" That's because it means subjecting Holmes to a cross-examination that would undoubtedly be ""really, really rigorous."" As Weisberg noted to CNN Business, anything Holmes testifies about could potentially be impeached by what she's said and written over the years. The prosecution will get an opportunity to confront Holmes about many issues, but two stand out. One involves documents sent to stakeholders purporting to be validation of its technology from two major pharmaceutical companies; scientists from both companies testified the documents did not represent their conclusions and that the use of their companies' logos was not authorized. The other concerns claims from Holmes that its technology was deployed in the battlefield, which witnesses testified did not happen.Baer noted that, ""if she appears to evade questions, she may inadvertently strengthen the government's narrative.""So far during Holmes' testimony, there's been no mention of Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. Holmes' attorneys indicated in pre-trial court filings that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani, who was also her boyfriend at the time of the alleged fraud. Balwani, who will face the same charges as Holmes when his trial gets underway next year and has also pleaded not guilty, ""adamantly denies"" the allegations, according to a court filing.Nearly 20 years Holmes' senior, the pair met in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford's Mandarin program.When will jurors deliberate?Before Holmes was called to the witness stand Friday afternoon, Judge Edward Davila informed jurors the case would not be done by December 6, a date he said he'd previously given them. An updated calendar on the court's website now has the trial scheduled through December 17. This comes as the judge has added numerous court days in November, as well as stretched the hours for sessions.Outside the presence of jurors, Davila addressed attorneys about the trial's pacing: ""I don't think any of you -- I hope none of you are being strategic as far as timing. And I say that because my sense is that none of you want this jury to be deliberating this case on the holiday week in December, the third week of December or any week like that."" He continued: ""We're concerned about the jury and their comfort level and keeping them engaged,"" adding that having a jury deliberate over a holiday week ""doesn't benefit either side."" The prosecution has expressed frustration with the amount of time the defense has taken up during its case, saying that it exceeded the number of hours the government has spent questioning its own witnesses. Eying the calendar could indeed be a strategic move for the defense, according to George Demos, a former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and an adjunct law professor at the UC Davis School of Law. ""The defense may aim to have the case submitted to the jury right before Christmas because that's not the time of year a lot of people would feel comfortable sending a new mother to jail,"" he told CNN Business.

88," (CNN Business)The pandemic has boosted the digital economy across the world, and Africa is no exception. However, limited internet access remains a major stumbling block in Africa's digital transformation, as do inconsistent policies across the continent in areas such as payment systems and data roaming.Looking to remedy that is Smart Africa, a partnership between 32 African countries, and groups including the World Bank and the African Union. Tasked with developing the continent's digital infrastructure, the organization recently signed an agreement with Intel (INTC) to develop its member states' digital skills and understanding of emerging technologies, such as cloud computing. Eleni Giokos spoke with Lacina Koné, director general of the Smart Africa secretariat, about the continent's digital future. The following interview has been edited for clarity and length.I want to talk about Smart Africa's ambition to create a digitally connected Africa by 2030. How are you planning to achieve this goal?Koné: We can achieve this by organizing ourselves. Every country who joins has a flagship project — Rwanda's is a smart city, South Africa's is artificial intelligence and blockchain, Burkina Faso's is capacity building, Côte d'Ivoire is cybersecurity. We assist them, take it from a concept to a blueprint for pilot, then scale it up. When we get to the scaling-up stage, we share the best practice with the rest of the members. We're learning from each other and growing together. And the central role that Smart Africa is playing is really coordination and our organization of laws, because what is very important is building a regulatory environment in Africa for emerging technology for investors to back.Read: Now for the hard part, says Secretary General of African Continental Free Trade AreaWe've seen incredible movements in the financial technology space — Africa dominates the use of mobile money transfers — but have we seen anything new that's disruptive, that's transforming lives dramatically?Koné: We have seen it, but probably not big enough. Today, Africa has about seven tech unicorns [privately owned startups valued at over $1 billion]. When we talk about leapfrogging, this is about innovation-based entrepreneurship. We need a digital economy that is sustainable and that requires an adaptive regulatory environment. I keep on saying infrastructure is a regulatory environment. Digital governance is a regulatory matter.I want to talk about some of the most amazing tech startups that have been bought out by Silicon Valley, like Stripe's takeover of Nigeria's Paystack for over $200 million. Do we want that to happen? Or do we want to keep them purely African? Koné: Even if those companies are bought by Silicon Valley companies, they still remain African companies doing great in the US and wider world. I think this is actually a very good way of looking at things. Imagine our young generation, the young programmers and coders, seeing their friends developing companies being bought for a billion dollars. It actually encourages them and one way the government is helping them to actually organize themselves is through what we call Startup Acts: supportive legislation designed to stimulate entrepreneurship. That's an opportunity for them to set up a company and sell it.Fast cheap internet is still not a reality for many people. How do we bridge the gap?Koné: True — today the connectivity is at 39.8%. Mobile network operators are there, but people are not using it because of affordability, cybersecurity, access to devices and content. So once we're able to work on those, I think from now to 2025 we can see this jumping from 39% to 51%. So we are very optimistic. I believe we are doing really great at our own pace.So let's say you've achieved your goal of creating a single continent-wide digital market — describe what that would look like. Koné: To think about where we are right now, just think about Dubai 20 years ago. That's what Africa can be by 2030. That's only nine years from now. It means you can do literally everything from your couch, not even moving, paying everything by mobile money for public or private services. The infrastructure will be abundant, so it's quite possible. I think I can say it is the digital ""Wakanda"" [a fictional African country that's home to Marvel superhero Black Panther] — actually better. And of course close to 60% of Africa's population is living in rural areas. This is something also being taken into consideration. That's why Smart Africa has a broadband strategy 2025 to connect those rural areas.",2

90,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)China is bringing the regulatory hammer down yet again on some of the country's largest tech firms. Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and other companies were all slapped with fines over the weekend for violating antitrust laws, the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) said in a statement.SAMR listed 43 separate violations, with some offenses dating back as far as 2012. The penalty for each fine is 500,000 yuan ($78,000).""The cases announced this time are all transactions that should have been declared but not declared in the past,"" SAMR said in its statement. The market regulator has spearheaded a yearlong campaign against Big Tech in China. The totals announced Saturday are small in comparison to some of the marquee penalties levied earlier this year, including an 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) record fine that Alibaba (BABA) was ordered to pay.  At the time, antitrust regulators said they had concluded that the online shopping giant had been behaving like a monopoly.Shares of Alibaba, Tencent (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU) were all slightly lower in Hong Kong on Monday following the announcement. Baidu fell the most, 2.1%, while Tencent slumped 0.3%.Alibaba fell 1.6%. The company on Friday plunged nearly 11% in its steepest decline since listing in Hong Kong in November 2019. The tech giant warned last week of weaker growth this year as China's economy slows and Beijing continues its regulatory crackdown.

""This is a fully ecological city that works and is energized by a volcano.""Half of the VAT levied would be used to fund the bonds issued to build the city, and the other half would pay for services such as garbage collection, Bukele said, estimating the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 bitcoins.El Salvador in September became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.Although Bukele is a popular president, opinion polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about his love of bitcoin, and its bumpy introduction has fueled protests against the government.Likening his plan to cities founded by Alexander the Great, Bukele said Bitcoin City would be circular, with an airport, residential and commercial areas, and feature a central plaza designed to look like a bitcoin symbol from the air.""If you want bitcoin to spread over the world, we should build some Alexandrias,"" said Bukele, a tech savvy 40-year-old who in September proclaimed himself ""dictator"" of El Salvador on Twitter in an apparent joke.El Salvador plans to issue the initial bonds in 2022, Bukele said, suggesting it would be in 60 days time.Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain technology provider Blockstream, told the gathering the first 10-year issue, known as the ""volcano bond"", would be worth $1 billion, backed by bitcoin and carrying a coupon of 6.5%. Half of the sum would go to buying bitcoin on the market, he said. Other bonds would follow.After a five year lock-up, El Salvador would start selling some of the bitcoin used to fund the bond to give investors an ""additional coupon"", Mow said, positing that the value of the cryptocurrency would continue to rise robustly.""This is going to make El Salvador the financial center of the world,"" he said.The bond would be issued on the ""liquid network"", a bitcoin sidechain network. To facilitate the process, El Salvador's government is working on a securities law, and the first license to operate an exchange would go to Bitfinex, Mow said.Crypto exchange Bitfinex was listed as the book runner for the bond on a presentation behind Mow.Once 10 such bonds were issued, $5 billion in bitcoin would be taken off the market for several years, Mow said. ""And if you get 10 more countries to do these bonds, that's half of bitcoin's market cap right there.""The ""game theory"" on the bonds gave first issuer El Salvador an advantage, Mow argued, saying: ""If bitcoin at the five-year mark reaches $1 million, which I think it will, they will sell bitcoin in two quarters and recoup that $500 million.""

92,"New York (CNN Business)Apple posted a statement to its employees Friday evening reminding them of their rights to speak up about their pay and working conditions. The move comes after months of employee organizing in a movement that's come to be known as #AppleToo.  ""Apple is deeply committed to providing employees with a workplace where they feel safe, respected, and inspired to do their best work,"" the company said in the statement posted to an internal employee portal, which was obtained by CNN Business. ""Our policies do not restrict employees from speaking freely about their wages, hours, or working conditions."" The statement added that employees are welcome to raise concerns ""in the way they feel most comfortable, internally or externally."" NBC first reported the memo Friday. In recent months, Apple (AAPL) employees have broken with the company's historic culture of secrecy to speak out on controversial hiring decisions, alleged pay disparities and remote work policies.  Apple did not respond to requests for comment for this article.  Two Apple employees, Janneke Parrish and Cher Scarlett, started #AppleToo in August to help the company's workers ""organize and protect ourselves,"" according to the movement's website. They called on coworkers to share stories of issues they may have faced, including incidents of racism, sexism and discrimination, in order to outline ""changes we expect to see Apple make."" Parrish told CNN Business last month that they received hundreds of reports from employees within weeks about alleged incidents that ""range the gamut from sexism and ageism to disclosures of rape and suicide,"" she said. Parrish filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board earlier this month alleging that she was fired from her job as an Apple program manager in October in retaliation for her organizing efforts. (At the time, Apple said it does not discuss specific employee matters but that ""we take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised."" For her part, Scarlett said on Twitter last week that Friday was her last day at Apple. Friday's statement by Apple is a win for the #AppleToo movement, Parrish told CNN Business.  ""It's something that we've wanted Apple to communicate for the entirety of #AppleToo,"" Parrish said. ""It's definitely not the end of the road but it's a really big first step and it shows what workers speaking in unison can achieve."" She added that one common theme in the stories that employees have submitted to #AppleToo is that workers don't know that they're allowed to speak up when issues arise. The company's recent statement will ""help end a systemic culture of silence around our working culture and pay equity,"" she said.  ",2
93," (CNN Business)Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder and former CEO of Theranos, is taking the stand in her own criminal trial.Holmes began testimony on Friday afternoon in the San Jose courtroom during the first day of the defense's case. She is also expected to testify on Monday and Tuesday next week, the only days court is in session.Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, faces 11 federal fraud charges over allegations that she knowingly misled investors, doctors, and patients about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each charge.Whether Holmes would testify was a big question looming over the trial. She has attended the trial each day, typically with her mother and occasionally her partner. On Friday, her partner, mother and at least one person who appeared to be her friend were in attendance. She was smiling as she took the stand and during much of her testimony.Off the bat, Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey asked her if she believed Theranos had developed technology that was capable of running any blood test. ""I did,"" Holmes testified. ""We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all the technologies in a laboratory. The core part of that was a formula for being able to run tests on small samples and run that formula,"" Holmes testified, adding that by 2009 or 2010, the company had a ""breakthrough."" Downey then stepped backed to establish the background of the company's origin, including how she was a chemical engineering student at Stanford University and her first patent application.""I started with talking to my parents and they let me take the money that they had saved for me to be able to go to college to work on my patent,"" she testified. ""Then I went to try to raise or borrow money.""""Were you able to?"" her attorney asked.""I was,"" she replied.The original patent was not for blood testing. Rather, she started with the idea of a pill that could be swallowed without any other actions needed, she said.Holmes went on to explain the evolution of her idea from a pill to a patch to a benchtop device. ""As I started talking to people about what could be useful for a pharmaceutical clinical trial, I learned people were interested in a benchtop or a tabletop device and we moved to trying to build that,"" she said.She testified that she then built out a prototype and set out to raise financing to develop it into a product. She testified she was introduced to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas ""by someone who had gone to college with my dad."" ""I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long-term,"" she testified, adding that he did a ""very comprehensive diligence process.""Holmes said that process included ""giving him a lot of information about our patents."" ""He asked us to get an audit of our financials,"" she testified. ""He wanted copies of contracts and other information about the business. He wanted to speak to people that we were talking to and interacting with.""He ultimately invested and served as Theranos' chairman of the board for a number of years.Holmes' attorneys previously indicated in court documents that she may claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who served as the company's COO. They indicated that she is ""likely to testify herself to the reasons why she believed, relied on, and deferred to Mr. Balwani,"" who is nearly 20 years her senior. The filings were from 2020 and unsealed just before the trial kicked off with jury selection in late August. Balwani, according to a court filing from his attorneys, ""adamantly denies"" the claims.Her attorneys also indicated plans to have an expert testify about the psychological, emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of Balwani.A Stanford University dropout, Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 with the mission to revolutionize blood testing. Inspired by her stated fear of needles, the company promised patients the ability to test for conditions such as cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos had struck up partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway, and a who's who list of board members and investors. Then it all came crashing down. A damning investigation by The Wall Street Journal in October 2015 called into question the capabilities of the company's proprietary blood testing machine, Edison, as well as Theranos' testing methods. Theranos was subsequently sued by investors for fraud and had its US blood-testing license revoked. The firm settled ""massive fraud"" charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately dissolved in September 2018.",2
94,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)After testimony from 29 witnesses, federal prosecutors are resting their case against Elizabeth Holmes, the former CEO and founder of failed blood testing startup Theranos.  Over the course of 31 court days spread out over nearly three months, jurors heard from a broad assortment of witnesses in the San Jose federal courtroom where the highly-anticipated trial of Holmes kicked off with opening statements on September 8. The start of the trial faced numerous delays due to the ongoing pandemic and the birth of Holmes' first child this summer.To make its case, the prosecution turned to scientists, doctors, retail executives, former employees and even a former Defense Secretary. Through them, the government attempted to unravel the many layers of the alleged deception that led investors and patients to believe Theranos' false promises that it could accurately, reliably and efficiently conduct a range of tests using just a few drops of blood.Holmes, a Stanford University dropout who founded Theranos in 2003 at age 19 with the lofty mission of revolutionizing blood testing, is facing nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The government alleges she knowingly misled doctors, patients, and investors about her company's blood testing capabilities in order to take their money. Now 37, Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison, as well as a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count. She has pleaded not guilty. Jurors heard from investors who lost millions of dollars after having been provided information by Holmes about Theranos' supposed blood testing capabilities. That information included, jurors learned, falsified documents purporting to be endorsements of its technology from two major pharmaceutical companies. Jurors heard from three patients; one was falsely told she was miscarrying after taking a Theranos test when, in fact, her pregnancy was viable; another was told she had HIV antibodies when previous and subsequent tests by other labs indicated she did not. The trial now turns to the defense, which has given some indications of what its case could entail during opening arguments and cross examinations of government witnesses. Holmes' team has sought to convince jurors that Holmes -- who it frequently characterizes as a young, ambitious but inexperienced entrepreneur -- acted in good faith, and lacked the intent to deceive. Instead, it has pointed at others for Theranos' downfall.Holmes' attorneys have blamed the lab's failings on lab directors and Theranos' COO and president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, with whom Holmes was romantically involved and who was roughly two decades her senior. (Balwani is set to face federal prosecutors over the same charges next year; he has pleaded not guilty.)  ""There were lots of misleading statements made during the lifespan of Theranos. The jury has now heard that evidence. But the government still has to establish intent -- and that provides a real opportunity for the defense,"" Mark MacDougall, a white-collar defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor, told CNN Business.  Many layers to the government's caseProsecutors sought to contrast the issues inside Theranos with how it was pitching itself to investors and business partners. The prosecutors also attempted to show that Holmes was at the center of it all, in an effort to address the trial's three main questions: what Holmes knew, when she knew it, and whether she intended to deceive investors, patients and doctors.Multiple high-profile witnesses testified about Holmes' charisma and, according to the former CEO of Safeway, her unusually hands-on role ""negotiating completely on her own."" Investors and retail executives testified that they were kept in the dark about the company's true capabilities. And former employees testified that they alerted Holmes directly to the lab's issues, to little effect.Surekha Gangakhedkar, a scientist who worked at Theranos for eight years, testified that she quit in 2013 over her concerns with launching blood tests to consumers through its Walgreens partnership. When she expressed this to Holmes, she testified the CEO responded by conveying ""that when she has a promise to deliver to the customer, she doesn't have much of a choice but to go ahead with the launch.""Similarly, Adam Rosendorff, the former lab director who was questioned for six days of the trial, testified that while he technically reported to Balwani, Holmes sat above Balwani. Rosendorff said he made his own concerns known to Holmes and ultimately determined ""the company believed more about PR and fundraising than about patient care."" After Rosendorff departed, Theranos had two co-lab directors who overlapped yet were unaware of each others' existence. One rarely ever set foot in the lab and only met Holmes once; the other never visited the lab. Investors and business partners had little visibility into these issues at the time. Former executives for Walgreens and Safeway, testified that they were kept in the dark that the company relied on third-party devices, rather than its own, to analyze patient blood. Witnesses like former Walgreens executive Wade Miquelon testified being shown pharmaceutical company endorsements which had been faked.Miquelon and some investors also said they were impressed by another misleading claim: that Theranos' technology was being tested in Afghanistan on military helicopters. ""What better application for a technology like this than in a military setting under harsh conditions like one would expect in a place like Afghanistan or Iraq,"" investor Brian Grossman, whose firm Partner Fund Management poured $96 million into Theranos, testified this week.Theranos' association with retired four-star general and former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who once served on Theranos' board, made it plausible that the startup could have had its technology deployed to help solders in war zones and on military aircrafts. But Mattis, arguably the biggest name to take the stand, testified it was not, as did a former Theranos employee who was involved with its conversations with the military.These misrepresentations were fed directly from Holmes to journalist Roger Parloff, who was the government's final witness before it rested its case. Parloff wrote the 2014 Fortune Magazine cover story, which was one of the glowing articles that circulted Theranos' claims and factored into why investors were wowed.Six investors, whose investments are each part of the wire fraud charges Holmes is facing, took the stand, including some who spoke about investments made by some of the world's wealthiest families.Among them were a money manager for the billionaire family of former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and a former lawyer who first heard about Theranos from a longtime client — former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger — and then solicited other rich families to invest, including the DeVos family, the Waltons of the Walmart fortune, and the heir to an Italian auto empire. From the outset of the trial, legal experts have suggested jurors may be less sympathetic to investors than patients, who are the other category of alleged victims in the government's case.The government introduced two patients, and a doctor in the final week of its case. Earlier this month, the prosecution botched an attempt to bring in another patient because it failed to list the specific test the patient took on a document previously provided to the defense. That error resulted in the government removing one count of wire fraud.The prosecution had listed roughly 180 possible witnesses it may call. Among those it didn't call: Kissinger, who once sat on the board; media mogul Rupert Murdoch who reportedly invested $125 million; high-powered attorney David Boies who was an investor, board member and legal defense for Holmes and Theranos, and employee-turned-whistleblower Tyler Shultz, the grandson of the late George Shultz, another former Secretary of State and board member. Jurors heard her voice, read her texts and saw clips of her TV interviewsIn the company's heyday, Holmes was the subject of much media attention as it soared to its once-$9 billion valuation. In its downfall, that spotlight hasn't dimmed -- there have been documentaries, a forthcoming limited series, a planned feature film and at least two podcasts devoted to covering the trial. That attention was a big challenge to selecting a pool of jurors largely unfamiliar with her.But since the beginning of the trial, jurors -- who knew little, if anything about the baritone-voiced entrepreneur with a penchant for black turtlenecks -- have only gotten glimpses into how she spoke, and presented herself.They heard audio from a 2013 investor call where Holmes made claims about Theranos' testing capabilities and its work with the military. They also saw television clips from interviews she gave after the 2015 Wall Street Journal investigation that first poked holes in its technology and testing methods. ""I'm the founder and CEO of the company — anything that happens in this company is my responsibility,"" she said, in a April 2016 Today Show clip.Perhaps the most intimate look jurors have gotten into Holmes' state of mind at the time of the alleged fraud has come through text messages between her and Balwani. The texts, some of which have been introduced through various witnesses, ranged from personal to professional and reveal the two were in constant communication. Among them, they discussed the state of Theranos' clinical lab in November, 2014 as the company was securing investments (""Normandy lab is a f***ing disaster zone,"" Balwani wrote) and how they felt when regulators were doing a laboratory audit in September, 2015 (""Praying literally non stop,"" Holmes wrote. ""Going bad so far. Pray,"" Balwani wrote). There were also more intimate ""love you"" texts to some confusing ones that mentioned ""the death and sex thing,"" which went unexplained to jurors. ""There's an aspect of many criminal cases where the jury is asked to get inside the heads of the defendant and other important individuals in the case and that can be uncomfortable for a variety of reasons,"" said Jessica Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Cardozo Law School professor. Roth noted that, given the particulars of the Holmes case, ""it is warranted, at least to a certain extent, to get inside that relationship and to understand the nature of the power dynamics.""Will Holmes take the stand? Whether jurors will get to hear from Holmes, who is listed as a possible witness, remains an open question. Legal experts such as Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg say that determining whether to take the stand is ""a very complicated calculation."" Doing so would mean subjecting Holmes to a cross-examination that would undoubtedly be ""really, really rigorous."" He noted that anything she testifies about could potentially be impeached by things she has said and written over the years. Another looming question: whether Holmes will claim she was the victim of intimate partner abuse at the hands of Balwani. The allegation, which Balwani's attorneys have denied, was introduced in pre-trial filings. So far, her attorneys have only vaguely hinted at the idea in opening arguments. Still, among the possible witnesses for Holmes is clinical psychologist, Dr. Mindy Mechanic, whose work focuses on the psychosocial consequences of violence, trauma and victimization.The defense is likely to continue playing up Holmes' youthful age and lack of experience at the time of the alleged fraud. Through cross examinations, the defense has drilled into the expertise of witnesses and their teams in contrast to Holmes. Holmes, her attorneys have argued, wasn't qualified to run a laboratory. The defense also sought to sow doubt in the due diligence process of investors and underscore that startups are known to be risky investments. ""Elizabeth was only in her twenties, had no prior business experience and was surrounded by much older mentors and advisers,"" said MacDougall, the white-collar defense lawyer. ""The defense now has the chance to put the evidence in context.""George Demos, a former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and an adjunct law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, said the defense ""may call witnesses to testify about Theranos' successes to show that Holmes was in fact on the road to achieving her goals.""Holmes, who has been present each day inside the courtroom, is dutifully accompanied by her mother, Noel, who oftentimes walks hand-in-hand with her daughter to the door through which she enters the courtroom and gives her a hug. (Holmes' father is listed as a possible defense witness.)Anne Kopf-Sill, Phd., a retired biotechnology executive who has been attending the trial most days and has been following the story of Theranos for years, said she's been struck by the persona Holmes gives off in the courtroom: ""She's just sitting there looking sweeter than an angel.""

95," (CNN Business)Every time you pick up your smartphone, you're summoning algorithms. They're used for everything from unlocking your phone with your face to deciding what videos you see on TikTok to updating your Google Maps route to avoid a freeway accident on your way to work.An algorithm is a set of rules or steps followed, often by a computer, to produce an outcome.  And algorithms aren't just on our phones: they're used in all kinds of processes, on and offline, from helping value your home to teaching your robot vacuum to steer clear of your dog's poop. Over the years they've increasingly been entrusted with life-altering decisions, such as helping decide who to arrest, who should be released from jail before a court date, and who's approved for a home loan.In recent weeks, there has been renewed scrutiny of algorithms, including how tech companies should shift the ways they use them. This stems both from concerns raised in hearings featuring Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen and from bipartisan legislation introduced in the House (a companion bill had previously been reintroduced in the Senate). The legislation would force large tech companies to allow users to access a version of their platforms where what they see isn't shaped by algorithms. These developments highlight mounting awareness about the central role algorithms play in our society.""At this point, they are responsible for making decisions about pretty much every aspect of our lives,"" said Chris Gilliard, a visiting research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.Yet the ways in which algorithms work, and the conclusions they reach, can be mysterious, particularly as the use of artificial intelligence techniques make them ever more complex. Their outcomes aren't always understood, or accurate — and the consequences can be disastrous. And the impact of potential new legislation to limit the influence of algorithms on our lives remains unclear.Algorithms, explainedAt its most basic, an algorithm is a series of instructions. As Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist on the ethical AI team at AI model builder Hugging Face, pointed out, it can be hard coded, with fixed directions for a computer to follow, such as to put a list of names in alphabetical order. Simple algorithms have been used for computer-based decision making for decades.Today, algorithms help ease otherwise-complicated processes all the time, whether we know it or not. When you direct a clothing website to filter pajamas to see the most popular or least expensive options, you're using an algorithm essentially to say, ""Hey, Old Navy, go through the steps to show me the cheapest jammies.""All kinds of things can be algorithms, and they're not confined to computers: A recipe, for instance, is a sort of algorithm, as is the weekday morning routine you sleepily shuffle through before leaving the house.""We run on our own personal algorithms every day,"" said Jevan Hutson, a data privacy and security lawyer at Seattle-based Hintze Law who has studied AI and surveillance.But while we can interrogate our own decisions, those made by machines have become increasingly enigmatic. That's because of the rise of a form of AI known as deep learning, which is modeled after the way neurons work in the brain and gained prominence about a decade ago.A deep-learning algorithm might task a computer with looking at thousands of videos of cats, for instance, to learn to identify what a cat looks like. (It was a big deal when Google figured out how to do this reliably in 2012.) The result of this process of binging on data and improving over time would be, in essence, a computer-generated procedure for how the computer will identify whether there's a cat in any new pictures it sees. This is often known as a model (though it is also at times referred to as an algorithm itself).These models can be incredibly complex. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter use them to help personalize users' feeds based on each person's interests and prior activity. The models can also be based on mounds of data collected over many years that no human could possibly sort through. Zillow, for instance, has been using its trademarked, machine-learning assisted ""Zestimate"" to estimate the value of homes since 2006, taking into consideration tax and property records, homeowner-submitted details such as the addition of a bathroom, and pictures a house.The risks of relying on algorithmsAs Zillow's case shows, however, offloading decision-making to algorithmic systems can also go awry in excruciating ways, and it's not always clear why.Zillow recently decided to shutter its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, showing how hard it is to use AI to value real estate. In February, the company had said its ""Zestimate"" would represent an initial cash offer from the company to purchase the property through its house flipping business; in November, the company took a $304 million inventory writedown, which it blamed on having recently purchased homes for prices that are higher than it thinks it can sell them.Elsewhere online, Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has come under scrutiny for tweaking its algorithms in a way that helped incentivize more negative content on the world's largest social network.There have been life-changing consequences of algorithms, too, particularly in the hands of police. We know, for instance, that several Black men, at least, have been wrongfully arrested due to the use of facial-recognition systems.There's often little more than a basic explanation from tech companies on how their algorithmic systems work and what they're used for. Beyond that, experts in technology and tech law told CNN Business that even those who build these systems don't always know why they reach their conclusions — which is a reason why they're often referred to as ""black boxes.""""Computer scientists, data scientists, at this current stage they seem like wizards to a lot of people because we don't understand what it is they do,"" Gilliard said. ""And we think they always do, and that's not always the case.""Popping filter bubblesThe United States doesn't have federal rules for how companies can or can't use algorithms in general, or those that harness AI in particular. (Some states and cities have passed their own rules, which tend to address facial-recognition software or biometrics more generally.) But Congress is currently considering legislation dubbed the Filter Bubble Transparency Act, which, if passed, would force large Internet companies such as Google, Meta, TikTok and others to ""give users the option to engage with a platform without being manipulated by algorithms driven by user-specific data"".In a recent CNN Opinion piece, Republican Sen. John Thune described the legislation he cosponsored as ""a bill that would essentially create a light switch for big tech's secret algorithms — artificial intelligence (AI) that's designed to shape and manipulate users' experiences — and give consumers the choice to flip it on or off."" Facebook, for example, does already have this, though users are effectively discouraged from flipping the so-called switch permanently. A fairly well-hidden ""Most Recent"" button will show you posts in a reverse chronological order, but your Facebook News Feed will go back to its original, heavily moderated state once you leave the website or shut the app. Meta stopped offering such an option on Instagram, which it also owns, in 2016.Hutson noted that while the Filter Bubble Transparency Act clearly focuses on large social platforms, it will inevitably affect others such as Spotify and Netflix that depend deeply on algorithmically-driven curation. If it passes, he said, it will ""fundamentally change"" the business model of companies that are built entirely around algorithmic curation — a feature he suspects many users appreciate in certain contexts.""This is going to impact organizations far beyond those that are in the spotlight,"" he said. AI experts argue the need for more transparency is crucial from companies making and using algorithms. Luccioni believes laws for algorithmic transparency are necessary before specific usages and applications of AI can be regulated.""I see things changing, definitely, but there is a really frustrating lag between what AI is capable of and what it's legislated for,"" Luccioni said.",2
96,"San Jose, California (CNN Business)Journalist Roger Parloff, who wrote the first major cover story on Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes and later issued a retraction, was called to testify in her criminal trial Thursday.The government has alleged Holmes used the media, and Parloff's Fortune Magazine story titled ""This CEO is Out for Blood"" in particular, to perpetuate a scheme to defraud investors.Parloff's testimony comes as the government has said it is close to resting its case against Holmes. She faces a dozen counts of federal fraud and conspiracy charges, and up to 20 years in prison over allegations that she knowingly misled doctors, patients and investors in order to take their money. Holmes has pleaded not guilty.Parloff is set to return to the stand Friday for continued cross-examination. Thus far the defense has focused on Parloff's note taking and reporting process.Holmes was for a time upheld in the media as a rare female founder who'd raised significant sums of capital and driven her startup to an eye-popping $9 billion valuation. Parloff's story was the first of many laudatory cover stories of Holmes and has been shown repeatedly in the San Jose courtroom. Through Parloff's testimony, the government pieced together various layers of the alleged fraud that it has spent more than 10 weeks establishing before jurors through witness testimonies. Parloff testified he has interview notes, as well as 10 hours of audio recordings from interviews associated with his 2014 Fortune story, clips of which have been played for the jury. The recordings contrast how Holmes represented the company's capabilities with what jurors have heard from other witness testimonies. In one recording, Holmes explains that the company can do tests for 1,000 ""CPT"" or medical codes, despite its website stating 200 tests. Jurors have previously heard Theranos could only perform around a dozen tests using its proprietary technology, one of the numerous points prosecutor John Bostic sought to highlight through questioning Parloff about what Holmes told him in his interviews.Parloff said Holmes did not tell him about Theranos' reliance on third-party devices. When Parloff asked Holmes about use of venous draws instead of its finger stick method, Holmes is heard ticking off a list of reasons why it may conduct such a sample, but does not disclose, as Bostic elicited, it is because of the limitations of Theranos' devices.Parloff testified that Holmes told him that its tech had been used in Afghanistan, but that ""she did not want me to publish that."" While Parloff interviewed James Mattis, the former US Secretary of Defense and onetime Theranos board member, he testified Holmes told him the retired four-star general couldn't discuss deployment and not to ask him about it.During his reporting, Holmes sent Parloff the reports, affixed with Pfizer and Schering-Plough logos, purporting to validate its blood tests, which jurors have learned were not legitimate. Parloff testified that after the article's publication, Holmes ""praised it effusively,"" and said he believed she linked to it on Theranos' website. The article, which contained false and misleading statements, circulated to stakeholders and how it played a role in validating the company to outsiders.""This morning I had one of the most interesting meetings I can recall with the women [sic] profiled in the attached Fortune magazine article,"" read one email shown to jurors from the CEO of RDV Corp, the family office of the billionaire family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The email was sent to members of the DeVos family before they invested $100 million into Theranos.Investor Chris Lucas, whose firm Black Diamond Ventures invested more than $7 million across two funding rounds in 2006 and 2013, testified earlier this month that the piece made him ""proud of the situation. Proud that we are involved. Proud of Elizabeth."" ""Great article, great pictures, the whole thing,"" testified Lucas.In a column more than a year later titled ""How Theranos Misled Me,"" Parloff acknowledged that the article ""helped raise to prominence"" Holmes. (There is now an author's note at the top of his original article that links to the column and reads, ""On December 17, 2015, I published a protracted correction to this article here."")""As much as I'd like to say that Holmes lied to me, I don't think she did. I do believe I was misled — intentionally — but I was also culpable, in that I failed to probe certain exasperatingly opaque answers that I repeatedly received,"" wrote Parloff, who was formerly an attorney.The government said in a court filing that it will not seek to admit the follow-up column but ""reserves the right to introduce that article for a non-hearsay purpose should the defense open the door by questioning Parloff about statements he made in that article.""For weeks, attorneys have been wrangling over what Parloff can testify to, and what information he can be compelled to provide. While Parloff has turned over audio recordings and notes from his interviews with Holmes and former Theranos COO Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani as part of a grand jury subpoena order, he successfully fought a trial subpoena order by Holmes' defense team for notes and recordings from interviews he conducted with others for his story. (Balwani faces the same charges as Holmes; his criminal trial is slated to begin next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.)Holmes' attorneys argued those notes may serve to refute the claims that Holmes misled Parloff, and through him, investors. Judge Nathanael Cousins, who presided in a hearing on the matter, called the quest for Parloff's additional notes ""a fishing expedition as to whether there might be material out there that could be helpful to the defense.""Parloff's remorse over the story has been well-documented. ""Roger was first [to the story] and felt a tremendous amount of guilt,"" said Alex Gibney in 2019. Gibney is the prolific documentary filmmaker whose HBO film, ""The Inventor,"" chronicled the rise and fall of Theranos. Gibney, who has said his work started with interviewing journalists who felt duped, has called Parloff the ""beating heart"" of his film. (CNN and HBO share a parent company.)In addition to Parloff's article, a 2013 piece by a Wall Street Journal opinion writer, who has since passed away, has been frequently brought up in the courtroom. The government has alleged that, prior to its publication, Holmes approved the piece, which offered a glowing look at Holmes and Theranos, but also contained misleading claims about the company's capabilities at the time. The article corresponded with a broader unveiling of the startup after years of operating in stealth and was leveraged by Holmes as validation of the company.In a statement to CNN Business in September, Journal spokesperson Steve Severinghaus said, ""editors make publishing decisions based on their independent judgment.""The statement continued, ""Our writer asked Elizabeth Holmes to confirm complicated facts on a technical subject, not to approve publication. Our writer visited Theranos, spoke with numerous sources in and outside the company about its technology, and had his blood tested on a Theranos machine that appeared to offer credible results. If that was all a deception, then the responsibility lies with Ms. Holmes and Theranos.""",2
97,"New York (CNN Business)A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general have launched an investigation into Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on children and teens.  The announcement follows extensive reporting on a trove of internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Some of those documents show that the company's own researchers have found that Instagram can damage young users' mental health and body image, and can exacerbate dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders.  The attorneys general say they will look into whether, by continuing to provide and promote Instagram despite knowing of the potential harms, Meta violated consumer protection laws and ""put the public at risk."" The states involved include California, Florida, Kentucky and Vermont. ""Facebook, now Meta, has failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health -- exploiting children in the interest of profit,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigation, said in a statement. She added that the coalition hopes to ""get to the bottom of this company's engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good."" Meta (FB) spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement that the allegations made by the attorneys general are false and said they ""demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts."" He also noted that the company plans to launch features to help teens regulate their use of Instagram, such as a ""Take a Break"" reminder, which was announced in October amid intense scrutiny.  ""While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,"" the statement reads. ""We continue to develop parental supervision controls and are exploring ways to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for teens by default."" The investigation is the latest escalation of regulatory pressure on Meta related to findings from the leaked internal documents, which have come to be known as the Facebook Papers. Earlier this week, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that it misled the public about its algorithm and the harms its apps can cause to users, causing losses for shareholders when those things were revealed. (Meta says the suit is without merit.) Senator Richard Blumenthal has also asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about the effects of Instagram on children. The Wall Street Journal first reported in September on what the company's own documents and research show about the potential harms to young people from its apps, and said Facebook knew Instagram was ""toxic"" for teen girls. In one internal report from 2019 on the mental health effects of Instagram cited by the Journal and reviewed by CNN Business, company researchers said ""we make body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teen girls."" Meta has also pushed back on the Journal's reporting, and said its apps do more good than harm.  Following the Journal's report, a Senate subcommittee called a hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone Davis, where lawmakers grilled her on Instagram's effects on kids. Davis said the company was ""looking for ways to release more research"" that she suggested might paint a different picture about the platform. Haugen has also testified to lawmakers that she believes Meta's platforms ""harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.""  The company announced it was pausing plans to develop a version of Instagram designed for kids in late September, amid the fallout from the Journal report.  ""While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we've decided to pause this project,"" Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote in a blog post at the time. ""This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.""

98," (CNN Business)Activision Blizzard's longtime CEO Bobby Kotick is facing mounting pressure from employees to step down amid the company's ongoing sexual harassment scandal.More than 800 Activision Blizzard workers so far have signed a petition calling for Kotick's resignation. The petition, released on Thursday by a group of employees, says they ""no longer have confidence"" in Kotick's leadership. ""We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders,"" the petition added.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) — which owns hugely popular titles such as ""Call of Duty,"" ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Candy Crush"" — has been roiled by a sexual harassment and discrimination scandal for months and is currently under scrutiny from multiple government agencies.An Activision Blizzard spokesperson said in response to the petition that the company was ""fully committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and rewarding environment"" for its 9,500 employees worldwide. ""We support employees' rights to express their opinions and concerns in a safe and respectful manner, without fear of retaliation,"" the spokesperson added. The petition comes two days after more than 100 employees organized a walkout demanding Kotick step down. That walkout, the company's second in less than six months, came in response to a Wall Street Journal investigation indicating the CEO was aware of the company's harassment and discrimination issues for several years. The report cited internal company documents and people familiar with the matter. Kotick said in a statement to employees that the Journal story ""paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership."" He added that ""anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn't really appreciate how important this is to me.""While the report prompted renewed tension with some employees, Activision Blizzard's board of directors has so far stuck by Kotick. ""The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick's leadership, commitment and ability"" to address the company's longstanding and ongoing issues with harassment and discrimination, it said in a statement Tuesday.Kotick, who has been Activision CEO since 1991, including at the time of the 2008 merger with Blizzard, has been in damage control mode for most of this year.Last month, he announced an intention to slash his controversial $155 million pay package — one of the largest in corporate America — to the ""lowest amount California law will allow"" until the gaming company fixes its issues with gender discrimination and harassment. If the board approves, Kotick will be paid $62,500, he said.",2
99,"Seoul (CNN Business)Tim Sweeney is on a mission. The Epic Games CEO has been mounting a relentless attack on Apple, after the tech giant kicked his company's hugely popular video game Fortnite off the App Store. Apple said at the time that Epic flouted rules on digital payments by establishing its own system.Epic sued Apple in response, kicking off a highly public trial. Apple has argued that its rigid payments system exists to protect the security and privacy of its developers and customers, and that it's only a small part of the video game market — and therefore has no monopoly. Sweeney sees things differently. Companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL), he argues, wield enormous power over the app market. Their control prevents consumers and companies from choosing how they do business.The case is still working its way through US courts, but in September a judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside its App Store. Still, the judge stopped short of calling Apple a monopoly, and the company has barred Fortnite from its devices until the legal battle finishes, which could delay the game's return to iPhones by several years.CNN Business caught up with Sweeney in Seoul, where he was attending the Global Conference for Mobile Application Ecosystem Fairness — an event hosted by South Korean lawmaker Jo Seounglae. The country recently enacted a law that allows app developers to use alternative payment systems. We asked Sweeney questions about that law, as well as his ongoing fight with Apple, Fortnite's failed foray into China and his thoughts on the ""metaverse,"" the virtual world Facebook (FB) sees as its future. Our Q&A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.South Korea recently passed a bill banning mandatory in-app purchases and ordering tech companies to allow alternative payments. What did you think?I was very happy to see that Korea was taking the leadership role, initially. Korea is one of the leading technology powerhouses in the world, with Samsung (SSNLF) and all the great game developers around Korea. It's great to see Korea really defending developers, including all the Korean developers against these bad practices [by] Apple and Google. How much business and revenue has Epic Games lost as a result of getting kicked off Apple's ecosystem?Fortnite had made hundreds of millions of dollars, and with Fortnite being off of iOS, it's losing that much now. But fortunately, Fortnite is also successful on personal computers and game consoles. So the business continues to be strong, despite being off of iOS. But it just shows how much power Apple wields and is able to completely eliminate a game's existence on iOS. No platform company should have that power, right? Consumers should be free to install software. And developers should be free to create software, and the platform company should never stand in between them.Do you have any regrets about how the legal battles with Apple and Google have played out?We always knew it would be a slow and complex case. Both Apple and Epic realized from the beginning that whatever happened within the District Court ... the decision would be appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court in the United States, and, if possible, to the United States Supreme Court, to ultimately make the decision. And so, it was inevitable that this would take many years.Do you have anything to say to the people who have influence over this issue in the United States? Ultimately, this is a battle for consumer rights. Though the disputes are mostly between companies and governments, it's about the right of a smartphone owner to be able to install software from sources of their choosing, and to do business directly with developers without the platform company adding taxes and fees to every transaction. ... It's about the basic freedom of everybody to do business together directly if they choose. I think it's the most important fight for digital rights in the industry right now. Because more and more of our lives are moving online and becoming digital — all of our digital interactions are increasingly controlled by Google and Apple. If we allow the world's two most powerful corporations to control our online lives, it'll become a force that's more powerful than the government itself.Epic spent a long time working on Fortnite's launch in China, but it didn't happen. Was that time and effort worth it?I'm glad we tried. There's always been a lot of uncertainty about the future of US-China relations, and unfortunately, they've been strained for the past few years. And we just didn't see a realistic likelihood of being able to receive approval to launch in China. So we gave up trying, but I think it was a good effort.The team did a wonderful job, and I wish there had been a way, but I think there's just going to be a long period in which there's a separation between consumer services inside China and globally.What is the ""metaverse"" to you?It is real time 3D entertainment experiences that are social. It's you and your friends together in a 3D world, having fun in lots of different ways. You can be playing games like Fortnite Battle Royale, you can be going to concerts, you can be dancing, or you can just be standing around and chatting. It's all the sorts of social interactions we can have in real time 3D together with our group of friends.What kind of future do you envision in the metaverse? Is it really going to be a game changer, like the internet was when it was introduced?I think it will take a decade or more to really get to the end point, but I think that is happening. And it will be a better online experience than we're having today. It will succeed because it's better. The metaverse doesn't require fancy new hardware. It doesn't require all that reality hardware or [virtual reality] or things that haven't been invented yet. You can get online and start experiencing this right now.The next step of this metaverse evolution is to open up broader experiences to bring in the next billion users.What are some of the biggest hurdles to making it happen?The metaverse isn't going to be created by one company. It will be created by millions of developers each building out their part of it.Another challenge is building the economy. In order to have millions of developers building for the metaverse, you need to have a business where they can make as much or more money from that effort, developing software to support their businesses.We need to win the fight against platform monopolies, because Apple and Google currently have rules in place to prevent the metaverse from existing on the Google Play Store and on iOS. They have rules that prevent web browsers from existing — you're only allowed to use their web browser.They don't allow commerce to be done directly with users. They don't allow code to be run on your local device if it hasn't been reviewed by Apple and Google. The metaverse needs to support all of these things, so we really need to win this battle to open up platforms before the metaverse can truly exist.-- Rishi Iyengar and Jill Disis contributed to this report.",2
100,"New York (CNN Business)The director of the United Nations' World Food Programme laid out a plan to spend $6.6 billion to combat world hunger — a direct response to a back-and-forth with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who claimed he would sell Tesla stock to fund a plan if the WFP could describe ""exactly how"" it would work. David Beasley, the UN food program director and former Republican governor of South Carolina, tweeted a link on Monday to a 1,000-word ""executive summary."" It maps out how the UN would deploy $6.6 billion worth of meals and vouchers to feed more than 40 million people across 43 countries that are ""on the brink of famine"" — thereby averting what the WFP is calling a looming ""catastrophe.""In the document Beasley posted, the WFP proposes dedicating $3.5 billion to buy and deliver food directly, $2 billion ""for cash and food vouchers (including transaction fees) in places where markets can function,"" and spending another $700 million to manage new food programs that are ""adapted to the in-country"" conditions and ensure ""the assistance reaches the most vulnerable.""Another $400 million would be used for ""operations management, administration and accountability"" and supply chain coordination. ""The world is on fire,"" Beasley wrote. ""I've been warning about the perfect storm brewing due to Covid, conflict, climate shocks & now, rising supply chain costs. IT IS HERE."" ""This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable,"" Beasley wrote in a separate tweet, tagging Musk, who is the world's wealthiest person with a net worth of approximately $288 billion. ""You asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you - and anyone else - who is serious about saving lives.""As of Wednesday afternoon, Musk had not responded.The back-and-forth between Musk and Beasley kicked off with a CNN interview last month in which Beasley asked billionaires to ""step up now, on a one-time basis"" to help combat world hunger, specifically citing the world's two richest men: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.Beasley said giving $6 billion, or 2% of Musk's net worth, could help solve world hunger. Musk responded on Twitter, writing, ""If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it."" ""But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent,"" Musk added.Beasley previously replied to Musk's tweets, assuring him that systems are in place for transparency and open source accounting.""For him to even enter into this conversation is a game-changer because simply put, we can answer his questions, we can put forth a plan that's clear,"" Beasley told CNN in a follow-up interview earlier this month. ""Any and everything he asks, we would be glad to answer. I look forward to having this discussion with him because lives are at stake.""Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the world's hunger crisis was already exacerbated by climate change and conflict. The pandemic compounded the existing issues though, leaving ""42 million people that are literally knocking on famine's door,"" Beasley said. ""This is a worst-case scenario."" It's not clear if Musk or Bezos have seen the plan and will ultimately decide to lend their support. Spokespeople for Musk's companies did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for Bezos, Angela Landers, declined to comment on the WFP's proposal but pointed to other philanthropic donations Bezos has made to combating hunger.Musk has previously made bold promises on Twitter, committing resources to charitable endeavors. In 2018, for example, he pledged to ""fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels."" Musk ended up donating about half a million dollars for installing water filters in the town's schools, according to an August article from a local news outlet. Musk has made more sizable donations to certain projects. This year, he promised to donate $30 million to Brownsville, Texas, the city nearest to a massive rocket hub run by his company SpaceX, and local schools. He also set up the Musk Foundation, which says it gives to efforts related to renewable energy expansion, human space exploration and safe uses of artificial intelligence. He's also signed The Giving Pledge, a promise to donate at least half of his wealth to charitable efforts during his lifetime, something Bezos has not done.",2
101," (CNN)The hesitancy of many people to get a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday.""Those who are vaccine hesitant have had their hesitancy enhanced by a variety of things that are happening right now, particularly the unfortunate mix of science and politics,"" Collins said at an event hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than half of respondents -- 54% -- said they would not get the vaccine if it was available for free before the November 3 presidential election. Along party lines, 60% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they would not. Half of Democrats said they would. ""I don't want to have us, a year from now, having a conversation about how we have in our hands the solution to the worst pandemic of more than 100 years, but we haven't been able to actually convince people to take charge of it,"" Collins said.People need to understand that if not enough people get vaccinated, a vaccine won't help reduce the spread of the virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.""It's a combination of how effective a vaccine is and how many people use it,"" he said. ""If you have a vaccine that is highly effective and not enough people get vaccinated, you're not going to realize the full, important effect of having a vaccine.""The less protective a vaccine is, the more people need to get it to provide population-wide immunity, Fauci said.President Donald Trump has said a vaccine could be available before the election November 3, and on Wednesday he said a vaccine could be released by mid-October. Fauci said he still thinks it will be the final months of the year before a vaccine is proven to be safe and effective.''I would still put my money on November/December,"" Fauci said during a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute panel on global pandemics.The CDC head gave a timeline. The President disputed itThe timeline for a Covid vaccine became a major headline Wednesday, when Trump challenged assertions by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Dr. Robert Redfield said earlier that a ""very limited supply"" of a vaccine might be ready in November or December, but it would have to be prioritized for first responders and those at greatest risk for death.""If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at third, late second quarter, third quarter 2021,"" Redfield told a Senate appropriations subcommittee.On top of that, ""in order to have enough of us immunized so we have immunity, I think it's going to take us six to nine months,"" he said.In the meantime, ""These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,"" Redfield said, holding up a blue face mask, adding that masks may offer more protection than a vaccine. Trump said Redfield was ""confused"" in his testimony. ""I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information,"" Trump said about Redfield's vaccine timeline.The President also said Redfield's comments to Congress about masks possibly being more effective than a vaccine were incorrect and that Redfield may have misunderstood the question.""Maybe he misunderstood it,"" Trump said, later adding, ""As far as the masks are concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks.""A CDC spokesman said in a statement that Redfield was answering a question he thought was in regard to the time period in which all Americans would have completed their Covid vaccination, and his estimate was by the second or third quarter of 2021.""He was not referring to the time period when Covid-19 vaccine doses would be made available to all Americans,"" the spokesman said.In a later statement, Redfield said that he believes in the ""importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a Covid-19 vaccine.""Distrust is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spreadDistrust in government agencies is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,"" he said during an American Public Health Association webinar.Surveillance helps public health officials by collecting information on infected people, such as where they were exposed and who they've been in contact with, and the course of their illness. Fauci said the variability in how the coronavirus affects people has helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.""One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently... propagating the outbreak..."" Fauci said during a virtual panel sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Fauci said he has ""never seen anything with a range"" like this virus.""It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,"" he said.7 coronavirus deaths are linked to 1 weddingA wedding in Maine is linked to 176 Covid-19 cases and the deaths of seven people who didn't attend the celebration -- showing just how easily and quickly coronavirus can spread at social gatherings, public health experts say.  For months, doctors have stressed the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. But outbreaks have stemmed from Memorial Day events, Fourth of July celebrations and a massive motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.The wedding in Millinocket on August 7 had about 65 guests, a violation of the state's 50-person limit for indoor events, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.The event is linked to outbreaks that have unfolded at a nursing home and a jail, both more than 100 miles away from the wedding venue, among people who had only secondary or tertiary contact with an attendee. Residents at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center accounted for 39 cases tied to the wedding and six of the seven deaths thus far, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said.""The virus favors gatherings,"" Shah added. ""It does not distinguish between happy events like a wedding celebration, or sad farewells, like a funeral.""Despite such somber warnings, about 1,500 people descended on a New Jersey boardwalk house featured in MTV's ""Jersey Shore"" on Monday night, ending in eight arrests, Seaside Heights police said. The event was organized by a group of YouTube pranksters, according to Seaside Heights Police Detective Steve Korman, and officials say they are now worried about how they will track possible infections among more than a thousand people.Universities try to get ahead of outbreaksOutbreaks keep cropping up at colleges and universities, prompting some to go to virtual learning again. More than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at colleges and universities in all 50 states. Citing a significant rise in cases among students, the University of Colorado Boulder announced a 14-day quarantine period for students living within the city.The University of Arizona is taking a similar approach, urging students to shelter in place until the end of the month after a large number of positive cases. The university reported 261 positive cases on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard.At the University of Missouri, two students were expelled and three were suspended for violating rules that require students who test positive to isolate and comply with social distancing.""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable. We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students,"" the university said in a statement Tuesday.",2
102," (CNN)President Donald Trump knew back in the spring that it would probably take a year to develop a coronavirus vaccine, according to interviews with journalist Bob Woodward.Trump also suggests that's why he initially pushed so hard for the use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, because the malaria drug had already been tested and approved for other uses.""Well, we're doing great on vaccines,"" Woodward quotes Trump as saying in his latest book, ""Rage.""""The problem with a vaccine is a vaccine will take 13 to 14 months once you have it. Because you have to test a vaccine. As opposed to the hydroxy, you have to test it. Because the hydroxy's been there for 25 years.""Hydroxychloroquine was indeed an approved drug, but it had never been tested in people with coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration gave hydroxychloroquine emergency use approval but later rescinded it after several studies showed the drug did not help patients were coronavirus and might be harmful.Trump heavily promoted hydroxychloroquine for months but after the FDA rescinded the EUA, began talking about development of a vaccine. He has repeatedly said he believes a vaccine could be approved before the Nov. 3 election.His interviews with Woodward -- also recorded on audiotapes -- show he was briefed on the timetable for a coronavirus vaccine. The US government had been working with vaccine makers, including Moderna Inc, and Johnson & Johnson, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The new vaccines are made using pieces of genetic material and researchers started testing the first vaccines in human clinical trials in March.""We probably already have the vaccine,"" Trump said on April 13, according to the book. ""You know the biggest problem though? You have to test it, so you have to make sure it kills the virus, but you've got to make sure it doesn't kill the person. Can you imagine? You vaccinate a hundred million people and you find out it's poison, right?""Administration officials have told CNN that in meetings focused on vaccine development throughout the spring and summer, Trump consistently pressed officials to speed up the timeline for developing a vaccine, and the President appeared intent on being able to deliver at least the solid promise of an effective vaccine by the time he faces reelection.Those efforts have scaled up as Election Day nears, and Trump has repeatedly complained that some officials at federal health agencies are actively working to stymie his reelection chances by slow-walking announcements.""It will be delivered before the end of the year, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October,"" Trump said about a vaccine at a rally this month. ""How do you like that? Wouldn't that be nice? And you know why? Not because of the election. It'd be nice because we want to save people.""Trump's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has denied there's pressure on the FDA ""to do anything.""",2
103," (CNN)President Donald Trump has defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic many times before, but on Tuesday he faced his most threatening critics yet — undecided voters.A version of this story appeared in the September 16 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.At an ABC town hall in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, the President hit back at a question over his remarks to renowned journalist Bob Woodward that he deliberately downplayed the threat of the virus, despite knowing the risks.""Well I didn't downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it in terms of action,"" he claimed in response to a question at the town hall. He pointed to his government's travel bans on China and Europe as examples of ""very strong"" action.It was an invitation to the audience to refuse to believe their own ears, as Stephen Collinson writes. Trump repeatedly told Americans the virus would ""just disappear,"" and he privately told Woodward in mid-March: ""I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.""Trump and the White House have been widely criticized for flouting government guidelines designed to limit the transmission of Covid-19, including social distancing and wearing a mask. On Tuesday, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain at the White House to sign normalization agreements between Israel and the two Arab countries. None of the officials wore masks, and after the meetings, a large crowd sat shoulder-to-shoulder outside to watch the leaders sign the agreements. YOU ASKED.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYChildren from ethnic-minority groups hit harderA new report confirms that while deaths in kids infected with Covid-19 are very rare, children and teens from ethnic-minority groups are disproportionately impacted. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly report Tuesday that while Hispanic, Black, Native American and Asian or Pacific people represented 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age group.If rich countries get the vaccine first, twice as many people will die: studyNew modelling from Northeastern University shows that a coordinated vaccine response that provides countries with a number of doses proportionate to their population will save twice as many lives than if rich countries were prioritized.If the vaccine is distributed based on population numbers, it could avert 61% of global deaths. But if higher numbers of doses are given to wealthier countries, just 33% of deaths could be prevented. The US and China are among nations that have not joined an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine ahead of a deadline on Friday.It may be 2022 before we can start thinking about 'normal life' againThat's the stark warning from the World Health Organization's chief science officer, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, who said there needs to be  60% to 70% of the population with immunity before a dramatic reduction in viral transmission is realistic. ""We're looking at 2022 at least before enough people start getting the vaccine to build immunity.""A WHO special envoy, David Nabarro, also warned that the pandemic has just begun. ""This is really serious -- we're not even in the middle of it yet,"" he told British lawmakers. ""And it's getting nastier as we go into this particular phase in Europe of watching the thing come back again.""ON OUR RADARCountries heading into winter will have to choose between having bars and nightclubs open, or schools in session, the WHO has warned.France appears to be entering its second wave of Covid-19, and doctors at one hospital in Bordeaux say this one is going to be a marathon.India topped 5 million coronavirus cases Wednesday, after confirming 1 million new infections in just 11 days.Top spokesperson for the US Department of Health, Michael Caputo, has apologized after a scathing rant in which he accused government scientists of ""sedition"" in their coronavirus responses.Covid-19 may have circulated in the US as early as December, about a month earlier than widely believed, according to UCLA researchers. TODAY'S TOP TIPIn times of stress, we often turn to comforting sugary indulgences. Cutting sugar comes down to knowing how much is in what you eat and drink. A committee on dietary guidelines in the US has recommended that adults limit their sugar intake to around 6 teaspoons a day — less than a can of soda, or around two-and-a-half choc chip cookies.

104,"Bordeaux, France (CNN)Dealing with the first wave was like a sprint, the second will be more like a marathon.That's how Dr. Olivier Joannes-Boyau, head of the intensive care unit at University Hospital in the southwestern city of Bordeaux, describes the resurgence of Covid-19 in France. After young French people took advantage of the lifting of lockdown and summer months to socialize freely, Covid-19 hospitalizations have risen in large cities like Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille on the Mediterranean coast. French hospitals are now preparing for the long slog.The last time University Hospital dealt with a rise in Covid-19 cases, it put aside all other emergency procedures to deal the crisis. This time, it is trying to keep the rest of its services going too. Just like the wider country, it is adapting to a virus that looks like it is here to stay.Hospital staff are more experienced than they were when the coronavirus first swept through France, and Bordeaux University Hospital is now armed with steroids to reduce Covid-19 symptoms and improved ventilators, both of which can reduce intubation rates.But juggling the swelling number of Covid-19 patients alongside those with other conditions will be difficult, says Dr. Catherine Fleureau, the hospital's director. ""It's also going to be harder than last time, because this wave, I think, will grow progressively and then last over time.""Earlier this year, the first coronavirus wave spiked fast, but was cut short by a strict nationwide lockdown. In total more than 31,000 people died from the disease in France, out of over 433,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Now, the number of new cases is rising fast. A record was set over the weekend with more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. The number of clusters has been rising steadily and, most worryingly, nationwide, the number of people in intensive care has risen 25% in the past week. That number is still 10 times lower than they it was in the spring but it is a worrying trend; like in the spring it will be about how fast the numbers move upwards.The French government is determined to avoid a second general lockdown that could cripple its economy, so is tasking local authorities with responsibility for reducing the virus's spread.In response, Bordeaux and Marseille have tightened their Covid-19 regulations, extending the places where masks must be worn, limiting the size of public gatherings and hardening enforcement. More checks are to be carried out to ensure that Covid-19 regulations are being respected.In Bordeaux, the plan announced by regional officials includes a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in public parks, along the river banks and on beaches. In cafes and restaurants clients will no longer be able to eat and drink while standing up. In both cities regional officials lowered the number of people allowed to gather for large events to 1,000 from 5,000 previously, resulting in the cancellation of sporting fixtures.And just since the start of the school year, 81 schools and 2,100 classes have had to close due to Covid cases. Minister for Education Jean-Michel Blanquer also said Wednesday 1,200 new infections among students had been recorded, compared to last week. The success of these measures will dictate the number of patients that ultimately reach doctors like Dr. Joannes-Boyau. ""The major problem will be to keep the wave, really low,"" he says. ""Because if this wave grows a lot, we will face a large number of patients with Covid-19 that will come and we will not able to treat them.""It's too early to judge whether local restrictions can keep the coming wave manageable, but his intensive care unit is already nearing capacity, with 33 of the 35 available ICU beds occupied on Wednesday. As Joannes-Boyau says, it takes about three weeks for any change in the state of a population's health to be measurable. Now the city is braced to see if it has the endurance to last the marathon.An earlier version of this story incorrectly understated the number of ICU beds that were occupied in Bordeaux on Wednesday. It was 33.",2
105," (CNN)The deadly coronavirus may have circulated in the United States as early as December, about a month earlier than believed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to researchers with UCLA.Their study, published last Thursday in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, found a statistically significant increase in clinic and hospital visits by patients who reported respiratory illnesses as early as the week of December 22.The first known case of Covid-19 in the US was thought to be a patient in Washington who had visited Wuhan, China, according to the CDC. The case was reported in January. Dr. Joann Elmore and colleagues looked through nearly 10 million medical records from the UCLA Health system, including three hospitals and 180 clinics. Elmore said she started the search after receiving a number of emails from anxious patients in March through her clinic's patient portal at UCLA. Patients kept asking if the cough they had in January could have been Covid-19.""With the outpatients, I found a 50% increase in the percentage of patients coming in complaining of a cough. It came out to over 1,000 extra patients above the average of what we would typically see,"" Elmore told CNN.  The number of patient visits to the ER for respiratory complaints, as well as the number of people hospitalized with acute respiratory failure between December 2019 and February 2020, were all up, compared to records from the past five years. The uptick in cases started in the final week of December. ""Some of these cases could have been due to the flu, some could be for other reasons, but to see these kinds of higher numbers even in the outpatient setting is notable,"" Elmore said.Elmore hopes the research shows that real-time data collected on diseases like this could potentially help public health experts identify and track emerging outbreaks much earlier and potentially slow or stop the spread of disease.Dr. Claudia Hoyen, an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center who did not work on the study, said she believes it's possible Covid-19 may have been in the US much sooner than first realized.But Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research, disagreed.""We know from the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that the pandemic started in late November / early December in China so there's absolutely no way the virus could have been spreading widely in December 2019. From the same genetic data we know that widespread transmission didn't start in the United States until (around)  February 2020,"" Andersen said in an email.""The paper is picking up spurious signals and the hospitalizations are more likely from flu or other respiratory diseases,"" Andersen wrote. Parties and virus concerns keep high schoolers from returning to class Overcrowded parties have forced several high schools to go back to online learning in hopes of staving off Covid-19 outbreaks.Two of those schools are in Massachusetts, which is reporting fewer cases than last week, and New York, which has maintained an infection rate less than 1% for 38 days. Although the states' numbers are promising, experts have warned that people attending large gatherings are a serious threat to managing the spread of the virus that has infected more than 6.5 million and killed 195,275 people in the US.Student parties have already sent colleges and universities scrambling to manage outbreaks, and now high school administrators are working to avoid the same. A crowded student party ""that involved alcohol and complete lack of safety precautions"" pushed Lincoln-Sudbury High School outside of Boston to go back to remote learning the first two weeks of school, a letter from the superintendent said. And Pelham High School in Westchester, New York, has extended online learning after two nights in a row of students partying in the woods, the school district announced.But students' social lives are not the only cause for concern. The president of the United Federation of Teachers said Monday that New York City is ""not making the grade"" when it comes to enacting the safety measures needed to reopen schools for in-person learning.Michael Mulgrew cited insufficient staffing and a two to three day delay in testing results as major roadblocks.""If you asked me if we are ready to open today, I would say we are not,"" he said. In New York City Public Schools, at least 422,190 students have requested the entirely remote learning option for the fall, according to data provided by the city's Department of Education -- a little over 40% of the more than 1 million students enrolled in the nation's largest public school system. Roughly 58% of students plan to return to school buildings as part of a hybrid learning model beginning next week, according to the department.Parents in the New York City public school system could opt out of the in-person hybrid plan since it was first announced. In August, Mayor Bill de Blasio said 74% of families had said they were planning to participate in in person learning at the time. The city's daily Covid-19 indicators are all under desired thresholds, de Blasio said Tuesday.Schools plan ahead for safe reopeningsAs several schools make last minute changes to their plans in response to parties, others are implementing systems ahead of time to respond to changes in the virus. Kentucky officials outlined a color-coded system Monday to help individual districts determine every week if they should continue with in-person learning based on coronavirus levels in their area. ""If you're in the red, it means there's widespread community spread of COVID-19, and if you're in the red it's not responsible -- it is not responsible -- to be doing every day in-person learning,"" Gov. Andy Beshear said.And though students in the Los Angeles Unified School District are still learning remotely, a ""report card"" will show the number of cases in each school as part of the district's testing and tracing endeavor, Superintendent Austin Beutner said. To address childcare concerns, about 3,000 children of essential workers will be able to return to school in groups of six after being tested for the virus, Beutner said. States cracking down on large gatheringsSome states are doing their part to curb the spread and limit the number of fall and winter infections by cracking down on large gatherings. Officials from New York City parks and New York University are patrolling Washington Square Park and encouraging personal protective equipment use after two back to back weekends of parties with NYU students. After the first weekend gathering, Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the city's police and the university officials for not taking firmer action to stop the parties. NYU has instructed all residents and employees the Rubin Hall dormitory to quarantine until at least Tuesday night after the diagnosis of six positive cases out of roughly 400 students living in the building, the university announced in its latest campus update.""Out of an abundance of caution, we are also retesting all residents of Rubin Hall (and employees, too), and instructed them on Saturday to begin quarantining until at least Tuesday night,"" the university said. NYU has reported a total of 65 cases since August 1, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard — an overall positivity rate of .19%. The school has reported 48 cases in the most recent 14-day period, a positivity rate of .31%.The University of Missouri in Columbia has expelled two students and suspended three others for violating the school's Covid-19 rules, including ""requirements that COVID positive individuals isolate and comply with social distancing requirements,"" the university said Tuesday. ""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable,"" Chancellor and UM System President Mun Choi said in a statement, without elaborating on their alleged actions.""We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students.""MU has referred roughly 470 students to the Office of Student Conduct for possible Covid-19 safety violations since August 16, and 11 student organizations are currently under investigation. MU has 332 active cases among students, according to the university dashboard -- down from 700 active cases earlier this month. The school has reported more than 1,300 cases since August 19. On Monday, the University of Arizona -- in accordance with the local county health department -- strongly urged students to shelter in place until September 30, following an increase in positive Covid-19 cases.Exceptions include obtaining food, attending work, seeking medical treatment and going outside where social distancing is possible. The school limited in-person instruction to ""essential courses"" only until September 27. The University of Arizona reported 261 positive Covid-19 tests on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard, and has seen roughly 1,400 cases since July 31.Pennsylvania appealing court ruling on large gatherings In the face of possible fall and winter resurgence, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's office is appealing a federal court ruling that keeps the state from banning certain types of large gatherings. The state has instituted measures against indoor gatherings of more than 25 people and outdoor events with more than 250 people to stop the spread of coronavirus.The action is used by many governors across the US, said Wolf's press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger, and continues to ""save lives in the absence of federal action.""Connecticut has also had ordinances in place to prohibit large gatherings and require face masks in the time of coronavirus, but now law enforcement will have the authority to impose fines to enforce them, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday.People not wearing masks can be fined $100. Organizers of large gatherings can be fined $500, with those attending fined $250, Lamont said.Despite the importance of masks to halting the spread, White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said a national mask mandate ""probably would not work.""Speaking at a news conference with Vermont Gov. Phil Scott on Tuesday, Fauci said, ""There is such a degree of variability of accepting mandates throughout the country.""Fauci said issues arise when a majority of the population in an area do not agree with the mandate -- and that begs the question: How do you enforce the mandate?Anything that puts an ""authoritative statement to the citizenry often is met with a considerable amount of pushback,"" he said. Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, said in Geneva that countries approaching winter will have to choose between having bars and nightclubs open or schools in session.""We have to sustain pressure on this virus, we have to reduce transmission at community level in order to lower the risk to those older and vulnerable people and to maintain an environment in which our children can continue to attend school,"" Ryan said at a briefing.""So, what is more important? Are children back at school? Are the nightclubs and the bars open?"" he said. ""I think these are decisions that we have to make in coming into the winter months."" ",2
106," (Kaiser Health News)The Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to follow British regulators in resuming a coronavirus vaccine trial that was halted when a participant suffered spinal cord damage, even as the National Institutes of Health has launched an investigation of the case.""The highest levels of NIH are very concerned,"" said Dr. Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director and a leader of viral research at the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an NIH division. ""Everyone's hopes are on a vaccine, and if you have a major complication the whole thing could get derailed.""A great deal of uncertainty remains about what happened to the unnamed patient, to the frustration of those avidly following the progress of vaccine testing. AstraZeneca, which is running the global trial of the vaccine it produced with Oxford University, said the trial volunteer recovered from a severe inflammation of the spinal cord and is no longer hospitalized.AstraZeneca has not confirmed that the patient was afflicted with transverse myelitis, but Nath and another neurologist said they understood this to be the case. Transverse myelitis produces a set of symptoms involving inflammation along the spinal cord that can cause pain, muscle weakness and paralysis. Britain's regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, reviewed the case and has allowed the trial to resume in the United Kingdom.AstraZeneca ""need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people,"" said Nath. ""We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so.""Any decision about whether to continue the trial is complex because it's difficult to assess the cause of a rare injury that occurs during a vaccine trial — and because scientists and authorities have to weigh the risk of uncommon side effects against a vaccine that might curb the pandemic.""So many factors go into these decisions,"" Nath said. ""I'm sure everything is on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt healthy people.""The NIH has yet to get tissue or blood samples from the British patient, and its investigation is ""in the planning stages,"" Nath said. U.S. scientists could look at samples from other vaccinated patients to see whether any of the antibodies they generated in response to the coronavirus also attack brain or spinal cord tissue.Such studies might take a month or two, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it would take before it decides whether to move forward.Dr. Jesse Goodman, a Georgetown University professor and physician who was chief scientist and lead vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency will review the data and possibly consult with British regulators before allowing resumption of the U.S. study, which had just begun when the injury was reported. Two other coronavirus vaccines are also in late-stage trials in the U.S.If it determines the injury in the British trial was caused by the vaccine, the FDA could pause the trial. If it allows it to resume, regulators and scientists surely will be on the watch for similar symptoms in other trial participants.A volunteer in an earlier phase of the AstraZeneca trial experienced a similar side effect, but investigators discovered she had multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccination, according to Dr. Elliot Frohman, director of the Multiple Sclerosis & Neuroimmunology Center at the University of Texas.Neurologists who study illnesses like transverse myelitis say they are rare — occurring at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250,000 people — and strike most often as a result of the body's immune response to a virus. Less frequently, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines.The precise cause of the disease is key to the decision by authorities whether to resume the trial. Sometimes an underlying medical condition is ""unmasked"" by a person's immune response to the vaccine, leading to illness, as happened with the MS patient. In that case, the trial might be continued without fear, because the illness was not specific to the vaccine.More worrisome is a phenomenon called ""molecular mimicry."" In such cases, some small piece of the vaccine may be similar to tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on that tissue in response to a vaccine component. Should that be the case, another occurrence of transverse myelitis would be likely if the trial resumed, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A second case would shut down the trial, he said.In 1976, a massive swine flu vaccination program was halted when doctors began diagnosing a similar disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, in people who received the vaccine. At the time no one knew how common GBS was, so it was difficult to tell whether the episodes were related to the vaccine.Eventually, scientists found that the vaccine increased the risk of the disorder by an additional one case among every 100,000 vaccinated patients. Typical seasonal flu vaccination raises the risk of GBS in about one additional case in every 1 million people.""It's very, very hard"" to determine if one rare event was caused by a vaccine, Schaffner said. ""How do you attribute an increased risk for something that occurs in one in a million people?""Before allowing U.S. trials to restart, the FDA will want to see why the company and an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) in the U.K. felt it was safe to continue, Goodman said. The AstraZeneca trial in the United States has a separate safety board.FDA officials will need to review full details of the case and may request more information about the affected study volunteer before deciding whether to allow the U.S. trial to continue, Goodman said. They may also require AstraZeneca to update the safety information it provides to study participants.It's possible that the volunteer's health problem was a coincidence unrelated to the vaccine, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Studies aren't usually stopped over a single health problem, even if it's serious.Yet many health leaders have expressed frustration that AstraZeneca hasn't released more information about the health problem that led it to halt its U.K. trial.""There is just so little information about this that it's impossible to understand what the diagnosis was or why the DSMB and sponsor were reassured"" that it was safe to continue, Goodman said.AstraZeneca has said it's unable to provide more information about the health problem, saying this would violate patient privacy, although it didn't say how.But there's an exceptional need for transparency in a political climate rife with vaccine hesitancy and mistrust of the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 response, leading scientists say.""While I respect the critical need for patient confidentiality, I think it would be really helpful to know what their assessment of these issues was,"" Goodman said. ""What was the diagnosis? If there wasn't a clear diagnosis, what is it that led them to feel the trial could be restarted? There is so much interest and potential concern about a COVID-19 vaccine that the more information that can be provided, the more reassuring that would be.""The FDA will need to balance any possible risks from an experimental vaccine with the danger posed by COVID-19, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.""There are also potential consequences if you stop a study,"" Goodman said.If the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the U.S. government is supporting six other COVID vaccines in the hope at least one will succeed. The potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine show this to be a wise investment, Adalja said.""This is part of the idea of not having just one vaccine candidate going forward,"" he said. ""It gives you a little more insurance.""Schaffner said researchers need to remember that vaccine research is unpredictable.""The investigators have inadvisedly been hyping their own vaccine,"" Schaffner said. ""The Oxford investigators were out there this summer saying, 'We're going to get there first.' But this is exactly the sort of reason ... Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and the rest of us have been saying, 'You never know what will happen once you get into large-scale human trials.'""",2
107," (CNN)Children and teens from minority groups are disproportionately hit by coronavirus, just as older adults are, according to the findings of a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children from ethnic and racial minorities, those with underlying health conditions and those between the ages of 18 and 20 are more likely to die, a CDC-led research team wrote in a study published Tuesday in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.  The report also showed just how unusual it is for children and young adults to die from coronavirus. Among the 190,000 deaths tallied in the country, only 0.08% -- or 121 -- were reported in those under 21. The most updated report from the CDC shows 377 children, teens and young adults aged up to 24 have died from coronavirus. The researchers asked 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands to submit information on coronavirus deaths in those under 21, between February 12 and July 31. Forty-seven jurisdictions responded. Among the approximately 6.5 million Covid-19 cases in the country, the researchers found a total of 391,814 cases of Covid-19 and MIS-C in those under 21. While people under 21 make up 26% of the US population, they make up only 8% of all reported cases.  Hispanics, Blacks and American Indian/Alaska Natives were disproportionately affected.  A total of 44% of the 121 who died were Hispanic children, 29% were Black children, 4% were American Indian/Alaska Natives and 4% were Asian or Pacific Islander. While these groups represent 41% of the US population under the age of 21, they accounted for approximately 75% of deaths in that age range. Fourteen percent of the deaths were in white children. ""Infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, particularly those from racial and ethnic minority groups at higher risk, those with underlying medical conditions, and their caregivers, need clear, consistent, and developmentally, linguistically, and culturally appropriate COVID-19 prevention messages,"" the researchers wrote. While 25% of the deaths were in previously healthy children, 75% had at least one underlying health condition and 45% had two or more. The most frequently reported medical conditions were chronic lung disease, including asthma; obesity; neurologic and developmental conditions and cardiovascular conditions.  The breakdown among the different age groups varied substantially, with those in the younger age groups doing better than adolescents and young adults. Approximately 10% of the deaths were in infants under the age of 1, an additional 9% were in children between 1 and 4, with another 11% in the 5-9 range and 10% in the 10-13 range. But almost 20% of the deaths were seen in teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 and more than 40% were in 18 to 20 year-olds.  This matches up somewhat with earlier CDC statistics that found 0 to 4-year-olds are four times less likely to be hospitalized and nine times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds, and 5 to 17-year-olds are nine times less likely to be hospitalized and 16 times less likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds.  Boys fared worse than girls: males accounted for 63% of the deaths compared with 37% for females.  Even though children are reassuringly less likely to get severely ill and die, they can still get infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, according to numerous studies.  For example, in one study published last week in the MMWR, researchers analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care facilities in Salt Lake County from April to July. They found at least two children who had no symptoms not only caught the virus, but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One eight-month-old baby infected both parents.  ""The infected children exposed at these three facilities had mild to no symptoms. Two of three asymptomatic children likely transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to their parents and possibly to their teachers,"" the researchers from the Salt Lake County Health Department wrote in their report. Another study out of South Korea analyzed data on 91 asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic children diagnosed with Covid-19 between February 18 and March 31 at 22 centers throughout that country. It found that 22% of the children were asymptomatic. The study was published at the end of August in JAMA Pediatrics. ""This highlights the concept that infected children may be more likely to go unnoticed either with or without symptoms and continue on with their usual activities, which may contribute to viral circulation within their community,"" wrote two doctors from Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, in an accompanying editorial.  The CDC researchers of the current study said it is important to keep a close eye on children infected with Covid-19. ""Although infants, children, and adolescents are more likely to have milder COVID-19 illness than are adults, complications, including MIS-C and respiratory failure, do occur in these populations. Persons infected with or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be followed closely so that clinical deterioration can be detected early,"" they wrote. ",2
108," (CNN)Eli Lipman, 9, and his father have been battling the impact of Covid-19 since March, and he said life as a ""long hauler"" isn't easy.""Kids, I'm sorry to say this, but it is a big deal. It will hurt,"" Eli told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday. ""You just got to face the truth: Sometimes you're not OK.""Eli and his father, Jonathan Lipman, are among a growing population of people who have been deemed ""long haulers"" -- people who are diagnosed with coronavirus and experience symptoms for months.Though research has found children face a small risk of severe illness from coronavirus.Eli described being achy, sore and tired. He said he felt like he ""got smashed into a wall.""But as fatigued as he is and as much as he wants to, Eli told Cuomo he can't sleep.""My body is just like 'nope,'"" Eli said.Lipman said doctors initially brushed Eli and his illnesses off many times. First in their diagnosis, then when their symptoms persisted and even when Eli's temperature stayed at a low-grade fever for months. ""No one would really believe us that we were still sick, and when you keep being not believed you stop believing yourself,"" Lipman said.Lipman is still fighting the symptoms, too. He said most mornings he wakes up with aches similar to when he broke his shoulder. He can't go up the stairs without gasping and can't even cook dinner for his family like he so enjoys doing, because he falls asleep.Dr. William Li, who is researching long-hauler patients, said that while there is still so much more to learn, the problem likely involves the blood vessels. ""One of the important things is to keep talking to your doctor, and doctors need to keep listening to your patients,"" Li said. ""There is really something unfolding before our eyes that we need before our eyes that we need to actually come together with our patients and with ourselves as researchers and as doctors to try to help heal.""Li recommended that, in addition to regular conversation with doctors, long haulers need to get as much sleep, movement and leafy greens as possible.",2
109," (CNN)Sibling rivalry is often taken as an unexamined fact of family life -- as much a part of parenting as potty training or bedtime stories.But experts say parents don't have to put up with the bickering and the fights: There are strategies and techniques to help brothers and sisters get along better, strengthening a relationship that will support them for life and make for a more harmonious home.Given the enforced proximity that is still a reality for many during the Covid-19 pandemic, a game plan to improve sibling relationships could be a lifesaver for struggling parents tired of snarled insults and hurled objects. ""It's been part of our culture, at least in the US, to think that siblings fight. That there's going to be lots of times they don't get along. That's what they do,"" said Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University in Boston.""When social lives are so restricted, families really see the value of encouraging their kids to be friends, in some respects, to be companions and playmates.""Unlike many of our relationships, we don't choose our siblings, and this makes for a unique dynamic. Brothers and sisters can withstand far more negativity and behavior that simply wouldn't fly among friends, Kramer said. That's one reason why sibling interactions are developmentally so important. These relationships allow children to try out new social and emotional behavior, particularly when it comes to conflict, helping them learn ways to manage emotions and develop awareness of other people's thoughts and feelings.""It's helpful for children to have experiences in a very safe relationship with a brother or sister where they can work through (conflict) and learn conflict management skills that they will be able to use in other relationships in their life,"" Kramer said.  ""Conflict can be very constructive and helpful. It helps children get a sense of who they are and their own identity.""It's worth parents spending some time to help their children get along since these are typically the longest-lasting of our close relationships. That shared history can be really important in a crisis.  So what steps should you take to help feuding siblings get along? Here are some ideas. One-on-one timeIt may sound counterintuitive, but scheduling regular one-on-one time with your children is a good first move. ""When you have one-on-one time there is no competition for your attention. There are no perceived winners and losers in this regard,"" said family therapist Jonathan Caspi, a professor in the department of family science and human development at Montclair State University in New Jersey.""There is the ability to praise and correct without the audience (and it having any meaning) for the other children. It's a freer relationship and one in which bonding and closeness can be developed without interference,"" he said via email.Another tip: While it's tempting to seize the moments they do get along to get things done, it's important to take a moment and praise siblings when they are cooperating and playing nicely -- parent the good behavior as well as the bad. Intervene or ignore?Tougher to deal with are the fights and knowing when to intervene or not. As a rule, Caspi said, it's better to ignore simple bickering. However, he stressed that physical violence and the name calling that often precedes it should be policed.""Since violence escalates incrementally in its severity, it is important that parents stop verbal violence before it becomes physical. Name calling is violence and opens the door for escalation into more severe violence.""""Do not allow your children to call each other curse words or negative terms like 'fat,' 'stupid,' 'icky,' etc.  While physical wounds heal, verbal ones can last a lifetime."" Children under the age of 8 don't usually have the skills to manage conflict, said Kramer, who encouraged parents to act as mediators or coaches to facilitate solving the problem at hand rather than serving as a referee. ""What happens when parents do nothing and don't intervene is that children can get the message that parents think what you're doing is OK. That it's all right to keep on at one another,"" she said.""We encourage parents to intervene to help children manage conflict on their own.""For example, Kramer suggested saying something along the following line: ""I'm hearing some scuffling. I'm hearing some conflict. I'd like for the two of you to work this out together. If you need some help, I'm down the hall but let's see what you can do on your own.""It was once thought that girls used more verbal aggression than boys, Caspi said, but research is suggesting that sisters are just as apt to use physical violence as much as brothers. ""The difference may be how severe the physical violence gets. Boys tend to do more damage, particularly when older,"" he said via email. ""It was also assumed that girls relied more on relational aggression (e.g., strategies to socially humiliate, isolating, injure reputation) than boys. However, there is evidence that brothers use this approach about the same too.""What not to doThe danger with intervening or involving yourself in children's disagreements is that it can backfire and fuel the fighting. Parents tend to intervene on behalf of the younger child, which builds more resentment in the older and empowers the younger to challenge the older more frequently, Caspi said. Avoid phrases like  ""You're bigger, be nice!"" ""Be a good role model,"" or ""She's little, let her have the toy.""""Another reason for bickering is parents who make lots of comparisons. Parents should avoid comparing their children. Children hear the comparisons and it creates more competition and fighting,"" he said. It's also important to take complaints seriously. For example, if a child consistently complains, ""It's not fair"" -- something I find particularly challenging in dealing with my own daughters.""When children complain about fairness, parents often dismiss it ... which only confirms the sense that they are on the outside in the parent-children relationship. Acknowledge the feelings and openly discuss it,"" Caspi said.""Parents should observe how they intervene in sibling conflicts. Are you taking one's side more than the other's?  If so, change it up,"" he said. Lastly, and perhaps most crucially, both Caspi and Kramer said that it's important for parents to cut themselves some slack and take care of their own mental health. Kids can pick up on stress and tension, and this may lead to more fights.""Parents are stretched in so many different ways right now,"" Kramer said.",2
110," (CNN)Dr. Umair Shah remembers the last mass vaccination campaign the US waged.  It was in 2009, when the H1N1 ""swine"" flu broke out in April, right at the end of the regular flu season. ""That was very challenging,"" Shah, who heads the Harris County, Texas, health department, told CNN. ""There were a lot of moving pieces. It took several weeks to months to not just organize but to implement and to do safely and effectively. And that was a mild pandemic."" This is not a mild pandemic. And while vaccine manufacturers, public health experts and the federal government are all confident one or more of the coronavirus vaccines being tested now will be shown to work safely by the end of the year, the US and the world will still be a long way from ending the pandemic. ""I feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this calendar year, as we get into early 2021,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, who, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is helping lead the medical battle against the virus, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual,"" Fauci added. ""Having"" a vaccine does not mean having a vaccine approved, distributed and into the arms of more than 300 million Americans.First, any vaccine must either be approved or authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. That's a process that under normal circumstances can take months or years. While the FDA has promised a speedier process for a Covid-19 vaccine, it must still go through a committee known as the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBAC. The FDA will almost certainly allow a shortcut process known as emergency use authorization, or EUA, but the agency has said it will require an ""EUA-plus"" that adds at least some layers of scrutiny. ""It's unlikely that a Covid-19 vaccine will receive full approval and broad distribution right away. Instead, the FDA will probably authorize vaccines for use in targeted groups of people at high risk from Covid and most likely to benefit from the vaccine,"" Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, both former FDA commissioners, wrote in a commentary in the Wall Street Journal Monday. ""All this means that at least initially, Covid vaccines won't provide the sort of herd immunity that can help extinguish an epidemic.""  That will take time -- likely well into next year, even if a vaccine were to be authorized in January, most experts who spoke to CNN predicted. ""People can't be lulled into a false sense of security by knowing the vaccine is coming,"" Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, told CNN. Although manufacturers are already making vaccine doses, it takes time. And the US will likely need more than 600 million doses of vaccine -- enough for everyone to get two doses of the vaccine. A new vaccine, and a plan for getting it out""Let's say ... at the end of the year, there will be millions and tens of millions of doses available,"" Fauci said in the CNN interview Friday.   ""It won't be until we get into 2021 that you'll have hundreds of millions of doses, and just the logistics constraints in vaccinating large numbers of people -- it's going to take months to get enough people vaccinated to have an umbrella of immunity over the community."" The US just is not ready for a mass vaccination campaign like the one needed to bring coronavirus under control, public health experts agreed. ""I don't think it's going to be seamless,"" said Plescia. The biggest mass vaccination program the US undertakes every year is the annual influenza vaccine. Only about half of Americans get a flu vaccine, and manufacturers make and distribute fewer than 150 million doses of it. Yet it takes a full year from start to finish to formulate, make and distribute flu vaccines every influenza season.  ""We start planning for flu vaccines in January or February,"" Michael Einhorn, the president of Dealmed, an independent medical supply distributor covering New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Flu vaccines generally become available in August -- seven to eight months later. And that's with a vaccine made using familiar technology, and dispensed in ways that people are familiar with -- in pediatricians' offices, at pharmacies, in grocery stores and at clinics.  ""You have a playbook for influenza,"" Shah said. ""This is not the same."" Any coronavirus vaccines will involve new technology and a whole new process for distribution, administration and then for payment. And while anyone can walk into, say, a pharmacy, get a flu shot and leave without ever thinking about it again, coronavirus vaccines will involve a whole lot more trouble and paperwork. People will probably need at least two doses about a month apart. Someone will have to track and follow up on that. ""We have to be able to see who has been vaccinated and who has not been,"" Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, told a public hearing about vaccine distribution organized by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Paperwork and red tape ""To have two doses means that you provide the initial dose and we will need to bring the person back for a second dose a month later,"" Dr. Jinlene Chan, acting deputy secretary of public health for the state of Maryland, told CNN. And it's very likely that vaccines made by several different companies will be in use by next year. ""We have to make sure that we give the person the same vaccine for their second dose that they got for their first dose,"" Chan said. No vaccination program can start until there are plans in place to manage this. Plus, the coronavirus vaccine or vaccines will still be experimental, so every person who gets one will need to be tracked to make sure there are no adverse reactions. There is no plan yet for any of this. ""We have gotten very little information on how this is going to roll out,"" said Harris County's Shah. ""That makes it even more difficult to plan.""  One big potential stumbling block is what's known as the cold chain. The two vaccines furthest along in development both must be kept frozen. Moderna's vaccine must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius), while Pfizer's must be kept at -94 F (-70 C). While -4 isn't much colder than the optimal home freezer's setting of 0 degrees F, -94 is more of a challenge. ""Throughout -- from every single point the vaccine has to traverse -- we have to maintain it at that temperature. Otherwise, there is a risk of some degradation and the vaccine possibly becoming less effective,"" Chan said. ""We need to make sure that there is some capability to store it appropriately until it is ready to use."" Otherwise, a thawed batch could mean hundreds or even thousands of people get a dud vaccine. This can be a challenge, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a vaccine expert at Emory University. ""We simply don't have freezers that can reach minus 70 degrees in most clinics,"" he told the National Academies meeting. To reach enough people, any mass vaccination effort will have to go beyond clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. ""You are going to have to get out to communities. You are going to have to get out to places of work,"" Del Rio said. That makes keeping the vaccines cold enough more of a challenge. Plescia said Pfizer has a plan to help keep its vaccine cold. ""Pfizer is going to have special boxes they ship the vaccines in, packed with dry ice,"" he said. ""Once you get the box, it'll keep the stuff at negative 80 degrees for 10 days."" But it's not clear, Plescia said, if the boxes could be opened and a few doses of vaccine taken out safely. ""Even if these boxes work very well, it is still going to add a whole level of challenge,"" he said. Taking the mass out of mass vaccinationPast mass vaccination efforts have been just that -- mass. But coronavirus is a respiratory disease, and the last thing anyone should be doing is lining people up or packing them into, say, school gyms to get vaccinated, Chan noted. ""With mass vaccination clinics, it involves bringing large groups of people into a site and vaccinating as many people as possible,"" Chan said. ""How do we do that in a way that reduces the risk of transmitting the very disease that we trying to vaccinate against?""  Illinois' Ezike said some of the experience with test sites may help. ""We had these strike teams,"" she said. ""We have been able to convert a lot of different sites into sites where people can drive up. Can you do a vaccination through the [car] window?"" she asked.  But to accommodate that, cities and states will have to get busy soon. ""We are going to need additional providers,"" she told the NASEM meeting. ""We need mass vaccination clinics and sites. So we really want to recruit lots and lots of essential partners,"" she added -- especially for the communities that are hardest hit by the pandemic, including meat-packing facilities and remote rural areas. That means changes in policies and legislation -- another potentially time-consuming process. Medical practice is legislated by states, not by the federal government. ""We know that we'll need some expanded scope of practice for different professional groups,"" she said. For instance, states may want to enable dentists, dental hygienists and even medical school students and veterinarians to vaccinate people. And that requires some other levels of legislation so that providers can get paid for their time. Changes to health insurance laws may be necessary, including billing codes that provide for a system under which people get vaccinated for no charge. Because rollout will not be immediate, people will be vaccinated in groups. The National Academies is considering this, as is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). They, along with private advocacy groups, have already released their own draft blueprints that in general put health care workers, first responders and the most vulnerable at the front of the line. But that's another layer of management for governments to take on. Many states have old and unwieldy systems for managing all of this, and Ezike said the needed upgrades may take time. Immunity takes time Adding to the timeline is simple biology. The Pfizer and Modern vaccines, at least, will have to be given in two doses, a month apart. After that, it takes about two weeks for immunity to build. That makes for six weeks from the time someone first gets vaccinated to when they can feel safe from infection.  On top of all of this, many Americans are fearful of vaccines -- especially a new one and especially a new vaccine rolled out in a time of intense politicization of the process. ""There's general vaccination mistrust and then there's government mistrust,"" Ezike noted. The current atmosphere over mask use has not helped, added Harris County's Shah. ""We have made it a political fight,"" he said. ""When you make it political in nature, not driven by health and medical considerations, ultimately people will take sides."" Unless a majority of the population gets vaccinated, the virus will continue its spread. Most estimates suggest that 60% to 70% of the population must be immune to provide enough herd immunity to interrupt the spread of the virus. Polls indicate that only about half of Americans feel confident right now about being vaccinated.  And if vaccines are less than fully effective, that may mean even more of the population needs to be vaccinated to have an effect on spread. Then there are the unknowns. ""Testing has not been seamless at all. There are going to be some glitches,"" Plescia said. ""I think there is a good chance there is going to be a vaccine that works and gets us out of this, but it is hard to believe that it is going to go really smoothly, given all the things that could happen."" Shah is ready for unpleasant surprises. ""This is a super slick virus that has broken every rule in the book,"" he said.",2
111," (CNN)Many of us hope to escape who we were in high school -- particularly if you were last in line to be picked in gym class -- but a growing body of research suggests that how popular you are in adolescence has a link with psychological and physical health decades later. Thirteen-year-olds who weren't very popular with their peers growing up, a new study released Tuesday has found, seem to have a heightened risk of developing circulatory system disease in later life. This includes higher risk for conditions such as narrowed and hardened arteries and abnormal heartbeat that affect the normal functioning of the heart and blood vessels. ""Although not many realize it, peer status is one of the strongest predictors of later psychological and health outcomes, even decades later, said Mitch Prinstein, the John Van Seters distinguished professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina. ""Several early studies revealed that our likeability among peers in grade school predicts life outcomes more strongly than does IQ, parental income, school grades, and pre-existing physical illness,"" Prinstein, who wasn't involved with the research, said. Prinstein, and the authors of the study, said that it's important to note that peer status is a specific form of popularity -- likeability rather than being the cool kid.  ""Many would perhaps think of high-status kids as those who were highly visible and influential -- hanging out in the smoking area during breaks and partying during the weekends. That is another type of popularity, which is sometimes referred to as perceived popularity,"" said Ylva Almquist, an associate professor and senior lecturer at the department of public health sciences at Stockholm University and an author of the study, which published in the journal BMJ Open. ""Peer status is rather an indicator of likability, and the degree to which a child is accepted and respected by their peers.""Chronic health problems are usually explained by genetic factors or actions like smoking, drinking or an unhealthy diet, but research has suggested that high-quality relationships are a key indicator of mortality. Observational studyIn this study from Sweden, the researchers used data from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, which includes everyone born in 1953 and residing in Stockholm, the Swedish capital, in 1963.The health of 5,410 men and 5,990 women was tracked into their 60s. At age 13, they had been asked who among their classmates they preferred to work with. They used the results to determine ""peer group status,"" which they divided into four categories: zero nominations, which they termed ""marginalized""; one (""low status""); two or three (""medium status""); and four or more (""high status""). Thirty-three percent of the boys enjoyed high peer group status at the age of 13, slightly more than girls (28.5%), the researchers found. Some 16% of the girls were classed as ""marginalized,"" compared to 12% of boys.  Circulatory disease was more common among the men than it was among the women, but the children classed as ""marginalized"" at age 13 had a 33% to 34% higher risk of circulatory disease in adulthood in both sexes, the study found. In their analysis, the researchers said they accounted for factors such as number and position of siblings, parental education and mental health, socioeconomic conditions, and school factors, such as intellect, academic performance and any criminal behavior.But as an observational study, it can only show a link, and Almquist said there could be many explanations for the association. ""A common dilemma in this kind of research is that we have the information we need to establish associations between conditions in childhood and health outcomes in adulthood, but we know quite little about whatever is happening in between,"" Almquist said.Potential for chronic inflammation due to stressKatherine Ehrlich, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Georgia, who wasn't involved in the research, said one explanation could be chronic inflammation linked to stressful experiences of relationships, both in adolescence and in adulthood. ""It is plausible that stressful social experiences (like being socially isolated) could lead to persistent unresolved inflammation, and if these levels are sustained over time, that could increase one's risk for plaques in the arteries, heart attacks, and other cardiovascular problems,"" said Ehrlich, who wasn't involved in the research.""It seems likely that health behaviors also play a role in the progression from low peer status to circulatory diseases decades later. Individuals who are socially isolated may be more likely to have unhealthy diets, engage in excessive drinking, and lead sedentary lifestyles, all of which could also increase one's risk for cardiovascular problems.""There is also an evolutionary logic, according to Prinstein, who is also the author of ""Popularity: Finding Happiness and Success in a World That Cares Too Much About the Wrong Kinds of Relationships.""""Our species is uniquely and remarkably attuned to our social position because many years ago we relied on each other for safety,"" he said.""Research now reveals that social rejection activates the same regions of the brain that are known to respond to physical pain, and also expresses dormant DNA to prepare our bodies for imminent injury. Unfortunately, this response is no longer necessary, so the expression of these genes leaves us more vulnerable to viral infections and more likely to suffer from inflammation-related illnesses,"" Prinstein said. He added that it was also possible that those higher in peer status are more likely to be afforded opportunities for learning and access to more resources -- including ones that could promote their health. ""We spend so much time, energy, and funding attending to factors we think can improve children's chances at a happy and successful life, but we have neglected the one factor that is perhaps most important of all: our children's ability to get along well with others and be perceived as likeable,"" he said.For parents worried about their kids' social life, Almquist stressed that problematic experiences with peers do not automatically lead to health problems and having caring and supportive parents was a ""protective factor.""Ehrlich agreed that strong ties between parents and teens could act as a buffer against problematic peer relationships. ""It is understandable to see these findings and worry about the long-term consequences for teens who might be more socially isolated. ""Additionally, many adolescents struggle at one point or another with their peer relationships -- finding it difficult to fit in or 'find their people,'"" she said. ""The advice I would give to families is: keep trying. Join new clubs, try to meet people online, put yourself out there -- you never know who could turn out to be a lifelong friend.""",2
112," (CNN)At first, Cameron Lynch thought she would need prepared questions for the group to discuss in their first Zoom call. On the list of proposed topics: ""Have you had a hard time with friends in the pandemic?"", ""Are you planning to go back to school in the fall?"" and ""How have you been coping on a day-to-day basis?""But Lynch quickly realized that the group of immunocompromised college students didn't need questions to guide them. They just wanted to talk about their shared feeling of isolation during the pandemic. They bonded over the fact that people assume that all teens are healthy. They questioned whether their schools were taking the right measures to help those who are more at-risk. They vented about their friends not understanding their inability to leave the house without fear of contracting Covid.It's a virtual support group for immunocompromised students -- but its members don't call it that. They prefer the name ""Chronic and Iconic."" It all started with a social media post. Lynch, who has Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and a form of muscular dystrophy, opened up in a heartfelt letter to her friends and followers. ""While I have been preparing my body to fight the virus by running so my lung capacity can be better, eating healthy so that my body has enough nutrients to fight, and attempting to manage my disease (which is difficult with teenage hormones), it seems that everyone else has stopped caring,"" Lynch, 19, wrote in the letter, which she shared with CNN. ""My reality is different. My reality is isolating.""Her reality means she can't hang out with other college students who she said she sees on her social media feed ""flood to the beaches to drink their White Claws."" Instead, it means she sits alone in her bed ""afraid that no one cares.""Much to Lynch's surprise, the post resonated beyond her own social network. What started in July as a five-person Zoom hangout has turned into a 50-plus person group -- with students from across the US -- who have an ongoing GroupMe text messaging chain and frequent video calls.As US colleges and universities return -- either in-person, online only or both in what's called the ""hybrid model"" -- immunocompromised students are struggling to figure out how to navigate school during a pandemic. If their classes aren't offered online, some are forced to rearrange their schedules or risk falling behind. If they don't feel safe going to campus, some have to take a leave of absence. And throughout it all, some say the feeling of isolation has become overwhelming. ""I think one thing that the media and schools don't seem to understand is how these policies are impacting the mental health of their students,"" Lynch told CNN. ""By saying that in-person learning is essential, that's basically saying the community can function without us, and is better off when we're not there.""Covid puts life on hold for high-risk students In her letter, Lynch emphasized that her new normal means limiting time outside, even though she's sick of watching shows on Netflix. Unlike her peers, who can cautiously partake in activities, she feels she has to keep her life on hold until Covid is no longer a threat.And she's not alone. People with underlying medical conditions are more likely to become seriously ill if they get Covid-19. Some of them are young and most of them may not look sick at all. Millions of them are living with a compromised immune system.""People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,"" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes on its website. ""They may also remain infectious for a longer period of time than others with COVID-19.""Aside from worrying about getting infected, many of these immunocompromised students said they feel anxious about people -- specifically their peers -- disobeying health and safety guidelines.To date, there are more than 40,000 cases of Covid-19 among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- and is likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days.With social life trickling back to life on campuses, coronavirus outbreaks have hit places where students congregate, like fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning. While most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities.""With the pandemic, we don't have same sense of immortality as other people,"" Lynch said. ""This is very real for us. If we get a cold, we're in hospital for four days. We have to take it more seriously. If there aren't systems in place we have to make them.""They found comfort in a virtual communitySamantha Price, who has Type 1 diabetes, was among the first to respond to Lynch's letter.Price and Lynch met doing community theater in Richmond, Virginia, when they were 10 and nine years old, respectively. They bonded after realizing they both have diabetes. Over the years, they lost touch. But Price saw Lynch's post and reached out.Together, the two created the support group, which now includes people with a range of disabilities. ""We always say, 'Can you explain what that is please?' when people say what their disability is,"" Lynch said. ""We learn what everyone's going through, and how we can better support each other.""Price, a junior at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said it's been comforting to connect with people who understand how she's been feeling.""We're not normally surrounded by people who can relate to us,"" Price told CNN. ""It (the group) helps us have our feelings validated. If I'm super depressed or down in the dumps one day because my friends are going out and posting about it ... complaining isn't going to do anything,"" the 20-year-old said. ""But if I'm able to go to this group and say, 'this happened' 15 people like it or respond and say, 'I totally understand, that happened to me.'""Kaitlin Ahern, a 20-year-old student at Lafayette College, saw Lynch's social media post circulating online and reached out, eventually joining the group.""At this time it's very easy to feel ostracized and alone,"" said Ahern, who said she is immunocompromised because of a medication she takes. ""Because everyone's kind of paying attention to older people because they are immunocompromised, and younger people kind of expect all young people to be able to reckless and go out and party and everything."" Ahern's college is mostly remote for the semester, but she lives near other schools and sees students everywhere. ""I can't see my friends because they are all partying, they aren't willing to give up partying just to wear a mask and social distance (and) see me,"" she said. ""There's very little contact outside of my family. It's very lonely not interacting with anyone.""The virtual group has been ""amazing,"" especially as she struggled to connect to her existing social circle during the pandemic, she said.It's not surprising that the pandemic has affected the mental health of many nationwide, including young people. The National Center for Health Statistics and the US Census Bureau estimate that more than a third of Americans have experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety since spring.A recent CDC survey found that almost 41% of respondents are struggling with mental health issues stemming from the pandemic -- both related to the pandemic itself and the measures used to contain it, including physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.""A lot of students in the group text us, like 'Today was a terrible day, I'm so frustrated,'"" Lynch said. ""We're kind of like a help line in a sense. We're all at home so people respond very quickly.""Now, the group has gone beyond just sharing their problems.""People will talk about their highlight of the week, what quarantine crafts they've started,"" Price said. ""Some people will tell us about their personal lives. We've actually gotten to know these people really well.""Students ask peers to 'stay safely away'Aleah Colón-Alfonso, who has small fiber neuropathy, Lyme disease and accompanying secondary illnesses, said she felt the need to do something after noticing the lack of social distancing and facial coverings in Sarasota, Florida.Though the junior at the New College of Florida isn't part of the virtual support group, she has found a different way to help people who are in similar situations. In July, she officially launched a business called Stay Safely Away, which sells wearable merchandise that lets people display their immunocompromised status to urge others around them to ""stay safely away.""""Communicating behind masks and from a distance is difficult, so my idea and all my products attempt to serve as an unspoken and polite assertion,"" she told CNN.The company now sells more than 150 products, including beach towels, face masks, backpacks, school supplies, swimwear and stickers. All merchandise includes some sort of catchy yet informative message, like: ""I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised"" and ""science is real.""""'I'm not rude, I'm just immunocompromised' was a direct quote of what I wanted to say to every person I socially distanced myself from,"" she said. ""The phrase is essentially a shortened version of 'I really don't want to be rude -- but I also really don't want to end up on a ventilator!'"" Big plans beyond fallIn recent interviews with CNN, three developmental psychologists said they believe the majority of students are taking the pandemic seriously and acting accordingly. Viral videos of maskless parties and packed bars account for hundreds out of the nearly 20 million college students in the US, they said.But for at-risk students, the fear is still there -- and some must decide whether they feel safe enough to return to campus. ""The first feeling I had about universities and schools reopening was fear,"" Colón-Alfonso said. ""Fear of lives lost, fear of the academic and social impact, and fear of how to accurately make decisions in a time where everything seems uncertain and ever changing. I also felt a distinct trepidation towards institutions who need student tuition if they want to remain afloat.""Colón-Alfonso said her school has been very ""accommodating,"" and she feels safe returning to in-person learning. However, she added, ""I know that my experience is an exception to the rule. Seeing parties on the news, receiving texts from family and friends in college with stories of the danger they see every day is unsettling.""Many at-risk students remain wary of the risks. Lynch, who is in the UK with her family, and Price, who is in Virginia with her parents, said they have barely left their homes. But the time in quarantine has also given them a renewed sense of purpose -- and the two said they have big plans. Eventually, Lynch said, she and Price want to create a national organization for disabled students, with branches at universities and colleges.""There's college diabetes network which we're both apart of,"" Lynch said, ""but this would be for more disabilities -- physical, learning and invisible disabilities.""The two also hope to create a conference when it's safe to meet in person.""My goal is getting people to even acknowledge that there are young disabled people,"" Lynch said. ""It's really important.""For now, though, they continue to focus on building their community virtually -- and staying healthy while studying remotely.""We have an understanding that things suck right now,"" Price said. ""But (staying home) is what we have to do. It's going to be better for us in long run.""",2
113," (CNN)A mother's depression and anxiety from conception through the first year of the baby's life is associated with negative developmental outcomes through adolescence, according to a study published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.That could affect a lot of women: About 15% to 23% of women worldwide experience anxiety during pregnancy, while 15% deal with anxiety after childbirth. Depression through pregnancy is estimated to affect 10% of women, and 15% face postpartum depression. The burden is greater for women who are experiencing poverty or are teen parents, according to Postpartum Support International. For the baby, the perinatal stage — which is defined as the time from conception through pregnancy (antenatal), birth and the first year of the baby's life (postnatal) — is ""a time of unprecedented growth and sensitivity,"" the study said. That's when exposures and early life experiences may modify development starting from when he or she is in the womb to that critical first year as a growing child and onward. A mother experiencing depression and anxiety before and after birth was moderately linked with her child's deficits in language and cognitive and motor development in infancy. All of these children were more likely to exhibit behaviors that either internalized negative feelings or targeted them toward others. These kids experienced and reacted with more negative emotions and were temperamentally difficult through adolescence as well. ""In light of the pandemic, these are particularly concerning results,"" said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University, who wasn't involved in the study. ""Since risk factors for perinatal depression include life stress and lack of social support, pregnant and postpartum women may be particularly vulnerable right now.""These data that suggest that this poses risks not just for the mother, but also for her child, not just now but into adolescence, is a stark reminder that the indirect effects of Covid-19 may be long-lasting,"" Jamieson added. Researchers have conducted reviews of studies on the relationship between a woman's mental health during this time and her child's development — but they hadn't previously evaluated the long-term effects of depression and anxiety at different stages of motherhood on a range of developmental functions from infancy through adolescence, the study said. The authors of the current study analyzed the association of perinatal depression and anxiety with social-emotional, cognitive, language, motor and adaptive behavior development in their offspring from infancy up to age 18. They also examined whether the timing of depression and anxiety, type of mental illness and offspring age affected the findings. Mental health before and after birthParticipants included 195,751 otherwise healthy mother-child pairs from 191 studies based in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Norway. These women had either reported their symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or had diagnoses, while later information about their children's development was also self-reported. Depression and anxiety in the perinatal period had small-to-moderate associations with deficits in social-emotional behavior development through adolescence, such as peer problems, a lack of prosocial behaviors and attachment and emotional dysregulation. How maternal mental health might influence a child's growth How a mother's mental health might influence her offspring's development could hinge on what happens to the baby while in the womb and interactions after birth. Anxiety and depression during pregnancy could expose the fetus to increased concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, leading to changes in brain function and reducing the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients, the study said. The neurocognitive changes that prepare mothers to be able to sensitively respond to their infants could also be hampered by experiencing depression and anxiety during pregnancy, the study said. A mentally taxed mother may be less able to quickly, carefully and thoughtfully respond to her baby's cues — potentially reducing the chances of attachment between a mother and her baby.""During the first year of life, infants are unable to sooth themselves when they become upset — they rely on sensitive caregivers to respond when they are distressed,"" said Dr. Alison Stuebe, a professor of maternal and child health at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, who wasn't involved in the study.""With support from these caregivers, infants gradually learn how to cope with fear and frustration,"" Stuebe, also a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the UNC School of Medicine, added.The authors lacked details about individual, family and social factors that could have affected the mothers' mental health and their children's development, said the study's senior author Delyse Hutchinson, an associate professor in the school of psychology at the Centre for Early Social and Emotional Development at Deakin University in Australia. Additional studies are necessary, Jamieson said, but ""the large numbers of studies in this systematic review begin to paint a fairly consistent pattern."" 'When parents struggle, kids struggle'For mothers to recover from birth and transition to their role as parents, and for growing families to thrive, they need support, Stuebe said. ""But in the United States, 23% of mothers are back at work within 10 days postpartum,"" Stuebe added. ""We are (the) only industrialized country without paid parental leave. Women lose pregnancy Medicaid coverage at 60 days after birth, losing access to psychotherapy and medical treatment for depression and anxiety."" If parents lack access to treatment because they're uninsured, can't take time off from work or face some other barrier, Stuebe continued, ""it's likely that their children will be exposed to food and housing insecurity, poorly funded schools, lack of safe spaces to play and other stressors.""When parents struggle, kids struggle."" Maintaining well-being through new chaptersSince families now ""have to balance the urgent need for hands-on help with deciding who can be part of their 'bubble' in the first weeks after birth,"" the pandemic has made building a village more challenging, Stuebe said. Some solutions can be found at New Mom Health, a resource for postpartum women. Expecting and new mothers concerned about their mood should seek help from their physician and/or psychologist early, Hutchinson said. ""Perinatal difficulties are often overlooked,"" Hutchinson said, ""and many women do not seek help because they think it is expected that mothers feel down, tired or worried or because they are concerned about the stigma related to mental health."" Staying connected with supportive family, friends and other mothers is also important, Hutchinson said — as is doing activities that bring you joy and regularly practicing self-care, ""whether it involves going for a walk or other exercise, reading a book, speaking to a friend, relaxation or simply catching up on some sleep."" While these tools alone may not prevent depression and anxiety, they can help mothers navigate challenges. If mothers are concerned that their children have any of the developmental deficits the study highlighted, they should talk with their pediatrician, Hutchinson said. ""If difficulties are recognised and help is sought,"" Hutchinson said via email, ""this risk may be reduced, potentially leading to improved health and wellbeing outcomes for both mother and child.""

114," (CNN)Like many moms, Sofia Axelrod found the lack of sleep really hard after giving birth. But unlike many moms, she refused to accept that the exhaustion was inevitable. ""Sleep deprivation is so detrimental,"" said sleep consultant Axelrod, who is a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York. ""I didn't just want to suck it up and think, yeah my life for now on is going to be permanently damaged.""The mother of two was inspired to dig into the research, looking for evidence-based tactics to get young children and their parents to sleep through the night. The results of her search can be found in her new book, ""How Babies Sleep: The Gentle, Science-Based Method to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night.""Axelrod learned that parents' brains -- mostly moms -- are wired to care for a young child. Nighttime noises, tame or savage, will jolt many of us awake. Even when the baby is capable of self-soothing. Even when we are so, so tired.But if we let our instinct to care for our young children reign supreme, and get no sleep as a result, nobody wins. ""If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy,"" the old saying goes; and sleep-deprived mamas are not happy.""I wanted to be happy, and I need sleep to make me happy,"" Axelrod said. ""So I said, how do I make it happen?""Axelrod spoke to CNN about how to maximize everyone's sleep, from the baby years on. She also had a few thoughts about which pandemic habits might be getting in the way of a good night's sleep, and which ones, surprisingly, are not.This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.CNN: Humans instinctively respond to light and get sleep cues from natural and artificial light. What should parents use for light to signal ""sleepy time"" to their kids?Sofia Axelrod: The light bulb went off in my head, pardon the pun -- it's intended -- when I was working in the lab with fruit flies. When we want to test their sleep without waking them up, we use a red flashlight. Every other type of light wakes them up.I was pregnant, and I realized that the same is true for humans. We are largely insensitive to red light. So I bought a red light bulb (Ed. note: Not all red light bulbs are actual red light, so shop carefully) and started using it during nighttime feeds when my baby was born, and it worked. The baby wouldn't get the signal from the red light that it's time to wake up.CNN: How does light signal to the brain that it's time to sleep or time to wake up? Axelrod: We have these special cells in the back of our eyes that have special light receptors. So whenever you're exposed to light, in the morning or the evening, they signal to your body that it's time to be awake. They reset your body clock. You can use light to help train your body that this is bedtime, and this is morning time.CNN: Can introducing red light and limiting overall light exposure help older kids fall asleep more quickly at night?Axelrod: Yes. We actually have a red light in our living room that we put on an hour before bedtime.Subscribe to CNN's Sleep, But Better Newsletter: Want the best sleep of your life? Sign up for our newsletter series for helpful hints to achieve better sleep.CNN: Can dimming lights in the evening help get us to sleep?Axelrod: Yes, though it's really important to be consistent with timing. We need to work with our inner clock. Also, turn the red light on or dim the lights an hour before bedtime. This is how long it takes for the sleep hormone that is dependent on light to be released.CNN: Though no matter how careful we are with lights, babies will still cry in their cribs. What's your take on sleep training?Axelrod: Honestly, I regret calling it ""sleep training"" in the book because those two words have such a negative connotation. That said, there are longitudinal studies showing that allowing your child to cry a little and learn to self-soothe has no detrimental effects. I recommend a middle ground. Suppress your mom guilt and let them cry for 90 seconds before you go in. The research is crystal clear -- even just 90 seconds will teach them to fall asleep. People don't realize this, but babies are not born knowing how to fall asleep. It's our job to teach them.CNN: What do you think about co-sleeping?Axelrod: This is a very personal decision. But the research has shown that if you are in the same bed as your child, it's much harder to create that short delay between when the baby wakes up and the parent soothes the baby, and the delay is important for learning how to self-soothe. If a parent thinks they need that closeness, then go for it. But the research does show that kids who co-sleep take longer to learn to sleep through the night. CNN: What about naps? Last year my son took a mandtatory nap at his preschool, and then was staying up past 10 p.m. every night. Should we never wake a sleeping child?Axelrod: I had that exact experience at my child's day care. I tried my best to use my credentials to get them to change their policy so naps weren't required, but it didn't work, and I ended up having my nanny go early to pick up my daughter so she wouldn't nap there. It was either that or let her sleep there and have her go to sleep at midnight.Science is very clear on this point: Daytime naps control toddler sleep. Control! Kids only need so much sleep in a day. If your kid isn't going to bed at night, cut that nap. Either make it shorter or cut it altogether.CNN: There seems to be a critical mass of people who believe that it's better for kids to go to sleep early. But some kids are night owls. Are they OK? Axelrod: This is so politicized -- that somehow people who go to bed late and wake up late are still considered lazy. But there is a genetic basis for circadian rhythms. One out of 100 people have a mutation in their clock genes that alter their day length, and as a result they go to sleep later. It's not detrimental, and nothing is wrong as long as they are getting enough overall sleep.CNN: Many families are a bit off their sleep schedules during the pandemic and going to bed later. So they'll be fine? Axelrod: It doesn't matter if you go to bed later. What does matter is day-to-day variation. I don't recommend doing something different over the weekend than during the week or when you are on vacation. Your circadian clock responds to time cues, and it helps regulate everything, from when you go to sleep to when you are ready for lunch. You want to keep this regular.CNN: What about television at night? I've heard that you need to stay far away from all things backlit in the evening. But sometimes 30 minutes of TV helps us settle down.Axelrod: Screens can be fine at night. Just try to dim it as much as possible, and generally try to avoid them an hour before bedtime. Though people do have different sensitivity to light. Some of us might be fine watching them right before bed without any decrease of our melatonin production or impact on our sleep overall.CNN: Any solutions for Covid anxiety-related nightmares or wake-ups in our kids?Axelrod: It's important to remember that our kids are sensitive to what is going on, and they may not know it or even show it. It depends on the age, but overall it's important to shield our kids from our anxieties and the news to some degree so they can sleep.There is a strong correlation between not getting enough sleep and depression, and so the sleep deprivation can end up making them feel even worse if it continues. Parents need to try to provide the comfort their kids need, so the kids' anxieties don't take over and keep everyone from sleeping well.",2
115," (CNN)An influential model is predicting a catastrophic winter with a significant rise in coronavirus deaths.A possible scenario sees 415,090 Covid-19 deaths by January, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington says in its latest forecast. The worst-case scenario is 600,000 deaths by January 1.""When we look ahead into the winter with seasonality kicking in, people becoming clearly less vigilant, you know mask use is down, mobility is up in the nation, you put all those together and we look like we're going to have a very deadly December ahead of us in terms of toll of coronavirus,""  IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper.The IHME model is essentially predicting the number of deaths will double in the next four months. As of Friday, nearly 6.4 million infections have been recorded in the US and more than 192,000 Americans have died,  according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Despite the dire prediction, President Donald Trump says the US has done ""really well"" in fighting the virus, according to a Thursday video on the White House official Facebook page. ""I really do believe we're rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there, but not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump said. Speaking with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not agree with the President's statements.""We're plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day, and the deaths of around 1,000,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He said test positivity is increasing in some regions of the country and people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather.""That's not good for a respiratory-borne virus,"" he said. ""You don't want to start off already with a baseline that's so high.""Fauci's disagreement with that comment is another example of a top scientist and a member of the White House coronavirus task force publicly disputing the President's claims about the virus. ""We're in a very politically-charged atmosphere now and whenever you're trying to get people all together singing from the same tune and doing the same things as a society, unified against this common enemy -- this virus -- it's very difficult to do that when you have such a charged atmosphere that we have right now,"" Fauci told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday. ""And that really is truly unfortunate."" Fauci warned that the country needs to get the levels down lower ""so that when you go into a more precarious situation, like the fall and the winter, you won't have a situation where you really are at a disadvantage right from the very beginning.""US may not return to normal until 2021, Fauci saysThe US might not return to pre-coronavirus life until the end of next year, Fauci said, but he is cautiously optimistic the US will have a vaccine by the end of this year. ""But it's not going to be turning a switch off and turning the switch on. It's going to be gradual and I think it's going to take several months before we get to the point where we can really feel something that approximates how it was normally before Covid-19,"" he said.There's also the issue of how many doses of the vaccine will be available and how long it takes to distribute the vaccine. ""It's going to take several months to get the country safe and vaccinated,"" Fauci said. Nearly 30 US states are reporting downward trends in Covid-19 cases, but the pandemic will likely worsen again, Fauci said.""We need to hunker down and get through this fall and winter because it's not going to be easy,"" Fauci said.Experts -- including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director -- have warned the months ahead will be challenging. The US continues to see about 36,000 new cases each day -- which is better than  August but still too high, Fauci said. ""I keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I'd like,"" he said.As the weather gets colder, Americans will move indoors more, where the virus spreads more easily. The coming flu season will complicate diagnoses. The strains on the healthcare system will make for one of the ""most difficult times that we experienced in American public health,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has said. Where we stand nowThe actual number of infections could be far greater. Many may have had Covid-19 without knowing, as the CDC projects about 40% of people who are infected don't show any symptoms.Others could have been sick but never got tested. A new study says the US greatly undercounted Covid-19 cases at the start of the pandemic -- missing 90% of them -- mostly due to a lack in testing. Across the US, 28 states are reporting downward trends -- including Florida and California -- compared to the previous week, and 14 are steady.Experts worry a surge could come weeks after Labor Day celebrations, like cases soared after the Fourth of July. An ensemble forecast from the CDC now projects that between 205,000 and 217,000 people in the US will die by October 3.Medical experts also worry about the upcoming flu season. Fauci told CNN Friday the CDC recommended people getting their flu vaccines by October 31. ""What we're hoping for -- and I hope this happens -- is that a combination of people getting vaccinated against the flu and the fact that the very public health measures that they implement to avoid coronavirus will actually help them avoid influenza,"" Fauci said. Fauci also recommended people ""hunker down"" for the fall and winter, but he says that does not mean shutting down the country again. ""We don't need to shut down, we can do this if we pull together and abide by relatively simple and understandable public health measures,"" Fauci said, adding that the measures include social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding crowds. Non-symptomatic children can transmit virus, data showEven children with mild or no symptoms can transmit Covid-19, according to contact tracing data from three Utah child care facilities released Friday. Researchers said 12 children got Covid-19 in a child care location and transmitted it to at least 12 people outside, including household members. They analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care centers in Salt Lake County from this April to July. They found at least two children who had no symptoms not only had caught the virus but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One 8-month-old child spread the virus to both parents. The researchers say that two of the facility outbreaks began with staff members who had household contacts with the virus.Overall, children accounted for 13 of the 31 confirmed Covid-19 case linked to the facility, and all of the children had mild or no symptoms.Infected college students shouldn't be sent homeColleges across the country have made face masks a requirement hoping to keep Covid-19 cases down. But just weeks into the first semester, campuses from all 50 states have reported infections. The University of Texas at Austin announced this week three confirmed clusters on campus which collectively account for about 100 cases. San Diego State University confirmed almost 400 infections among students, after announcing a halt on in-person instruction.And more than 1,300 Arizona State University students have tested positive since August 1. Colleges and universities should try to isolate infected students instead of sending them home, Fauci has said. ""You send them back to their community, you will in essence be reseeding with individuals who are capable of transmitting infection, many communities throughout the country,"" he said earlier this week. ""So it's much, much better to have the capability to put them in a place where they could comfortably recover.""",2
116," (CNN)When the pandemic hit, couples found themselves worrying about getting sick, losing income, teaching their children at home while working full time (or worrying full time about sending them to school). It hardly makes a perfect recipe for sex. The stress has been too much for one Texas couple in their mid-40s with two children, according to one woman who did not want to be named due to the sensitive nature of the story, given her high-profile job in Austin. ""I stopped exercising because I was too scared of the plague ravaging society,"" she said.""While scared and doing nothing, I threw my back out and couldn't move for two weeks,"" said the woman, who now works her informational technology job from home alongside her husband.Then her husband had a non-Covid health issue that ""doused any embers that may have survived all of our lockdown trauma.""Covid-19 has invaded nearly every aspect of our lives. So, it's no surprise it's infiltrated our bedrooms, too — for better or worse. Many people are reporting challenges in their sex lives and relationships, according to early findings from the ongoing Sex and Relationships in the Time of Covid-19 study undertaken by Indiana University's Kinsey Institute, which researches issues related to gender, sexuality and reproduction.What the sex surveys sayThe results are a mixed bag so far, said Justin Lehmiller, a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute and the author of ""Tell Me What You Want,"" a book about the science of sexual desire.""Some people reported their sex lives and romantic lives had improved and were reporting their relationships were better and stronger than ever,"" he said. ""But a larger number (of respondents) reported challenges in their sex lives and relationships.""The study kicked off mid-March, and researchers initially heard back from roughly 2,000 respondents -- 75% of whom were Americans and 25% were from other countries -- between the ages of 18 and 81 in varied relationships. Almost 53% of the participants identified as heterosexual, almost 20% as bisexual and the rest as: queer, pansexual, gay/lesbian or other. About 44% of participants reported a decline in the quality of their sex lives, with 30% reporting a decline in their romantic lives, according to early findings from the longitudinal study, which is in its sixth wave and will continue for several more months.Some 14% said their sex lives had improved, he said, and 23% reported their relationship was in a better place.And summer, Lehmiller said, brought no salvation. When people are going on vacation and have more free time, there's usually more sexual activity. But the most recent wave of data collection from this summer indicated our sex lives have not yet rebounded to the levels of past summers. ""This summer really seems to be the exception to that peak,"" he said. More stress equals less sexDeclining quality of one's sex life often correlates with higher levels of stress, according to Lehmiller. ""We know that stress comes from a lot of different sources, it's complex and multi-factorial,"" he said. ""The more stressed people reported feeling, the less desire for sex.""That's true even when business is good. For Marcus Anwar, 31, working long hours in Toronto running OhMy — the classified advertising website he founded in 2017 — appears to be taking a toll on his sex life with his fiancee. With everything moving online, OhMy's revenue has tripled its revenue since the pandemic began, he said, but that has meant less free time for the couple.""There are days I am working 14 to 16 hours. Having the weekend off is a thing of the past,"" Anwar said.  ""When I'm done working, I try to spend quality time with Tiffany. But unfortunately, there are constant calls and emails that I have to answer, making it very difficult to separate work from personal life.""""Even though we've been together for so many years, it just hasn't felt like it used to, when we both wanted to be having sex,"" said Tiffany, 29, who declined to give her last name for privacy reasons. ""(Back) when there weren't a million things we had to worry about or have to get done."" Talking about sex is difficultDiana Wiley, a Seattle-based certified sex therapist and licensed marriage and family therapist, told CNN that talking about sex can be very hard. ""Some people are so stressed they've just kind of folded up their tents about sex, they don't want to do it,"" said Wiley, whose book, ""Love in the Time of Corona,"" shares tips for reconnecting sexually and emotionally in troubling times. Wiley suggested a few ways for couples to try to get their sex lives back on track in pandemic times, including tips for full-body caressing exercises that begin with nonsexual touch to help release stress.Being more mindful in the bedroom and in general, she said, can also be beneficial.""Take control of your thoughts rather than let your mind send you into a tailspin,"" she said, ""It helps to name what's true right now, in this moment — my family and friends are healthy, for example."" And if you have to put sex on the calendar, do it. ""It's a myth for sex to be any good it needs to be spontaneous,"" she said. Some are having more intimate sexAccording to the Kinsey Institute's early findings, not everyone is folding up their tents, however.For Bob Curley of Rhode Island and his wife, who had recently gone back to grad school, the couple of over 30 years had adapted to her being away from home more often.""Initially, there was a lot of stress around the pandemic that didn't put us in an amorous mood,"" Curley told CNN. ""But once we got used to it, we really started enjoying having the extra time together.""Their communication improved in and out of the bedroom, he said. ""The sex may not have increased significantly in terms of frequency, but the intimacy definitely has,"" said Curley, adding that the couple took the opportunity to ""push some sexual boundaries together in a way we might not otherwise have found the time or energy to do.""The Kinsey study backs him up, with one in five people trying at least one new sexual activity since the pandemic began, said Lehmiller, including things like trying a new sexual position, sexting or sending nude photos and sharing or acting on sexual fantasies. ""This period in time has been a sexual revolution for many people,"" he said, adding that people who are trying new things were three times more likely than those who aren't to report improvements in their sex lives. Single life in pandemic timeFor single people considering new relationships during the pandemic, feelings of isolation are often compounded with health concerns about Covid-19, said Jenni Skyler, a certified sex therapist and director of The Intimacy Institute in Boulder, Colorado.""I see a lot of people taking this as an opportunity to connect online and cultivate emotional intimacy first before jumping to something physical,"" she said. Such was the case for 34-year-old San Diego resident Jackie Bryant, who pens a monthly newsletter about cannabis culture. Until recently, she said she had been perusing dating apps but not meeting anyone in person due to the health concerns of the pandemic. ""I've been much more choosy, talking to a number of people, trying to be open-minded, but not agreeing to see anybody unless it seemed really promising,"" Bryant said. ""There's this very real layer of death and sickness tied to human intimacy now.""  The pandemic made ""me drill down on what I was looking for even more,"" she said. ""Am I going risk my life for some chump? ... not anymore."" During a recent socially distanced second date that ended with an awkward but cute moment when saying goodbye, Bryant said, she and the man navigated their personal safety rules. ""I was like, 'For you I don't have rules,'"" she said. ""From opposite sides of my yard, we walked toward each other and kissed."" ""I've decided I can't put that part of my life on hold. I need sex, I want to be in a relationship and who knows how long this will last,""  Bryant said. ""You learn to navigate that within the confines of Covid.""And how people navigate the pandemic, it seems, may have the power to lead to a sunnier sexual outcome.""The overall emerging picture is that there are more struggles and challenges,"" Lehmiller said. ""But there's a sizable number of people who really seem to be thriving during this situation, too.""",2
117," (CNN)Cakes, cookies, pie. During a global pandemic or even more moderately stressful life circumstances, we often turn to comforting sugary and carb-rich indulgences that may help to calm us down.Now for the bad news. New recommendations that will inform soon-to-be-released US dietary guidelines reveal we should further limit the amount of sugar we consume. This guidance will come at a time when many of us may be looking to indulge our sweet tooth more than ever. No sugarcoating the new recommendationsFirst, some sugar basics: Not all sugars are created equal and need to be limited to the same degree. Natural sugars are present in nutritious foods like fruit and milk in the form of fructose and lactose. These foods deliver important nutrients — such as fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals — that play a role in a healthy diet. Added sugars are another story. They are sugars or sweeteners that are added to foods or beverages during processing or preparation. They contribute calories, without any essential nutrients.The average American gets about 13% of their total calories from added sugars, but new recommendations call for that average to be cut by about half, according to a recently issued report from the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee — a group of experts charged with providing science-based recommendations every five years. The 2020 committee recommended a limit of no more than 6% of calories coming from added sugars, with ranges from 3% at the lowest calorie levels and up to 8% at the highest calorie levels (which vary based on age, gender, activity level and body weight).  The committee also recommended that children younger than age 2 should avoid any foods and beverages with added sugars.How many treats do you get?That 6% limit translates to 30 grams of sugar in a 2,000 calorie daily diet — less sugar than what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. It's a limit that more closely reflects the American Heart Association's current recommendation, which was issued in 2009.  The heart association's recommendation translates to a limit of 6 teaspoons of sugar, or about 25 grams each day for women and children over 2 years of age; and about 9 teaspoons, or about 36 grams for men.                 There are 6 teaspoons or 25 grams of sugar in two and a half chocolate chip cookies, 16 ounces of fruit punch and about 1½ tablespoons of honey. There are 9 teaspoons, or about 36 grams of sugar in 11 ounces of cola, 2 servings of premium vanilla ice cream and about 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of honey.Why do you need to avoid added sugars? They increase the risk for cardiovascular disease in different ways. For one, excess calorie intake contributes to weight gain, thereby increasing risks for insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  High sugar intake is also associated with increased triglyceride levels that often accompany reduced HDL-cholesterol (high-density lipoproteins, better known as the good cholesterol) levels, thereby contributing to metabolic syndrome, also a risk for developing cardiovascular disease, explained Linda Van Horn, chief of the nutrition division at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine's department of preventive medicine.And since most adults need fewer calories with increasing age, their limited total calorie intake should come from nutrient-dense foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and fish, appropriate dairy foods, legumes and nuts, Van Horn said. ""To consume all of those recommended foods encompasses the vast majority of their calorie allowance leaving very few 'discretionary' or empty sugary calories without causing weight gain,"" Van Horn said. But though limiting added sugars to 6% of calories may be ideal from a nutrient-density perspective, that doesn't mean it will be easy to achieve.""While it's great if you can get added sugar intake to no more than 6% of calories, depending on your current diet, the (previous) recommendation of no more than 10% of calories may be a more realistic and achievable goal to aim for first,"" said Denver-based registered dietitian nutritionist Kelli McGrane, who works as a dietitian for Lose It! and TheHealthyToast.com.Again, here's the math: 6% of added sugars on a 2,000 calorie diet is 30 grams of sugar or 120 sugar calories.  Strategies for cutting backFive food categories — sweetened beverages, desserts and sweet snacks, coffee and tea (with their additions), candy and sugars, and breakfast cereals and bars — contribute 70% of the added sugars we consume in the United States, according to the dietary guidelines committee. These foods are often energy-dense with low amounts of key dietary nutrients. Here are some ways to reduce your intake.Train your taste buds to crave less sugar. Cut back gradually and include more protein and fiber-rich foods in your diet, which will help you crave less sugar.  Consume low-sugar or no-sugar-added versions of foods. Opt for whole-grain cereals with less than 6 grams of sugar per serving and unsweetened yogurts, McGrane said.You can sweeten these foods with natural, nutrient-rich sources of sugar like berries or diced fruit. If your kids love a sugary cereal, you can sprinkle it on top of a healthier, whole-grain cereal. Limit or avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks. That includes sodas, energy drinks and fruit punch. If you like sweet carbonated beverages, add a splash of cranberry or orange juice to seltzer or try flavored seltzers. You can also flavor your own waters with fruit slices for natural sweetness or try herbal fruit teas.Cut back on sugar in your coffee and tea. These sugar calories can quickly add up, especially if you drink more than one cup each day. If you are currently adding 2 teaspoons of sugar, cut back to one. This applies to coffee shops, too. ""If you're just starting to wean yourself off sweetened store-bought coffee drinks, ask for fewer pumps of syrup. As each pump contains approximately 5 grams of sugar, depending on the flavor, the sugar savings add up quickly,"" McGrane said.Enjoy fruit for dessert. Try cinnamon baked apples, berries or grilled peaches instead of cookies, cake, ice cream, pastries and other sweet treats. If you need something a bit more indulgent, swap your candy habit for a piece of good-quality dark chocolate. ""It'll still satisfy that sweet craving without as much sugar,"" McGrane said.Look out for stealth sugars. Added sugars are often present in foods that you might not think of as ""sweet,"" like sauces, breads, condiments and salad dressings. ""Pre-packaged sauces — like ketchup, BBQ sauce and tomato sauce — tend to be some of the biggest offenders of hidden added sugars in the diet,"" said Kristi King, senior pediatric dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital and a national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Check nutrition facts labels. This will help you determine how much of your added sugar budget a food or beverage contains. By January 1, 2021, all foods and beverages will be required to list added sugars on food labels. Until then, look for other names for added sugars like: agave, brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, evaporated cane juice, fructose, fruit juice concentrate, fruit nectar, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, maple syrups, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose and turbinado sugar. The higher up these added sugars are on the ingredients list, the greater the amount of added sugar in the product.Cooking helps you reduce added sugarsUse fruits and spices to add flavor at breakfast rather than sugar. ""Rather than having sweetened oatmeal packets, make plain oatmeal and flavor with blueberries and cinnamon. I even like adding a pinch of cardamom for an extra flavor-punch,"" McGrane said.  You can also use sliced fruit instead of sugary jams on your toast and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. ""Sliced strawberries are my favorite, but peach, banana, and apple slices all work well, too,"" McGrane said.Opt for homemade rather than store-bought baked goods. This gives you full control over the amount of sugar in your desserts. In most recipes (except for yeast breads) you can reduce the sugar by a third without causing a noticeable difference in texture, McGrane explained.Make your own granola or protein bars. ""I like making chocolate chip cookie dough bites that are sweetened only with medjool dates, almond extract and mini dark chocolate chips,"" McGrane said.Create your own sauces and salad dressings. As condiments and sauces are often a hidden source of sugar in our diets, you can make your own versions while controlling the amount of sugar you add. Try using salsa as your condiment instead of ketchup. Two tablespoons of standard salsa contains 1 gram of sugar, compared to 6 grams of sugar in 2 tablespoons of ketchup, McGrane explained. If it feels impossible to escape your sugar cravings, start out by trying just one or two of these strategies. As you get the hang of those newly formed habits, slowly incorporate the other tips, one or two at a time. Taking a gradual path will help you curb your sweet tooth and set you up for improved health for the long haul. Isn't that sweet news?",2
118," (CNN)Not sleeping enough or getting a bad night's sleep over and over makes it hard to control your appetite. And that sets you up for all sorts of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes.The link between poor sleep and a greater body mass index (BMI) has been shown in study after study, but researchers typically relied on the memories of the participants to record how well they slept.Sleep apps on fitness trackers, smartphones and watches have changed all that. In a new study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers tracked sleep quality for 120,000 people for up to two years.  The results showed sleep durations and patterns are highly variable between people. Despite that, the study found people with BMIs of 30 or above -- which is considered obese by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- had slightly shorter mean sleep durations and more variable sleep patterns.It didn't take much less sleep to see the effect. People with BMIs over 30 only slept about 15 minutes less than their less weighty counterparts.There were some limitations to the study. Naps were excluded, other health conditions could not be factored in, and people who use wearable tracking devices are typically younger, healthier and from a higher socioeconomic status than those who do not wear trackers.""These are quite pricey devices, and remember, they are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,"" said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, the associate program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California. ""The results would need to be validated by the appropriate FDA-approved devices, and because the study is likely on younger people who are more economically well off, does that really apply to older folks we worry about with poor sleep?"" said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study.However, Dasgupta added, a major plus for the study is that it did monitor people for over two years, and the results corroborated prior research and were ""not surprising.""""While we cannot determine the direction of association from our study result, these findings provide further support to the notion that sleep patterns are associated with weight management and overall health,"" the authors wrote. ""The findings also support the potential value of including both sleep duration and individual sleep patterns when studying sleep-related health outcomes.""Link between sleep and eatingThere is a scientific reason why a lack of sleep is linked to appetite. When you're sleep deprived, research has shown, levels of a hormone called ghrelin spike while another hormone, leptin, takes a nosedive. The result is an increase in hunger.""The 'l' in leptin stands for lose: It suppresses appetite and therefore contributes to weight loss,"" he said. ""The 'g' in ghrelin stands for gain: This fast-acting hormone increases hunger and leads to weight gain,"" Dasgupta said.Another reason we gain weight is due to an ancient body system called the endocannabinoid system. Endocannabinoids bind to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana, which as we know, often triggers the ""munchies.""""When you're sleep deprived, you're not like, 'Oh, you know what, I want some carrots,'"" said behavioral neuroscientist Erin Hanlon, who studies the connection between brain systems and behavior at the University of Chicago, in a prior CNN interview.""You're craving sweets and salty and starchy things,"" she added. ""You want those chips, you want a cookie, you want some candy, you know?""A 2016 study by Hanlon compared the circulating levels of 2-AG, one of the most abundant endocannabinoids, in people who got four nights of normal sleep (more than eight hours) to people who only got 4.5 hours.People who were sleep-deprived reported greater increases in hunger and appetite and had higher afternoon concentrations of 2-AG than those who slept well. The sleep-deprived participants also had a rough time controlling their urges for high-carb, high-calorie snacks.Get better sleepWant more control over your appetite? Depending on your age, you are supposed to get between seven and 10 hours of sleep each night. Getting less has been linked in studies to high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, weight gain, a lack of libido, mood swings, paranoia, depression and a higher risk of diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia and some cancers.So sleep a full seven to 10 hours a night, stick to a regular bedtime and get up the same time very day, even on weekends, experts advise. Adding exercise to your daily routine is a great way to improve your sleep and improve your health. After finishing one 30-minute physical activity, you'll have less anxiety, lower blood pressure, more sensitivity to insulin and you'll sleep better that night.You can also train your brain to get more restful sleep with a few key steps:During the day, try to get good exposure to natural light, as that will help regulate your circadian rhythm.Avoid stimulants (coffee, tea) after 3 p.m. and fatty foods before bedtime.Establish a bedtime routine you can follow each night. Taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, listening to soothing music, meditating or doing light stretches are all good options.Make sure your bed and pillows are comfortable and the room is cool: Between 60 and 67 degrees is best. Don't watch TV or work in your bedroom; you want your brain to think of the room as only for sleep.Eliminate all lights -- even the blue light of cellphones or laptops can be disruptive. Dull sounds, too. Earplugs or white noise machines can be very helpful, but you can create your own with a humidifier or fan.Does that sound hard? Then sign up for our sleep newsletter and take steps toward better sleep.",2
119," (CNN)With talk of the possible availability of a vaccine candidate heating up, you might have heard the term Emergency Use Authorization -- or EUA -- all over the news lately. But what is it exactly, and how does it apply to vaccines?Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests: a medical product that gets special authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration to be used during an emergency. Sometimes it's a product that has already been FDA-approved, but for another condition, and sometimes it's a new product that hasn't yet received the agency's green light.There is a lot of ongoing concern and debate about whether any vaccine candidate should be granted an EUA -- or outright approval -- without first completing Phase 3 clinical trials.The 411 of EUAsAccording to the FDA's website, during public health emergencies, the agency can use Emergency Use Authorizations ""to help make medical products available as quickly as possible by allowing unapproved medical products to reach patients in need when there are no adequate, FDA-approved and available alternatives.""But that's only if ""the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat the identified disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.""So, in essence, what an EUA does is speed up the process of getting potentially helpful  medical products authorized for a specific use to the public during a health emergency, without the rigorous testing and subsequent scrutiny that's usually required to get FDA approval -- which traditionally takes years.When the health emergency is over, ""then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,"" according to the FDA. But the manufacturer can still submit documentation to the agency for regular approval.The EUA hasn't been around that long. The process was included within the Project  Bioshield Act passed by Congress in 2004, which enabled the federal government to prepare and stockpile new ""medical countermeasures"" during a declared public health emergency.And despite issuing many EUAs over the years, only one vaccine has ever received one -- but it was in an unusual and controversial circumstance. In 1997, the Department of Defense began a mandatory anthrax vaccination program. Shortly thereafter, soldiers claimed the vaccine made them sick, so they sued and a judge put a hold on the program in 2003. The Department of Defense asked for an EUA that then overrode the court ruling in 2005, so it could continue vaccinating military personnel -- this time on a voluntary basis.EUAs during this pandemicDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA has granted EUAs many times to a wide range of medical products, such as ventilators; personal protective equipment, including masks; molecular and antigen tests to diagnose Covid-19, and serologic tests to look for antibodies; and even treatments, such as remdesivir  and convalescent plasma.An EUA can be revoked,as in the case of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. These drugs had already been approved to treat and prevent malaria, and showed promise against the novel coronavirus in laboratory studies. Small early trials in Covid-19 patients added to the optimism, and the medication was touted by President Trump. But larger studies found the medications to be ineffective in treating patients with Covid-19. Additionally, one of the side effects could also potentially be dangerous in people who had pre-existing heart conditions. After about two and a half months with EUA, the emergency authorization was revoked.Many experts see granting an EUA to a vaccine against Covid-19 as problematic. For one, vaccines are given to healthy people by choice, unlike medications that are given to gravely ill patients who might die without them. So drugmakers have a higher bar, so to speak, to make sure there are no unexpected side effects that make healthy people sick -- and the only way to find out is in large-scale trials, like those going on right now.The FDA has said it would hold a vaccine to a higher standard. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Thursday that requirements will be stricter than for an emergency use authorization for an experimental drug.""For us, for a vaccine for which there is adequate manufacturing information, if we going to do an emergency use authorization, it is going to really be like an emergency use authorization plus,"" Marks told a seminar hosted by Duke University's Margolis Center for Health Policy. On Friday Marks and Hahn said in a joint blog post they'd be issuing more guidance ""shortly"" about how much higher the bar might be.  They noted it is up to the manufacturer to ask the FDA either for an EUA or full approval, known as a Biologics License Application. With so much at stake, we understand the importance of being as transparent as possible about the work we do, including how we will make decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines,"" Marks and Hahn wrote.The FDA has already said it would want to see an efficacy of at least 50% -- meaning any vaccine, to be considered, would need to reduce the risk of infection or of serious illness by at least 50% over a placebo.In a string of tweets by Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor and the dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, earlier this month, he noted that ""EUAs involve substandard or lesser reviews. How can you justify a substandard or lesser review for something that would be injected in tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of Americans?""Additionally, Hotez pointed out that the mRNA technology being used in two of the vaccines that are the furthest along in Phase 3 trials -- the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine -- is ""a new technology that has never before been licensed. We have no history or experience on such vaccines. Even more reason for a full/comprehensive review.""Hotez also brings up the point that in this highly politicized climate, there is a lack of confidence and trust in the government and federal agencies. ""We've seen how in 2020 the White House has abused the EUA mechanism - remember the EUA for hydroxychloroquine that was revoked? Neither does the White House or Dept. HHS,"" he tweeted.Political subtextThere is also the worry that the President is looking to make a vaccine available for political reasons during the run-up to the November election.President Trump has said several times he thinks a vaccine could be available by Election Day. Without a doubt, the pace of medical innovation has moved faster than ever before, and human vaccine trials began just 67 days after the virus was first identified. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told public health officials to prepare to distribute a potential vaccine as early as end of October. And FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said he'd consider an EUA before Phase 3 trials are complete.Still, several government health officials have told CNN the idea that a vaccine could be available to the general public by November 3 is unlikely. ""There is a big concern about the sort of political expediency and when this [October] date was being picked ... and just picking this date, before the election, sort of stokes those fears that the government isn't being duly diligent to make sure that any vaccine really is not just efficacious, but has few side effects,"" said Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and former director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the CDC.""So, we're all optimistic that there are currently three vaccines in Phase 3 trials -- that maybe one of these vaccines is so excellent that you don't need to vaccinate 30,000 people to find that it's going to work. However, the concern is that if you don't do a full set of these so-called Phase 3 trials, that you will miss rare side effects,"" he said on CNN earlier this month.When a vaccine -- or other medical product -- is given to enough people, rare side effects can turn up. In 1976, the government  launched a  hastily produced  vaccine about seven months after the Ford administration was led to believe a pandemic caused by a new strain of flu was imminent.The pandemic never materialized, but 40 million people got vaccinated under a compulsory program. That vaccine was later linked to a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine. The link was never proved, but the program was stopped.Also, in order to demonstrate efficacy of the vaccine, dozens of people in the placebo group would need to become infected, while very few -- if any -- infections would be seen in the vaccinated group of trial participants. It may take weeks, if not months, to see that difference between the two populations.Lack of trustThe lack of public trust and vaccine hesitancy are real. A CNN poll in August showed 40% of Americans do not want to get a vaccine when it becomes available -- even if it is cheap and easy to get. Such a low uptake of the vaccine could hurt the country's ability to get the virus under control and return to normalcy.If history is any indication, skepticism -- if not outright mistrust -- about an unapproved vaccine is nothing new. In a study published in 2009, months after the US declared a public health emergency due to the H1N1 influenza and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic, researchers explored the public's willingness to use a drug or a vaccine with an EUA (not full FDA approval) by surveying a representative sample of more than 1,500 US adults. They found more than 77% of respondents would be moderately, very or extremely worried if offered an unapproved vaccine; 63% said they would not take it.But there were also some other key factors that would convince respondents that a vaccine authorized under an EUA was safe to use. If the vaccine were administered by a public health professional, 55% of respondents say they would take it. If it came with a fact sheet, just over 57% of those surveyed said they would get it. And if it were administered by their own health care provider, that number shot up to 68%. Transparency is key in gaining trust.Those in charge of the country's health agencies -- Alex Azar at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Francis Collins at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the FDA's Dr. Stephen Hahn and the CDC's Dr. Robert Redfield -- have all tried to reassure Americans that politics will not play a role in when a vaccine becomes available.Fauci has said he believes a vaccine will likely come closer to the end of the year, and that he wouldn't be comfortable with making a vaccine widely available unless the scientific evidence backed it up. ""I'm not a regulator. I mean, I just do the science. I'd report the science in an accurate way, and certainly if I saw interference, I would be very disturbed and call it out,"" Fauci told CNN's Jim Acosta on ""The Situation Room.""As for an emergency use authorization, ""I would not be comfortable with a vaccine unless it was shown in a clinical trial clearly to be safe and effective,"" Fauci said during an interview on NBC's ""Today."" Dr. Luciana Borio, the former acting chief scientist at the FDA, agrees that a vaccine must be shown to be safe and effective first and foremost.But if a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, it should not be withheld until all the stringent licensure requirements for FDA approval are met, because some of the requirements cannot be generated quickly.""Safe & effective vaccines can save lives and help contain the pandemic,"" Borio tweeted. ""The EUA is the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for distributing vaccines that have been shown to be safe & effective in phase 3 RCTs (randomized controlled trials) but have not yet met all of the FDA's standards for licensure.""  Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine program, said that ""it would be unethical"" to not move quickly to put out a Covid-19 vaccine if it is proven to work.""If we know a vaccine is 70% or 80% or 90% effective, it would be unethical to hold it back,"" Slaoui said during a CNN interview on Friday.On Tuesday, nine biopharmaceutical companies, including those who are furthest along in their vaccine testing programs, signed an unusual pledge to uphold ""high ethical standards,"" suggesting they won't seek premature government approval for Covid-19 vaccines.They pledged to ""Only submit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA.""In fact, later that same day, AstraZeneca, one of the signatories of the pledge, said it had paused its trials globally because of an unexplained illness in one volunteer in the UK. The drugmaker called the halt ""a routine action.""""In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline,"" AstraZeneca said in a statement sent to CNN.According to the FDA's guidance, any vaccine -- whether under emergency authorization or approved -- needs to either prevent disease or at least decrease severity by at least 50%.Despite all the intrigue, it may be worthwhile to circle back to the original criteria for an EUA -- in particular, the stipulation that it only be granted when ""there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.""While most people understandably don't want to hear it, there is a reasonable alternative, which has worked well  in many places around the world, and that is abiding by basic public health measures: wearing a mask, maintaining physical distance, practicing good hand hygiene and staying away from large, especially indoor crowds -- especially indoors.Following those rules will significantly reduce the likelihood of people getting sick, and slow the transmission of the virus. It will also buy us more time to make sure we get the evidence supporting the vaccine totally nailed down.",2
120," (CNN)While many colleges and universities are offering classes online, that hasn't necessarily stopped students from gathering. And now some college towns are grappling with outbreaks of Covid-19 as the start of the fall semester complicates local responses to the pandemic. ""We are urging students to understand the imperative role that they play in stopping this community spread and, ultimately, saving lives,"" said Mayor Aaron Stephens of East Lansing, Michigan, where Michigan State University students were asked to quarantine after the local health department reported 342 new cases among people affiliated with the university since August 24.The outbreak started as students returned to East Lansing for the fall semester, the health department's statement said. MSU resumed classes on September 2. And while most are online, many students had ""binding off-campuses leases or simply desired to physically return to the university community.""""MSU is committed to doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" MSU Physician David Weismantel said. ""The safety of our entire community is a priority and we all have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus.""Kelly Girtz, the mayor of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia -- home to the University of Georgia -- told CNN Saturday his city has seen a ""dramatic spike"" in cases after maintaining lower case counts and death counts throughout the summer. UGA classes began August 20.""Clearly it's the return to campus of large numbers of students who are not here through the summertime,"" he said.""Certainly young people are going to do the things that young people do, so we need to create the underlying conditions that keep people safe,"" Girtz said, calling for better coordination among state and national leaders. ""So that means very low allowance of gatherings and really as much digital or online learning as possible.""Six students at Miami University in Ohio were cited after holding a house party even though at least one of them tested positive for Covid-19, according to police records. The university declined to comment, citing federal privacy laws, but said students would face disciplinary action if they violate quarantine orders or the city ordinance on mass gatherings.Arkansas reported a record high of 1,107 new cases on Friday, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson said a backlog in testing was to blame. About 13% of the state's cases were attributed to young people in college communities, according to Dr. José Romero, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health -- though he said that was down from previous counts, calling it a ""good indicator."" More than 6.4 million infections have been recorded in the US and 193,482 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Air pollution from wildfires could lead to vulnerabilityDoctors warn that bad air quality stemming from smoke produced by the wildfires ravaging Western states could make people more vulnerable to coronavirus infections.""Multiple studies have shown a correlation between higher levels of pollution in the air and greater spread and severity of Covid-19 cases,"" said Dr. Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, citing several studies conducted in the United States, China and Italy. ""Some studies have also shown that exposure of lung tissue to pollution may increase susceptibility to viral infections.""Smoke from wildfires can irritate the lungs and cause inflammation that can affect the immune system, said Dr. Rekha Murthy, an infectious disease specialist at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. That inflammation can make people more at risk of lung infections. ""Whenever the lining of the lung or the airways become inflamed or damaged, it increases the potential for inhaled viral particles to take hold in the lungs and cause infection,"" Murthy said.There are also concerns that smoke-filled air will drive coronavirus-positive people indoors, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. That, she said, could potentially increase the spread of the virus. ""We know being outdoors versus indoors reduces the rate of transmission ... but now people are being told you have to go indoors because you don't want to breathe in the air that could cause respiratory issues,"" she said. ""But you don't want to be indoors with other individuals and have a higher rate of contracting COVID-19... so, it's really a catch-22.""To prevent the possible spread of coronavirus during the intense fire season, those remaining indoors due to poor air quality should stay away from anyone who is not in their immediate household, Wen said.Early mask wearing would have saved livesAbout 150,000 of the lives lost would have been saved if more Americans wore masks earlier on in the coronavirus pandemic, a health expert says.  ""If the President had said from day one everyone is wearing a mask, we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" said CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University. Reiner pointed to how Germany handled the pandemic. ""They haven't been the best. They haven't been the worst. They've been OK in their pandemic response and they've had about 10,000 deaths,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett.The US has four times the population of Germany. ""So we'd have about 45,000 deaths in this country,"" he said. ""So about 150,000 people would be alive.""He reiterated the importance of embracing masks. ""If you want to think about why we still have 40,000 cases a day and 1,000 deaths a day in this country, it's because we're still talking about masks,"" Reiner said. ""It's so basic.""More deaths predicted if people let their guards downAn influential model is predicting a catastrophic winter with a significant rise in coronavirus deaths.A possible scenario sees 415,090 Covid-19 deaths by January, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington says in its latest forecast. The worst-case scenario is 611,000 deaths by January 1.""When we look ahead into the winter with seasonality kicking in, people becoming clearly less vigilant, you know mask use is down, mobility is up in the nation, you put all those together and we look like we're going to have a very deadly December ahead of us in terms of toll of coronavirus,""  IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper.Despite the dire prediction, President Donald Trump says the US has done ""really well"" in fighting the virus. ""I really do believe we're rounding the corner and the vaccines are right there, but not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump said. Speaking with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he does not agree with the President's statements.""We're plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day, and the deaths of around 1,000,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He said test positivity is increasing in some regions of the country and people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather.""That's not good for a respiratory-borne virus,"" he said. Fauci warned that the country needs to get the levels down lower ""so that when you go into a more precarious situation, like the fall and the winter, you won't have a situation where you really are at a disadvantage right from the very beginning.""",2
121," (CNN)The AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial, halted last week after an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers, will resume, the University of Oxford announced Saturday.The university, which is developing the vaccine with AstraZeneca, did not say when the trial would resume. AstraZeneca said the trial will only resume in the United Kingdom, adding that it's working with health authorities across the world to determine when other trials can resume. Before the pause, the company was testing its vaccine, dubbed the Oxford vaccine, in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa.The university said in a statement that some 18,000 individuals around the world have received study vaccines as part of the trial. ""In large trials such as this, it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety,"" the statement added.US National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told a Senate hearing Wednesday that pausing a trial was a standard precaution that is meant to ensure experimental vaccines don't cause serious reactions among participants.""To have a clinical hold, as has been placed on AstraZeneca, as of yesterday, because of a single serious adverse event, is not at all unprecedented,"" Collins said at a hearing of the Senate Heath, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. The companies promised to wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely.AstraZeneca did not provide any details on the issue that caused the trial to stop. While AstraZeneca didn't specify what the issue was, at the hearing on Wednesday Collins said the AstraZeneca hold was due to a ""spinal cord problem.""On Wednesday, AstraZeneca issued a statement denying news reports that suggested the trial was stopped because of a case of transverse myelitis -- a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord. On the same day, AstraZeneca said it had paused its coronavirus vaccine trial not once but twice because of adverse events. ""We can also confirm that there was a brief trial pause in July while a safety review took place after one volunteer was confirmed to have an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which the independent panel concluded was unrelated to the vaccine,"" a company spokesperson said.The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the US. It has the backing of the US federal government. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTec are the other two groups with Phase 3 trials under way, also with federal government funding.",2
122," (CNN)Primary school students in China experienced more depressive symptoms and made more suicide attempts after schools closed for the pandemic, a new study found.When Covid-19 hit China in January, the Ministry of Education postponed the start of spring semester to late April. That closure separated children from their friends and their broader community network, and seems to have had an impact on their mental well-being.The study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open, compared reports of mental health problems in November -- before the pandemic started -- to mid-May, two weeks into the new spring semester when schools had re-opened.Researchers from Anhui Medical University got results back from surveys for 1,241 students who were in grades 4 through 8, and in junior high. The kids lived in Chizhou, Anhui Province, an area that did not have a large number of Covid-19 cases.Nearly 25% of the students reported depressive symptoms in May, when only about 19% did in November. Suicide attempts more than doubled -- at 6.4% in May compared to the 3% who made suicide attempts in November. There were no similar increases seen in reports of children who reported feeling an increase anxiety.Researchers hope school leaders will use this research to prepare the necessary mental health services to help children as they return to school following the lockdowns.This study is consistent with others that have found that enforced social isolation can cause mental health challenges for children.Benefits of in-person school outweigh virus risksAs states grappled with how to safely reopen schools earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics led a push for students to be physically present in classrooms rather than continue in remote learning for the sake of their well-being.The group, which represents and guides pediatricians across the country, updated its back-to-school recommendations in June to say evidence shows the academic, mental and physical benefits of in-person learning outweigh the risks from the coronavirus.""The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school,"" the group said on its website.""""The importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020. Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation,"" the group said.What it looked like when schools reopenedThis overhaul of the traditional school day become reality in August, as schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Indiana opened their doors for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic abruptly shuttered classrooms across the United States -- all while the virus remained largely uncontrolled.More students and teachers tested positive for Covid-19, some schools were forced to suddenly change plans, while others opted to delay the start of the school year giving educators more time to prepare for in-person classes.""What we do know is children have a harder time social distancing. And we can't put a whole bunch of them in a classroom with a teacher right now,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in an August briefing announcing a delay.""Other states that have tried to open this new school year are now having to close. We don't want to start and stop. That may be more difficult on our children,"" he said.Now, many have embraced virtual learning, which has posed its own set of challenges.Schools across the country have reported system outages, cyberattacks and other issues that prompted some districts to postpone the first day of class.If you're experiencing a suicidal crisis, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or text the Crisis Text line by texting HOME to 741741 to get help.",2
123," (CNN)Vaccine clinical trials are notoriously difficult to conduct.They involve thousands, or even tens of thousands, of participants, and typically go on for years. The chances that one or more of these study volunteers will develop a health issue is quite high.Most of the time, that health problem is not related to the vaccine being investigated, and the trial can continue. But sometimes there is a chance that the issue -- called an ""adverse event"" in medical parlance -- could be related to the vaccine.In that case, the trial is paused so the incident can be investigated.On Wednesday, it came to light that pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had paused its coronavirus vaccine trial not once but twice because of adverse events. The second pause is still in effect while researchers look into one volunteer's ""unexplained illness.""While Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Wednesday implied that pausing a Phase 3 trial was a somewhat common occurrence, vaccine trial experts interviewed by CNN say it is not common.""It's unusual to pause a Phase 3 trial on a safety basis,"" said Dr. Carl Fichtenbaum, an infectious disease expert at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. ""It's uncommon.""One trial, two pausesAstraZeneca announced Tuesday it had paused global trials of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the study participants.Then on Wednesday, a company spokesperson revealed the trial had also paused briefly in July to investigate an illness in another study volunteer, who ""was confirmed to have an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which an independent panel had concluded was unrelated to the vaccine.""AstraZeneca is one of three companies in the US currently in Phase 3 trials for a coronavirus vaccine. Each trial is aiming to enroll 30,000 people; half will get the vaccine and half will get a placebo, which is a shot of saline that does nothing.""With that many people, it's inevitable that someone, at some point, will get sick,"" said Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.Carrie Wolinetz, associate director for science policy at the National Institutes of Health, agrees. ""Adverse events happen in the normal course of very large trials. It's really a matter of determining whether it's a coincidental event or was it really something linked to the trial itself,"" she said.The coronavirus vaccine trials are what's called ""double blind,"" so when someone gets sick, neither the participants nor the doctors know if they received the vaccine or the placebo.The only people who know are members of the trial's Data Safety and Monitoring Board -- an external group of experts that monitors the trial.Each trial has its own protocol, but when an illness arises that causes concern, the DSMB will see if the volunteer received the vaccine or a placebo.If the volunteer received the vaccine, then the questions begin. If it's believed that the illness might possibly be related to the vaccine, the DSMB might recommend that the trial pause while the illness is investigated.After investigating, the DSMB might recommend that the trial continue as before, or it might suggest a change in the trial protocol, or it could recommend that the trial be shut down.On Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, commented on the AstraZeneca trial pause.""It's unfortunate that it happened. Hopefully they'll work it out and be able to proceed along with the remainder of the trial, but you don't know. They need to investigate it further,"" Fauci said.Hitting the pause buttonRedfield said Wednesday that in his research, he at times had to put trials on hold.""I've conducted a number of clinical trials in my days, both at Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center] and University of Maryland, of which I had the trial put on hold because of adverse reactions until we could evaluate whether that adverse reaction was something that was associated with the investigational product, and if so, was it serious enough that we then had to stop the trial,"" Redfield said at an online forum held by Research!America.Redfield did not specify whether he meant vaccine trials, nor did he specify whether he meant Phase 3 trials or trials in earlier phases, which can be more prone to adverse events because the vaccine hasn't been as well tested.CNN reached out to a spokesperson for Redfield for clarification, but they did not provide a comment.Illnesses that necessitate a pause don't occur very often, according to three vaccinologists -- Frenck, Fichtenbaum and Dr. Saad Omer -- who, combined, have worked on more than 100 vaccine trials.""In Phase 3, it's uncommon to have a pause,"" Frenck said. ""I've seen it happen a few times.""He estimates that pauses in Phase 3 trials due to a study subject becoming ill happens ""in under 10% of trials -- probably under 5%.""According to Fichtenbaum, ""Phase 3 trials don't typically pause. I've only seen it handful of times in my experience.""Both Fichtenbaum and Frenck have served on DSMBs. Additionally, Frenck is a researcher in both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer coronavirus vaccine trials, and Fichtenbaum is an investigator in the Moderna coronavirus vaccine trial.Omer is director of the Yale Institute for Global Health and has been the principal investigator in several vaccine trials.""It's not unheard of that a trial has paused. It's a very real possibility,"" he said. ""But I wouldn't call it common.""Confusion about the cause of AstraZeneca's most recent pauseAstraZeneca on Wednesday issued a statement denying news reports that suggested the trial was stopped the second time because of a case of transverse myelitis -- a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord.""Reports claiming to be based on comments made earlier today by our CEO stating that we have confirmed that a participant in our clinical trial suffered from transverse myelitis are incorrect. He stated that there is no final diagnosis and that there will not be one until more tests are carried out,"" a spokesperson for the pharmaceutical giant said in a statement emailed to CNN.""Those tests will be delivered to an independent safety committee that will review the event and establish a final diagnosis,"" the spokesperson added.The New York Times had quoted a source saying a trial volunteer had transverse myelitis. And STAT News reported that the company's CEO, Pascal Soriot, told investors in a conference call that the trial was stopped because a woman volunteering in the trial had symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis.While AstraZeneca didn't specify what the issue was, at a Congressional hearing Wednesday, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said the AstraZeneca hold was due to a ""spinal cord problem.""""With an abundance of caution, at a time like this, you put a clinical hold. You investigate carefully to see if anybody else who received that vaccine or any of the other vaccines might have had a similar finding of a spinal cord problem,"" Collins explained.He added that ""this ought to be reassuring to everybody listening,"" as this shows the ""focus first on safety.""",2
124," (CNN)Growing up with ""Sesame Street"" in the early 1980s, I found pieces of myself in Cookie Monster's sweet tooth, Big Bird's gentleness and in Grover, who was outgoing and always willing to help others, even though he made a lot of hilarious mistakes. There was even a lady named Maria who was Puerto Rican, just like my family. Maria (played by actress Sonia Manzano) looked and sounded like one of my aunts. I wanted to be a flower girl when she married Luis on ""Sesame Street."" And then along came the movies, which sealed my lifelong obsession with Jim Henson's Muppets.Seeing ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" when I was 7 changed my life. Just like the characters, I studied theater in college, moved to the Big Apple to make my dreams come true and even started doing stand-up comedy, just like my hero, Fozzie Bear. Friendship. Perseverance. Hope. The Muppets helped me get through the lean times and sang along with me when I celebrated any small victories. I didn't know that these amazing characters would prepare me to raise my own child during the rough times we'd face over the past few months. A deep dive into the MuppetsIn my 30s, I took my love of all things Muppet-related to academia. In graduate school, I studied the informal learning that happens for young children when exposed to Muppet movies and other media created strictly for entertainment. I found that kids as young as 3 years old were able to recognize and categorize positive and negative characters, behaviors and situations. Young kids also learned language while being entertained by these movies and television programs, especially when watching with a parent or other close adult. The children immediately picked up new words, when placed in context, and learned more complicated words and ideas by asking the adult watching along, ""What does that mean?""There is much more beneath the surface of ""Sesame Street""'s curriculum-based programming, too. My friends on ""the street"" taught me my ABCs and 123s, of course. But I also learned about helping others, community and what to do with all of the big feelings that took over my little body. These lessons carried with me throughout my life and shaped my relationships with others.I was 18 years old when my grandmother, who was the heart of my family, died. I remember my younger cousin, who was about 7 years old, struggling to understand and cope with her passing. The well-meaning adults, lost in their own grief, used flowery language — ""she's resting in peace,"" ""she's passed on,"" ""she's gone."" As tears streamed down his face, my cousin called out for her and wanted to see her again. I tried to help him understand the permanence of the situation. It didn't even occur to me at the time that I was using the same language the grown-ups on ""Sesame Street"" had used to help Big Bird and 6-year-old me understand Mr. Hooper's death. Helping me parent in a pandemicI had no idea how valuable these lessons of kindness, honesty and emotional intelligence would become once I became a parent. Back in March, a week after my son's third birthday party, I picked him up from preschool. We stopped at the local grocery store — where everyone knows him by name — and went home. We didn't realize that would be the last time my kiddo saw anybody beside his parents for six months — and counting. Like so many American families, when we first began our stay-at-home safety measures, we really thought it was only going to be for a couple of weeks. A month, tops. My son is a tiny empath. One time, I told him that his swim class had been canceled because his instructor was sick. Instead of being upset that he had to miss his swim lesson, my son cried with worry over his teacher's mystery ailment. ""Oh no! What's wrong with Mr. D? Will he be OK?"" That's why, when faced with a global pandemic, my husband and I chose not to ring the alarm bells right away. We told our son that it was just time for everyone to stay at home and spend time with their families for a while, like a little vacation. That seemed to satisfy him.As I grew anxious about the situation at hand, I turned to ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" and channeled Dr. Teeth and the lyrics from ""You Can't Take No for an Answer:""""Whatcha gonna do when the dimes get toughAnd the world's treating you unkind?You gotta hang on to your optimistic outlookAnd keep possession of your positive state of mind""Our family took walks, read stories and made beautiful messes, but it wasn't easy. As more time passed, it was becoming harder to juggle entertaining a toddler and keeping up with our work commitments.  There are big germs out thereAs it became clear that we were in this for the long haul, things in our home got a little looser. Rules and structure took a backseat to safety and comfort. And my son started asking more questions. It was time to change the language we were using. When we potty-trained my son, we talked a lot about hand-washing and germs. So I knew I had a familiar place to start the conversation. We talked about the time he got a runny nose at school because his friend had a runny nose, how he had a fever and how we had to go to the doctor. I told him that there are some big germs out there, and if we get together with lots of friends, it might make us all not feel well. I was honest without scaring him with the gravity of Covid-19. He took it in stride and then said, ""OK. You wanna make some animals with my Play-Doh?""Sure, maybe I left out the fact that some of his friends are, in fact, back at school. I'm heartbroken about everything he's missing out on. Every family has difficult choices to make — and there is no one correct answer. I'm not a parenting expert. I'm just a working mom doing the best I can to keep ""sweeping the clouds away"" for my boy. Sometimes, he has a question I can't answer. Instead of making something up — even toddlers can smell baloney a mile away — I'll say ""I don't know. Let's try to figure it out together."" It's what Kermit would do. 'Smarter, stronger, kinder' That's been the mantra sung at the end of every episode of ""Sesame Street"" since 2016, and it's something I try to take to heart every day. Not just as a parent but as a person living on this planet in 2020.Last night, my kid went to bed happy, healthy and safe. To quote his favorite Cookie Monster song, that's ""good enough for me.""",2
125," (CNN)After time off from exercising, it's understandable if you're having a hard time getting motivated. You may even feel a bit bad, but I'm here to say it's important to go easy on yourself. Even if you start ever so slowly, know that returning to a workout routine means you'll soon get those feel-good serotonin and dopamine boosts from exercising. And let's face it, with so much time cooped up at home due to coronavirus lockdown measures, it's been all too easy for many of us to gain a couple of pounds or more. But if you join me, we can all be in this together.  Now let's think about the path to get back on track. While it might seem tempting to try to whip yourself back into shape by jumping into heavy weight training or intense cardio out of the gate, this cold-turkey approach will overstress your system — and you could easily hurt yourself by training too hard, too soon. That's why I'm sharing a seven-part series of weekly articles to safely guide you back into an effective workout regimen that will set you up for long-term success. This first one sets the foundation by guiding you into a positive mindset and getting you moving in the right direction. There will be plenty of time later in the series for intensive workouts, but for now, we're going to ease our way back. So, whether you're reestablishing an exercise routine — or even starting for the first time — read on for an easy three-step process to get you on a consistent path.READ PART II: Master body-weight movements: How to reboot your workout routineReconnect your mind and bodyWhen getting back into an exercise regimen, it's natural to focus on how much better we want to make ourselves look, but let's stop for a moment and think about how physical activity will improve the way we feel. Any negativity we might be feeling about our bodies being ""out of shape"" actually stems more from our minds and bodies being out of sync.Remember, physical activity produces those feel-good chemicals in our brains that reinforce our positive mind-body connection. Developing this mind-body connection gets you in a positive mindset and will help you establish a sense of control and respect for your body, paving a path for your exercise efforts that's sustainable — which, in turn, will lead to achieving your goals. READ PART III: Strength training with free weights: How to reboot your workout routineStep one: Mind your muscle movementWhen trying to restore and strengthen this connection after being sedentary, I recommend practicing this progressive muscle contraction/relaxation daily for a week and then several times per week thereafter. This is best done lying down, but you can do it from almost any position as it relies on muscle contractions with very little to no movement.Begin by focusing your attention in your body, on your breathing. During this exercise, your breath will serve as the link between your mind and muscles.Inhale as you close your eyes tightly and tighten your jaw by clenching your teeth. Exhale as you release the tension, letting your eyes remain gently closed. Inhale fully into your rib cage and hold your breath, creating tension in your chest, upper back and neck. Exhale to release. Inhale and squeeze your hands into fists, trying to make contact and create tension in all the muscles of your arms. Exhale to release. Inhale to contract your glutes and pelvic floor muscles while tightening your abdomen as well. Exhale to release. Inhale to curl your toes and create tension in all the muscles of your legs. Exhale to release.Take five additional, long, deep breaths, while your mind rests in awareness of your body's state of total relaxation. READ PART IV: Get moving faster with cardio: How to reboot your workout routineBreathe into good postureThe safety and efficacy of any exercise program is predicated on executing proper form. If your posture is poor and movement is restricted, it'll be difficult to perform almost any exercise safely. So, it's in your best interest to optimize your breathing before beginning or restarting an exercise program.What does breathing have to do with posture and movement? The short answer is: everything. The shallow, upper-chest-oriented breathing pattern many of us have fallen into reduces the function of our diaphragm, requiring upper-body muscles to compensate as accessory breathing muscles that lift the rib cage during inhalation. This creates painful, movement-limiting, chronic upper-body tension and poor posture. For more on the biomechanics of proper diaphragmatic breathing, check out my article ""Breathe better to move better: Train to breathe like a pro athlete."" READ PART V: Biking your way to better health: How to reboot your workout routineStep two: Move your ribs while breathingRegularly practicing breathing better will decrease tension to restore mobility and establish good posture  for proper exercise form. Here's a basic way to practice every day:Sit comfortably in a chair with your hands resting on your legs. Close your eyes. Begin lengthening and deepening your inhalations and exhalations. As you breathe, concentrate on the movement of your rib cage. Inhale, filling the lowest lobes of your lungs so that your lower ribs externally rotate and expand out to the sides. When you exhale, completely empty your lungs, using core muscles, almost like an abdominal crunch, to move your lower ribs in, back, and down toward your waist.Repeat this for five to 10 breaths, practicing several times per day.If you're having trouble getting your ribs to move, place your hands on your lower ribs while you breathe, so that you can guide them in and out under your fingers. You can also try the breathing bridge exercise featured in my recent article on exercises to offset too much sitting.READ PART VI: Safely ramp up exercise intensity: How to reboot your workout routineWalk your way to a healthy routineWhen establishing an exercise routine, consistency is the key to long-term success. Ideally, exercising regularly needs to become a lifestyle habit akin to toothbrushing. Rather than diving head-first into an overwhelming workout that's too time-consuming and strenuous to sustain, begin by forging an easy-to-accomplish daily walking habit.Because walking is so accessible, people often discount its benefits, making it one of the most underrated fat-burning, mind-body exercises.Step three: Establish a walking habit Start by walking just five to 10 minutes daily over the first few days while you figure out the best time and place for your walks. Once you've determined the logistics, begin adding a few minutes more to each walk. Ideally, you want to get up to about 20 to 30 minutes per day.On days you can walk longer, that's great, but don't put pressure on yourself to do more, which could sabotage your daily habit. Likewise, on days you can only walk a few minutes — still do it. Of course, if you walk outside, the weather won't always cooperate. On those days, a few sets of walking lunges inside or marching in place might be your only alternative (if you don't have access to a treadmill). The important thing is that you do something active during the time you would've normally walked. Don't break your habit!Keep in mind that walking at a moderate-to-brisk pace can be very effective for fat burning. This is especially true when in a fasted state (not having eaten in a few hours). When your stomach is empty and insulin levels are low, your body relies on fat as its primary energy source.READ PART VII: Why recovery is the key to effective exercise: How to reboot your workout routine In terms of mind-body benefits, when you take your walks disconnected from your devices, it gives your mind a much-needed tech break, enabling you to tune into the sensations in your body. Even better, walk outside to gain the health benefits of green space and vitamin D.Here are some additional ways to increase the health benefits of your walks.Once you've established a daily walking habit, it creates a platform for sustainably expanding your exercise program.This is especially true when in a fasted state (not having eaten in a few hours).

But to ensure long-term success, it's important to map out a logistical plan of where and when you'll be training to avoid unexpected hiccups that can quickly snowball into excuses not to work out.When? Not having enough time is probably the most common excuse for skipping exercise. Don't let that be your excuse! If you can't find a dedicated 30- to 45-minute time slot at least three times per week, trade out your daily walking time on those days.Where? Will you be returning to your old gym? If so, are you comfortable with the safety precautions they have in place to fight coronavirus? Is there potential for gym capacity limitations to impact your ability to work out during the time frame you've allocated?If you're planning to work out at home, it's important to create a dedicated home workout space, so you don't run into issues like clutter or other family members needing the space.Remember these three stepsDevelop a strategy that helps you anticipate and deal with potential issues before they arise. And leverage the three-step process in this article to set your foundation:1. Use the progressive muscle contraction/relaxation exercise to strengthen your mind-body connection.2. Practice breathing with rib movement to create good posture.3. Walk every day to establish a daily exercise habit. Using the three steps above, you'll not only build a foundation for returning to regular exercise but forge a commitment to a healthier lifestyle that's built to last.

126," (CNN)Wildfires have broken out across the United States on an unprecedented scale, with 77 large complexes of fires engulfing 3 million acres in a matter of weeks.While the fires themselves only cover a small portion of California, Oregon and Washington, at least 24 people have died as of September 11. And the smoke they are producing is creating a widespread health problem.Satellite images show smoke covering much of the Pacific coastline, with major cities there seeing very high Air Quality Index numbers, indicating unhealthy air. That's a problem for the elderly and young children, as well as those with asthma and Covid-19 or other breathing conditions.""The weather and geography in the Bay Area and valleys of California can also trap the smoke close to the surface, which can keep the smoke trapped near the ground at certain times of the day in certain locations where people live and breathe,"" said CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller.Here's some advice for reducing your exposure risk and keeping yourself and your family safe.Wildfire smoke includes particles from burning vegetation and building materials mixed with gases. If your eyes feel like they're stinging, smoke exposure could also be inflicting other damage. Particles could be getting into your respiratory system.Exposure can cause chest pain, a fast heartbeat or wheezing or bring on an asthma attack. Besides coughing and trouble breathing, many people experience symptoms similar to a sinus infection, such as headaches, sore throat, a runny nose and even tiredness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Wildfire smoke can be especially harmful to the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with chronic heart and lung diseases. Because children breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults and their airways are still developing, they may experience more severe symptoms.Some people may even experience illnesses like bronchitis due to the fine particles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Those with asthma or lung disease living in wildfire country should consult their doctors.Staying healthy when it's smokyIf you see a haze, smell smoke or know of a wildfire in your area or a place you plan to visit, check the Air Quality Index to see whether you need to limit your time outdoors.When advised to stay inside, keep your windows and doors closed. It's OK to keep the air conditioner running, but the CDC recommends making sure the filter is clean, and close the fresh-air intake to prevent smoke from entering.It's also important to keep indoor air clean by not burning candles, using gas stoves or fireplaces, or smoking. Running a vacuum can also keep particles circulating in the air.Dust masks actually trap large particles and don't protect your lungs from smoke inhalation, but a mask that uses a filtering respirator can offer some protection. The CDC also has tips for how effective different types of masks can be, depending on your exposure.Even if the air outside or in your home looks clear, it may not be free of harmful microscopic particles, especially if the wildfires and smoke persist for weeks.Pediatric pulmonologists at the Breathing Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado also recommended changing your clothes if you've been outside, rinsing out red, irritated eyes and drinking fluids to keep from being dehydrated. Parents should seek emergency care for their children if they experience real difficulty breathing or a change in their level of consciousness.There is a low risk of long-term effects of wildfire smoke exposure for healthy individuals.",2
127," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci said it could be the end of 2021 before life gets back to how it was before Covid-19.""If you're talking about getting back to a degree of normality which resembles where we were prior to Covid, it's going to be well into 2021, maybe even towards the end of 2021,"" Fauci said Friday.A vaccine will help, but there are caveats, Fauci said in a series of interviews Friday.   Fauci has said repeatedly that it's possible at least one of the vaccines being tested could get emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year or early next year. But it won't be available to everyone immediately.""By the time you mobilize the distribution of the vaccinations, and you get the majority, or more, of the population vaccinated and protected, that's likely not going to happen to the mid or end of 2021,"" he  told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell. One stumbling block -- keeping the vaccines cold. Most of the experimental coronavirus vaccines must be kept frozen. Speaking during a Friends of the Global Fight webinar earlier on Friday, Fauci said, ""One of the things that's always an issue is the cold storage issue, and the 'cold chain' that is so often required."" Debunking nonsensePlus, people are not always doing what they should do to control the spread of the virus, even now, Fauci said.""When you're dealing with a situation that requires behavioral change, we in the United States have a significant issue that I'm very disappointed in,"" Fauci said during the webinar.""It was stunning to me ... that in some states and cities and counties, you would see television clips of people crowded indoors at bars, which is a superspreading event if you ever saw it.""Young people may think they are not going to get dangerously ill, and get careless, Fauci said.""But what they forget is their societal responsibility to not propagate the outbreak because if they get infected, they're likely going to infect someone else who then might infect someone who really is vulnerable and will have a serious severe consequence."" And people are spreading misinformation, making the virus even harder to fight.""The one thing that bothers me is the amount of things that aren't evidence-based, and we've seen examples of that in the United States like claims that certain drugs have a great positive effect when there's no scientific evidence whatsoever that they have a positive effect,"" Fauci said.""And yet it gets ingrained and I and my colleagues have to spend a lot of time trying to debunk that. And you're in the middle of a pandemic and you're trying hard to address all the appropriate issues, it is truly a waste of time to have to debunk nonsense.""Fauci also cautioned that just because coronaviruses are in the spotlight, people should not forget  the flu.""The one thing I've learned throughout the years is don't put anything past the flu -- don't take anything for granted,"" he said during the MSNBC interview. There ""a hint of potential good news"" when it comes to flu season. In Australia, where the flu season just ended, ""They have had the lightest flu season in memory -- which most people think is because they're doing things to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection with masks, distancing, avoiding crowds, outdoor more than indoor. That what they've done as a secondary offshoot of that is they brought down the level of influenza cases, very, very low,"" he said. He added that if  Americans can do this, he's optimistic the country will have a light flu season too. ",2

131," (CNN)Jeffery Lynn Johnson, 58, who appeared in ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,"" died by an apparent suicide during an argument with his wife, the Oklahoma City Police Department told CNN on Monday.  Johnson -- a former reptile dealer -- was one of several people interviewed in episode 4 of the enormously popular 2020 docuseries on Netflix. According to a police incident report, officers were dispatched to the Johnson family home shortly after 10 p.m. on September 8 for a reported attempted suicide.Johnson's wife, Charity, told police her husband killed himself in front of her during an argument in their garage. Their 4- and 5-year-old children were inside the house at the time, the report says.  Johnson still had a pulse on the scene and was taken to a hospital but was later pronounced dead, according to the report.  An attorney for Joseph Maldonado, the show's central figure known as Joe Exotic, confirmed he had spoken to Johnson's widow about the incident.According to the report, Johnson had ""no mental health history.""

132," (CNN)Eddie Redmayne has addressed the controversy surrounding his Oscar-nominated role in ""The Danish Girl,"" calling his decision to play transgender pioneer Lili Elbe in the 2015 drama a ""mistake.""  The ""Fantastic Beasts"" star, who is preparing for a new West End production of ""Cabaret,"" was speaking to UK publication the Sunday Times. ""The Danish Girl,"" directed by Tom Hooper, is inspired by the story of Elbe, one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Although Redmayne was nominated for a string of awards for his performance, his casting as Elbe  prompted complaints, with many critics arguing that the role should have gone to a trans actor.At the time, trans writer Carol Grant described his casting as ""regressive, reductive, and contributes to harmful stereotypes."" She said: ""What should've been a celebration of a very complex, compelling transgender figure is instead transmisogynist, and just plain-old misogynist in general."" In his interview with the Sunday Times, Redmayne said the criticism was justified, admitting that while he had the best intentions, taking the role was a ""mistake"" and he wouldn't accept it if it were offered today. ""No, I wouldn't take it on now,"" the 39-year-old star said, adding: ""The bigger discussion about the frustrations around casting is because many people don't have a chair at the table. There must be a levelling, otherwise we are going to carry on having these debates."" Redmayne can next be seen playing the Emcee in ""Cabaret,"" opposite ""Chernobyl"" actress Jessie Buckley as Sally Bowles. Liza Minelli famously played Bowles and Joel Grey was cast as the sexually ambiguous Emcee in the 1972 film adaptation Redmayne asked those who might criticize his decision to take on a role often played by LGBT actors to suspend judgment. ""Of all the characters I've ever read, this one defies pigeonholing. I would ask people to come and see it before casting judgment,"" he said. ""Cabaret"" opens opens at London's Playhouse Theatre on December 12.",2
133," (CNN)An Australian TV journalist has apologized for failing to listen to Adele's new album ahead of an interview with her. Matt Doran, who co-hosts ""Weekend Sunrise"" on the country's Channel 7, traveled to London with a camera crew for an exclusive interview with the British singer songwriter. The interview took place earlier this month but it will now not be aired, as Adele's record label, Sony Music, reportedly refused to allow the footage to be shown after Doran told the singer he hadn't heard her new album. Sony Music did not respond to CNN's request for comment.Two weeks ago, Doran posted a picture of himself and colleagues armed with filming equipment on Instagram, against a backdrop of the River Thames and the Tower of London. He wrote: ""Back at it with the boys! This one is going to be pretty special ... 🤫@7newsspotlight #london""However, the interview did not go to plan when it emerged that Doran had not listened to the singer's new album, ""30"" -- her first in six years --  ahead of their meeting. In a statement sent to CNN, Doran said he had missed an email sent from Sony with an advance copy of the album, which was released on Friday. He said: ""When I sat down to interview Adele, I was honestly unaware that I'd been emailed a preview of her unreleased album. I later discovered it was sent to me as an 'e card' link after we landed in London on the day prior to the interview. In my lengthy phone discussions with Sony reps in advance I was never told a preview copy was being made available.""It was a major oversight on my end but NOT a deliberate snub. This is the most important email I have ever missed and I am mortified and unequivocally apologetic.""Doran dismissed media reports that Adele ""walked out"" of the interview and said they still spoke at length, though he acknowledged that the interview would not be aired. He said: ""I'm in awe of Adele's music and the majesty of her voice, and it's gnawing at me savagely that I've offended her. Of course I'd have listened to the album if I'd known a copy was being released. To deliberately not bother would be unforgivable arrogance.""But to suggest that the interview was disrespectful -- or that Adele walked out -- is incorrect. In fact, it ran well overtime and we had a great rapport. Adele was hilarious, engaging, generous, honest and profound and I'm devastated that her fans are being denied this interview.""For the record,"" he added, ""I never said: 'I haven't listened to your album'. I said, 'I've only had the privilege of hearing Go Easy On Me, and already it sounds like you've produced something extraordinary'.""  ",2

""The people who loved her are in pain and we are mourning they are not talking to the press, they are not spreading rumors and they sure as hell are not making this about themselves.

135," (CNN)Adele is known for moving fans to tears with her music, but the Grammy award-winning singer shed some of her own after a surprise reunion with a former high school teacher.  The emotional moment happened during the British powerhouse's ITV concert special, ""An Audience with Adele,"" which aired in the UK on Sunday night. During the pre-recorded concert, the pop superstar took a question from Hollywood actress Emma Thompson, who asked whether there was anyone in her past who had supported her, inspired her or protected her from life's trials and tribulations.  In response, Adele opened up about the impact Ms. McDonald, her English teacher at Chestnut Grove Academy, had had on her. The London-born singer shared: ""I had a teacher at (south London high school) Chestnut Grove, who taught me English. That was Miss McDonald... She got me really into English literature. Like, I've always been obsessed with English and obviously now I write lyrics."" ""She was so bloody cool. So engaging,"" Adele added, recalling that McDonald often wore sequins and gold bracelets. ""She really made us care, and we knew that she cared about us."" Thompson then revealed that McDonald, whom Adele hadn't seen in 20 years, was in the audience. It was time for the singer, who is used to surprising fans at her concerts, to be left stunned. In the clip shared on ITV's Twitter account from the highly anticipated televised UK concert special, Adele embraced her former mentor after she was brought on stage. ""I'm so proud of you,"" McDonald said as Adele cried tears of joy. During their exchange, the ""Easy On Me"" hitmaker told McDonald: ""You really did change my life.""  ""Now, I've got to get my whole face re-done,"" the 33-year-old star joked while wiping away tears. She then called on host Alan Carr to step in and entertain the audience with a song while she stepped away to regain her composure After the special aired, Adele took to Twitter to share her excitement at the reunion.  ""Home Sweet Home. I've always dreamt of doing An Audience With..."" she wrote alongside a series of pictures from the TV special, adding: ""There was so much love in the room for each other, it felt like such a gig! Everyone was raucous and bang up for it! And my teacher Ms McDonald was there, it was just heaven."" ""An Audience With Adele"" was filmed at the London Palladium earlier this month in front of a star-studded audience which included the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Jodie Comer and Idris Elba. The broadcast comes a week behind a similar US TV special, ""Adele One Night Only,"" which included an emotional interview with Oprah Winfrey.She is currently promoting her new album, ""30,"" which is her fourth studio album and the first to be released since 2015.

139," (CNN)Whether you're a tiger king or the queen of breakup ballads -- hey, Adele -- please enjoy this week's TV OT: 'Keeping Up With the Oppenheim Group'I sometimes feel like a detective of things that don't matter. Want to solve a murder? Call someone with real skills. Have a petty point you want to make using evidence you find on the internet? Come sit by me. For example, at some point during the summer, I noticed several cast members from ""Selling Sunset"" posted a series of photos from a yacht party but one cast member -- token villain Christine Quinn -- was not in any of the pictures. I immediately texted a fellow ""Selling Sunset"" watcher to ponder the absence, ""Was she a no-show or not invited?"" I asked. We then launched into some detective work that helped us form theories which, having already binged the upcoming fourth season, which has been provided to press ahead of the new seasons's Nov. 24 premiere, I now know turned out to be true. That's when it dawned on me: With ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" off the air, the only family worthy of keeping up with these days is The Oppenheim Group. Attempts to find conventional families worthy of the Kardashian Reality crown have been thus far uninspiring. (Sorry, D'Amelios.) But four seasons into its run, ""Selling Sunset"" has proved itself worthy of filling the void for a new First Family of Fly-on-the-Wall reality. The show, about a herd of gazelle-like female realtors and their two males bosses, not only fills the void of the Kardashians but is a sort of reality TV transformer —at times it's ""The Hills"" and others it's ""Million Dollar Listing."" The storylines go beyond tiny quibbles that are solved in an episode and end with ""In the end, we're family,"" the formula that made ""KUWTK"" a snooze at times. Instead, we're invited into storylines that combine high-stakes real estate, plenty of petty trash talk and build up to big, soapy confrontations. The upcoming season is in some ways the best and worst season so far. The main storyline — which finds the office splintered by the addition of some new faces — is strong, but it also feels like producers struggled to fill the rest of the season with minimal material. (How many times did editors have to include comments about Christine's post-baby body?)Even with its weaknesses in the upcoming season, If ""Selling Sunset"" aired daily for an hour, I'd watch every day. And I wouldn't be alone. I guess you could say that whatever ""Selling Sunset"" has been selling, I'm sold. A not-so-bitter 'Pill' to swallowElsewhere, Brian Lowry watched the new HBO documentary about Alanis Morissette, and still can't quite figure out why she slammed it.""'Jagged' is a perfectly fine HBO documentary about Alanis Morissette's meteoric musical career, made puzzling by the controversy unleashed by her negative reaction to the film when it screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's a reminder that people tend to take the way they're depicted seriously, and -- isn't it ironic? -- often see the bad more than the good.Specifically, Morissette objected to a portion of the documentary and its 'salacious agenda' that discussed the way men hit on her when she was just 15 years old, and regrets that she harbors about that period in her life.'You're not consenting at 15,"" she says during the interviews, adding of the questions regarding why women don't report sexual assaults right away, 'Women don't wait. A culture doesn't listen.'All told, those exchanges amount to about two minutes out of an otherwise wildly positive 97-minute documentary directed by Alison Klayman, which speculates about who inspired the song 'You Oughta Know,' the way Morissette was pressured about her weight and accused of being angry, and how her music opened doors for the female artists that followed her.To a third-party observer with no dog in the fight, Morissette's irritation seems misplaced, especially because she admits to having undergone 'copious amounts of therapy' to address her past, and how living under such public scrutiny is 'not a normal social construct.'Anyway, 'Jagged' kicks off a run of HBO music documentaries, to be followed by films about Earl 'DMX' Simmons, Kenny G, producer Robert Stigwood, and Juice WRLD under the ""Music Box"" banner. And at least the first one well worth watching, even if its subject doesn't think that you should.""""Jagged"" premieres Nov. 18 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.'The Line' examines the media's role in the Eddie Gallagher caseIn other docu-content (and there's a lot of it this week), Lowry looks at the Apple four-part podcast-turned-series ""The Line.""""Dissecting the trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was charged with war crimes after accusations from his own men, 'The Line' provides a sobering look at the horrors of war as well as what's expected of those who fight in them.Produced by among others Alex Gibney, the four-part Apple TV+ docuseries (and related podcast) includes interviews with Gallagher and his accusers, who present strikingly different accounts of what transpired in Mosul, Iraq, both in their interviews with the filmmakers and videotaped questioning from NCIS investigators.Perhaps most notably, once Gallagher was charged his wife Andrea and brother Sean took the battle to conservative media, freely acknowledging that they used those conduits -- particularly Fox News -- to catch the eye of then-President Trump, who weighed in on Gallagher's behalf.'They played the Fox fiddle beautifully,' says former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer.The SEALs who spoke up knew they were taking a chance that could endanger their careers but cite being alarmed enough by Gallagher's actions to take that unusual step. Yet as key facets of the prosecution's case crumbled, one team member interviewed anonymously says that at a certain point, ""Everybody just gave up on justice.""'The Line' captures the gung-ho mentality of these elite units, with member Dylan Dille likening serving in Mosul to 'going to the Super Bowl.'Whether that sports metaphor holds, 'The Line' makes a compelling argument that military standards didn't represent the only line that might have been crossed in the course of the Gallagher case.""""The Line"" premieres Nov. 19 on Apple TV+.Free ideasCongratulations, Adele.

140," (CNN)Princess Charlene of Monaco spent half a year away from the European principality to recover from a severe ear, nose and throat infection in her native South Africa. Just 11 days after returning home, Prince Albert II announced in an exclusive interview with People on Friday that the princess has entered a treatment facility ""outside of Monaco"" for exhaustion. Her return home ""went pretty well in the first few hours, and then it became pretty evident that she was unwell,"" Albert told the publication.Though speculation swirled that her move resulted from a rift in her relationship with her husband , the son of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III, the palace, Albert and Charlene have affirmed that her health struggles grounded her on another continent. Mid-May: During a trip to her native South Africa to advocate against poaching and killing rhinos for their horns, Charlene experienced an ear, nose and throat infection severe enough that it ""does not allow her to travel,"" the palace told South African outlet News24. June 24: Charlene's foundation confirmed to News24 was ""undergoing multiple, complicated procedures"" after contracting the infection. Her medical team advised her to stay in South Africa as she continued to recover and waited to receive further procedures, the foundation said. July 6: Charlene, unable to return to Monaco to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary, told News24 in a statement that her illness and grounding in South Africa has ""been a trying time."" ""I miss my husband and children dearly,"" she said. ""What has been extremely difficult for me was when I was instructed by my medical team that I could not return home for my 10th wedding anniversary. Albert is my rock and strength and without his love and support I would not have been able to get through this painful time.""September 2: Albert, speaking exclusively to People, said that his wife was ""ready to come home"" after undergoing months of medical procedures. September 4: Charlene left a South African hospital after she was treated for an ear, nose and throat condition, Monaco's palace told Reuters at the time. She was admitted to the hospital after fainting earlier in the week, though the palace said her collapse wasn't a major concern. September 8: In another interview with People, Albert denounced rumors that Charlene remained in South Africa due to issues in their relationship. ""She didn't leave Monaco in a huff!"" he told the outlet. ""She didn't leave because she was mad at me or at anybody else ... It was only supposed to be a weeklong, 10-day maximum stay, and [she is still there now] because she had this infection all these medical complications arose.""October 26: Albert told People that Charlene will return to Monaco within weeks after she completed her recovery from an early October surgery. November 9: Charlene returned to Monaco after half a year away, eagerly greeted by her children and husband. On Instagram, she shared a photo of herself in a black face mask with her children and husband, captioned, ""Happy day today Thank you all for keeping me strong !!"" with a heart emoji. November 16: The palace announced that Charlene, within a week of returning to Monaco, would avoid public duties as she continued her recovery. ""A period of calm and rest is necessary to ensure the very best recovery for Princess Charlene's health,"" the palace said in a statement, according to Reuters. November 19: Charlene was absent from celebrations for the National Day of Monaco.Prince Albert told People his wife is suffering from profound ""exhaustion, both emotional and physical.""

Three things to watch'Adele One Night Only'The sumptuous location, Adele in that couture gown and, oh, the music.Adele's CBS special owes us nothing, as she slayed with the tunes, the banter and the interview in Oprah Winfrey's gorgeous garden.And did we mention the absolutely precious marriage proposal that happened during the show at LA's Griffith Observatory?You can watch (or rewatch) it all happen on Paramount+, where it's currently streaming. 'Skyfall'No, Adele didn't act in this one, but she sang the theme song for the 23rd installment of the James Bond franchise.So come for the car chases, high-tech gadgets and Daniel Craig's suave demeanor, but stay for the music that earned Adele an Academy Award for best original song in 2013.Adele's Album of the Year win at the 59th GrammysIt's not a streaming movie or TV show, but I had to include one of the greatest Grammy speech moments ever.Adele took to the Grammys stage in 2017 to accept the award for album of the year for ""25,"" talked about her life, praised her son and husband at the time, then tearfully said she couldn't possibly accept because the album of her life was Beyoncé's ""Lemonade,"" which had also been nominated.""It was so monumental, Beyoncé,"" Adele said to her fellow nominee, who was seated in the front row.The camera went to a pregnant, tearful Bey in the audience, mouthing her love for Adele. They were crying and we were, too, at how wonderful it was to see two queens supporting each other.It's on the Recording Academy's Grammys YouTube channel.Two things to listen toThis one is so easy because her new album, ""30,"" has dropped.Adele's fourth studio album felt a long time coming since her last one was released in 2015.Her debut single from the new collection, ""Easy on Me,"" blew up on the charts and streaming services — and the album has been expected to be a massive seller from the moment it had been announced.I feel like any album with a single titled ""I Drink Wine"" can't help but win.It's out now.For a bit of nostalgia, go back and listen to her ""21"" album from 2011. With hits like ""Rolling in the Deep"" and ""Set Fire to the Rain,"" Adele defied the sophomore jinx, which often finds successful artists unable to do well with their second album.Not only did she gain critical acclaim, she could barely hold all the Grammys she won the following year. One thing to talk aboutAdele seems different these days, and we are not talking about her weight loss.Instead, she seems more confident and willing to let fans in on her life and thoughts.Opening up in an interview with Vogue and her sit-down with Oprah Winfrey, she seems relaxed and happier in her skin.She talked to Winfrey about how being in this new place in her life helped her find love with superstar sports agent Rich Paul.""It's just timing,"" she said. ""But it'd be interesting to see what my reaction is like in general to anything that hurts me now that I feel so secure in myself, and I'm talking outside of romance as well.""Speaking of Adele and Paul, they are one of the Hollywood couples discussed in the latest episode of my weekly show, Pop Life Pop Off! Check it out here:Something to sip on For years, Adele would disappear from the scene and only come back when she had new music to drop.It was a risky strategy in a time when fans have come to expect celebrity visibility on social media and everywhere else.But the thing is, I don't think Adele gave a flying, ahem, thought about strategy.She appeared to simply just be living her life, which enabled her to write the songs that we have come to love.Now she has done her first Instagram Live (where she couldn't have been more charming) and allowed her followers to share in the excitement of the new album.And even if she chooses to drop off the scene again — remember this is a woman who said her last tour might be her final tour — she owes us absolutely nothing because artistically she has already given us so much.",2

Smith aces the performance, which is the main attribute in elevating the story above the standard sports-movie conventions.The film actually follows a fairly concentrated stretch in the formative years of Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams (Demi Singleton) under the watchful eye and tutelage of their father Richard, who speaks frequently of the 78-page plan he mapped out for conquering the nearly all-White tennis world before they were old enough to hold a racquet.""I'm in the champion-raising business,"" Williams announces as he makes the rounds looking for a coach, met with dismissive and vaguely racist replies, including ""You ever think about basketball?""Williams can be imperious (hence the title) and overbearing, much to the occasional chagrin of his daughters and wife (Aunjanue Ellis), who is no wallflower when it comes to the coaching chores or speaking her mind.The portrait that emerges from director Reinaldo Marcus Green and writer Zach Baylin consistently paints him as a heroic figure, protecting his daughters from dangers in the community, stressing their education as well as their ground strokes and working tirelessly to advance their careers, perusing tennis magazines while holding down a job as a night watchman.Any excesses, such as having the girls practice in a pouring rain, are filtered through that prism. And obviously, Williams' determination to ""stick to the plan"" paid off handsomely, despite the irritation and exasperation of tennis coaches (the most prominent played by Tony Goldwyn and Jon Bernthal) riled by his refusal to follow the customary script, including his decision to pull Venus out of juniors tournaments.Smith not only captures the cadence of Williams' voice but the unwavering confidence that he embodied, absolutely convinced that he knew what was best for his girls. It's down the movie's final stretch, as those plans begin to bear fruit, that ""King Richard"" feels more and more conventional, from the stirring music to the questions of how and when to cash in on Venus' prowess while the younger Serena is left behind, but as we all know, not for long.Smith (who also produced the film) is receiving a vigorous push for awards consideration, and he certainly nails the role in a way that belongs in that conversation, even if the movie as a whole seems unlikely to join him.Perhaps foremost, ""King Richard"" is framed as a response to the criticism and second-guessing that the outspoken Williams faced as his daughters took the tennis world by storm, which might explain why both signed on as executive producers.Indeed, it's hard to escape the sense that ""King Richard"" exists in part to let the Williams family set the record straight. And when it comes to giving Williams his due as both a tennis guru and a father, in this case, love means everything.""King Richard"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters and on HBO Max, from Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia.

144," (CNN)Adele is not going easy on her fans, with the singer starring in a highly anticipated televised UK concert special on Sunday following the release of her new album, ""30.""The special, titled ""An Audience With Adele,"" was filmed at the London Palladium and will air exclusively on ITV and its on-demand service, ITV Hub, on November 21 at 7:25 p.m. GMT.Adele posted a clip of the concert on Instagram, showing her singing her cherished classic ""Rolling in the Deep"" while donning a stunning black off-the-shoulder dress, with a star-studded crowd dancing and singing along.Adele's new album, ""30,"" dropped Friday and has been expected to be a massive seller from the moment it was announced. It's the singer's first album release since 2015. The full tracklist of her fourth studio album featured 12 songs, including her debut single, ""Easy on Me,"" which blew up on the charts and streaming services when it was released last month.""As one of the world's most in-demand stars, we are beyond thrilled to bring this one-off night to ITV,"" Katie Rawcliffe, the head of entertainment commissioning at ITV, said in a statement. ""Adele is a remarkable artist and this will be a very special event.""  Adele's audience at the special event consisted of ""friends, family, fans, her own personal heroes and heroines, fellow musicians, artists, actors, sportsmen, sportswomen and more,"" ITV said in a news release.The singer returned to the top spot of the UK charts and broke the national record for most streams in a week with ""Easy on Me,"" a heartbreak ballad exploring Adele's divorce from entrepreneur Simon Konecki. The single was streamed 24 million times in seven days, smashing the record of 16.9 million streams set by Ariana Grande's ""7 Rings"" in 2019.Adele filed for divorce from charity CEO Konecki in 2019. She and Konecki, who lives across the street from her in Los Angeles, share 9-year-old son Angelo.The iconic artist told Rolling Stone magazine in an exclusive interview that she was ""embarrassed"" by the divorce but wrote the album as a way to explain to her son who she was and how the divorce changed her life.""It's sensitive for me, this record, just in how much I love it ..."" Adele told American Vogue in an interview with Abby Aguirre. ""I'm not letting go of this one. This is my album. I want to share myself with everyone, but I don't think I'll ever let this one go.""On November 14, Adele performed in the CBS special, ""Adele One Night Only"" at Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The singer also became the first person to feature on the cover of both the British and American editions of Vogue magazine in its November issue, with interviews for both editions released online in early October.",2
145," (CNN)In a directorial father-son baton pass from Ivan Reitman to Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air""), ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is undeniably nostalgic and fairly sweet, while who-ya-gonna-calling directly back to the 1984 original. And yet with its focus on teenage heirs to that legacy, the movie simultaneously feels as much like the Disney Channel version of ""Ghostbusters"" as a long-delayed sequel.Happily, the kids are the very talented Mckenna Grace (""Gifted,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale"") and ""Stranger Things'"" Finn Wolfhard, the grandchildren of Egon Spengler (originally played by the late Harold Ramis). Egon has died, leaving a remote farmhouse to his estranged daughter (Carrie Coon), who for financial reasons finds the move timely.Moving into the place, Phoebe (Grace) and Trevor (Wolfhard) discover a lot of strange stuff happening around town -- starting with all those unexplained earthquakes -- and some nifty artifacts among grandpa's possesses. Phoebe possesses scientific acumen far beyond her years, while her brother mostly just crushes on one of his new classmates (Celeste O'Connor).Mom, meanwhile, strikes up a somewhat unexpected relationship with one of the kids' teachers (Paul Rudd, seemingly everywhere at once), adding to an adult component that produces some laughs but frankly rides in the passenger seat for much of the movie. (Coon is a gifted actress, but there's a bit of the ""E.T."" mom syndrome here, where she can't see all the weirdness happening her.)Cleverly, the film (written by Jason Reitman, Dan Aykroyd and Gil Kenan) does set up a dense mythology connecting this flurry of spectral shenanigans back to the 1980s, while playfully incorporating visual touches that recall the ""Ghostbusters"" of the past. There are also funny unrelated gags, such as Rudd's character getting through summer school by simply running wildly inappropriate horror movies.In some respects, ""Afterlife"" represents a rather conspicuous exercise in fan service, after the bizarre temper tantrum thrown by some in response to the female version of the concept that premiered five years ago. While that movie was flawed, the reaction seemed completely out of whack, elevating ""Ghostbusters"" to an overblown level of ""You ruined my childhood!"" exaltation.The elder Reitman serves as a producer on the movie, which -- with Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson promoting the movie -- isn't the only link to its Reagan-era roots. Still, this is one of those films that doesn't so much cross the streams as dip into a deep well of goodwill, hoping to bridge the gap between those who actually saw the original in a theater and kids and grandkids who will hopefully identify with the youthful protagonists.At its best ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" simply delivers a good time, combining the upgraded special effects with comedy and youthful angst, while taking a little too long to get to the good stuff.Broken down into those components, the younger Reitman has dutifully answered the call to carry on his family legacy, without quite conjuring the kind of sparks that would have made ""Afterlife"" completely rise to the occasion.""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" premieres Nov. 19 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.",2

""Gillian Anderson plays my mom, Jason Isaacs plays [Nicholas Hoult's character, Peter III's] dad. There's moms, dads, babies, motherhood, becoming a mother to a country.""The new season of Hulu's naughty - and mostly not historically accurate - depiction of Catherine the Great's life as empress of 18th century Russia debuts Friday.In it, Fanning and Hoult play battling spouses who are expecting a child and have a complicated relationship, to say the least.Hoult said he knew very little about Catherine prior to taking on the role.""I only knew the infamous horse rumor,"" he said, referring to a false urban legend that Catherine the Great died attempting to have sex with a horse.The series is as bawdy as that false story about the empress.""That's kind of a bizarre thing when you break it apart and realize that this woman achieved so many wonderful things, changed a country, moved science forward and education,"" Hoult added. ""She was so progressive.""Phoebe Fox, who plays lady in waiting Marial, said ""The Great"" is as much fun to perform in as it is to watch.""Most of the time it becomes about trying to mitigate how much fun you are having,"" she said. ""It becomes sort inappropriate or the time is ticking, we're trying to get the scene and people keep laughing. It's helped by the fact we really like each other.""Sacha Dhawan plays Count Orlo and said the chemistry of the cast is magical because they didn't do any testing together or even a table read of the first script.""Our director who did the pilot was like 'Ok, let's just get up on our feet and run it like a play,"" Dhawan said.

149," (CNN)Tom Holland understands that playing ""Spiderman"" comes with great responsibility.

""Having her [Zendaya] in my life was so instrumental to my sanity. She is so good at being the role model for young guys and girls.

""We sort of felt robbed of our privacy.""When asked if he wasn't ready to talk about Zendaya after photos of them together over the summer sparked speculation they were more than costars, he clarifies, ""I don't think it's about not being ready.

151," (CNN)Streaming services continue to roll out expensive series based on presold concepts, but those big swings can produce big misses, with two prime examples this weekend: ""Cowboy Bebop,"" Netflix's live-action spin on a popular anime show; and ""The Wheel of Time,"" Amazon's poor-man's version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (before its actual one) based on popular fantasy books.Both shows fall flat, for different reasons. ""Cowboy Bebop"" seeks to replicate the style and tone of the violent animated series, a space western that features a trio of bounty hunters (or ""cowboys""). They're played by John Cho (under a tousled mop of hair), Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda, hunting a bizarre array of targets, firing off playful banter and weapons in near-equal measure.While much of the action is episodic, the season is connected by a larger plot involving the villainous Vicious (Alex Hassell), from the Cho character's past, and the alluring woman (Elina Satine) that came between them -- a thread that feels so familiar as to become a bit of a snooze.Introduced in Japan in 1998 and in the US via Adult Swim three years later, the series demonstrates once again that it's not easy to approximate the tone of a cartoon in a live-action format, even one that's adult in its content. (Netflix is also streaming the original show to maximize the bangs -- and there are a lot of them -- for its bucks.)All told, the new series is big, loud and lavishly produced, with a music-infused sensibility that works in its favor, or at least should.Yet somehow, the producers have managed to make a show that appears to have provoked skepticism among the original's devotees -- who speak of it with the kind of reverence once reserved for ""Citizen Kane"" -- without effectively inviting newcomers into the party.Whatever the cause, the chemistry feels off. And while the action sequences are stylishly choreographed, ""Cowboy Bebop"" finally bangs out a pretty dull tune. At least ""Bebop"" doesn't aspire to being much more than fun, while ""The Wheel of Time"" -- adapted from Robert Jordan's books -- has a more epic scope that adds to the sense of dramatic inertia.Rosamund Pike provides a degree of star power -- or at least the most recognizable face -- as the mysterious Moiraine, who comes to a small village where she enlists five young men and women on a quest to thwart the return of ""the dark one,"" with one member of the quintet, still unknown, representing the prophesied savior of their world.The dark one's slavering minions, naturally, are in hot pursuit, but the characters simply don't possess enough pop to draw in those who don't come immersed in the mythology, and the special effects are uneven. What emerges thus feels like another fantasy-based soap opera, populated by fantastic creatures and stiff dialogue filled with ominous warnings like ""The dark one is coming for your friends.""Put the blame on ""Game of Thrones,"" which prompted every streamer to take a hard look at fantasy concepts with literary underpinnings to tap into that genre. As noted, Amazon's really big bet is an upcoming series based on ""The Lord of the Rings,"" which only feeds the sense that this represents a once-over-lightly version of it.While there have been successes, the streaming world has also absorbed expensive failures as it tests these waters, with ""Cursed"" and ""Jupiter's Legacy"" among Netflix's recent one-season wonders.On the plus side, it's nice to see streamers taking chances on material that requires such ambition. Nevertheless, there's not much to ""Cowboy Bebop"" that would merit saddling up for an encore, or anything about ""The Wheel of Time"" to provoke enthusiasm about the prospect of it marching on.""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""The Wheel of Time"" premiere Nov. 19 on Netflix and Amazon, respectively.",2
152," (CNN)The longtime girlfriend of slain Memphis rapper Young Dolph has broken her silence following his death. Mia Jaye, the mother of his daughter Aria and son Tre Tre, expressed her grief in a series of posts shared on her Instagram Stories, a day after he was gunned down in a cookie store in Memphis. Sharing a video showing the late hip hop star -- whose real name was Adolph Robert Thornton Jr. -- exercising with their daughter, Jaye lamented in the caption: ""Question is... How am I going to tell to my babies that daddy is never coming home? ""#prayforme"" In another post, she declared her love for her partner, writing: ""God give me strength...Adolph I love you with all my heart and soul."" In a follow-up message, Jaye, who is CEO of lifestyle brand MOM.E.O, thanked well-wishers for their messages of support following the news of the 36-year-old star's death. ""Thank you to everyone for all of your prayers, love, support, calls, messages... I may not see them all but when my eyes are not full of tears, I catch a few...,"" Jaye wrote. ""Nonetheless, all the genuine positive vibes, energy and prayers are welcome...because Lord knows I need them."" Since his death, many pictures and videos showing Young Dolph as a dedicated family man have been circulating online, including one video of him styling Aria's hair. The clip was originally posted by Jaye in August on her Instagram account, along with a caption that read: ""Why Do Black Men Deserve To Grow Old?"" ""Because it is their Birthright! When God created each individual, he assigned them a task to fulfill and when these men are taken from this world prematurely, that Task... Purpose... Assignment may be left undone,"" Jaye's post continued. ""The task might be to raise children. To pour all of their wisdom, power and strength into them so that, they can fulfill their purpose when they become a Man, and that child deserves to grow old too!"" On Thursday, Memphis police released surveillance photos of two suspects they believe killed Young Dolph. No arrests have been made.""This shooting is another example of the senseless gun violence we are experiencing locally and nationwide. Our hearts go out to the Thornton family and all who are affected by this horrific act of violence,"" Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn ""CJ"" Davis said Wednesday. ",2
153," (CNN)HBO has a storied history with female quartets, from ""Sex and the City"" to ""Girls."" Yet ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" carves out its own niche with a distinct voice and plenty of very funny material, capturing four young women from diverse backgrounds thrown together as roommates while coming of age as first-year college students.Co-created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, the HBO Max show actually has a lot to say, in part by uniting women whose differences in terms of race, class and geography are somewhat eclipsed by sharing the process of discovering themselves and carving out identities apart from their parents.""Mom, I'm not bringing my teddy bear to college with me,"" one complains during the moving-in stage at New England's Essex College, nicely capturing the middle ground between independence and childhood that this period uniquely represents. Cue the slow-motion shots of shirtless guys jogging, the skepticism about a boyfriend who wants to wait until marriage (""Boys are born ready, so something's up"") and issues about grappling with sexual identity.The producers have helped the process by assembling a very good cast, including Pauline Chalamet -- Timothee's sister -- as Kimberley, a wide-eyed arrival from Arizona who forever seems to be saying the wrong thing, and who lacks the connections and financial resources of her roommates. The remaining trio, Bela (Amrit Kaur), Leighton (Reneé Rapp), and (Whitney) Alyah Chanelle Scott, are equally good, with Kaur garnering the biggest laughs as a kid eager to cut loose out now that she's escaped her parents' supervision.While this is hardly new terrain, ""Sex Lives"" manages to be occasionally sweet in addition to funny, such as when a couple of them attend a ""naked party"" and get chided for looking down at others', um, nakedness.""So we're not supposed to look? What is this, a naked party under Taliban rule?"" Bela complains.Later, Whitney -- the daughter of a senator -- grudgingly attends a fraternity party along with the wealthy Leighton, telling the sea of blond girls that she meets, ""I look forward to seeing you all on 'Selling Sunset' one day.""Amid the jokes and uncomfortable situations (including a positively cringeworthy dinner during parents' weekend in a later episode), there's an almost palpable sense of the desperate desire to fit in, as well as how significant the college years are in defining people as they mature.In that sense, ""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" is a rather simplistic, marketing-friendly title for a show that's refreshingly about a lot more than that.As it happens, the series will conclude the same day that HBO's ""Sex and the City"" revival hits the streaming service, a nod to the genre's past. If ""Sex Lives"" is in some respects a spiritual heir, it makes a strong case that meeting the next generation has more creative promise than revisiting an earlier one.""The Sex Lives of College Girls"" premieres Nov. 18 on HBO Max. CNN and HBO Max are both part of WarnerMedia.",2

155," (CNN)Lin-Manuel Miranda is not throwing his shots, and in 2021, the creator of ""Hamilton"" has been getting a whole lot of them.After his earlier work ""In the Heights"" became a critically admired (if little seen) movie, Miranda has made his directing debut with ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!,"" a loving adaptation of ""Rent"" creator Jonathan Larson's coming-of-stage story, and written eight original songs for ""Encanto,"" a Disney animated film featuring a predominantly Latinx cast. That follows another animated movie, Netflix's ""Vivo,"" which he produced in addition to writing the music.Although he is working from a script by Steve Levenson (""Dear Evan Hansen""), Miranda has clearly approached ""Tick, Tick"" as a deeply personal ode to musical theater in general and in particular Larson, who tragically died on the eve of what would become ""Rent's"" record-breaking run at the age of 35.Deftly expanding the source material into a movie, the film is anchored by a sensational performance by Andrew Garfield as Larson, with the title referring to the sense that his bravado about becoming ""the future of musical theater"" is running dry, with timing running out, in his eyes, as he approaches his 30th birthday.Capturing the creative process on film also poses a tricky proposition, but Miranda mostly manages to do just that, while conveying the palpable anxiety that Larson feels about at what point he transitions from being a writer who waits tables to make ends meet to becoming ""a waiter with a hobby.""The echoes of ""Rent"" throughout are also everywhere, reflecting how Larson eventually went from trying to sell an esoteric concept set in the future to writing about subjects very close to home, including struggles to keep the lights on (literally) and the ravages of AIDS at the time.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" is filled with happy surprises, and Garfield receives able support from Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesus and Vanessa Hudgens, as well as Bradley Whitford as legendary composer Stephen Sondheim.If Larson took the right advice when he decided to ""write what you know,"" Miranda, as a director, has taken that advice to heart as well.As for ""Encanto,"" feeling like an outcast is one of the most durable themes in Disney animation, which has become more relevant as those movies have moved in a more progressive direction than ol' Walt's early days. ""Encanto"" reflects a more recent tradition, in a movie about what makes us special, seriously enlivened, again, by Miranda's musical gifts.Miranda did the same for ""Moana,"" and ""Encanto"" possesses many similar charms, with a sizable dollop of ""The Incredibles"" in its focus on a super-powered family. The main departure, and it's an interesting one, is the lack of a traditional villain, an absence that's felt but mostly overcome by the warmth and energy behind the execution, which effectively draws audiences into the story.Set in a magical town in Colombia, Disney's 60th animated feature begins with a nod to a particularly sober real-world phenomenon -- namely, the plight of refugees. But amid their loss comes the magic that has made the Madrigal family flourish, with each possessing a remarkable gift under the watchful eye of matriarch Alma (María Cecilia Botero).Everyone, that is, except Mirabel (""Brooklyn Nine-Nine's"" Stephanie Beatriz), who emerged empty-handed from the gifting ritual, still determined  to be as much a part of the family as her parents and sisters.""Gift or no gift, I am just as special as the rest of my family,"" Mirabel tells the local children, but she seems as doubtful of the truth of that as they are.Still, just as one of Mirabel's cousins comes of age and her sister is about to marry, strange things start happening, with signs that the family's magic is beginning to fade. Mirabel thus becomes the Cassandra warning of danger, something her grandma has no interest in hearing, merely reinforcing Miirabel's sense that it has fallen to her to save everyone.Directed Jared Bush and Byron Howard (""Zootopia"") and co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, ""Encanto"" compensates for the dearth of traditional conflict with a colorful world filled with powers and an abundance of music.""I will never be good enough for you,"" an exasperated Mirabel says at one point.Happily, ""Encanto"" is plenty good enough for families seeking a sprinkle of that Disney animated magic, just as is ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" brings theater into the home.""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" premieres Nov. 19 on Netflix. ""Encanto"" premieres in US theaters on Nov. 24. It's rated PG.",2
